The theory of Aboriginalism is critiqued and interrogated in this thesis in relation to Indigenous Australian women, performance, and race. This thesis addresses the complex and contradictory ways that Aboriginalist discourse fixes non-Indigenous expectations of Indigenous Australian performance, gender, and race by exploring how the performers themselves work within and against these Aboriginalist constructions through their music. One of the immediate effects of Aboriginalism is that it silences Indigenous Australians. In academic discourse and popular media, the voices of Indigenous women who perform contemporary music are rarely heard and often overlooked or ignored. This thesis aims to redress and understand this gender imbalance by focusing on Indigenous women and their contemporary music and illustrate how Indigenous Australian women performers are enacting new types of agency to negotiate their way through, around, and over one-dimensional Aboriginalist constructions of themselves to self-define more positive and diverse identities as Indigenous Australian women. This thesis is divided into four parts. Part One (Chapters One, Two, and Three) provides necessary background to the study. Chapter One introduces the topic and poses research questions in relation to Aboriginalism, Indigenous women, and contemporary performance. Chapter Two examines a number of themes which emerge in the existing literature relating to Indigenous Australian musicians performing contemporary music. Chapter Three locates Indigenous Australian women in this academic discourse and explores some possible reasons for the increasing number of contemporary music recordings by Indigenous Australian women since the 1990s. Part Two (Chapters Four, Five, and Six) positions this study theoretically and methodologically. Chapter Four outlines the theoretical framework that informs this project while Chapter Five discusses the methodological issues and challenges I faced throughout the research process. Chapter Six introduces the Indigenous women performers who took part in this study. This chapter uses the literary convention of a &#147;playlet&#148; by weaving together comments of Indigenous Australian women performers from one-on-one interviews I conducted, media excerpts about the performers, as well as my own questions and comments into a conversation which tells a story about the performers&#146; backgrounds, experiences, albums, and achievements. Part Three (Chapters Seven, Eight, and Nine) comprises the analysis chapters and examines Aboriginalism in relation to race, gender, and performance. Each of these chapters utilise theoretical discussions of Aboriginalism, excerpts from interviews with Indigenous women performers, song texts, and media representations to examine how Indigenous women perform within and against Aboriginalism. Chapter Seven focuses on how Indigenous women performers resist Aboriginalist constructs of race through performance while Chapter Eight turns the gaze to gender and Aboriginalism to explore how the performers challenge Aboriginalist representations of Indigenous women by attempting bring Indigenous women&#146;s experiences, history, and topics to the foreground through song. Chapter Nine examines the way in which Indigenous women performers steer their way through Aboriginalism in music performance by blurring musical boundaries and drawing on a diverse range of musical styles. Finally, Part Four (Chapter Ten) discusses the possibilities of moving beyond Aboriginalism and reflects on my own contribution to discourse concerning Indigenous women performers.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">410101 Music</field><field name="subject">420303 Culture, Gender, Sexuality</field><field name="subject">410104 Indigenous Performing Arts</field><field name="subject">750201 The performing arts (incl. music, theatre and dance)</field><field name="subject">751005 Communication across languages and cultures</field><field name="subject">750309 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander development and welfare</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158217</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Expression of hnRNPs A/B in cancer cells and their roles in carcinogenesis</field><field name="creator">He, Yaowu</field><field name="description">The identification of specific and reproducible biomarkers is critical for the early diagnosis of cancer, which has a profound effect the survival rate of patients. Comprehensive laboratory and clinical evidence needs to be collected to confirm the accuracy of the biomarkers prior to their clinical use. Heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) A2 and B1 have been suggested as biomarkers for cancer since 1988 when hnRNP A2/B1 overexpression was first linked with the occurrence of lung cancer. Later studies established a correlation between the expression levels of these hnRNPs and other cancers, such as breast, pancreatic, and lymphatic tumours. In this study, the expression of hnRNPs A1, A2, A3, and B1 has been investigated in various cancer cell lines. hnRNPs A1 and A3, in addition to A2 and B1, were found to be overexpressed in some cancer types. However, the overexpression of none of the hnRNP A/B proteins was universal, and their upregulation may be limited to a few cell types, suggesting they may be effective biomarkers for a subset of cancers. The upregulation of hnRNP A/B proteins in tumours and cancer cell lines led to the hypothesis that they are involved in the uncontrolled cell growth in cancer. According to our Western blot analysis, expression of the hnRNP proteins, A1, A2, and B1, is dependent on the cell cycle whereas no significant change was detected for hnRNP A3, implying that the former three are needed during certain cell cycle stages. The results, together with the transcription factor analysis of the promoter regions of the HNRPA1, HNRPA2, and HNRPA3 genes, suggest that hnRNPs A1, A2, and A3 may have distinct regulatory machineries and cellular functions although they have high amino acid sequence identity. However, their mRNA levels were unchanged across the cell cycle, suggesting the cell-cycle-dependent expression of hnRNPs A1, A2, and B1 is modulated at the translational level. Previous studies showed higher expression of hnRNPs A1 and A2 in rapidly proliferating cells than in quiescent cells, suggesting a role of these proteins in cell proliferation. Though interruption of hnRNP A1 expression did not result in significant change in the viability of murine CB3 cells, simultaneous suppression of hnRNPs A1 and A2 caused apoptosis in a few cell lines. Consistent with this, suppression of hnRNP A1 or A3 expression in our study in Colo16 squamous cells using RNA interference did not affect cell proliferation, but simultaneous suppression of both caused slow cell proliferation. By contrast, reduction of the hnRNP A2 level alone slowed the proliferation of Colo16 cells. These results suggest that although hnRNPs A1, A2, and A3 share some roles in cell proliferation, each of them may have distinct tasks. This conclusion is supported by the data from the comparative analysis of the downstream targets of hnRNPs A1, A2, and A3, which has shown that these three proteins share a limited number of common downstream proteins. The observed impact on cell proliferation of suppressing hnRNP A2 subfamily proteins is in accord with our finding that the downstream targets of hnRNP A2 are overrepresented by genes involved in proliferation regulation, as shown in microarray and real-time PCR analysis. These include cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors, p21 and p27, and their regulatory proteins, such as Skp2 and Rpn10. Skp2 controls the ubiquitination of p21 and p27, and Rpn10 links them to the 26S proteasome, the complex that degrades these two CDK inhibitors. hnRNP A2 also regulates the transcription of securin and separin, which are essential for sister chromatid separation during late anaphase. In addition, hnRNP A2 can also influence cell proliferation through cell growth factors, including fibroblast, vascular endothelial, transforming, and insulin growth factors. Our gene array and real-time PCR analysis have shown that hnRNP A2 regulates the expression of these factors, their receptors, or associated proteins such as IGFBP7 and TGFBR2. The data presented in this thesis link the overexpression of hnRNP A/B proteins, in particular the A2/B1 subfamily, in cancer with their regulatory roles in cell division and cell proliferation. Our findings provide mechanistic evidence that these proteins may be a driving force for the uncontrolled cell growth in cancer, suggesting that some of hnRNP A/B proteins may be potential therapeutic targets for cancer. However, further studies are needed to obtain a global view of the roles of these proteins in cancer.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270201 Gene Expression</field><field name="subject">780105 Biological sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158357</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Acquisition of word order in Chinese as a foreign language: An error taxonomy</field><field name="creator">Jiang, Wenying Wendy</field><field name="description">Research in the field of Chinese second/foreign language (L2) acquisition, at present, does not match the increasing demand to learn Chinese as an L2, given that Chinese is the fastest growing foreign language (FL) in countries such as Japan, South Korea, the United States, Canada and Australia. There is a significant gap between Chinese L2 acquisition research and the large body of literature in second language acquisition (SLA), which mainly focuses on English L2. The need for more research in Chinese SLA is compelling. Particularly, research in Chinese L2 word order acquisition requires more attention because word order plays a more complex role in Chinese than in English. Chinese relies heavily on word order for information structuring of a sentence because this language lacks other means, such as verb endings indicating tense and aspect, to accomplish this function. Due to the different roles word order plays in Chinese and English, adult English-speaking learners find Chinese word order acquisition very challenging. Chinese L2 word order errors frequently occur in learners&#146; L2 production. However, Chinese L2 researchers and teachers are left with no means to adequately describe and explain these errors for instruction purposes. This dissertation develops such a means &#151; a comprehensive taxonomy of Chinese L2 word order errors. This taxonomy organizes these errors into a logical system of classification. Through the classification, explicit description of various Chinese L2 word order errors is achieved, and specific sources of these errors are traced. Data was collected from 116 native-English-speaking learners of Chinese at a large university in Australia. The Chinese L2 learners were divided into three proficiency levels based on their institutional status. Four hundred and eight word order errors were extracted by qualitatively analyzing the learners&#146; written samples. Among the 408 word order errors, 404 (99%) are successfully classified into different categories according to a new criterion proposed in this dissertation. The new taxonomy provides a principle-based description and explanation of various Chinese L2 word order errors. A word order error is deemed to constitute an error when it violates a relevant word order principle (or sub-principle). These principles not only explain why an error is an error but also provide a means for correcting the error. In a pedagogical sense, the directness and explicitness in explaining word order errors achieved by employing this taxonomy cannot be achieved by relying on any other sources of errors available in the literature. The new taxonomy overcomes the limitations of existing taxonomies in the literature that are either superficial, or unsystematic, or not empirically testable. For example, it draws on the Cognitive Functionalist Approach of L2 acquisition. Both its description and explanation of Chinese L2 word errors go beyond superficiality. The approach maintains that adult L2 learners&#146; conceptualization of the world is initially based on their L1. Their conceptualization of the world imposes constraints on the linguistic structures of their L2. Therefore, errors may occur when English learners of Chinese impose their conceptualization based on the English language onto the Chinese structures. The new taxonomy is systematic because it categorizes word order errors using one criterion. New categories emerging from the data and the existing categories from the literature are incorporated into one system. Finally, the new taxonomy is empirically testable because many new categories emerged from the data. It is an open-ended rather than a closed system. New categories can be added as necessary. The dissertation finds that violation of relevant word order principles has a high explanatory value for the various word order errors encountered in the data. This has clear pedagogical implications. Chinese L2 learners generally lack awareness of the word order principles (and sub-principles) on which the new taxonomy is based. These principles and sub-principles are seen to be of considerable importance to the acquisition of Chinese L2 word order. In order to improve learners&#146; word order performance, the results of this study indicate that it is imperative for the basic Chinese word order principles be included in a CFL curriculum.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">380201 Applied Linguistics and Educational Linguistics</field><field name="subject">751000 Communication</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158129</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Viable Software: the Intelligent Control Paradigm for Adaptable and Adaptive Architecture</field><field name="creator">Herring, Charles Edward</field><field name="description">The Intelligent Control Paradigm for software architecture is the result of this work. The Viable Software Approach is developed as an instance of the paradigm. The approach uses the Viable System Model as the basis for software system architecture. The result is a model-based architecture and approach for developing software systems by piecemeal adaptation with the goal that they become adaptive systems at runtime. Software built in this manner is called Viable Software. Viable Software represents a unifying class of self-controlling software that is an &#147;intelligent&#148; control system. Cybernetics, Control Theory, and Complexity Theory are the background for this work, and aspects relevant to this work are presented. These results are related to software architecture and software engineering. Rationale for the selection of the Viable System Model as a basis for software systems is given. The Viable System Model is described. The model is restated as an Alexanderian &#147;pattern language&#148; to make it more accessible to software engineering. A Viable Software Approach is proposed and expressed in the form of a Product Line Architecture that arranges the Viable System Model, the Viable Software Architecture, a Viable Component Framework, and a Component Transfer Protocol into a system for generative programming. An important result is the formalisation of the pattern of the Viable System into the interface specifications of the Viable Component. Three case studies illustrate the approach. The first is an analysis and extension of the Groove collaboration system. This study shows how the approach is used to map an existing system into the Viable Software Architecture and add fuzzy-adaptive user interface controllers. The second study presents the design and detailed software construction of an adaptive camera controller as part of a smart environment. The final study shows how a Business-to-Business e-Commerce system can be evolved and an expert system-based controller developed to implement business contracts.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">L</field><field name="subject">280302 Software Engineering</field><field name="subject">700199 Computer software and services not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">Software Architecture</field><field name="subject">Viable System Model</field><field name="subject">Intelligent Control</field><field name="subject">Adaptive Control</field><field name="subject">Adaptable Software</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157886</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Phylogeny, morphology and physiology of the secondary vascular system in fishes</field><field name="creator">Skov, Peter Vilhelm</field><field name="description">Vascular casts of three chondrichthian, one dipnoan, one chondrostean and 14 teleostean species were examined by light and scanning electron microscopy in order to give a qualitative and quantitative analysis of interarterial anastomoses (iaas) that indicate the presence (or absence) of a secondary vascular system (SVS). Anastomoses were found to originate from a variety of different primary blood vessels, many of which have not been previously identified as giving rise to secondary vessels. Segmental arteries derived from the dorsal aorta and supplying body musculature were major sites of origin of the SVS, although there was considerable variation in where, in the hierarchy of arterial branching, the anastomoses occurred. The degree of investment in a SVS was species specific, with more active species having a higher degree of secondary vascularisation. This difference was quantified using an absolute count of iaas between Anguilla reinhardtii and Trachinotus baillonii. A range of general features of the SVS is also described. No evidence of iaas was found on the coeliac, mesenteric or renal circulation in any species. Evidence of interarterial anastomoses were lacking in the dipnoan (Sarcopterygii) and chondrichthyan species examined, suggesting that a SVS is restricted to actinopterygian fishes. The presence and distribution of a secondary vascular system does not appear to be exclusively linked to phylogenetic position, but rather to the physiological adaptation of the species. Histological sections of primary segmental arteries and associated interarterial anastomoses and secondary vessels from the long-finned eel, Anguilla reinhardtii, were examined by light and transmission electron microscopy. Secondary vessels were found to originate from the primary vasculature as depressions through the tunica intima and media, from where they ran perpendicularly to the adventitial layer, before coiling extensively. From here the anastomoses travelled a relatively linear path in the outer margin of the adventitia to re-anastomose with a secondary vessel running in parallel with the primary counterpart. Secondary vessels had a structure quite similar to that of primary vessels; they were lined by endothelial cells on a continuous basement membrane, surrounded by single layer of smooth muscle cells surrounding the vessel. Smooth muscle cells were also found in the vicinity of interarterial anastomoses in the adventitia, but these were more longitudinally orientated. The presence of smooth muscle cells on all aspects of the secondary circulation suggests that this vascular system is regulated in a similar manner as the primary vascular system. Because interarterial anastomoses are structurally integrated with the primary vessel from which they originate, it was anticipated that flow through secondary vessels would to some extent be affected by an increase in primary vascular tone. Immunohistochemical studies showed that primary segmental arteries displayed moderate immunoreactivity to antibodies against 5-hydroxytryptamine and substance P, while interarterial anastomoses and secondary vessels showed dense immunoreactivity. Secondary vessels were followed to the surface of the animal through consecutive sections, where they eventually give rise to capillary beds overlying the scales. Secondary capillary beds were found to supply chloride cells in the skin, suggesting that this vascular system may be involved in cutaneous ionic exchange. Branchial vascular casts from two species of Tetraodontiformes showed that the vessels previously reported as nutrient vessels are with certainty part of the secondary vascular system. In the three-barred porcupine fish, Dicotylichthys punctulatus, interarterial anastomoses originated at high densities from efferent filamental and the efferent branchial arteries, from where they formed progressively larger secondary vessels. Small branches of this vascular system entered the filament body, where it gave rise to numerous side-vessels along the way. Large secondary vessels running in parallel with the efferent branchial arteries were found to constitute an additional arterio-arterial pathway, in that they exited the branchial basket in company with the afferent mandibular artery, the carotid artery and the efferent branchial arteries, from where they gave rise to vascular beds immediately after exit. The secondary vessels in this species were not found to supply the filament musculature; rather this vascular system was supplied by a single vessel derived from the efferent branchial artery, running in parallel with the afferent branchial artery. Secondary vessels were not found on any branchial component in the banded toadfish, Marylina pleurosticta, but in all other aspects the branchial vascular anatomy was similar to that of D. punctulatus. It is proposed that four independent vascular pathways may be present in the teleostean gill. The blood volume and flow rates of the primary (PVS) and secondary vascular system (SVS) were examined in the catadromous euryhaline teleost Lates calcarifer in order to determine whether any of these parameters were subject to change in individuals acclimated to seawater, compared to a group acclimated to freshwater. There was no significant difference in any measured parameter for the two groups. The volumes of the SVS were 0.67 &#132;b 0.13 and 0.76 &#132;b 0.13 mL 100g-1 body mass for FW and SW acclimated animals respectively. This constituted approximately one-third of the total blood volume in both groups. Turnover times for the SVS ranged from 21.0 to 25.2 minutes, demonstrating in accordance with previous publications, that this system is considerably more dynamic than previously assumed.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270604 Comparative Physiology</field><field name="subject">780105 Biological sciences</field><field name="subject">secondary vessels</field><field name="subject">anatomy</field><field name="subject">control</field><field name="subject">physiology</field><field name="subject">immunohistochemistry</field><field name="subject">histology</field><field name="subject">blood vessels</field><field name="subject">primary</field><field name="subject">secondary</field><field name="subject">volume</field><field name="subject">flow</field><field name="subject">chondrichthyes</field><field name="subject">dipnoi</field><field name="subject">actinopterygii</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158001</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Water Movement in Unsaturated Concrete: Theory, Experiments, Models</field><field name="creator">Leech, Craig Anthony</field><field name="description">Prediction of contaminant transport in concrete subjected to short cyclical wetting and drying processes is integrally bound to prediction of the moisture flux. The concrete is unsaturated and the non-linear contaminant and moisture fluxes are not described by simple constant diffusion methods. This thesis presents, and partially justifies, a thermodynamic model for prediction of moisture movement in concrete, at all moisture contents commonly encountered. The wetting process is examined with Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) images during a simple absorption (sorptivity) experiment. Diffusivity functions are derived via a novel analytical approach and a universal diffusivity is suggested. Water sorption and desorption isotherms are measured on large concrete samples. van Genuchten&#146;s retention function is successfully used to model the results. The unrelia-bility of the water sorption method at high moisture contents is illustrated by comparison with Mercury Intrusion Porosimetry (MIP). The BJH method is exploited to provide a methodology for estimating the water sorption isotherm from MIP. Mualem&#146;s conductivity model is assessed with the water retention and NMR results. This thorough validation of the model yields a tortuosity parameter that is different to that commonly assumed. An analytical relationship between the sorptivity and the saturated permeability suggests the experimental the long-term unsaturated permeability overesti-mates the unsaturated conductivity function, and as such should be used judiciously when predicting unsaturated flow processes. Mualem&#146;s conductivity model is further exploited to provide unsaturated air and vapour functions that are experimentally justified. The thermodynamic description of water movement and the hydraulic functions that are developed in the thesis are incorporated into T r inCet , a transient heat and mass trans-fer model based on the Finite Element Method (FEM). The complex coupled behaviour of air, liquid, vapour and temperature are well handled under a variety of common cyclical boundary conditions. The thesis presents all necessary experimental results required for validation of a com-plex, but easily described, model for moisture movement. It covers disparate ground to provide a powerful numerical model of unsaturated moisture movement in concrete under short-term cyclical processes.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">291100 Environmental Engineering</field><field name="subject">680299 Other</field><field name="subject">sorptivity</field><field name="subject">NMR</field><field name="subject">concrete</field><field name="subject">water retention</field><field name="subject">moisture</field><field name="subject">MIP</field><field name="subject">unsaturated</field><field name="subject">permeability</field><field name="subject">numerical</field><field name="subject">FEM</field><field name="subject">water</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157970</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Late Silurian to Middle Devonian acanthodians of eastern Australia</field><field name="creator">Burrow, Carole J</field><field name="description">The acanthodians were a common and widespread group of fishes throughout the world during the mid-Palaeozoic. In this study, a full-scale systematic analysis of Silurian to Middle Devonian acanthodian taxa of eastern Australia was undertaken, incorporating a review and updating of historical records and descriptions of taxa. Phylogenetic relationships within the group and with other early gnathostomes are uncertain. The structure, function and modes of growth of acanthodian scales were described and investigated, and these features were used for comparisons between different taxa within the group, and between acanthodians and other early vertebrates. Histological and morphological characters of the scales were incorporated in a cladistic analysis of genera erected for articulated fish. This analysis did not support the traditional ordinal level groups, the Climatiida, Ischnacanthida and Acanthodida. Therefore, the highest taxonomic level used in the study was the family. Rarely were acanthodians preserved as articulated fossils. The only examples known from the Silurian-Middle Devonian of Australia are one specimen of the putative acanthodian Yealepis douglasi Burrow &amp; Young 1999 from the Ludlow of Victoria, five specimens of an indeterminate ?ischnacanthidid from the late Givetian of New South Wales and a rich assemblage from the Givetian lacustrine shales of Mt Howitt, Victoria. The latter fauna (originally dated as Late Devonian) includes six incomplete specimens of the culmacanthidid Culmacanthus stewarti Long 1983 and about 60 specimens of acanthodidid Howittacanthus kentoni Long 1986. In contrast, disassociated remains of the group are ubiquitous in microvertebrate faunas from the mid-Palaeozoic of eastern Australia. Although scales of other fish groups are sometimes more common in particular facies, acanthodian elements are found in all depositional environments, from deep shelf marine to transitional to freshwater. Most of the taxa, particularly those only preserved as isolated scales, had not been systematically described by other workers. This thesis incorporates descriptions of new taxa, and revision and updating of other taxa. Several overseas studies have produced biostratigraphic charts based on acanthodian scales. A similar biostratigraphic overview was undertaken based on a systematic analysis of the Early Devonian acanthodians of eastern Australia, permitting comparisons with acanthodian faunas of other regions. Acanthodian scales and fin spines are the most common elements in the few vertebrate faunas that are known from the Silurian of Australia. Diversity and geographic distribution of the acanthodian faunas peaked during the Early Devonian. This study has been hampered by the low numbers of scales in many samples, and by uncertainty over their dating (particularly for the faunas from non-limestone deposits). Nevertheless, the work shows that changes in the marine assemblages are broadly correlated with the pattern of marine transgressions and regressions. Composition of the acanthodian faunas, and their abundance relative to other vertebrates in the assemblages, depend on the depositional environment. This correlation is best illustrated in Lower Devonian deposits, in which acanthodians are the most prolific and diverse. In transitional and marginal marine deposits, thelodonts are dominant, and acanthodians a minor element of the fauna. In off-shore assemblages, acanthodians and placoderms are dominant, and thelodonts are rare or absent. Vertebrate faunas are poor in the earliest Devonian deposits, but become more common by the late Lochkovian, with near-shore assemblages characterized by Trundlelepis cervicostulata and ANostolepis@ guangxiensis, and deeper shelf assemblages by a new genus, possibly assignable to the Ischnacanthidae. The vertebrate record is sparse through the middle Pragian, though AN.@ guangxiensis is present low in the Coopers Creek Limestone (upper sulcatus-pireneae zones), being replaced by Nostolepoides platymarginata, Gomphonchus? bogongensis, and Radioporacanthodes sp. aff. R. (Gomphonchus) liujingensis by the kindlei Zone. Microvertebrate assemblages are more common by the late Pragian (pireneae Zone), with Radioporacanthodes sp. aff. R. liujingensis in deeper shelf deposits, and N. platymarginata and G.? bogongensis dominating near-shore assemblages. The earliest Emsian (dehiscens Zone) is marked by the incoming Cheiracanthoides wangi. Middle Emsian (perbonus-serotinus zones) assemblages are characterized by two new species, possibly assignable to Gomphonchus.The Middle Devonian cosmopolitan association of Cheiracanthoides comptus and AAcanthoides@ dublinensis, which characterizes early Middle Devonian faunas from North America, Europe and China, appears first in the latest Emsian at the serotinus-patulus zone boundary. As well as showing the value of acanthodians in biostratigraphy and as indicators of environmental settings, their use in biogeography was demonstrated. Although many of the acanthodian taxa are endemic, several are also found in other regions. The Silurian to earliest Devonian faunas of eastern Australia are most closely related to coeval Chinese assemblages. Several latest Silurian-earliest Devonian taxa are also recorded from the circum-Arctic region. The late Lochkovian to early Emsian assemblages, particularly from south-eastern Australia, have many taxa in common with Chinese faunas. The mid-Emsian taxa show highest endemicity; and the latest Emsian-Eifelian assemblages have the most cosmopolitan aspect. Acanthodian faunas become rarer and depauperate in the Middle Devonian, particularly in the south-eastern corner, and are mostly in poorly dated, ?fluviatile/marginal marine deposits. This study of acanthodian faunas has encompassed a full scale systematic review of the group in this region, an appraisal of phylogenetic relationships within the group and with other early vertebrates, their palaeoecology, and their use in biostratigraphy and biogeography.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">260112 Palaeontology</field><field name="subject">780105 Biological sciences</field><field name="subject">Acanthodii</field><field name="subject">Devonian</field><field name="subject">Silurian</field><field name="subject">bistratigraphy</field><field name="subject">biogeography</field><field name="subject">eastern Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157975</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Validation of a CFD Solver for Hypersonic Flows</field><field name="creator">Elford, Michael Charles</field><field name="description">In this thesis the validation of a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code against published experimental data and alternative CFD results is explored. Six case studies are presented with flow speeds ranging from mid supersonic to hypersonic. The studies include complex compressible flow phenomena such as the interaction of shockwaves with boundary layers, vortices and other shockwaves. Two of the six validation cases also consider complex thermodynamic behaviour such as vibrational and chemical nonequilibrium. The problems chosen are limited in scope to flows which are planar or axisymmetric and remain laminar throughout the region of flow studied. This allows the studies to focus on simulating the fundamental behaviour of the flow without the added complication of turbulence or the need for large scale computing facilities. The problems which arose during the validation studies and a background to why they occurred and, wherever possible, strategies to avoid their occurrence are discussed. General modelling strategies in compressible CFD are also discussed. In this thesis the software suite CFD-FASTRAN is used to construct and analyse the CFD models. The material presented in this thesis is however general such that users of similar packages should find the thesis beneficial.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">290299 Aerospace Engineering not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">780102 Physical sciences</field><field name="subject">Hypersonics</field><field name="subject">CFD</field><field name="subject">CFD-FASTRAN</field><field name="subject">validation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158026</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Beyond Alethia: A Critique of Heideggerian Einaiology</field><field name="creator">Colledge, Richard John David</field><field name="description">The work of Martin Heidegger holds a pre-eminent place in contemporary ontological metaphysics, and this, it is argued, is a deeply two-edged sword. Proceeding on the basis of the unity of Heidegger&#146;s life-long project, the thesis critically evaluates Heideggerian thought, with a particular emphasis on its early formative texts (1923-35), highlighting what are seen as both its radical insights and its important shortcomings. The essay essentially follows Heidegger&#146;s own philosophical practice in two senses. First, it takes a strongly historical approach both to the etymology and semantics of the language of ontology, as well as to the context of Heideggerian thought in the tradition of western metaphysics. Second, beyond the method of &#145;immanent critique&#146; alone, it adopts a version of Heidegger&#146;s own methodology of &#145;retrieval&#146; (Wiederholung) in its confrontation with his thought: on one hand affirming the radically insightful nature of key elements of his work, while on the other hand looking to bring out of Heidegger&#146;s (and his precursors&#146;) own texts something of their &#145;drawing back&#146; from the deepest latent implications of his (and their) own insights. The essay begins with a historico-linguistic survey of the language of western ontology, from its origins in ancient Greek and Hellenistic metaphysics, through to its reception into medieval Latin, and onto its deployment in contemporary German and English, in this way establishing a key aspect of the &#145;pre-history&#146; of the &#145;ontological difference&#146; in terms of infinitival-participial renderings of the &#145;question&#146;. The interpretation offered here is then contrasted with key elements of Heidegger&#146;s own reading of the ancient origins of the tradition, and thus the first major strand of the essay&#146;s critique of Heideggerian thought is established along both linguistic and conceptual lines: i.e., that is amounts to an &#145;einaiolisation&#146; of the broad question of ontology. On the basis on this critique, the essay then sets out the understanding of &#145;be&#146; &#949;&#953;&#957;&#945;&#953;, esse, Sein) to be defended in what follows, a reading that situates itself between the Heideggerian and Thomistic positions, affirming and opposing key elements of each. On one hand, the vast wealth of Heidegger&#146;s alethiological phenomenology of &#145;world&#146; is affirmed as a radical advance on traditional static notions of essence, while on the other hand the collapse of any genuine understanding of the depth dimension of &#145;to exist&#146; (&#965;&#960;&#945;&#961;&#967;&#949;&#953;&#957;, ex(s)istere) is identified as a major point of contention with Heidegger&#146;s &#145;einaiology&#146;. In this way, the second major strand of the essay&#146;s critique of Heideggerian thought is established: i.e., that it amounts to a partialising &#145;alethiolisation&#146; of ontology. Within the context provided by the essay to this point, a more explicit &#145;retrieval&#146; of Heideggerian thought is then enacted first of all by situating his thought within the broad transcendental-phenomenological tradition in which it is so deeply embedded. In particular, this entails close readings of the methodological exclusion (&#949;&#960;&#959;&#967;&#951;) of exist(ence) seen in texts by Kant and Husserl, a strategy that in both cases is inadequately ameliorated by allusions to that which is surplus (&#220;berschu&#223;) to predication, meaning, sense, essence. Within the rich context provided by this analysis, the nature of Heidegger&#146;s innovation within, and yet deep adherence to, the transcendental-phenomenological tradition is sketched. The essay&#146;s fourth and final chapter involves a detailed confrontation with Heidegger&#146;s delimitation of the Seinsfrage to alethiological and einaiological concerns alone. This involves a close reading of some major early texts on the question of the independent integrity of beings from world(ing) and thus the meaning of Heidegger&#146;s category of &#145;Vorhandenheit&#146;, noting some substantial ambiguities on this question. It also involves a more systematic assessment of the consequential deep inner-contradictions of Heidegger&#146;s project as a whole, including some reflections on strands of early Heideggerian thought that appear to be attempts to address these deeply embedded tensions and problems. The essay&#146;s conclusion very briefly links the enacted critique of Heideggerian &#145;ontology&#146; to the broader question of the understanding of contingency in contemporary continental philosophy, thereby indicating something of the place of these reflections within a larger project of thought &#150; concerning philosophy as a &#145;hermeneutics of awe&#146; &#150; for which it serves as an essential prolegomena.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">440106 Logic</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158243</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Emperor and the Roman Elite from Commodus to Maximinus (A.D. 180-238)</field><field name="creator">Davenport, Caillan James Roderick</field><field name="description">Rome had twelve masters between the years A.D. 180-238, eleven of whom were murdered or killed in battle. The age of the Antonines came to an end with the death of Commodus and four years of divisive civil war. The eventual victor, Septimius Severus, established a new dynasty, but it was short-lived, coming to an ignominious end in a camp on the Rhine. Thus began the era of the soldier emperors. This thesis will argue that the rapid turnover of emperors in these fifty-eight years precipitated a crisis among the Roman elite. Senators and equestrians competed with each other, and with less exalted members of society, such as freedmen, to become members of the emperor&#146;s inner circle. Dio Cassius, a senator who began his Roman History during the reign of Septimius Severus, serves as an effective contemporary witness to the upheavals taking place at court and within society at large. Contrary to the views of scholars such as Crook and Syme, who place great emphasis on the continuity of policy provided by the emperor&#146;s amici, this thesis will demonstrate that there was significant discontinuity at the imperial court. Imperial advisers were not a fixed group retained from reign to reign &#150; instead, each new emperor chose to install his own supporters in key positions in order to put his own stamp on the administration of the empire. This has given rise to a tendency to label some rulers as &#145;anti-senatorial&#146; and others as &#145;pro-senatorial&#146;. Even those emperors who executed large numbers of senators, such as Commodus and Septimius Severus, had amici from within the senate whom they trusted and relied upon. The favour bestowed on such senators who formed part of the emperors&#146; exclusive cabal was a source of continual tension among the Roman elite. The amici formed a heterogeneous group, whose only common link was that they had earned the favour of the emperor of the day.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">430110 History - Classical Greek and Roman</field><field name="subject">780199 Other</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158140</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Theosophy of Jacob Boehme, German Protestant Mystic, and the Development of His Ideas in the Works of His English Disciples, Dr. John Pordage and Mrs. Jane Leade.</field><field name="creator">Harris, Brian</field><field name="description">This thesis, in the spirit of the History of Ideas, seeks to bring together in one work the basic ideas contained in the theosophy of the German Protestant mystic Jacob Boehme, and to subsequently trace how his ideas were developed and changed in the works of the English disciples, Dr. John Pordage and Mrs. Jane Leade. Recent studies have shown the pervasive influence of Jacob Boehme&#146;s writings in the early modern period, especially in England; Charles I, John Milton, William Law, and later, William Blake, were some of the important figures who came under its spell. Because of the radical nature of Boehme&#146;s message, that God had personally revealed universal secrets to him, Boehme&#146;s life in Germany became marred by persecution from the established religious hegemony. Religious radicals in England were also harried and pursued. During the interregnum, the Presbyterian and Anglican authority tried to uphold their power against a disintegrating political circumstance. They attacked with vigour any religious movement they deemed to be heretical and subversive to their authority. Under such pressure many religious groups sought refuge from the dictates of any religious jurisdiction. During the periods of intense political upheaval they looked for security in their own interpretations of the scriptures, and especially in the quietude of turning away from the world to the impulses given by the inner spirit. Overall, mystically inclined religious dissidents tended to long for some pansophic revelation that would rise above the worldly tumult and provide a resolution to long unanswered questions and aspirations. Boehme, for example, experienced the political and religious upheaval in Germany which led to the 30 Years War. He meditated upon the question of the cause of evil in the world. This endeavour led him to examine fundamental Christian questions, about what is God? What is the nature of God? How does God cause the things that are to come into existence? He sought to know these truths before he could answer the puzzle of why evil obtains. Because he could not find answers to these questions in orthodox canons he trawled far and wide - even to the works of antiquity, to bring in many topics he thought relevant into the pansophic net. Consequently, in his eclectic reach we will find reference to Neoplatonism, Alchemy, the Kabbalah, Astrology, Magia and Angelology, subjects that were always an undercurrent to the mystical in religion, now in Boehme&#146;s theosophy brought to the fore. This thesis will identify and draw out from the mass of Jacob Boehme&#146;s works the core ideas which underpin his theosophy. In bringing these subjects to the foreground the thesis points to the source, or tradition, of the core idea. Once we have established Jacob Boehme&#146;s core ideas and pointed to his sources it is contended that it will be possible then to approach and understand the doctrines of Dr. John Pordage and Mrs. Jane Leade in a clearer light. The thesis is divided into 6 chapters, but following the pattern set by the preceding remarks, the basic framework of the thesis is in three parts. Part one examines some detail of Boehme&#146;s life where it is deemed necessary for a framing exposition. The thesis is not concerned with an encyclopaedic reach of Boehme&#146;s biographical story but gives many details relevant for an understanding of his theosophy. Similarly, the thesis looks at the life and doctrines of former writers on mystical topics who are known to have been influential and it notes what aspect of their work was taken up by Boehme. Thus, armed with enough biographical detail and with an exposition of the major influences upon him, the thesis moves on to examine the core ideas of Jacob Boehme&#146;s theosophy. In part two, once the main planks of Jacob Boehme&#146;s are clearly delineated, the thesis moves on to discuss the reception of Boehme&#146;s theosophy in England, and how it impacted on the life and works of Dr. John Pordage. Pordage would go on to champion aspects of the Boehme canon to his own detriment. For a time he was able to combine his duties as an Anglican Rector with his preference for religious experimentation of a mystical nature. Unable to achieve the spontaneous theophanies encountered by the mentor Boehme, Pordage sought divine revelation in encounters with mediums, in trance-inducing rhythmic singing and dancing, in the rigours of self-deprivation, and in the company of eccentric characters who pretended to divine preference. These pursuits were obviously outside the scope of his Anglican duties and brought ill repute to him when such &#147;experiments&#148; were made known to the ecclesiastic authority. He was brought to book and sacked from the living of the Rectory at Bradfield. After exile from the church, Pordage continued on to live in seclusion, gathering about him a small number of devotees who were drawn to him by his undoubted personal magnetism and by the power of his preaching ability. As he got older he began to shun the world and to spend many days in introspective journeys where his spirit soared from his body in mystical flights of fancy. The thesis details biographical events relevant to an understanding of Pordage&#146;s thought and then moves on to discuss the main ideas presented in Pordage&#146;s work, the Theosophia Mystica, published by Jane Leade and her associates, three years after his death. The discussion seeks to establish the core ideas of Pordage&#146;s theosophy. Another aim of the thesis is to ascertain to what degree Pordage took up Boehme&#146;s ideas, and alternately, to show where he parted from them and why. In the third section of the thesis there is an exposition of Mrs. Jane Leade&#146;s works. After Pordage was rusticated he remained for a time in the vicinity of Bradfield, but thereafter moved to London. It was in London that Jane Leade was drawn to his little band of private worshippers. Mrs. Leade was destitute following the death of her husband. She had decided that her future lay in promoting God&#146;s works. As a chiliast she was especially concerned with the advent of the New Jerusalem. She believed that such an event was imminent and God&#146;s kingdom would be established on Earth. Eventually she was invited to join the Pordage household and she cast her lot with them. Together they worked upon a religious manifesto and eventually decided to publish their exhortations to the world under the banner of what they called the Philadelphian Society. The Philadelphian Society was a loose-knit federation of like minded people in England and on the Continent who were interested in Jacob Boehme&#146;s theosophy and the mystical in religion in general. When Pordage died Mrs. Leade assumed the leadership. She published many tracts of a religious nature during this time. Her purpose was to exhort those of lesser religious experience to strive to become of higher standing in the Lord. She wrote that she had achieved numerous preferments from God. She even contended that she had stood before God&#146;s presence in order that she might understand His purpose. In this way she thought she had become like a General. Her duties sought to martial the righteous armies back to their spiritual home. The thesis will notice her drive towards a thoroughgoing Neoplatonism as she eschewed all worldly gifts, honours and riches - counting them as of nothing compared to the glory of spiritual life. Her other-worldly encounters were often induced by what she called &#147;daily dyings&#148;, which meant, in practice, a regime of austere asceticism; meaning that the body was denied the comforts of repose, sleep and sustenance. She put into practice the extreme negative aspects of a Neoplatonic doctrine that the body and the things of this world were worthless. In similar fashion to the elder Pordage, she was never happier than in the state when she thought her spirit left her body to prepare for her return to the eternal spiritual home. Accordingly, the thesis discusses the major planks of Mrs. Leade&#146;s ideas as she extolled them in her writings. The exposition shows how she followed in the steps of her mentor John Pordage and where she added emphasis here and there with her own stamp. Overall, it is noticed how the framework of her ideas was compiled through her association with John Pordage; and how, through his mentorship, she reached back to the maker, Jacob Boehme.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">440209 Philosophy of Religion</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158301</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Representing the Bible : discourses in the press news</field><field name="creator">Matson, John</field><field name="description">While there have been a number of studies about the Bible in the media they have tended to look only at the use of Bible stories in the entertainment area and in the tabloid press. These studies do not consider how the news media covers the Bible. This study, however, presents the findings of a systematic and comprehensive analysis of the representation of the Bible in the press news. The primary aim of the research was to understand how the press news constructs the Bible with its discourse. To develop this awareness, the study employed the method of discourse analysis. This included both quantitative and interpretative analysis of the language of the news texts. The corpus came from news reports of the Bible in association with the controversy surrounding the Dead Sea Scrolls. From the point of view of this study, I collected the reports on the Dead Sea Scrolls as they occurred, thus reducing any possible bias from the selection process; the reports were simply a means to an end &#151; a thread to follow, as it were. The study period was from 1947, when Bedouins found the Dead Sea Scrolls, to 2003 just after the publication of nearly all the ancient texts. The media selected from which to draw the reports were: The Australian (Aust.), The Sydney Morning Herald (SMH), The New York Times (NYT), and The Times (London). I chose these papers because they are among the principal agenda-setters for the rest of their respective nation's media, and as such, they reflect the views of the opinion leaders in their communities at large. Results from the analysis revealed that while there were negative representations of the Bible, there were also press news reports that provided positive accounts. At first, news reports were more or less a matter of a factual accounting of the events. Later, the reports contained assertions on the need to rewrite the Bible &#151; iii something that was clearly abhorrent to conventional Christians. Moreover, there was a press discourse portraying the Bible as a document that was culturally irrelevant and with an uncertain status. Opposed to this however, there was discourse representing the Bible as a resource book (a document to which one could turn with one&#146;s problems). In addition, there was also evidence of a journalistic frame in operation that was organizing the world around the Bible, subtly managing audience interpretation. This framed the Bible as a sacred document safeguarded as much by religion as by tradition. This sacredness is rooted deep in Western culture. Such a frame, of course, was largely unspoken or unacknowledged. It provided a sense that the Bible enjoys a degree of cultural and social authority as a guide to life based on an interpretation of past events in faith. On the other hand, the nature of some reporting would suggest that the Bible is a 'cultural icon', a somewhat elitist object, now distant from the popular culture of which it was once a part. The impact of these findings lies in the apparent need for biblical scholarship to focus on the Bible&#146;s heritage in Western culture. Scholars may find this heritage in the fine arts and in the media, among other phenomena. Should they decide to take up this challenge then they would study the Bible as a cultural artefact, and not primarily as a religious text that is the property of the religious communities. This may mean completing cultural/biblical studies outside organized religion. Naturally, such a shift would represent a loss to the traditional philological/classical base of biblical scholarship. I expect that the findings of this study will contribute to both the growing body of research on media discourse; and a better understanding of the Bible in the Western way of life.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">440204 Christian Theology (incl.

And the society that this thesis will investigate, the French speaking people of north western Europe, was the theatre in which much of that debate and change took place. The opinions and arguments of the erudite from that time and place are well known. Studies of their interactions illustrate the existence of many schools and individuals whose deliberations were written down, and which supply ample material to modern scholars who research the theological development of the time. However, what is not so abundantly documented is the impact that religion had on the lay and sometimes illiterate Christians of the day. If, in fact, they did debate their religious beliefs and practices, their debates were not written down for posterity to read. Their opinions can only be accessed obliquely. This thesis takes the form of small social history, history from the lower echelons of society rather than the higher, that plumbs the experiences of ordinary people whose opinions were not important enough to occupy the scholars and administrators of the day. In this case a branch of their literature in the vernacular will be used as source material. I propose drawing out a picture of what the people of the time believed, and how they expressed that belief in action, through a close reading of the popular medieval genre of the chanson de geste. The subject has been broached before, by Carl Josef Merk in 1914, Adolphe Jacques Dickman in 1926, Marianna Gildea in 1943 and J-L. Roland B&#233;langer in 1975. This study will differ from previous studies in its concentration on only one cycle of poems and the depth of examination of those poems. Where Merk, Gildea and Dickman used many poems, almost the entire available corpus, and B&#233;langer used a mixture of the poems of the Loherain Cycle and other earlier chansons, this study will be confined to the poems of the Charlemagne Cycle. The poems of one cycle grew out of a common store of subject matter, in this case stories surrounding the great eighth and ninth century king, Charlemagne. By the time of the production and recording of chansons, Charlemagne had acquired legendary status and been credited with conquests and journeys that he never made in his lifetime. He represented an ideal of kingship and his actions were the actions of the ideal Christian conqueror, a monarch who, with his people, was loved by God and guided and assisted by God in all he undertook. For the most part the stories about him involved the conquest and conversion of non-Christian people. Consequently, although the poems are not overtly concerned with religious teaching or religious practice, their subject matter is imbued with religious language and significance. It is the religious significance of the language and subject matter of these poems and the similarity of the hierarchical structure of the society described to the conjectured celestial structure that makes these poems suitable as subject matter for this study. Eleven poems have been chosen for study, nine concerned with conquest of non- Christian people and two with the existence of traitors among the followers of the king. These two poems add the dimension of loyalty to one&#146;s monarch and preservation of the status quo to that of warfare against non-Christians. The findings are set out in two sections, one concerned with rituals that mark the milestones in the protagonists&#146; lives and the other with more spontaneous expressions of faith. Conclusions are drawn from each section and then melded to give an overall picture of the faith of the laity of the time. Where parallels or contrasts with the practice accepted and prescribed by the ecclesiastical establishment are detected, these are examined in the relevant chapters.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">780199 Other</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158226</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vapours and visions religious dimensions of DMT use</field><field name="creator">Tramacchi, Desmond Thomas</field><field name="description">Not available</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">440207 Religion and Society</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158343</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental systems analysis as an aid to policy development, application and auditing</field><field name="creator">Hill, Richard J.</field><field name="description">Environmental management in modern industry entails much more than simply measuring the level of contaminants at the discharge point of a chimney stack or pipeline and operating within defined licence limits. It involves: 1) Understanding the environmental risks associated with the industrial operation; 2) Quantifying the environmental assets at risk; 3) Evaluating the environmental challenge from the industry (determining the likely effect of particular emission levels on different environments); 4) Monitoring the condition of environmental assets in response to this challenge; 5) Devising appropriate remedial action where necessary. This study aimed to provide a rigorous and effective framework for decision making concerning vegetated landscapes surrounding industrial premises, particularly those associated with emissions of pollutants to air. Three Alcoa of Australia managed facilities in Victoria were used to develop and test the procedures, namely a coastal site at Point Henry, Geelong, a hinterland forest and heath site at Anglesea and a coastal heath site at Portland. The three facilities were involved in the aluminium smelting industry and the major atmospheric emissions were gaseous and particulate fluorides and sulfur dioxide. Analyses of vegetation distribution and condition were undertaken in order to establish whether the industrial activities at the three sites could be identified as the causes of changes in vegetation. A geographic information system (GIS) was implemented at each facility, to contain cadastral information as well as records of the physical environment and plant and animal species occurrences and condition, where appropriate. The GIS was used to create a surface of vegetation condition over the area of interest at the time of assessment and then over time to evaluate vegetation change and relationship to meteorological and production data. Baseline vegetation condition was established for each facility using large-scale high quality aerial photography and multi-spectral imagery. The photography for each site contained large amounts of latent information on vegetation distribution and condition. When properly rectified and geo-referenced, the images became accessible and open to manipulation within the GIS. At each of the three sites investigated, image classes were selected that provided appropriate detail for the vegetation type. In effect the image became a surrogate of the vegetation frozen in time and space. The ability to extract information on past vegetation condition was shown to be a very valuable asset providing the opportunity to generate new contemporaneous data to augment poor or lost historical data. The process was illustrated by developing vegetation change maps and trend information using past and current photography and limited historical field data. A verified emission model was applied to two of the facilities (Anglesea and Portland) to predict emission effects over the vegetated areas. These were used to evaluate current vegetation condition and change in terms of industrial challenge and other change agencies known or suspected. In each case, further developments of the model were required in order to achieve acceptable predictions of known atmospheric and air pollutant conditions. The investigations at Anglesea demonstrated the importance of fine-scale topographic description and meteorological modelling in order to reconcile modelled and observed environmental conditions in hilly coastal terrain. At Portland, the study revealed the importance of marine aerosols in the distribution and deposition of fluoride in the vicinity of the source. Within the broad framework of vegetation type and general condition at Anglesea and Portland, differences at the micro-scale of individual plants and clumps of plants were examined using multi-spectral imagery. Here differences in image characteristics that related to increased pigmentation and loss of chlorophyll in leaves and increased amounts of dead tissue on plants were evaluated. The change agents for the detected differences within sets and between sets of imagery were analysed and again shown to be mainly non-industrial. Only at Portland did atmospheric emissions from the aluminium smelter play a role at some locations, and then only because the effect was being reinforced by other factors (lack of burning and drought). At Portland, population data for associated fauna and an orchid were examined in relation to the baseline vegetation condition, vegetation change and industrial impact. The distribution and welfare of these species were shown to be generally dependent on vegetation condition and other non-industrial factors. If the vegetation overall was maintained in a condition of vigorous growth and structural diversity, it could be expected that specific dependant flora and fauna would thrive within it. The exception was the orchid, which was shown to be sensitive to emissions and could only thrive in its natural habitat in the vicinity of the smelter if protected by screening vegetation or nurtured by an intensive set of cultural practices that were developed as a result of this study.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300804 Environmental Impact Assessment</field><field name="subject">300800 Environmental Sciences</field><field name="subject">300801 Environmental Management and Rehabilitation</field><field name="subject">Alcoa</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158761</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Population diversity, sources and evaluation of metalaxyl-based management of pythium damping-off of cucumber in Oman</field><field name="creator">Al-Sa'di, Abdullah Mohammed</field><field name="description">This study was undertaken to identify Pythium species causing damping-off of cucumber in Oman, to characterize diversity in Pythium species, to identify the potential sources of Pythium inoculum in greenhouses and to evaluate the efficacy of metalaxyl in management of damping-off disease. A survey in 2004 and 2005 characterized Pythium aphanidermatum (77% of isolations), P. spinosum (22%) and P. splendens (1%) to be the pathogens associated with damping-off of cucumber in Oman, with the latter two being first reports in Oman. P. aphanidermatum was isolated from all districts in Oman during different times of the year and was generally aggressive at 25 and 30JC. However, the P. spinosum distribution was limited to seven out of 13 districts surveyed, isolated more during cooler months of the year and was found to be more aggressive at relatively lower temperatures (25JC). The second part of the thesis dealt with characterizing genetic diversity using Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphisms (AFLP) fingerprinting in the predominant species P. aphanidermatum. Isolates of P. aphanidermatum from muskmelon in Oman and from different hosts in the USA and Norway were included in the study. The study revealed that P. aphanidermatum populations in greenhouses in Oman consist of a large number of different phenotypes with generally a high level of genetic similarity (mean = 96.6%), which suggested the introduction of P. aphanidermatum in greenhouses via multiple sources. A high number of identical phenotypes were recovered between muskmelon and cucumber fields in the same area compared to the small number of identical phenotypes recovered across different regions. Quantitative population analysis using AMOVA and FST values supported the hypothesis of frequent movement of P. aphanidermatum inoculum between fields in the same area compared to limited circulation between geographically separated areas. Variation was also found between different isolates in aggressiveness on cucumber and muskmelon, but no host specialization was found. Investigating genetic diversity in 24 isolates of P. spinosum from different regions in Oman revealed that the population consists of a small number of phenotypes sharing a very high level of genetic similarity (L 99%). This was suggested to be due to the recent introduction of P. spinosum in Oman via a common source. All P. aphanidermatum and P. spinosum isolates were found to be highly sensitive to metalaxyl (EC50 &lt; 1 Ng ml-1), which indicates that no resistance had developed among populations of these two species to metalaxyl. Further experiments into the potential sources of Pythium species in greenhouses in Oman revealed that Pythium species can be introduced into greenhouses via contaminated soil previously cultivated with crops other than cucumber on which greenhouses are established. Other avenues for the introduction of inoculum include uncultivated soil introduced into greenhouses, soil left in the greenhouse after excluding the top 30 to 60 cm of old soil, potting mixtures and soil adhering to irrigation pipes, growers&#146; shoes and cultivation equipment. No Pythium inoculum was detected in irrigation water or organic fertilizers. Correlation analysis based on existing field observations indicated that the practice of soil replacement is efficient in reducing inoculum density and damping-off levels in greenhouses (P &lt; 0.01). The final part of this thesis dealt with identifying factors associated with decreased efficacy of metalaxyl to manage damping-off of cucumber. The study evaluated the contribution of three main factors to the problem: development of resistance to metalaxyl in the pathogen population, timing of metalaxyl application by growers and the rate of metalaxyl biodegradation in greenhouse soils. A survey over six growing seasons showed that growers lost up to 14.6% of seedlings under the use of metalaxyl, with mortality being high in the warmer seasons compared to the cooler seasons. All Pythium isolates were found to be highly sensitive to metalaxyl (EC50 &lt; 1 Ng ml-1). Over 57% of growers in Oman were found to delay metalaxyl application in greenhouses until up to four days following transplanting; this action significantly increased seedling mortality during the first week following transplanting compared with metalaxyl application before transplanting. Pre-transplanting treatment with metalaxyl was found in greenhouse experiments to be superior in reducing seedling mortality during this period compared to application following transplanting. However, the re-appearance of damping-off symptoms 9 to 14 days after initial suppression at the time of transplanting was found to be associated with a rapid rate of metalaxyl biodegradation in greenhouses experiencing re-appearance of damping-off symptoms. The half life of metalaxyl in soil was found to have a negative correlation with the number of seasons of metalaxyl use, where the half life of metalaxyl dropped from 93 days in greenhouse soil with no previous history of metalaxyl use to 14 days in greenhouse soil in which metalaxyl was used for eight consecutive seasons. Following up the first treatment of metalaxyl at the time of transplanting with a second treatment eight days after transplanting was found to reduce the appearance of the second phase of damping-off in greenhouses suffering from enhanced rate of metalaxyl biodegradation. Information generated from these studies helped to understand the nature of dampingoff of cucumber in greenhouses in Oman and provided the foundation for the development and implementation of management strategies which would enable growers to minimize the incidence of damping-off.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158422</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Refuge competition in the freshwater prawn, Macrobrachium Australiense : linking individual behaviours to population patterns</field><field name="creator">Lammers, Jan Hsuan</field><field name="description">By utilising an individual-based model (IBM) I directly examined the link between system level properties and their structural roots, the small scale competitive behaviours of individuals. The refuging behaviours of a diurnally inactive freshwater prawn, Macrobrachium australiense, were used as the basis for the IBM which explored the role of refuge competition on exposure to predation. Physical experiments were conducted to determine the behavioural rules and parameterise the model. The first series of experiments investigated the diel refuging patterns and competitive refuging behaviours of the study animal (Chapter 2-4). These were found to be strongly anti-predatory; individuals sharply reduced diel activity and spent the vast majority of their time in available vegetation refugia (Chapter 2). The presence of conspecifics, however, affected the activity of focal individuals, and their exposure to predation, by two separate mechanisms. The first was detectability related to the Size of the conspecific and the Refuge stalk Density (SiRD mechanism) (Chapter 3-4), the second was driven by the activity of the conspecific (Motion mechanism) (Chapter 4). During the SiRD mechanism the response of the individual was also related to its position in the dominance hierarchy relative to the conspecific. For dominant individuals activity increased in all refuge densities tested with increasing conspecific detectability (Chapter 3). Subordinate response in the SiRD mechanism was also affected by the quality of the refuge (Chapter 4). When faced with increasing dominant size subordinates in low quality refugia reduced activity, this contrasted with high quality refugia where their activity increased. This was explained in terms of alternative mechanisms to minimise contact with dominants: evasion and crypsis in high and low quality refugia respectively (Chapter 4). Compared to SiRD the Motion mechanism was relatively straight forward. In all cases the activity of other individuals was found to trigger an increase in the activity of proximate conspecifics (Chapter 4). During these experiments it was noted that when introduced to a novel environment M. australiense individuals would actively explore it, showing uncharacteristically high levels of diel activity. The subsequent experiments examined whether or not they required this exploratory period to determine the location and quality of refugia (Chapter 5). The results demonstrated that the study animals were able to detect and evaluate the quality of distant novel refugia without exploring them first. However, this ability did not preclude the performance of exploratory behaviours (Chapter 5). The behaviours in the preceding chapters formed the basis for the construction and parameterisation of the IBM (described in Chapter 6). Tests of the models validity showed that it could make adequate predictions about the distribution of individuals around an experimental aquarium and was able to reproduce a majority of trends seen in a series of independent experiments (Chapter 7). Though, the SiRD mechanism was underestimating the magnitude of the size related trends. The overall results determined that the model could describe the general effects of different behaviours on the exposure of individuals to predation, but would need further parameterisation to make predictions about real world scenarios. Bearing this in mind exploratory simulation experiments were conducted to test the link between the simulated behaviours and system level patterns (Chapter 8-9). Three core effects were found to affect the population&#146;s exposure to predation. First, the cumulative Motion mechanism resulted in the emergence of a density-dependent pattern affecting predator exposure which increased with escalating population size and decreasing refuge availability (Chapter 8). Second the low movement likelihood of individuals limited their spatial range to a subsection of the simulated environment. Because of this the fragmentation of refugia only had an impact on exposure to predation when it occurred at a scale relative to this spatial range (Chapter 8). The third core effect demonstrated a mechanism by which refuge competition could affect individuals exposed to predation and subsequently the size structure of the population (Chapter 9). When individuals, which surpassed a threshold of exposure to predation, were removed from the population there was a general increase in the average body size of the population. The number of individuals removed from the population, and the rate of increase in average body size was strongly affected by the initial body size variation of the individuals. This effect was strong despite the fact that it was probably underestimated by the model, as it was driven by the SiRD mechanism (Chapter 9). Overall the behavioural rules of the model succeeded in reproducing the system level patterns, demonstrating that they captured some essential processes of competitive refuging behaviours. The main contribution of this thesis to the scientific literature is the description of an explicit link between the competitive refuging behaviours of individuals and their resultant population patterns.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158604</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The behaviour and physiology of the gravid flatback turtle (Natator depressus)</field><field name="creator">Sperling, Jannie Bech</field><field name="description">The study describes for the first time the detailed behaviour of flatback sea turtles (Natator depressus) between nesting events within the same season. It includes both horizontal and vertical movements, obtained through satellite telemetry and with Time-Depth-Recorders, respectively. Two genetically and geographically distinct populations were studied; Curtis Island, Queensland and Bare Sand Island, Northern Territory. While the flatbacks at Bare Sand Island appeared to spread randomly out from the island, the flatbacks at Curtis Island made use of the protected waters of the Gladstone port and harbour area. The flatbacks&#146; vertical movements were compared to that of loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) nesting at Mon Repos Conservation Park, Queensland. Both species spent &lt;10% of their time at or near the surface and displayed dive types that could be referenced to terminology developed for sea turtle species. Most prevalent were dive types 1, 3 and 4, where the first is thought to represent dives during which turtles are inactive on the seabed. In the latter two turtles are thought to slowly ascend in mid-water, as a result of a slow increase in buoyancy, while swimming some distance horizontally. Dive type 1 was by far the most common dive type in the flatback turtle, while dive type 3 was equally as important as type 1 in the loggerhead. Dive type 1 was in both species more common in the middle third of the period, when eggs are maturing. There was some evidence of a diel pattern, with dive type 1 more common during the day in flatbacks and during the night in loggerheads. An important finding was that flatback turtles show long dives, up to 98 min. The mean duration of 50 min for dive type 1 is about twice as long as commonly seen in loggerheads and other large sea turtles, while comparable to the smaller olive ridley (Lepidochelys olivacea) and hawksbill turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata). Part of the explanation for long dives appears to include an oxygen carrying capacity at the high end of the range for diving reptiles and higher blood oxygen saturation at comparable partial pressures of oxygen. Internesting intervals were correlated negatively with sea temperature in both flatback and loggerhead turtles, but could not be described by a single correlation. The results showed that the modal temperature calculated for the egg maturation part of the interval, i.e. approximately the first nine days, depicts the temperature important to pre-ovipositional egg development better than mean temperature measured over the whole internesting interval.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158512</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Housing Opportunity and Residential Mobility in the Seoul Metropolitan Region, the Republic of Korea: Macro and Micro Approaches</field><field name="creator">Han, Jung Hoon</field><field name="description">This thesis examines residential relocation process within the Seoul Metropolitan Region (SMR) in the Republic of Korea at both a macro and micro level. The thesis makes theoretical and methodological contributions to residential mobility, housing vacancy chains and location choice behaviour in urban geography. The empirical study specifically focused on the relationship between housing opportunity and residential relocation process in the SMR during the 1990s. In developing countries, large scale suburban land and housing development on the fringe of metropolitan areas is seen as an important issue in the process of rapid urbanization and capital accumulation. This is particularly true of Korea where the population of the capital city, Seoul (SCC) has declined since the introduction of massive scale of new suburban housing developments in the 1990s. This is the first time the SCC&#146;s population has decreased in Korean modern history. However there is still debate about the impact of government proposed suburban new housing construction initiatives on residential relocation within the SMR. In addition there remain uncertainties concerning the impact of large suburban housing development on residential relocation behaviour. To date little evaluation of outcomes of the policies has been undertaken, a deficiency which this research seeks to address. Like other capital cities in the developing world, Seoul (SCC) has undergone significant urban expansion throughout its contemporary history, fuelled by the movement of refugees from North Korea in the period immediately following the end of the Korean War (1953) and by significant rural-to-urban, and later by intra urban movement. The SCC, in particular grew significantly, with the metropolitan area of Seoul soon expanding beyond its borders in a process akin to suburbanisation. The rapid urban growth in the Seoul Metropolitan Region (SMR) was accompanied by a series of urban problems including housing shortages, a decline in housing and urban quality, and the concentration of population in large cities, especially in the SCC. To counter these problems the national government in the Republic of Korea initiated a series of policies. Most prominently among these was a massive scale new housing development program initiated in 1988, aimed at developing large scale new satellite cites in Kyonggi, with the objective of decentralising the SCC&#146;s population and thus alleviating an urban housing shortage. This research focuses on two main issues charactering contemporary housing and land development policies in the SMR. The first relates to government efforts to redirect migration from the capital city, Seoul, to the outlying jurisdictions of Kyonggi and Inchon in an attempt to diffuse the concentration of population in the SCC and to alleviate housing shortages. The second issue concerns the determinants of residential mobility and residential location choice behaviour in the SMR. Mirroring the two issues, two approaches have been used to address these issues: a macro level study of residential relocation and a micro behavioural analysis. At macro level the research attempts to measure the impact of new housing developments on easing urban housing markets in the SMR during the 1990s, notwithstanding the continuous population movement from other regions in the Republic of Korea. The macro investigation addresses the questions: &#149; What are the changes in spatial mobility patterns occurring in the SMR since the introduction of government&#146;s suburban residential developments? &#149; Are the size of housing vacancy chains different by spatial mobility patterns among the three regional housing markets in the SMR? Multi-regional vacancy chain models are used to examine whether vacant housing opportunity spills over into neighbouring regions in the SMR, particularly the city of Seoul. The models focus mainly on the structural determinants of household mobility, such as local new housing construction, household formation, household mobility rate and demolition rate, and their role in creating and absorbing vacant housing opportunities in the three jurisdictions comprising the SMR: Seoul (SCC), Kyonggi and Inchon. The vacancy chain analysis uses a Markov chain model and Leontief input-output model to assess the impact of these structural differentials on household mobility in the multiregional system of the SMR. This macro study provides a structural framework for the subsequent micro behavioural approach to residential mobility occurring in the SMR. The micro behavioural approach investigates the following questions: &#149; What are the socio demographic profiles of people who relocate within the SMR?&#146; &#149; What are the housing transitions that occur after moving to regions of the SCC in the SMR? &#149; What are the reasons households give for moving within the SMR? This micro approach focuses on the behavioural aspects of residential mobility decision process as influenced by age, marital status, employment status, education level, duration of residence, dwelling size and tenure status. Apart from the mover&#146;s socio demographic profile, the study further investigates longitudinal housing transitions before and after a move by their origin and destination within the SMR, particularly those movers who relocated to suburban rings (Kyonggi/Inchon). However the reasons for movers to choose a particular location vary and they are socio demographically diverse. The research also discusses these behavioural reasons for moving within the SMR.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">370502 Migration</field><field name="subject">759900 Other Social Development and Community Services</field><field name="subject">residential mobility</field><field name="subject">migration</field><field name="subject">housing</field><field name="subject">housing choice</field><field name="subject">housing market</field><field name="subject">vacancy chains</field><field name="subject">korea</field><field name="subject">seoul</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157977</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study on diffusion and flow of sub-critical hydrocarbons in activated carbon</field><field name="creator">BAE, Jun-Seok</field><field name="description">This thesis deals with diffusion and flow of sub-critical hydrocarbons in activated carbon by using a differential permeation method. The hydrocarbons are selected according to the effect on environmental concerns and their unique characteristics such as polarity and affinity towards activated carbon. Although it has been known that transport processes in activated carbon consist of Knudsen diffusion, gaseous viscous flow, adsorbed phase diffusion (so called, surface diffusion) and condensate flow, there have been no rigorous models to describe the transport processes in activated carbon with a full range of pressures. In particular among the four processes, the mechanism of adsorbed phase diffusion in activated carbon is still far from complete understanding. Also due to the dispersion interactions between adsorbing molecules and the solid surface, one would expect that Knudsen diffusion is influenced by the dispersive forces. From intensive experimental observations with a great care over a full range of pressures, conventional methods (for example, direct estimation from inert gas experiments) to determine adsorbed phase diffusion are found to be inadequate for strongly adsorbing vapors in activated carbon. By incorporating the effect of adsorbate-adsorbent interactions into Knudsen diffusivity, the general behavior of adsorbed phase diffusion in terms of pressure (or surface loading) can be obtained, showing a significant role in transport at low pressures. For non-polar hydrocarbons such as benzene, carbon tetrachloride and n-hexane, a mathematical model, which accounts for the effects of adsorbate-adsorbent interactions and pore size distribution, is formulated and validated, resulting in a good agreement with experimental data. Moreover, the adsorption and dynamic behaviors of alcohol molecules (which are polar compounds) are investigated with an aim to compare their behaviors against those of non-polar compounds.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">670700 Industrial Chemicals and Related Products</field><field name="subject">surface diffusion</field><field name="subject">hydrocarbons</field><field name="subject">activated carbon</field><field name="subject">transport phenomena</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157965</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Implications of Adult Attachment Theory for Chronic Pain</field><field name="creator">Meredith, Pamela Joy</field><field name="description">This thesis presents empirical evidence supporting the relevance of adult attachment theory in understanding the chronic pain experience. The thesis arose from the recognition that, although pain-related psychosocial variables have been used to differentiate subgroups of individuals in chronic pain, little is known about the developmental origins or cognitive, behavioural, or affective correlates of these subgroups. Attachment theory offers a development framework, which is of potential value in guiding early pain intervention and prevention efforts, as well as tailoring interventions to suit specific patient needs. In order to investigate the value of applying adult attachment theory to the chronic pain field, five central research questions were identified: 1) Does insecure attachment contribute to a more negative experience of acute pain for those not diagnosed with a chronic pain condition? That is, does the association between insecure attachment and maladaptive pain-related variables precede the onset of chronic pain)? 2) How do the subgroups of adult attachment, identified in a chronic pain sample, compare to the clusters identified by pain-related psychosocial measures in the same sample? 3) Are the documented associations between attachment and psychosocial variables (i.e., cognitive appraisals, self-efficacy, coping, social support) evident in the context of chronic pain? 4) Do attachment variables moderate the associations between these psychosocial variables and painrelated variables?, and 5) What is the association between adult attachment variables and outcomes from chronic pain rehabilitation programs? To address the first question, an experimental study was designed to explore the perceptions, emotions and coping patterns of 58 pain-free individuals exposed to an acute (coldpressor) pain experience. Findings revealed that higher levels of anxiety over relationships were associated with lower pain thresholds, more stress, depression and anxiety, diminished perceptions of control over pain, and diminished ability to decrease pain. More secure attachment, on the other hand, was associated with greater perceptions of control over pain, and lower levels of depression and catastrophizing. In order to explore research questions 2-5, data from two clinical samples were collected on the first and last days of participation in one of two chronic pain rehabilitation programs (program length varied from two to three weeks). A total of 152 participants completed questionnaires before treatment, with 100 of these participants also completing questionnaires after treatment. Participants were aged between 18 and 82 years (M = 38.8, SD = 12.4), and had been in pain for an average of 3.7 years (SD = 6.9). Approximately 41% of participants were women, and 58% were men (gender for one participant was unknown). In order to address question two regarding the similarity between adult attachment subgroups and pain clusters based on a psychosocial pain measure (Multidimensional Pain Inventory, MPI), pre-treatment data were analyzed. The clustering approach using the MPI, known as Multiaxial Assessment of Pain (MAP), identifies three subgroups of individuals, labeled interpersonally distressed, dysfunctional, and adaptive copers. These clusters were compared with the four subgroups and two dimensions obtained with adult attachment measures. Results revealed that the interpersonally distressed MAP subgroup was associated with fearful attachment, while the dysfunctional MAP subgroup was linked with avoidant (low comfort) attachment. The comfort attachment dimension was associated with more adaptive MPI variables, while the anxious attachment dimension was linked with more maladaptive MPI variables. Consideration of research questions three to five prompted development of an integrative model, the Attachment-Diathesis Model of Chronic Pain (ADMCP), which provided a framework for exploring the psychosocial mechanisms linking attachment security with the outcome variables of perceived pain intensity, disability, and treatment outcomes. Based on predictions emerging from this model, a set of five studies explored pre-treatment associations between adult attachment variables, six psychosocial mechanisms (pain appraisal, depression, pain self-efficacy, anxiety, perceptions of social support, and coping), and outcome variables pre-treatment. One further paper was devoted to implications of adult attachment for treatment outcome. In general, findings from these studies revealed that variables representing attachment insecurity were significantly associated with more maladaptive coping, cognitive, affective and interpersonal characteristics, both before and after treatment, compared to variables reflecting secure attachment. Overall, both securely and insecurely attached individuals made progress in response to pain rehabilitation. Finally, a summary of the evidence of associations between attachment variables, psychosocial mechanisms, and treatment outcomes revealed by this research is presented, permitting discussion regarding the explanatory value of the ADMCP and clinical implications. Limitations to the present research, including family-wise error, the use of self-report measures, and the self-selecting nature of the sample, are discussed, and directions for further research are proposed. The evidence presented in this thesis advances our understanding of the developmental origins of chronic pain conditions, and provides a lens through which to view the heterogeneity of people with chronic pain. Overall, this project highlights the value of applying adult attachment principles to this field. It is anticipated that findings will assist in the development of a more differentiated range of treatment approaches for the individuals who experience chronic pain. In addition, the findings of this project may have important implications for prevention and early intervention of these conditions.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158257</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cognition driven deformation modelling</field><field name="creator">Janke, Andrew Lindsay</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the development of a model of cerebral atrophic change associated with neurodegeneration. Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's dementia present a significant health problem within the elderly population. Effective treatment relies upon the early detection of anatomic change, and the subsequent differential diagnosis of the disorder from other closely related neurological conditions. Importantly, this also includes the investigation of the relationship between atrophic change and cognitive function. In unison with the growth in neuroimaging technology, myriad methodologies have been developed since the first quantitative measures of atrophic change were deduced via manual tracing. Subsequently, automated region of interest analysis, segmentation, voxel-based morphometry and non-linear registration have all been used to investigate atrophy. These methods commonly report findings of ventricular enlargement and temporal lobe change in AD and other dementias. Whilst these results are accurate indicators of atrophy, they are largely non-specific in their diagnostic utility. In addition, the aforementioned methods have been employed to discern change observed at discrete intervals during a disease process. In order to gain a greater understanding of the temporal characteristics of changes that occur as a result of atrophy, a deformation modelling method that allows the continuous tracking of these changes in a cohort of AD patients and elderly control subjects is presented in this thesis. Deformation modelling involves non-linear registration of images to investigate the change that is apparent between two or more images. The non- linear registration results are analysed and presented via three metrics: local volume loss (atrophy); volume (CSF) increase; and translation (interpreted as representing collapse of cortical structures). Changes observed in the analyses in this thesis are consistent with results from neuro-anatomical studies of AD. Results using the more traditional methods of analysis are presented for comparative purposes.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">280406 Mathematical Software</field><field name="subject">700101 Application packages</field><field name="subject">MRI</field><field name="subject">Alzheimers</field><field name="subject">Non-Linear Registration</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157936</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Measurement and modelling of gas dispersion characteristics in a mechanical flotation cell</field><field name="creator">Sanwani, Edy</field><field name="description">The gas dispersion characteristics in mechanical flotation cells have a significant effect on the overall flotation performance. Three major properties that can be measured in characterising the gas dispersion in a flotation cell are bubble size, gas hold-up, and superficial gas velocity. Another property that is equally important in flotation is bubble surface area flux which is calculated from bubble size and superficial gas velocity. Despite the importance of gas dispersion in flotation, not much work has been reported previously in this area. Moreover, the study of gas dispersion in flotation has typically considered only a few points in a flotation cell and the average values were assumed to represent the gas dispersion characteristics in the entire volume of the cell. It is known however, that the gas dispersion characteristics are not uniformly distributed in a mechanical flotation cell. This thesis seeks to understand better the gas dispersion characteristics in mechanical flotation cells with a view to optimisation, modelling, cell comparison and selection. The main aim of this thesis was to measure comprehensively the gas dispersion characteristics in a mechanical flotation cell, analyse the behaviour in the entire volume of the cell, and develop a methodology for modelling the gas dispersion characteristics in the whole volume of the cell as well as develop the models themselves. For this purpose, a fully instrumented 3 m&#179; glass rectangular flotation cell at the Julius Kruttschnitt Mineral Research Centre (JKMRC) at the University of Queensland was used. The cell was fitted with a Dorr-Oliver impeller-stator mechanism and was provided with facilities to change impeller speed and gas flow rate. Sensors to measure the gas dispersion characteristics were also acquired and modified. This cell could only be operated in a two-phase (air-water) system but the opportunity was taken to make some comparative measurements in an operating plant in a three-phase slurry to compare the gas dispersion characteristics in two and three-phase systems. The comprehensive measurements of the gas dispersion characteristics (i.e. bubble size, gas hold-up, and superficial gas velocity, with subsequent calculation of bubble surface area flux) throughout the entire volume of the 3 m&#179; rectangular flotation cell show that the properties do vary with distance from the impeller, the cell bottom, and the walls. Statistical analysis to test the homogeneity of the properties in the cell confirmed that the differences (variation with distance) were real. It was found that the gas dispersion was poor in the corners of a rectangular flotation cell. These corners are referred to as dead zones. It can be interpreted that in these zones, flotation is less effective compared to other zones in a cell. The results of mapping the gas dispersion characteristics throughout the entire volume of the flotation cell were used to determine the best location to measure gas dispersion characteristics in a flotation cell in order to represent the overall values. It was established that this location in a flotation cell is about halfway between the impeller and the wall, and halfway between the bottom of the flotation cell and the pulp-froth interface. Statistical analysis also showed that there is &#147;quarter symmetry&#148;, i.e. there is no significant difference between equivalent positions in different quarters in a horizontal plane. In any future work, therefore, measurements of the gas dispersion characteristics need only be made in one quarter, and symmetry in the rest of the cell can be assumed. Following from the statistical analysis that established quarter symmetry in the 3 m&#179; glass rectangular flotation cell, a methodology to model gas dispersion characteristics in the entire volume of a rectangular mechanical flotation cell was developed, based on an experimental design known as CCRD (central composite rotatable design) which then modified. Using the methodology, models to predict bubble size, gas hold-up, superficial gas velocity and bubble surface area flux in the entire volume of a rectangular flotation cell were developed as a function of air flow rate and impeller speed. The validity of the models was tested using a predictive (cross) validation method, from where it was concluded that the models were valid. These models were then used to analyse the gas dispersion characteristics in detail in the flotation cell, as a function of flow rate, impeller speed, and location in the cell. Finally, a comparison of gas dispersion characteristics in two and three-phase systems in flotation cells was made. Comprehensive measurements of gas dispersion characteristics were performed in a three-phase slurry in an industrial OK 38 m&#179; rectangular flotation cell at the PT Freeport Indonesia concentrator, and the results were compared to those measured previously in the two-phase system in the 3 m&#179; rectangular cell. It was found that the profiles of gas dispersion were generally similar in both cells but the magnitude of the gas dispersion properties differed between the two systems. The presence of solid particles had greater effect on the bubble size than on gas hold-up and superficial gas velocity.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">290702 Mineral Processing</field><field name="subject">640300 First Stage Treatment of Ores and Minerals</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158265</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Entanglement, geometry and quantum computation</field><field name="creator">Dowling, Mark</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses a number of problems within the emerging field of quantum information science. Quantum information science can be said to encompass the more-established disciplines of quantum computation and quantum information, as well as rather more recent attempts to apply concepts, tools and techniques from these disciplines to gain greater understanding of quantum systems in general. The role of entanglement &#151; non-classical correlation &#151; has been of particular interest to date. Part I contributes to this later goal. In particular, we establish a connection between the energy of a many-body quantum system and the idea of an entanglement witness from the theory of mixed-state entanglement. This connection allows mathematical results about entanglement witnesses to be translated into physical results about many-body quantum systems, specifically energy and temperature thresholds for entanglement. For the case of two qubits we are able to establish fairly detailed results about the behaviour of entanglement with temperature. We also study entanglement in systems of indistinguishable particles, where even the question of which quantum states should be regarded as entangled has been the subject of much controversy. We aim to clarify this issue by applying Wiseman and Vaccaro&#146;s notion of entanglement of particles to a number of wellunderstood model systems. We discuss the advantages of the entanglement of particles approach compared with other methods in common use. Finally, we study the operational meaning of superselection rules in quantum physics, in particular the connection to the existence or not of an appropriate reference frame. We propose an experiment that aims to exhibit a coherent superposition of an atom and a molecule, apparently in violation of the commonly-accepted particle-number superselection rule. This result sheds light on the entanglement of particles approach to entanglement of indistinguishable particles. Part II returns to a fundamental question at the heart of quantum computation and quantum information, namely: how many quantum gates are required to perform a particular quantum computation? In other words, how efficiently can a quantum computer solve a particular computational problem? We establish a connection between this question and the field of Riemannian geometry. Intuitively, optimal quantum circuits correspond to &#147;free-falling&#148; along the shortest path between two points in a curved space. This opens up the possibility of using Riemannian geometry to study quantum computation, a possibility that was previously unknown. We provide explicit calculations of all the basic geometric quantities associated with the space, and give some preliminary results of applying geometric ideas to quantum computing. Finally, we explore more generally the connection between optimal control and quantum circuit complexity, of which the Riemannian metric described above can be viewed as a special case.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">240301 Atomic and Molecular Physics</field><field name="subject">780102 Physical sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158661</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Small scale quantum algorithms</field><field name="creator">Travaglione, Benjamin Christopher</field><field name="description">It appears, in principle, that the laws of quantum mechanics allow a quantum computer to solve certain mathematical problems more rapidly than can be done using a classical computer. However, in order to build such a quantum computer, a number of technological problems need to be overcome. A stepping stone to this goal is the implementation of relatively simple quantum algorithms using current experimental techniques. The research work presented in this thesis consists of several theoretical studies exploring small scale quantum algorithms and methods of implementing them. Included in this thesis are an investigation of a small scale version of the phase estimation algorithm, methods of implementing the quantum random walk, a discussion of protecting quantum information by encoding it in an oscillator, and a look at the power of a quantum computer with a restricted number of qubits.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">240201 Theoretical Physics</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158745</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A macroscopic chemistry method for the direct simulation of non-equilibrium gas flows</field><field name="creator">Lilley, Charles Ranald</field><field name="description">The macroscopic chemistry method for modelling non-equilibrium reacting gas flows with the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method is developed and tested. In the macroscopic method, the calculation of chemical reactions is decoupled from the DSMC collision routine. The number of reaction events that must be performed in a cell is calculated with macroscopic rate expressions. These expressions use local macroscopic information such as kinetic temperatures and density. The macroscopic method is applied to a symmetrical diatomic gas. For each dissociation event, a single diatom is selected with a probability based on internal energy and is dissociated into two atoms. For each recombination event, two atoms are selected at random and replaced by a single diatom. To account for the dissociation energy, the thermal energies of all particles in the cell are adjusted. The macroscopic method differs from conventional collision-based DSMC chemistry procedures, where reactions are performed as an integral part of the collision routine. The most important advantage offered by the macroscopic method is that it can utilise reaction rates that are any function of the macroscopic flow conditions. It therefore allows DSMC chemistry calculations to be performed using rate expressions for which no conventional chemistry model may exist. Given the accuracy and flexibility of the macroscopic method, it has significant potential for modelling reacting non-equilibrium gas flows. The macroscopic method is tested by performing DSMC calculations and comparing the results to those obtained using conventional DSMC chemistry models and experimental data. The macroscopic method gives density profiles in good agreement with experimental data in the chemical relaxation region downstream of a strong shock. Within the shock where strongly non-equilibrium conditions prevail, the macroscopic method provides good agreement with a conventional chemistry model. For the flow over a blunt axisymmetric cylinder, which also exhibits strongly non-equilibrium conditions, the macroscopic method also gives reasonable agreement with conventional chemistry models. The ability of the macroscopic method to utilise any rate expression is demonstrated by using a two-temperature rate model that accounts for dissociation-vibration coupling effects that are important in non-equilibrium reacting flows. Relative to the case without dissociation-vibration coupling, the macroscopic method with the two-temperature model gives reduced dissociation rates in vibrationally cold flows, as expected. Also, for the blunt cylinder flow, the two-temperature model gives reduced surface heat fluxes, as expected. The macroscopic method is also tested with a number density dependent form of the equilibrium constant. For zero-dimensional chemical relaxation, the resulting relaxation histories are in good agreement with those provided by an exact Runge-Kutta solution of the relaxation behaviour. Reviews of basic DSMC procedures and conventional DSMC chemistry models are also given. A method for obtaining the variable hard sphere parameters for collisions between particles of different species is given. Borgnakke-Larsen schemes for modelling internal energy exchange are examined in detail. Both continuous rotational and quantised vibrational energy modes are considered. Detailed derivations of viscosity and collision rate expressions for the generalised hard sphere model of Hassan and Hash [Phys. Fluids 5, 738 (1993)] and the modified version of Macrossan and Lilley [J. Thermophys. Heat Transfer 17, 289 (2003)] are also given.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">291899 Interdisciplinary Engineering not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">780102 Physical sciences</field><field name="subject">DSMC</field><field name="subject">rarefied gas dynamics</field><field name="subject">computational fluid dynamics</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158022</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of mental time travel</field><field name="creator">Busby, Janie Amber</field><field name="description">Adults can mentally relive experiences from their past and anticipate possible future events, a process called mental time travel (MTT). Recently, several theorists have argued that the ability to mentally travel through time may not emerge until 3- to 5-years of age. This proposal is based on evidence from a wide range of research, including investigations into children&#146;s recall, planning and differentiation of the times of events in the past and the future. However, as yet there has been no dedicated effort to find out how and when MTT develops. The current series of studies brought together a wide range of resources with the aim of designing a series of novel paradigms to measure aspects of MTT development between 3- and 5-years of age. The first of these novel approaches asked children to report events that occurred to them &#147;yesterday&#148; and would occur to them &#147;tomorrow&#148;, revealing that by 4- to 5-years of age most children could accurately do so. Another series of studies examined children&#146;s ability to anticipate a different, future situation, finding that only by 4- to 5-years did children&#146;s behaviour reflect differences in an anticipated future environment. Subsequent studies focusing on children&#146;s discrimination of past and future also suggested that by 4- to 5-years children could distinguish the different causal impact of past and future events on the present. Another task revealed that during the preschool years children become better at differentiating the times of events from throughout their own lifespan. These new data provide support for the claim that the ability to mentally travel into one&#146;s own past and future emerges during the preschool years. This thesis describes the first directed investigation into the development of MTT as a whole, bringing together much of the empirical and theoretical literature for the first time. The tasks designed are new approaches to investigating MTT and represent a starting point for future research. This thesis also introduces and discusses theories for the development of MTT, aiming to stimulate discussion not just of when it emerges, but how, and what processes may underlie the transition.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">389900 Other Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences</field><field name="subject">780108 Behavioural and cognitive sciences</field><field name="subject">mental time travel</field><field name="subject">cognitive development</field><field name="subject">children</field><field name="subject">episodic memory</field><field name="subject">episodic future thinking</field><field name="subject">time</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158045</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Selective transport of attached particles across the froth phase</field><field name="creator">Seaman, David Richard</field><field name="description">Over many years, researchers in the field of flotation have developed an in-depth understanding of processes occurring in the pulp phase of flotation machines. Until recently, however, the froth phase has received little attention. The froth phase serves to separate bubble-particle aggregates from suspended slurry in a flotation cell. The mechanism of recovery by entrainment, its relationship to water recovery and particle size dependency is well understood. Froth recovery, (the fraction of particles entering the concentrate launder that entered the froth phase attached to air bubbles), is not well understood. Up until now, there has been doubt over whether this property is dependent on particle size and hydrophobicity. Difficulties in measuring froth recovery had previously prevented researchers from gaining a deeper understanding of the transport of attached particles across the froth phase. A novel device was designed and tested to measure froth recovery by isolating bubble-particle aggregates in the pulp-phase of flotation machines through the determination of the bubble loading in the pulp phase (mass of particles attached per unit volume of air bubbles). This technique can be used with other measurements to investigate froth selectivity by directly comparing these captured particles to those found in the froth phase. Evidence was collected at Red Dog Mine, Alaska and Newmont Golden Grove Operations, Western Australia which showed that the froth phase selectively transported more hydrophobic and smaller sized particles across the froth than less hydrophobic and larger particles. Particles collected in the device were compared to those found in the concentrate stream on a size by mineral by liberation class. Froth recovery was also calculated on a size by mineral by liberation class for two valuable sulphide minerals in a continuous 3m&#179; flotation cell. These results show that the froth phase is responsible for the upgrading of attached particles across the froth phase as well as for the separation of bubble-particle aggregates from suspended slurry. The pulp phase is responsible for creating bubble-particle aggregates through the attachment of hdyrophobic mineral particles to air bubbles. Many complex factors affect the extent to which this occurs including the size and hdyrophobicity of the particles, the size and number of air bubbles produced by the flotation machine, the rate of collisions between particles and bubbles and the overall chemistry of the system. This measurement of bubble loading presents an opportunity to measure the impact of all these factors on the successful creation of bubble-particle aggregates. Based on a literature review suggesting that there was a high probability of particles being detached at the pulp-froth interface due to the aggregates change in momentum, a three phase description of a flotation cell was proposed. The three phases were: pulp, pulp-froth interface and upper froth zones. A second froth recovery measurement technique (changing froth depth) was used in combination with the bubble load technique to determine the recovery across each of the two froth zones. It was found that the pulp-froth interface appears to be responsible for the selectivity observed across the froth phase as a whole. These findings will enable more in-depth research into the sub-process of the froth phase as well as assisting flotation cell design through a better understanding of the roles of the pulp-froth interface and the upper froth region.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">290702 Mineral Processing</field><field name="subject">640300 First Stage Treatment of Ores and Minerals</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158293</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sensory processing and classroom emotional, behavioural and educational outcomes in children with autism spectrum disorder</field><field name="creator">Ashburner, Jill</field><field name="description">Many occupational therapists recommend adaptations to school tasks and classroom environments to accommodate the atypical sensory processing of students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), on the assumption that sensory processing impacts on classroom emotional, behavioural and educational outcomes. The purpose of this study was to explore the rationale underpinning this practice. Specifically, the first aim was to determine whether or not children with ASD differ significantly from typically developing children with regard to sensory processing. The second aim was to provide descriptive information about the nature and prevalence of atypical sensory processing in children with ASD. The third aim was to explore associations between the sensory processing patterns and classroom emotional, behavioural and educational outcomes in children with ASD and typically developing children. This study employed a matched case-control design. To control for differences in teaching styles, classroom environments and educational programs, two typically developing children were selected as controls from each of the classes of thirty students with ASD aged between 6 and 10 years. Twenty-eight children with ASD and fifty-one age- and gender-matched typically developing children were included in the final analysis. The children were all included in mainstream classrooms and were screened using the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test to ensure that their estimated IQ was within the average range. Sensory processing was measured using the Short Sensory Profile. Other independent variables that may have impacted on classroom emotional, behavioural and educational outcomes included symptoms of ASD, IQ and classroom environmental factors. Symptoms of ASD were measured using the Gilliam Asperger Disorder Scale and Gilliam Autism Rating Scale. The Kaufmann Brief Intelligence Test was used as an estimate of IQ, as well as for screening purposes. The investigator recorded observations of the sensory aspects of each classroom environment, including estimates of visual clutter, crowding and background noise. The dependent variables, which included classroom emotional regulation, behaviour regulation (e.g., compliance, attention and social behaviours) and educational outcomes, were measured using two teacher questionnaires: the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment Teacher Report Form and the Conners&#146; Teacher Report Form Revised &#150; Long Form. No significant differences were found between the two groups with respect to IQ or age in months, suggesting that the two groups were well matched. Observations of the classroom environments revealed high levels of background noise, visual clutter and unpredictable tactile input. The majority of the typically developing children achieved scores at or near ceiling level on both the measures of classroom emotional and behavioural outcomes and sensory processing. This suggested that most of these children processed sensory input in a typical way and were coping well with the emotional, behavioural and academic demands of school. No significant relationships were found between the measures of sensory processing and classroom emotional, behavioural and educational outcomes in the typically developing children. The teachers rated the children with ASD as demonstrating significantly more difficulties with attention, emotional and behaviour regulation and social skills and significantly poorer academic performance than the controls. The Short Sensory Profile scores suggested a high prevalence of atypical sensory processing in the children with ASD. There were highly significant group differences on all of the Short Sensory Profile scores (p &gt; .001), with the exception of the Short Sensory Profile score: Movement Sensitivity (p = .016). Multiple regression analysis suggested that the Short Sensory Profile scores: Under-responsive/Seeks Sensation and Auditory Filtering accounted for 47% of the variance in academic performance as measured by the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment Teacher Report Form. As estimated intelligence and autistic symptoms were not predictors in this multiple regression model, these specific sensory processing difficulties appeared to contribute significantly to academic underachievement. The Short Sensory Profile Score: Auditory Filtering was also associated with inattention as measured by the Conners&#146; Teacher Report Form. An association between Short Sensory Profile Score: Auditory Filtering and social problems as measured by the Conners&#146; Teacher Report Form approached significance (p = .019). Auditory filtering difficulties therefore appeared to be highly problematic for the children with ASD and likely to be exacerbated by high levels of background noise in classrooms. Multiple regression analysis suggested that the Short Sensory Profile scores for Tactile Sensitivity and Auditory Filtering accounted for 36% of the variance in the score for Conners&#146; Teacher Report Form score for inattention. The Short Sensory Profile score for Tactile Sensitivity accounted for 22% of the variance in a Conners&#146; Teacher Report Form measure of the combined symptoms of ADHD (including inattention and hyperactivity). The Short Sensory Profile score: Movement Sensitivity accounted for 22% in the Conners&#146; Teacher Report Form score for oppositional behaviours. An association between Short Sensory Profile Score: Tactile Sensitivity and oppositional behaviours as measured by the Conners&#146; Teacher Report Form approached significance (p = .015). As atypical sensory processing was found to be associated with difficulties in learning, attention and behaviour regulation at school, sensory processing may need to be considered in the planning of educational programs for students with ASD. The development of effective strategies to accommodate the atypical sensory processing of these students is a priority.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158222</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Models of fault-tolerant quantum computation</field><field name="creator">Dawson, Christopher Malcolm</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with certain theoretical problems that arise naturally in the context of fault-tolerant quantum computation. Fault-tolerance can be defined as the art of building reliable devices from unreliable components, and is of particular importance for quantum computers that aim to precisely control the dynamics of extremely sensitive quantum systems. A model of quantum computation is a specification of the basic building blocks by which a quantum computation is implemented. The best known model is the quantum circuit model, where computations are implemented by means of unitary quantum gates that are applied to two-level quantum systems known as qubits. In a physical implementation of a quantum circuit, the gates and qubits will inevitably be affected by noise. Fault-tolerant quantum circuits are designed to be resilient against the effects of this noise, provided that it is not too strong. Fault-tolerance in the quantum circuit model is well developed thanks to the theory of quantum error-correcting codes. These codes allow for the correction of small numbers of errors introduced by a variety of noise processes. In a fault-tolerant quantum circuit, qubits are replaced with encoded qubits, and quantum gates with encoded gates that are immediately followed by special quantum circuits for error correction. Provided the rate at which errors occur is below a constant threshold value, the accumulation of errors can be checked so that the correct output of the computation correctly determined. The threshold acts as both a measure of how good the design of a quantum circuit is, and also as a target for experimenters aiming to implement quantum circuits. Much current research in quantum computation is aimed at designing quantum circuits that increase the noise threshold, hopefully to the point where it becomes within the reach of experimenters. A fault-tolerant encoded quantum gate must limit the propagation of errors so that the code&#146;s corrective capabilities are not overwhelmed. It is not so easy to design encoded gates that satisfy this property, and to date only a finite handful of such gates are known. In a faulttolerant quantum circuit, all quantum gates must be decomposed or compiled in terms of those that may be implemented fault-tolerantly. In the first part of this thesis, we present two results that may be applied to this problem of gate compilation. The first is a generic method based on the Solovay-Kitaev theorem that may be applied to all quantum gates, but is most effective for those that act on single qubits. We present the Solovay-Kitaev theorem in its simples known form as an algorithm, together with novel constructions that can be used to implement it. Following this we give a two specialized methods for two-qubit gate decomposition, based on the Cartan decomposition of the Lie group SU(4). The cluster-state model of computation is an alternative to the quantum circuit model, and makes use of quantum measurements and highly entangled cluster-states to implement a quantum computation. The fault-tolerant techniques developed for quantum circuits are not immediately applicable in this model, so in order for it to be a realistic candidate for performing computations we prove that such techniques are possible. In the second part of the thesis we prove that constant fault-tolerance thresholds may be achieved in the cluster-state model, and in particular in an adaption to an optical implementation. Following this we design a complete error correction scheme for optical cluster-state computation, and numerically determine the threshold of this model in the face of the dominant noise models likely to affect such an implementation.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">249999 Physical Sciences not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158120</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of bovine colostrum supplementation on immune variables and exercise performance in trained cyclists</field><field name="creator">Shing, Cecilia Mary</field><field name="description">Bovine colostrum is homologous in composition to human colostrum but contains greater concentrations of key bioactive components that contribute directly to growth and immunity. It has been used by humans to treat and prevent enteric pathogens and to promote wound healing and intestinal repair. Moreover, bovine colostrum has been promoted and used by athletes as a supplement to enhance immune function and improve exercise performance. This is despite limited data in support of its value to athletes and the relative absence of strong data that identify mechanisms that could improve exercise performance and immune function. The aim of the three studies that comprise this thesis was therefore to investigate the influence of a bovine colostrum protein concentrate (CPC) on immune variables, hormone concentrations, autonomic activity and exercise performance in highly-trained endurance cyclists. Study one involved monitoring exercise performance and immune variables during an eight week bovine CPC supplementation period, which included five consecutive days of high-intensity training (HIT). Twenty-nine highly-trained male road cyclists completed an initial 40-km time trial (TT40) and were then randomly assigned to either a supplement (n=14, 10 g bovine CPC per day) or placebo group (n=15, 10 g whey protein concentrate per day). Following five weeks of supplementation, the cyclists completed a second TT40 before undertaking five consecutive days of high-intensity training (HIT) that included another TT40. A final TT40 was completed one week following the HIT. Venous blood and saliva samples were collected immediately before and after each TT40, and upper respiratory illness symptoms were recorded over the experimental period. Supplementation with bovine CPC elicited improvements in TT40 performance at the end of the HIT period, when compared to the placebo group, (1.9&#177;2.2%; mean&#177;90% confidence limits) and maintained ventilatory threshold following the HIT (4.6&#177;4.6%).

When compared to the placebo group, bovine CPC supplementation significantly increased pre-exercise serum soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor 1 during the HIT period (p&lt;0.039). Supplementation also suppressed the post-exercise decrease in cytotoxic/suppressor T cells during the HIT period (bovine CPC=- 1.0&#177;2.7%, placebo=-9.2&#177;2.8%; mean&#177;SE, p=0.017) and during the following week (bovine CPC=1.4&#177;2.9%, placebo=-8.2&#177;2.8%, p=0.004). In addition, bovine CPC supplementation prevented a post-exercise decrease in serum IgG2 concentration at the end of the HIT period (bovine CPC=4.8&#177;6.8%, p=0.88; placebo=-9.7&#177;6.9%, p=0.013) and there was a trend towards reduced incidence of upper respiratory illness symptoms in the bovine CPC group (p=0.055). Study one demonstrated that low dose bovine CPC supplementation elicited improvements in TT40 performance during a HIT period and maintained ventilatory threshold following five consecutive days of HIT. Supplementation was also found to modulate immune variables during normal training and following an acute period of intense exercise, which may have contributed to the trend toward reduced upper respiratory illness in the bovine CPC group. The maintenance of performance, prevention of post-exercise suppression of IgG2 and cytotoxic/suppressor T cells and increase in anti-inflammatory serum soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor 1 suggest that bovine CPC supplementation is beneficial to cyclists during a period of high-intensity training. The aim of Study two was to investigate the hormonal, immune and autonomic responses of competitive cyclists over a five-day stage race following eight weeks of bovine CPC supplementation. Ten highly-trained male road cyclists were randomly assigned to a placebo (n=6, 10 g whey protein concentrate/day) or bovine CPC group (n=4, 10 g bovine CPC/day). Cyclists provided a baseline saliva sample before commencing supplementation that culminated in a five day competitive cycle race. The cyclists provided daily saliva samples and heart rate variability (HRV) was measured on each day of the race. A Profile of Mood States questionnaire was completed on days one, three and five of the race and cyclists recorded upper respiratory illness symptoms throughout the experimental period. While there was no influence of bovine CPC on salivary IgA, supplementation maintained testosterone concentrations over the competition period (p&lt;0.05) and prevented a decrease in parasympathetic activity (p&lt;0.05). There was also a trend towards improved mood state (p=0.06) in the bovine CPC group. These data indicate that bovine CPC supplementation may prevent disturbances in autonomic function and the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis associated with consecutive days of cycle racing The aim of study three was to assess whether bovine CPC would directly stimulate cytokine production of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), with and without lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and phytohemagglutinin (PHA) stimulation. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was added to cell cultures as a potent enhancer of monocyte and macrophage cytokine release and a model of exercise stress. Phytohemagglutinin was added to PBMC to stimulate T cell proliferation. Blood was sampled from four healthy, male endurance cyclists who had abstained from exercise for 48 hours. PBMC were separated and cultured with bovine CPC concentrations of 0 (control), 1.25, 2.5 and 5% with and without LPS (3&#181;g&#183;mL-1) and PHA (2.5&#181;g&#183;mL-1). Cell supernatants were collected at 6 and 24 hours of culture for the determination of tumour necrosis factor (TNF), interferon (IFN)-y, interleukin (IL)-10, IL-6, IL-4 and IL-2 concentrations. Following six hours of PBMC incubation at 37&#176;C with 5% CO2, IFN-y, IL-10 and IL-2 secretion were increased with increasing concentrations of bovine CPC (p&lt;0.05). In a dose dependent manner, IFN-y and IL-2 remained elevated following 24 hours of incubation (p&lt;0.05). Data from this final study showed that bovine CPC modulates in vitro cytokine production of human PBMC. In conclusion, the present data suggest that bovine CPC supplementation is beneficial to highlytrained cyclists during periods of high-intensity training and competition. Bovine CPC promotes the release of cell mediated cytokines from PBMC and has the potential therefore to influence a number of physiological systems. Supplementation was associated with enhanced recovery over consecutive days of high-intensity training and competition, as evidenced by maintained exercise performance, ventilatory threshold and testosterone concentrations. Bovine CPC modulated immune function, particularly at the end of a HIT period, and there was a trend for reduced incidence of upper respiratory symptoms following bovine CPC supplementation in Study one. The data collectively suggest that bovine CPC supplementation may influence a combination of physiological pathways including the autonomic nervous system and the hypothalamic-pituitary axis.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321401 Exercise Physiology</field><field name="subject">750203 Organised sports</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158236</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stochastic models of election timing</field><field name="creator">Lesmono, Dharma</field><field name="description">Under the democratic systems of government instilled in many sovereign states, the party in government maintains a constitutional right to call an early election. While the constitution states that there is a maximum period between elections, early elections are frequently called. This right to call an early election gives the government a control to maximize its remaining life in power. The optimal control for the government is found by locating an exercise boundary that indicates whether or not a premature election should be called. This problem draws upon the body of literature on optimal stopping problems and stochastic control. Morgan Poll&#146;s two-party-preferred data are used to model the behaviour of the poll process and a mean reverting Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) is fitted to these data. Parameters of this SDE are estimated using the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) Method. Analytic analysis of the SDE for the poll process is given and it will be proven that there is a unique solution to the SDE subject to some conditions. In the first layer, a discrete time model is developed by considering a binary control for the government, viz. calling an early election or not. A comparison between a three-year and a four-year maximum term is also given. A condition when the early exercise option is removed, which leads to a fixed term government such as in the USA is also considered. In the next layer, the possibility for the government to use some control tools that are termed as &#145;boosts&#146; to induce shocks to the opinion polls by making timely policy announcements or economic actions is also considered. These actions will improve the government&#146;s popularity and will have some impacts upon the early-election exercise boundary. An extension is also given by allowing the government to choose the size of its &#145;boosts&#146; to maximize its expected remaining life in power. In the next layer, a continuous time model for this election timing is developed by using a martingale approach and Ito&#146;s Lemma which leads to a problem of solving a partial differential equation (PDE) along with some boundary conditions. Another condition considered is when the government can only call an election and the opposition can apply &#145;boosts&#146; to raise its popularity or just to pull government&#146;s popularity down. The ultimate case analysed is when both the government and the opposition can use &#145;boosts&#146; and the government still has option to call an early election.

Due to the apparent low pathogenicity of ALFV, few studies have previously focused on this virus, therefore, very little is known about it. This thesis aims to improve our understanding of this virus, with the potential of using ALFV, or markers of attenuation discovered within its genome, to develop novel vaccines for use against MVEV, JEV, and even other members of the Flavivirus genus. Previously, nucleotide sequence analysis of a small portion of the genome of ALFV was used to reclassify the virus as a subtype of MVEV. During this project the entire genome of ALFV was sequenced and compared with other members of the genus. Phylogenetic relationships revealed that although ALFV is closely related to MVEV, it is no closer to MVEV than to JEV or to Usutu virus, suggesting that ALFV should not be classed as a subtype of MVEV. Indeed, antigenic studies comparing ALFV, MVEV and JEV, using mAbs produced to MVEV, show a distinct antigenic profile for ALFV. Several unique genetic markers that may affect the virulence of ALFV were observed in the genome. Within the envelope (E) protein, the conserved Nlinked glycosylation motif contained a substitution causing a loss of glycosylation. Also within the E protein, the hinge region, involved in low-pH dependent conformational changes in the protein, also showed several amino acid differences when compared with MVEV and other related viruses. In addition, the highly conserved terminal dinucleotide was deleted. This region is thought to be important for replication of viral RNA. Virulence studies of different strains of ALFV in three-week old Swiss outbred mice also show a different pattern of virulence to MVEV. While MVEV is highly neurovirulent and neuroinvasive in these animals, ALFV exhibits weak neuroinvasiveness, producing very little disease in mice infected intraperitoneally, and producing ALFV-specific antibody only in mice infected with high doses. Even in the highly susceptible IFN-alphaR-/- mice (deficient in the receptor for interferon-alpha), ALFV caused significantly delayed mortality. This data suggests that ALFV is inefficient at replicating in the periphery of these animals. ALFV also exhibited a different tropism to MVEV in vitro, showing significantly reduced replication in Vero cells, a line of African Green Monkey kidney cells that supports efficient replication of all other members of the JEV complex. Binding studies showed that ALFV was able to bind to the surface of these cells, but electroporation of viral RNA directly into the cytoplasm was unable to initiate infection, suggesting inefficient replication or translation of ALFV viral RNA in this cell type. To determine the motifs responsible for these unique phenotypic characteristics of ALFV, three chimeric viruses were engineered based on a previously constructed infectious clone of MVEV. One, containing the structural (prM and E) genes of ALFV in the MVEV backbone, exhibited weak neuroinvasiveness, similar to ALFV, but unlike ALFV, was able to replicate efficiently in Vero cells, and produced ALFVspecific antibody in mice infected with low viral doses. This suggests that the structural genes of ALFV are associated with poor neuroinvasion, but are not responsible for poor extraneural replication in mice, or lack of growth in Vero cells. Another mutant virus was constructed by deleting the terminal dinucleotide in the MVEV infectious clone. This clone spontaneously reverted to the wild type sequence, preventing phenotypic analysis of this mutation. The final chimera contained the nonstructural genes of ALFV with the structural genes and the UTRs of MVEV. Unfortunately, despite several attempts, this clone was unstable in the bacterial host, and insertions or deletions were spontaneously introduced into the genome. Based on phylogenetic, antigenic and virulence data, ALFV is sufficiently different from MVEV to be classified as a separate virus within the genus. Determinants of the low neuroinvasiveness of ALFV have been localized to the structural genes of ALFV, probably within the hinge region of E, and/or due to the lack of glycosylation of the E protein. The cause of the delayed growth in Vero cells was unable to be determined, but is not due to a motif within the structural genes.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270206 Genetic Immunology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158119</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Palynology, sequence stratigraphy, and palaeoenvironments of Middle to Upper Jurassic strata, Bayu-Undan Field, Timor Sea region</field><field name="creator">Mantle, Daniel</field><field name="description">Detailed palynological analysis of 230 core and sidewall core samples from the uppermost Plover, Elang, and lower Frigate formations, Bayu-Undan Field, Timor Sea, reveals the presence of diverse and moderately well preserved palynomorph assemblages (predominantly dinoflagellate cysts, together with acritarchs, spores, and pollen grains) that facilitate biostratigraphic, sequence stratigraphic, and palaeoenvironmental interpretations. The palynomorph assemblages, detailed systematically herein, comprise 96 spore and pollen species, 84 dinoflagellate species, and 15 acritarch species. Of these, the following 14 dinoflagellate cyst species are newly instituted: Ampulladinium aiax, Batiacasphaera macbethiae, Broomea fusticulum, Cauca bayuiana, Egmontodinium elongatum, Ellipsoidictyum fenestellum, Evansia? lacryma, Leberidocysta? strigosus, Leptodinium? ancoralium, Meiourogonyaulax baculata, Nannoceratopsis reticulata, Paragonyaulacysta? feneseptata, P. helbyi, and Yalkalpodinium playfordii. A further five species are not formally named due to a lack of adequately preserved specimens. One genus, Broomea COOKSON&amp;EISENACK, is formally emended. The palynostratigraphic sequence has previously been assessed as latest Bathonian to early Oxfordian in age, based mainly on correlations with European dinoflagellate assemblages dated by ammonite faunas. Ten subzones (TB1-5 and VT1-5) are informally erected, collectively encompassing the Ternia balmei and Voodooia tabulata dinoflagellate cyst Interval Zones. The subzones are defined variously on first and last appearance datums, first and last common occurrences, and species acmes. The acme events are coincident with marine flooding surfaces and enable precise correlation across the Bayu-Undan Field. The Elang Formation &#150; the prime focus of this study &#150; is divided into three third order sequences, each comprising a lowstand, transgressive, and highstand systems tract. These tracts and their delimiting stratal horizons or flooding surfaces possess distinctive palynological or palynodebris assemblages. Qualitative and quantitative variations of these assemblages correlate very closely with gamma-ray log profiles and can be consistently placed within a sequence stratigraphic framework across the Bayu- Undan Field. Palynofacies analyses provide additional means to distinguish among the systems tracts; viz., microphytoplankton diversity increases through transgressive systems tracts to a peak diversity at the maximum flooding surface; atypically brown wood frequencies may also peak at maximum flooding surfaces; and black debris frequencies increase higher in the highstand systems tracts. Palaeoenvironmental interpretations based primarily on palynological assemblages (especially microphytoplankton groupings and palynodebris distribution) provide a means to identify depositional settings in non-cored intervals. For instance, the occurrences of Ternia balmei, the Meiourogonyaulax group, the Ctenidodinium group, and the Rigaudella group represent an approximate gradient from very nearshore to offshore environments or possibly an increase in salinities from euryhaline to stenohaline conditions.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">260113 Palynology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158275</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of early life history stages of the saucer scallop Amusium balloti (Bernardi, 1861) : impacts on the development of hatchery practices</field><field name="creator">Wang, Sizhong</field><field name="description">In the states of Queensland and Western Australia, Australia, the wild fisheries of the saucer scallop, Amusium balloti, have fluctuated greatly in the last 20 years. Despite considerable interest in the cultivation of A. balloti, there have been many factors limiting the development of A. balloti aquaculture or stockenhancement programs. One limitation is access to scallop juveniles, as wild spat collection is difficult for this species. To date, breeding of A. balloti using standard hatchery techniques has had limited success. The overarching objective of this research, therefore, is to understand the early life cycle biology of A. balloti and apply this knowledge to improve hatchery and culture methods and technology. The successful and efficient cultivation of A. balloti from fertilised egg through to juvenile should provide the foundation to develop future aquaculture and stock-enhancement programs. Systematic experimental analysis of different diets and culture water temperatures allowed the identification of conditions that promoted high survival and growth rates of A. balloti larvae. Seven algal species were evaluated as mono-species diets or as combinations over a seven-day trial. As mono-species diets, golden-brown flagellates (Isochrysis aff. galbana (Tiso) and Pavlova lutheri) promoted the highest larval growth and survival compared with other algal diets and the unfed controls. Diatoms (Chaetoceros calcitrans, C. muelleri and Thalassiosira pseudonana) supported reasonable growth and survival, whereas a diatom (Skeletonema costatum) and a green alga (Tetraselmis chuii) were not suitable for A. balloti larvae. Multi-species diets were better than mono-species diets, which supported better larval growth and survival. Of the seven rearing water temperatures tested (14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24 and 26&#176;C), the optimum water temperature range for A. balloti larvae was between 18 and 20&#176;C, where there was 50 to 95% survival and 14 to 23 &#181;m growth in 11 days. These water temperatures were similar to ambient seawater temperatures of the Central Queensland waters during the peak spawning season for this species (July to August). To precisely define settlement competency in A. balloti larvae, and to determine the ideal period to induce settlement and metamorphosis, larval development and growth was characterized cytologically and morphologically. The nervous system development of larvae, postlarvae and newly-settled spat was assessed by detecting serotonin expression using an anti-serotonin antibody. Serotonin expression was first detected in the apical ganglia of two-day old larvae (48 h after fertilization). This expression appeared to be transient and ceased during metamorphosis. In the later (eyespot) larval stage all three major adult ganglia (cerebral, pedal and visceral) expressed serotonin. Based on immunocytochemical staining patterns, these ganglia appeared to progressively assemble throughout metamorphosis and postlarval development. There was no obvious change in the serotonergic nervous system at competency. The development of larvae and postlarvae and newly-settled spat musculature was assessed by phalloidin staining of myofibrillar F-actin. In early D-veligers, the muscular system was well developed, with the present of the anterior adductor, a number of velar retractors (VR) and posterior retractors (PR). With progressive larval growth, the myofibril mass and complexity of VR and PR increased significantly, and new muscles such as mantle retractors, anterior and posterior body retractors, posterior adductor, and foot gradually formed. After metamorphosis, A. balloti lost the VR and PR but retained anterior adductor and other muscles. The foot retractors were developed after metamorphosis. There were no apparent myogenesis events that correlated with competency. While no obvious change in the central nervous system or muscle architecture of A. balloti larvae was detected that correlated with acquisition of competence, it was observed that larval eyespot appearance was closely linked to competency. This might, therefore, be a useful marker to artificially determine when to induce metamorphosis in the hatchery. To improve the speed, synchrony, and survival through metamorphosis, various cues, previously shown to be effective in inducing settlement and metamorphosis in a range of invertebrates, were tested both in terms of efficiency of inducing metamorphosis and for assessing the acquisition of larval competency. The results demonstrated that no settlement substrata tested in this study were effective inducers of settlement and metamorphosis. However, biofilms, 10 and 20 mM KCl-elevated seawater, 10&#150;4 M epinephrine and 10-5 M L-DOPA were effective metamorphosis inducers. Potassium chloride was the most effective (15% to 37% higher than controls). However, higher concentration of KCl (e.g. 40 mM) was toxic to A. balloti larvae. These studies again confirmed that the presence of eyespots was the most reliable and prectical morphological indicator of larval competency in A. balloti. Traditional scallop settlement and nursery systems, which use fibrous substrata to collect larvae, did not promote a high rate of settlement for A. balloti, possibly because of the lack of long-term byssal attachment in A. balloti spat. A downweller screen nursery system was evaluated for settlement of A. balloti larvae and culture of A. balloti spat. Compared to a traditional settlement and nursery system, the downweller screens greatly improved the rate of metamorphosis for A. balloti larvae and the survival of the spat. A mean yield of 57% was achieved in the downweller screens, compared to 3% using a traditional settlement and nursery systems. Continuous aeration enhanced A. balloti larval metamorphosis in the downweller screen nursery system, with a mean spat yield of 50% achieved, compared to 10% using intermittent aeration and 15% with no aeration. Previous reports indicated that A. balloti either lacks the ability to produce byssal threads, or could do so only briefly. As the byssal attachment is crucial to the settlement process in many other scallop species, this was examined in detail. Specifically, it was demonstrated that in the early spat stage, A.balloti does secrete a byssus. The first byssal attachment was detected only after A. balloti developed to spat (indicated by the presence of dissoconch shell). By contrast, the newly-metamorphosed postlarvae crawled over the substratum using their foot, and for immobile postlarvae, byssal attachment was not detected. Although spat remained byssally attached for most of the time, they commonly changed position, moving a mean of 17 mm/day. A gentle water jet and 40&#137; hypersaline bath were effective in detaching spat, with the majority rapidly reattaching. Byssal attachment was shown to persist until the spat reached 4 - 5 mm, around the stage they first develop an ability to swim. Large-scale post-hatchery nursery culture and growout could not be included in this study due to outdoor culture facilities being unavailable. However, a proof of concept trial was conducted to compare juvenile A. balloti growth and survival in suspended culture and bottom culture under laboratory conditions. The results showed that preventing juvenile A. balloti from recessing into the sand (suspended culture) may stress the animals and does affect their growth rate. Also, A. balloti is sensitive to high stocking density. Using photographic images can be a valid method to measure shell size in scallops. These results will provide valuable information to develop a post-hatchery nursery culture technique for A. balloti. Together these data - effects of water temperature and diet on larval growth and survival, identification of the development of larval competency, understanding of external factors controlling settlement and metamorphosis, analysis of postlarval and spat development and behaviour, comparison of suspended cage culture and bottom culture of juveniles and a practical method fro rapid, mass shell measurement - allow for the beginnings of an efficient cultivation system for A. balloti on a commercial scale. The application of this study to stock-enhancement and mariculture programs is discussed, particularly in regard to the further development of culturing A. balloti in Queensland and Western Australian.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">06 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">0704 Fisheries Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158628</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using the floatability characterisation test rig for industrial flotation plant design</field><field name="creator">Coleman, Robert Gerald</field><field name="description">Flotation is the separation process most used to recover valuable minerals from sulphide ores. The design of industrial flotation plants is a complex process involving many stages. Current design practice involves performing laboratory scale grinding and batch flotation tests, followed by a circuit design based on the scale-up of the laboratory kinetics and recovery-grade data. A pilot plant is then operated to evaluate the performance of the circuit based on recovery and grade, usually in the configuration of the intended full-scale plant. The circuit design is refined and economically evaluated after which the design of the full-scale plant is performed. A new approach to full-scale flotation plant design has been proposed by the Julius Kruttschnitt Mineral Research Centre and the Mineral Processing Research Unit of the University of Cape Town, as part of the Australian Minerals Industries Research Association (AMIRA) P9 Project. In this new methodology, the effects of the ore on plant performance are decoupled from the circuit effects. The ore properties are characterised by operating the pilot plant in as simple a configuration as possible. The pilot plant units are configured to perform a similar duty (in terms of mineral content and particle size) to the full-scale operation and their response measured. An important factor in the success of the methodology is having a pilot plant that is capable of accurately characterising the ore properties. For this purpose, the Wemco&#174; Floatability Characterisation Test Rig (FCTR) was built. The FCTR is a self-contained, highly instrumented mobile pilot plant designed to develop and validate the new flotation plant design methodology. The aims of this thesis were to propose, develop and validate a methodology for using the FCTR to design industrial flotation plants. The hypothesis was that full-scale flotation plant design could be accurately performed using the P9 flotation model and modelling and scale-up methodologies, in conjunction with the FCTR. Test work was performed in three main areas: calibration of the ore characteristics and model parameters for the flotation model currently used by the AMIRA P9 Project; validation of the flotation model and modelling methodology; and prediction of full-scale plant performance using parameters determined on the FCTR. The ore floatability characteristics were calibrated using four FCTR circuits of increasing complexity. The ore floatability characteristics were determined for various models derived from data from one, two, three and four calibration circuits. Validation of the flotation model and modelling methodology was performed using three validation methods: internal validity tests, parameter sensitivity tests and predictive validation. From the internal validity tests, some of the models did not meet the validation criteria. The parameter sensitivity tests used Monte Carlo simulations to determine the sensitivity of the regressed model parameters. The tests produced small differences in the values determined from the models and the average values from the Monte Carlo simulations. The floatability characteristics appeared to be stable and unique. Predictive validation was performed using five FCTR circuits, different in configuration to the calibration circuits. The predictive validation was performed using the floatability characteristics determined from each of the calibration models, in conjunction with estimates of the model parameters. Overall, the predictions of the circuit performance were accurate and within experimental standard deviations for most streams in the circuits. The predictions of the key parameters of pentlandite and chalcopyrite recovery were accurate, especially for the final concentrate. The prediction of pyrrhotite recovery produced the largest errors. The prediction of pyrrhotite recovery appeared to be dependent on the addition of depressant to the cleaner and recleaner circuits of the circuit to be predicted. When the depressant addition rates were significantly different from those used in the calibration circuits, the prediction of pyrrhotite recovery was inaccurate. These errors were however reduced when experimental water recovery values were used. The extensive and robust validation of the flotation model and modelling methodology has shown that the flotation model and modelling methodology are valid under certain conditions. This test work represents the first comprehensive validation of the flotation model and modelling methodology incorporating changes in circuit configuration. Using the proposed modelling and scale-up methodology in conjunction with the FCTR, the metallurgical performance of three industrial flotation circuits were predicted. The predicted results were then compared to the experimentally determined results around the industrial circuits. In each case, a scale-up factor between the ore floatability characteristics determined on the FCTR, and the full-scale floatability characteristics, was required to achieve an accurate prediction. The scale-up factor ranged from 0.17 to 0.97 for the case studies investigated. In light of the results from each stage of test work, the proposed flotation plant design methodology was refined. With this methodology and the continual development of techniques for the measurement and prediction of the P9 flotation model parameters, accurate industrial plant design using the FCTR will become possible. With the addition of other unit operations, such as comminution, into the flowsheet, this methodology will eventually lead to the achievement of the ultimate goal of accurate plant design of green-field sites.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">290702 Mineral Processing</field><field name="subject">091404 Mineral Processing/Beneficiation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158278</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Differential gene expression associated with the immune response pathways to oral Candida Albicans infection in IL-12p40 deficient mice</field><field name="creator">Kazoullis, Andrea</field><field name="description">The oral commensal Candida albicans is found in a majority of the human population. Defects in innate and cell-mediated immunity alter the status of the yeast from a commensal to an opportunistic pathogen. One of the most common clinical manifestations of this infection is oro-pharyngeal candidiasis. Previous studies have reported on the establishment of a chronic oro-pharyngeal infection in a mouse model. In this study, investigations were carried out on local and systemic immune responses against oral C. albicans infection using an IL-12p40 cytokine deficient knockout mouse model. Draining lymph nodes (LN) and oral tissues (OT) consisting of tongue, buccal mucosa and palate were isolated from na&#239;ve (Day 0) and infected (Day 6) IL-12p40 knockout and C57BL/6J wildtype mice and analysed using Affymetrix Mouse Genechip MOE430A. Quality control of the samples was carried out using hierarchical clustering. Clustering analysis showed how comparable the duplicates for each group were clustered together. Analysis of the data including data mining tool (DMT) and MAS5.0 was performed to generate reliable and manageable gene lists for the lymph nodes and oral tissues, and of highly expressed genes that could be verified using traditional molecular methods. Identification of differentially expressed genes using statistical (t-test and ANOVA with Benjamini-Hochberg correction, p&lt;0.05) and non-statistical (Fold Change &gt; 1.5) tools highlighted substantially greater numbers of differentially expressed genes in the knockout mice with respect to strain and/or disease. Further analysis of this data, limited to the immune response pathways, showed that CD4 antigen was downregulated in the infected knockout mice compared to the infected wildtype mice. The CD8&#945; antigen was also down-regulated in the infected knockout mice compared to the infected wildtype mice. Within the oral tissues, genes expressing proteins such as &#946;-defensin 4 and triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (Trem1) were down-regulated in the infected knockout mice compared to the infected wildtype mice. The glycoprotein osteopontin was up-regulated in the oral tissues in the na&#239;ve knockout mice and to a lesser extent in the infected knockout mice. Confirmation of the microarray data was undertaken using real time quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction qRT-PCR for the selected immune response genes in the lymph nodes and oral tissues. Real time qRT-PCR data confirmed the differential expression of nominated genes obtained from the microarray analysis.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">320899 Dentistry not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">730112 Oro-dental and disorders</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158229</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of urban growth in the process of impoverishment of campesinos&#8217; households living in peri-urban areas: a case study in Mexico City</field><field name="creator">Mendez de Martinez, Yadira Mireya</field><field name="description">In the last 50 years, Mexico, like many other countries in Latin America, Asia and Africa, has experienced accelerated urban growth. Urban growth has been accompanied by an increase in urban poverty. While the spatial distribution of poverty in urban areas in Mexico is varied, new settlements that tend to grow in the peri-urban hinterland of cities are largely associated with poverty. This is because inexpensive, but mostly illegal, agricultural land (ejido or private) has been alienated to satisfy the demands of low income population for housing. The focus of this study lay in the Metropolitan Area of Mexico City (MAMC), which is the habitat of diverse low-income groups. Among those groups are the campesinos (people with rural background engaged totally or partially in agricultural livelihoods). Some studies have suggested that campesinos are very vulnerable to urban growth, since population expansion has put severe pressure on their agricultural land, which, despite its marginal value, is used to produce crops for either semi-commercialisation or subsistence. Although such research has showed how poor campesinos have engaged in non-agricultural activities to make a living and how land and their communities are threatened by urban growth due to speculative pressures on land and/or environmental deterioration, little is known about the impact of urban growth in the process of impoverishment of campesinos living in peri-urban areas. This study aims to understand how the growth of the MAMC affects poverty in campesinos&#146; households, in order to recommend directions for poverty reduction. Three villages in Chalco municipality, which is situated in the peri-urban fringe of Mexico City, were selected as the study area. Based on the development of a conceptual framework, this study considered three interconnected elements underpinning poverty: multi-dimensionality, complexity and dynamism. For this reason, the Sustainable Livelihoods approach was selected as an analytical tool, as it provided a flexible analytical framework that encompasses all those elements. The study is divided in three stages. In the first stage (namely documental investigation), a series of published and unpublished written materials were reviewed to determine how the growth of the MAMC transformed the nature and availability of resources in Chalco municipality from 1970 to 2000. This stage was followed by the empirical investigation that aimed to examine how those transformations affected campesinos&#146; assets (human, natural, physical, productive and social), the strategies they used to adapt to such changes, and how they perceived changes in poverty status. Accordingly, for this stage, quantitative and qualitative longitudinal and cross-sectional data were collected from 110 campesinos&#146; households living in the study area in 1997 and 2003 by using structured questionnaires. Qualitative data were also collected by using semi-structured interviews from 34 campesinos&#146; households in 2000. The final stage, called recommendations, involved the synthesis of the results of the documental and empirical investigations and suggests a series of directions for poverty reduction in campesinsos&#146; households in the study area. The documental and empirical investigations revealed that changes in asset ownership, between 1997 to 2003, depended on both transformation in the nature and availability of resources in Chalco and intra-household organization. Fundamental transformations in socio-demographic, economic, natural, physical and political/organisational resources of Chalco municipality were mainly, but not exclusively, associated with the growth of the MAMC. Climatic and physical characteristics of Chalco were also evident. To respond to such changes, campesinos implemented a series of strategies to get access to resources. Such strategies were based on campesinos&#146; needs, priorities and the portfolio of assets available, and their functionality. It was clear that campesinos depleted some existing assets to acquire urban assets and preserve their rural assets. In some instances, such strategies led campesinos&#146; families to satisfy their basic needs and, therefore, perceive themselves as non-poor. However, in other instances, such strategies prevented families from meeting their needs, leading them to the perception of being poor. The recommendation was made that in order to reduce poverty among campesinos in the study area, it was necessary to identify different alternatives to support their urban and rural assets and certain of their strategies that improve the wellbeing of individuals, families and communities and mitigate constraints to meeting their goals.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="subject">Poverty</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158594</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In/visibility: Women looking at men's bodies in and through contemporary Australian women's fiction</field><field name="creator">Bode, Katherine</field><field name="description">Masculinity is an increasingly prominent and important issue in debates within feminism, literary studies and visual theory. This study intervenes in and contributes to such debates by analysing an emerging group of Australian women&#146;s fictions (published between 1998 and 2002) which focus on male characters and, in particular, on the description and narrative potential of their bodies. The majority of these texts, and the ones that are explored in this thesis &#150; namely, Jillian Watkinson&#146;s The Architect, Georgia Blain&#146;s The Blind Eye, Mireille Juchau&#146;s Machines for Feeling, Fiona Capp&#146;s Last of the Sane Days, Sarah Myles&#146;s Transplanted and Wendy Scarfe&#146;s Miranda &#150; share two preoccupations. Firstly, male characters bodies&#146; are almost always damaged or suffering in some way; secondly, the ability (or inability) of female characters to look at these bodies is repeatedly foregrounded. I argue that the interactions between male characters&#146; bodies and female characters&#146; gazes function in complex ways both to confirm and to challenge patriarchal constructions of masculinity and male corporeality. Specifically, this occurs in relation to the engagement of each text with popular discourses of feminism and masculinity crisis, discourses that emerge and interact in complex and often contradictory ways in depictions of male visibility and exposure. While my approach is generally feminist, it is also fiction-centred. Thus, I draw on a variety of theoretical perspectives, including literary theory, masculinity studies, visual theory, history, sociology and philosophy, in order to unpack and engage with these contemporary Australian women&#146;s fictions. Paradoxically, one of the main consequences of this fiction-centred approach is a reengagement with and a rethinking of theoretical concepts emerging from psychoanalytic feminist film theory. In a remarkably consistent and explicitly pedagogical way, these fictions explore notions of objectification and dichotomisation, especially as they are elucidated in Laura Mulvey&#146;s analysis of Hollywood narrative cinema. Objectification is overwhelmingly aligned with oppressive power structures and identified as problematic, and the first half of this thesis explores the novels&#146; critiques of this mode of visual interaction. The second half investigates the alternatives to objectification imagined in these fictions. While, upon closer consideration, some of these alternatives recapture male and female characters within traditional patriarchal power relations, others enable a rethinking of both women&#146;s vision and desire, and men&#146;s subjectivity, visibility and desirability.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">420303 Culture, Gender, Sexuality</field><field name="subject">751001 Languages and literature</field><field name="subject">masculinity</field><field name="subject">female gaze</field><field name="subject">men's bodies</field><field name="subject">contemporary Australian women's fiction</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158036</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On hamilton cycles and manilton cycle decompositions of graphs based on groups</field><field name="creator">Dean, Matthew Lee Youle</field><field name="description">A Hamilton cycle is a cycle which passes through every vertex of a graph. A Hamilton cycle decomposition of a k-regular graph is defined as the partition of the edge set into Hamilton cycles if k is even, or a partition into Hamilton cycles and a 1-factor, if k is odd. Consequently, for 2-regular or 3-regular graphs, finding a Hamilton cycle decompositon is equilvalent to finding a Hamilton cycle. Two classes of graphs are studies in this thesis and both have significant symmetry. The first class of graphs is the 6-regular circulant graphs. These are a king of Cayley graph. Given a finite group A and a subset S &#8838; A, the Cayley Graph Cay(A,S) is the simple graph with vertex set A and edge set {{a, as}|a &#8712; A, s &#8712; S}. If the group A is cyclic then the graph is called a circulant graph. This thesis proves two results on 6-regular circulant graphs: 1. There is a Hamilton cycle decomposition of every 6-regular circulant graph Cay(Z[subscript n],S) in which S has an element of order n; 2. There is a Hamilton cycle decomposition of every connected 6-regular circulant graph of odd order. The second class of graphs examined in this thesis is a futher generalization of the Generalized Petersen graphs. The Petersen graph is well known as a highly symmetrical graph which does not contain a Hamilton cycle. In 1983 Alspach completely determined which Generalized Petersen graphs contain Hamilton cycles. In this thesis we define a larger class of graphs which includes the Generalized Petersen graphs as a special case. We call this larger class spoked Cayley graphs. We determine which spoked Cayley graphs on Abelian groups are Hamiltonian. As a corollary, we determine which are 1-factorable.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">230101 Mathematical Logic, Set Theory, Lattices And Combinatorics</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158235</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Carbon sequestration in native rainforest tree plantations</field><field name="creator">Richards, Anna Elizabeth</field><field name="description">The recent rapid decline in tropical and subtropical forests and subsequent loss of biodiversity, coupled to the threat posed by climate change, has led to a requirement for sustainable forest systems. Large-scale monocultures supply timber that can no longer be harvested in sufficient quantity from natural forests in subtropical and tropical regions. However, there is a general perception that forest systems need to be managed to provide multiple production and environmental services, including carbon (C) sequestration, restoration of soil fertility, and biodiversity. Overall, traditional plantation monocultures cannot meet all of these new objectives, and native and mixed-species plantations may provide an alternative, when provision of ecosystem services, besides timber, becomes a priority. The objective of this thesis was twofold. Firstly to assess C storage in native rainforest tree (hoop pine, Araucaria cunninghamii) plantations, planted as monocultures in subtropical Australia. Plantations were examined to evaluate their potential as a sustainable forest system for provision of high-value timber products and C sinks. The second objective was to contrast the traditional monoculture system with a multi-species system, and a mixed-species rainforest tree plantation was studied. These systems are receiving substantial attention from private forest growers as they could provide economic benefits, including greater productivity, coupled to biologically desirable outcomes, such as higher biodiversity. The focus of the second objective was to improve the design of mixtures for maximum wood production and C sequestration, so that other ecological benefits could be realised. Subtropical native hoop pine monocultures did not store soil C into long-term storage pools as rapidly as adjacent native rainforest or pastures. In addition, substantial amounts of soil nitrogen were lost from tree plantations, indicating that with current management, these systems may not be sustainable in the long-term. Overall, total C storage, including soil and aboveground biomass C, was higher in tree plantations than pastures highlighting the potential of native tree plantations for C sequestration. The mechanisms behind lower soil C storage of native hoop pine plantations, compared with rainforest and pasture, may be related to differences in soil C stabilization. While native forest and pasture systems stored C within soil aggregates and through organo-mineral interactions, tree plantations did not show a strong aggregate hierarchy and most soil C was associated with mineral-sized particles. Because soil minerals have a limited capacity to adsorb soil organic C, they may limit the C storage capacity of the studied tree plantations. We conclude that changes to management of hoop pine monocultures, such as increasing plant diversity in tree plantations, may create conditions similar to the native forest and promote greater C sequestration in plantation soils by stabilization through both soil aggregation and organomineral interactions. Since traditional monoculture forest production systems may not provide the multiple benefits needed for sustainable forestry, an alternative mixed-species tree plantation was investigated. We examined the dominant paradigm that mixtures of two fast growing species (Grevillea robusta and Elaeocarpus angustifolius) compete for site resources, while mixtures of shade tolerant (Castanospermum australe) and shade intolerant (G. robusta or E. angustifolius) species are complementary. Contrary to predictions, there was evidence for complementary interactions between the fast-growing species in terms of nutrient uptake, nutrient use efficiency and nutrient cycling. Preliminary model simulations of interactions between species for light indicated that G. robusta maintained the highest rates of photosynthesis under different light conditions and may be combined with C. australe and the more light demanding E. angustifolius in mixtures. Overall there was evidence for tree species combinations which could potentially sequester more C, in addition to other benefits including higher biodiversity and improved use of soil resources, in mixed-species plantations. Such knowledge is useful to encourage implementation of these new timber production systems.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300600 Forestry Sciences</field><field name="subject">300803 Natural Resource Management</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158510</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Study of the mechanisms of gravity flow for block caving</field><field name="creator">Castro, Raul Luis</field><field name="description">In block caves, the flow characteristic of the caved rock strongly influences ore recovery and dilution content. Consequently, caved rock flow characteristics plays a fundamental role in determining, at an engineering level, optimal production level layout and draw control practices. Since the first applications of block caving, a significant amount of research has been focused towards an understanding of the flow characteristics of the caved rock. Laubscher&#146;s gravity flow principles for block caving mine design, widely used by the industry, were initially derived in the 1980&#146;s using a combination of sand physical models and observation in the field of the flow of finely fragmented caved rock. Those principles have involved the definition of the geometry of the Isolated Movement Zone (IMZ) and the interaction limit for defining the production level layout. Afterwards, other researchers have continued with sand modelling work confirming and improving on Laubscher&#146;s gravity flow principles. In today&#146;s mining practice, block caving methods are being applied to a range of competence of rock masses and block geometries which have resulted in a wide range of caved rock sizes from fine to very coarse. There is a general concern in the industry about the applicability of the principles of gravity flow derived from sand models to the full range of modern block cave conditions. This has motivated in the last years studies on the mechanisms of flow in coarse caved rock through large physical models and numerical modelling. Physical modelling work in large three dimensional models using gravel as the model media has been very helpful in understanding the location of the extracted material when drawing from a single drawpoint. However, there is still debate on the controlling parameters and mechanisms under isolated draw. Additionally, to date large three dimensional physical modelling has not been conducted to study the mechanisms of draw under multiple drawpoints using coarse fragmented materials. Numerical modelling using both particle flow codes and continuum models has been used to help describe the flow of coarse cohesionless granular materials. Mechanisms of isolated draw and interaction of IMZs as observed in sand models have also been observed in numerical models but those require to be validated through experiments. In this research, the mechanisms of the flow of coarse caved rock were studied by conducting controlled experiments using the largest ever three-dimensional physical model built to date. This research aimed mainly to investigate the mechanics of flow in both isolated and multiple drawpoint draw and to incorporate those observations into a cellular automata numerical approach to simulate flow. Previous to the experimental work, the physical modelling conditions were defined by means of an analysis of similitude based and on a benchmark study of block caving practices. Experimental studies of the mechanisms of isolated draw showed that the main controlling parameters that define the geometry of the IMZ are the mass drawn and the column height. The influence of other parameters such as particle size and drawpoint dimensions were varied but showed not to have a statistical major role in determining flow behaviour under the experimental conditions. Detailed modelling of the experimental data along with stress measurements during draw were used to describe the mechanisms controlling the evolution of the geometry of the isolated movement zone. Experiments were conducted to study the mechanisms of mass flow and the limit of interaction under multiple drawpoints using different drawpoint configurations. The results indicated that when the distance between drawpoints was such that IMZs overlap mass flow was initiated under concurrent (ideal) draw. When the distance between drawpoints was such that IMZ did not overlap, vertical stresses in the unmoved zone increased. However, movement zones between adjacent drawpoints only interacted when the distance between drawpoints was smaller than that of the IMZ&#146;s width. Stress data in the large physical model also showed that at model conditions there was significant stress arching expected to occur in a confined granular material. Analysis of vertical stresses and material characteristics in previous sand models were conducted which indicated an absence of stress arching and the use of weak under shear material conditions that could have induced failure of unmoved areas between IMZs. In the current mining design criterion, interaction is the main mechanisms to justify the spacing of drawpoints at up to 1.5 wIMZ. The current research and those from sand models suggest that interaction is a function of stresses and material shear strength characteristics (friction angle and cohesion). These conditions characteristics under full scale are not well understood. This suggest that it essential to investigate in-situ and induced stresses during flow and caved rock shear strength characteristics if interaction is to be used as part of the design criterion in block caving mines. Advanced numerical models using results of this research may be an avenue of investigating the observed behaviour in the physical model but under full scale conditions. The observed flow patterns in coarse granular material were used as a basis for the proposal of a new Cellular Automata Flow Simulator (CAFS). This solution showed to be able to represent the movement and extraction zone observed in the experiments and to give good prediction of the extraction and movement zone geometries even for the draw of several drawpoints in just a few minutes. Calibration and evaluations of CAFS were conducted showing that when properly adjusted the numerical approach was able to capture in qualitative and quantitative ways the flow pattern observed in the experiments.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">840299 Primary Mining and Extraction of Mineral Resources not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">091405 Mining Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158447</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Practising self-determination: Participation in planning and local governance in discrete indigenous settlements</field><field name="creator">Moran, Mark F.</field><field name="description">The principle and policy of self-determination holds that Aboriginal people should have the right to pursue a lifestyle of their choosing and to have control over their interactions with the wider society. Self-determination policy has been in place at a federal level since the 1970&#146;s, yet after thirty years of implementation, there is considerable disarray and disagreement over its merits. This study investigated the transactions of decision-makers as they practised two of the main policy instruments of self-determination: participatory planning and self-governance. The research settings were Mapoon and Kowanyama, two discrete Indigenous settlements on the West Coast of Cape York Peninsula, in the state of Queensland, northern Australia. Three typologies for settlements, planning, and organisations were established, which gave the context for the study, as well as a basis from which to generalise findings. From the types of planning in practice, a participatory plan at Mapoon was singled out for further study since it specifically recreated the language of self-determination. The Mapoon Plan was found to be successful technically, but it fell short of its stated social development goals. Planning proved to be a highly politicised and idealised activity, brokered by external consultants. The complex interplay among knowledge, ideology and politics, as observed, could not be described in terms of two separate domains, but rather in terms of intercultural production across an interethnic field. The anthropological literature tended to treat Aboriginal polities as cultural isolates, situated within administrative vacuums. To progress the study, it became necessary to apply a functional and administrative rationality to what needed to be done in practice. Twenty case studies of decision-making forums were analysed in the main research setting of Kowanyama. Each involved the contemporary practice of self-determination, as local decision-makers engaged with the wider society. In the majority of cases, all six proposed factors were found to be necessary, but not sufficient, for success: (1) participation, (2) technical expertise, (3) negotiation, (4) institutional capacity, (5) focal driver, and (6) jurisdictional devolution. A typology of actors was established to define the different decision-makers involved. Of the 600 adults in Kowanyama, only 30 were found to be actively involved in decision-making. This was unexpectedly low given the quantity of government activity purporting to further Kowanyama&#146;s self-determination. Six determinants were found to influence the level of participation: efficacy in practice, jurisdictional devolution, representativeness, function, informality, language and motivation. In particular, form followed function, whereby the function of a decision-making forum decided the level of participation that was appropriate. Contrary to accounts in the anthropological literature, the study found a fledgling system of representation in Kowanyama, complete with informal &#145;extra-constitutional&#146; checks and balances. Factions were a powerful aspect of Kowanyama society, but they did not monopolise politics. The local polity was better conceptualised in terms of its political pluralism, encompassing a complex array of balancing and competing interests. Significantly, constituents were beginning to exert local political influence over their leaders. The analysis found that notions of &#145;community control,&#146; as promulgated in the community development literature, were not adequate to explain the intercultural production underway. The full spectrum of participation was relevant to the actors of governance, from political activism to ambivalent apathy. Community control was found in the absence of government interventions, imbedded within informal institutions and cultural norms. Yet, introduced political structures, including Councils, were no less a part of the local political arena. The notion of governance better encapsulated the array of decision-making activities and actors occurring across a broad range of institutional positions. The study documented multiple dilemmas and indeterminacies as actors practised self-determination in the interethnic field, especially the interplay between local and external ideologies and knowledge. All of the examples of political innovation in the contemporary history of governance in Kowanyama involved productive social contexts developing locally between leaders and trusted outsiders. The complexity of problems and their solutions were only revealed through practice, one step at a time. Successful initiatives in Kowanyama were to a degree inadvertent; it was not until the end that actors understood what they had done right or wrong. Significantly, political innovation occurred in practice, often without any active intervention by government. Ironically, one of the greatest obstacles limiting local capacity was the size of the task of administering the programs of self-determination. An accepted role for leaders and employees was radical action to manipulate the system and to create the institutional space to permit the subjects of self-determination to participate. The analysis suggested that the importance assigned to government policy, legislation, and structure has fallen out of balance with their actual practice. Rather than fixating on policy solutions to self-determination, policy-makers should be focusing more on creating an enabling framework for practice. The six success factors proven in the study give the basis for such a framework.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310101 Architecture</field><field name="subject">780107 Studies in human society</field><field name="subject">governance</field><field name="subject">participatory planning</field><field name="subject">indigenous settlements</field><field name="subject">community development</field><field name="subject">Mapoon</field><field name="subject">Kowanyama</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158053</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ecology of individual specimens Acanthaster planci in low density populations</field><field name="creator">Souter, David William</field><field name="description">This is the first long-term study of A. planci based on repeated observations of recaptured specimens living in three low density populations at Lady Musgrave Island Reef, Heron Island Reef and One Tree Island Reef, situated in the southern Great Barrier Reef. This study describes the growth of adult specimens, their dietary preferences, their feeding rates and their movements over periods ranging from days to more than three years. These data enable the ecology and life history strategy of A. planci in low density populations to be examined in detail for the first time. In addition, the results of this study enable a true comparison of the behaviour of individuals in low density populations with those maintained in the laboratory or comprising outbreaking populations in order to assess the applicability of previously held hypotheses, notions and beliefs concerning this starfish. The mean density of starfish at each reef ranged between 93.7 starfish&#183;km-2 at Heron Island Reef and 535.7 starfish&#183;km-2 at Lady Musgrave Island Reef and was well below that ascribed to outbreaking populations. Each population exhibited adult-dominated, uni-modal size frequency distributions with starfish ranging in size from 27 cm to 59 cm in total diameter. The mean size of starfish sampled within each population did not change significantly over the duration of the study and was 41.9 cm, 44.5 cm and 50.9 cm at Heron Island, One Tree Island and Lady Musgrave Island Reefs respectively. These results indicate that both adult mortality and recruitment within low density populations was low and/or unpredictable. The growth of 59 starfish ranging in size from 28 cm to 59 cm in total diameter and recaptured between 1 and 5 times, was recorded over periods ranging between 65 and 1252 days. The growth of these individuals was extremely plastic with the rates of change in size between encounters ranging between &#150;9.2 mm&#183;month-1 and 18.4 mm&#183;month-1 demonstrating that, in the field, A. planci normally exhibit periods of significant growth and shrinkage, which are interspersed with periods of stasis. Several starfish maintained rapid growth beyond 45 cm in total diameter and many demonstrated that specimens of A. planci have the capacity to grow significantly throughout their entire size range. Although the rate of growth tends to decline with increasing size, many of these starfish maintained large sizes for the duration of the study. This study showed that in habitats where food is not limiting, specimens of A. planci exhibit plastic asymptotic growth where the maximum size of a starfish is likely to be constrained by morphometry and physiological demands, but sub-maximal asymptotes can be temporarily imposed by the various environmental conditions experienced throughout the life of an individual starfish, particularly food availability. The achievement of large body sizes increases fecundity and confers greater resilience to predation and to periods of food limitation. Phenotypically plastic growth enhances the survival and fitness of individuals by allowing them to accommodate changes in environmental conditions throughout their lives. The mean coral consumption of each of 14 recaptured starfish at Lady Musgrave Island Reef ranged between 0 cm2&#183;day-1 and 974 cm2&#183;day-1, while at One Tree Island Reef the feeding rates of 20 starfish ranged between 4 cm2&#183;day-1and 570 cm2&#183;day-1. The majority of individuals did not show significant changes in their feeding rates between encounters or between seasons, although the great variation in the amounts of coral eaten by these starfish each day might have obscured any clear seasonal changes in the feeding rates of these starfish. At Lady Musgrave Island Reef, significant variation in the feeding rates of different individuals was recorded during 2 of 4 field trips and also within both summer and winter. Some of this variation can be attributed to the fact that larger starfish generally consumed more coral than smaller starfish at both reefs. The remaining variation was attributed to differences in the composition of the coral community within the specific habitats occupied by different starfish. Starfish occupying habitats in which preferred corals were abundant generally consumed a smaller area of coral per day suggesting that the return per unit effort foraging on preferred corals is greater, thus increasing the survival and fitness of individuals by reducing the time spent foraging and exposed to predators. The dietary preferences of 43 individuals were investigated. The diets of 10 of these starfish were recorded on multiple occasions. Twenty-four genera of scleractinian coral were recorded in the diet of these starfish. When eaten, Acropora and Seriatopora were universally preferred, while Stylophora was usually preferred and Porites was generally not preferred. Although regularly preyed upon, Montipora was often consumed in similar proportions to its availability. Pocillopora was more acceptable to individuals at One Tree Island Reef than at Lady Musgrave Island Reef and not preferred by any starfish investigated at Heron Island Reef. The dietary preferences of those starfish observed repeatedly did not change significantly between field trips or seasons. Significant variation in preferences between individuals examined during the same trip was uncommon at Lady Musgrave Island Reef and Heron Island Reef but occurred during each field trip conducted at One Tree Island Reef. These results indicate that A. planci does exhibit a hierarchy of preferences for various corals but the stability of this hierarchy is moderated by the dietary experience of the individual and the availability of preferred coral genera, such that when preferred corals, particularly Acropora, are abundant, there is little variation in preferences between individuals or within individuals over time. As the abundance of preferred corals declines, starfish consume a broader range of corals. The foraging behaviour of A. planci is consistent with a time minimising strategy and appears to conform to the predictions of optimal foraging theory. The mean daily displacement of individuals sampled ranged between 0 m&#183;day-1 and 6.8 m&#183;day-1 at Lady Musgrave Island Reef and between 0.2 m&#183;day-1 and 4 m&#183;day-1 at One Tree Island Reef. At both reefs, most starfish did not exhibit significant variation in their daily displacements between field trips or between seasons, but the daily displacements of different individuals varied significantly within 6 of the 7 field trips conducted, and also within summer and winter. Individuals occupying habitats with greater cover of live hard coral tended to exhibit smaller daily displacements. &#145;Homing&#146; to a refuge was common among starfish at Lady Musgrave Island Reef but rare in starfish at One Tree Island Reef. No relationship between starfish size and daily displacement or &#145;homing&#146; frequency was found at either reef. The mean daily displacement of the population sampled at Lady Musgrave Island Reef was significantly greater during summer than during winter, but such seasonal variation was not apparent within the population at One Tree Island Reef. The mean daily displacement of all starfish sampled at One Tree Island Reef was significantly greater than those sampled at Lady Musgrave Island Reef. The daily movements of A. planci in populations of low density are highly plastic and appear to be influenced by the abundance of preferred corals providing food, predation pressure and the cover of live hard coral providing suitable refuges. Over periods ranging between 140 days and 1249 days, individual starfish were relatively stationary. The mean rate of displacement between encounters for 41 starfish recaptured at Lady Musgrave Island Reef was 70.6 m&#183;year-1 and was 43.9 m&#183;year-1 for the 8 starfish recaptured at One Tree Island Reef. At Lady Musgrave Island Reef, almost 30% of recaptures occurred within 10 m of an individual&#146;s last recorded position and overall, greater than 85% of all recaptures occurred within 100 m. The furthest any starfish moved from its point of initial capture was 330 m in 734 days. Starfish that had traversed sandy habitats exhibited greater changes in displacement compared with those that had travelled across coral. Starfish located on reef slopes tended to navigate directional paths, which prevented retracing ground already covered, while the direction of movement of starfish located on reticulated or isolated patch reefs was more random. These results show that specimens of A. planci in populations of low density do not undergo long migrations and could potentially live their entire life within a small area of reef. A. planci demonstrate plastic phenotypic responses in growth and foraging behaviour to varying environmental conditions experienced throughout their life. These characteristics have evolved to counteract unpredictable recruitment while living in low densities by promoting survival and longevity of individual starfish. This allows A. planci to adopt an iteroparous strategy which enhances the fitness of individuals by enabling them adapt the level of reproductive effort to prevailing environmental conditions. Because the life history strategy of A. planci has evolved to ensure survival and longevity of individual starfish, the appearance and persistence of outbreaks is an inevitable consequence of circumstances that facilitate greater than usual fertilisation success. Identifying the mechanisms that might produce &#145;unnaturally&#146; high fertilisation success will be important in determining the causes of primary outbreaks.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158513</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Patterns of development of regeneration of tree species in a subtropical rainforest</field><field name="creator">Song, Guo-Zhang Michael</field><field name="description">Factors relating to seedling establishment and the effects of selective logging on regeneration were investigated in a subtropical rainforest in south east Queensland, to determine the regeneration patterns of tree species. Along a 200m long and 0.5m wide transect, litter movement and accumulation were studied. Although litter movement was detected in every month, the total amount of litter accumulated varied slightly during the present study, due to the comparable amount of litter moved out and moved in. A larger amount of litter movement was observed with a smaller probability of occurrence. In terms of frequency, a biotic agent (the foraging behaviour of vertebrates) and abiotic agents (rain, wind and topography) respectively contributed to half of the movement of litter on the ground. Nevertheless, in terms of mean amount of litter being moved in every event, vertebrates moved significantly more litter than did abiotic agents. The understorey vegetation of this forest was dominated by a fern species ( Lastreopsis decomposita ) with a canopy height of 30-40cm. Lower light transmittance accompanied higher fern cover. The probability of being disturbed by vertebrates and covered by litter was significantly lower under the fern canopy than at the edge of fern canopy or in habitats without fern cover. The frequency of vertebrate disturbance and the amount of litter being moved in decreased as the extent of fern cover increased. In the 100 m2 transect area, even though mean growth rate of seedlings was positively correlated with light availability of habitats, over 70% of seedlings did not grow at all to their death or the end of the two-year study. Herbivory caused the largest proportion of seedling mortality (28.2%), followed by litter cover due to abiotic disturbance (27.8%), uprooting (15.4%), water stress (13.0%), vertebrate-induced litter cover (7.9%), pathogens (5.8%) and unknown agents (1.9%). Animals (herbivory, uprooting and vertebrate-induced litter cover) were responsible for more than half of seedling mortality. The effects of several factors on seedling survival were evaluated with survival analysis. The effects of herbivory, litter cover, light intensity, and litter thickness on seedling survival were not significant. Higher survival rates of seedlings were associated with greater initial height, older age and lower frequency of vertebrate disturbance. Due to a high risk of succumbing to animal disturbance, seedlings of three shrub species with woody or hard shoot structures had higher survival rates than did seedlings of canopy tree species. Understorey vegetation significantly reduced light availability and the risk of being damaged by vertebrate disturbance and litter cover. The negative effects of lower light availability were outweighed by the positive effects associated with reduced stress due to litter cover and vertebrate disturbance. As a result, seedlings in habitats with higher coverage of understorey vegetation had higher survival percentages. The 40-year vegetation records of an unlogged and a logged forest stand were compared. The selective logging operation in 1961 reduced species richness by 36.1%, the number of stems &gt;= 6m in height by 60.1% and stem basal area in the community by 62.7%. Species richness and the number of stems recovered in ten years, and the vertical structure recovered in 40 years. Nonetheless, due to the removal of large DBH trees, it is predicted that the pre-logging basal area will not be regained within 20 to 60 years. Early successional species contributed a higher proportion of stems and basal area in the logged than in the unlogged plot. Forty years after logging, there was no significant difference in ground level light availability between the two plots, which was attributed to the dense understorey in the logged plot. For the first 30 years after logging, most individuals markedly grew faster in the logged than the unlogged plot, but in the last ten years, the situation of growth was reversed. This change was attributed to the marked reduction in growth of the smaller trees in the very dense understorey of the logged plot. The seedling study suggested there were two principal modes of regeneration establishment. Shrub species with low fecundity established seedling pools with high survivorship as a result of having woodier plant bodies. High fecundity is necessary for the establishment of seedlings of canopy tree species due to their non-durable characteristics. The study of the logging plots showed that different requirements for regeneration environments between early successional species and later successional species. Large-scale disturbances are needed for regeneration of early successional species, whilst later successional species can regenerate in smaller gaps. The prevailing natural disturbances which mainly create small canopy gaps will unilaterally facilitate the regeneration of the later successional species.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158539</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular studies on the neuroendocrine regulation of pubertal development in grey mullet, Mugil Cephalus</field><field name="creator">Nocillado, Josephine N.</field><field name="description">This research project was designed to advance our understanding of the molecular regulation of pubertal development in a late maturing fish, using the grey mullet as model species.

The muCyp19a promoter sequence contained consensus TATA box and putative &#189;ERE, SF-1, AhR/Arnt, PR and GATA sites. The muCyp19b promoter sequence revealed consensus TATA and CCAAT boxes and putative PR, ERE and &#189;ERE, SP-1, GATA C/EBP, GRE, NFkappaB, STAT, PPAR/RXR, Ahr/Arnt and CRE sites. As in the mudrd2 gene promoter, the functionality of muCyp19a and muCyp19b gene promoters, observed in COS-7, HT3 and TE671 cell lines, pointed to the transcriptional roles of the putative regulatory elements identified on the promoter sequences. Additionally, for the muCyp19b gene, negative vi modulation of promoter activity by quinpirole, a DA D2-receptor type agonist, was observed. The gene expression profile of muGPR54, muGnRH1, muGnRH2 and muGnRH3, mudrd2, muCyp19a and muCyp19b genes in pubertal fish revealed their functional relevance during sexual maturation. The significantly high relative expression levels of muGPR54, muGnRH1, muGnRH2 and muGnRH3 genes in the brain at the early stage of puberty (defined by low GSI, no apparent oocyte development and low, but detectable, plasma vitellogenin) pointed to a coordinated stimulatory role of these genes at the beginning of puberty. Data also suggested that muGnRH1 has the gonadotrophic role. In contrast to the expression profiles observed in the brain, expression levels of muGPR54 and muGnRH1 in the ovary were high at the advanced stage of puberty (characterised by high GSI, yolky oocytes and high plasma vitellogenin), suggesting a role of these genes towards sustaining gonadal development. The high expression levels of mudrd2 in the brain at the early stage of puberty and in the pituitary at both the early and intermediate stages, which correspond to a period of pronounced DA inhibition of reproductive function in grey mullet, indicated the role of mudrd2 in mediating the inhibitory effect of DA. Ovarian expression of muCyp19a and brain expression of muCyp19b increased during pubertal development, which implied the functional relevance of E2 biosynthesis to the pubertal process in those tissues. In conclusion, the results provide evidence that the molecular regulation of pubertal development in female grey mullet is contingent upon the functional integration of the regulatory signals coming from a suite of genes, including, at least, the genes characterised in the present study. The molecular tools obtained and the understanding achieved from the present research work provide basis for further investigations dealing with the manipulation of puberty in late maturing species of fish.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158370</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Expression and promoter analysis of Glycine max nodule autoregulation receptor kinase gene</field><field name="creator">Nontachaiyapoom, Sureeporn</field><field name="description">Legume-rhizobia symbioses contribute at least 20% of the biosphere's supply of reactive nitrogen. These unique associations rely on the exchange of specific molecular signals between nitrogen-fixing soil bacteria, collectively called rhizobia, and their host plants and, with few exceptions, result in the formation of root nodules, which provide an environment suitable for nitrogen fixation. However, nitrogen fixation is energetically expensive and nodule proliferation, in much the same manner as the proliferation of other meristems in plants, must be controlled in order to attain equilibrium between cell proliferation and differentiation. Nodule proliferation is controlled primarily and systemically by autoregulation of nodulation (AON). A gene central to this process was first isolated by map-based cloning from soybean (Glycine max) and was named G. max Nodule Autoregulation Receptor Kinase (GmNARK) in accordance with its biochemical and physiological functions. Expression patterns of GmNARK have been described by several investigators; however, these reports were based on either non-quantitative methods or a limited number of tissue types. More importantly, the expression domains of GmNARK were completely unknown. The study described in this thesis utilised techniques such as quantitative RT-PCR (QRTPCR), transcription start site mapping, promoter-reporter gene fusion, and promoter deletion, to analyse the expression levels and domains of GmNARK across a variety of tissues as well as identify the promoter elements that are responsible for the basal and tissue-specific expression of GmNARK. In addition, the promoter activity of GmNARK was also compared with that of Lotus japonicus HAR1, the GmNARK orthologue, in both homologous and heterologous transformation systems. Based on QRT-PCR, GmNARK was expressed to varying levels throughout the plant; the transcript was detected at high levels in mature leaves and roots but to a lesser extent in young leaves, shoot tips and nodules. The transcript level was not significantly affected by Bradyrhizobium japonicum during the first week following inoculation. Histochemical analysis of L. japonicus plants carrying either a 1.7 kb GmNARK promoter or 2.0 kb LjHAR1 promoter fused to a beta-glucuronidase reporter gene localised GUS activity to living cells within vascular bundles, especially phloem cells in leaves, stems, roots, and nodules. Phloem-specific expression was also detected in soybean hairy roots carrying these constructs. These results suggested that both cis- and trans-acting elements required for the transcriptional regulation of these orthologous genes are likely to be conserved. In contrast, 1.7 kb of the GmNARK promoter did not drive phloem-specific expression in Arabidopsis thaliana, indicating the absence of the trans-acting elements required for the tissue-specificity of GmNARK in this distantly related species. The comparison of 2.0 kb of promoter sequences of GmNARK, LjHAR1 and Medicago truncatula SUNN, another GmNARK orthologue, using bioinformatics and computational approaches indicated several highly conserved motifs including a putative negative regulatory region (NRR), which was previously reported to repress gene expression in non-phloem cell types. Deletion analysis of the GmNARK promoter, however, ruled out the possibility that this motif, found at -308 bp with respect to the translation start site, was truly functional and located the region controlling phloem-specific expression to DNA sequence between 908 bp and 1.7 kb upstream of the start codon. Two other candidate regions were identified by Multiple EM for Motif Elicitation (MEME). These regions, namely MEME3 and MEME4 showed strong sequence similarity to the corresponding regions of the LjHAR1 promoter. Interestingly, the MEME3 motif was also found in the MtSUNN promoter at a similar location to that of LjHAR1. Potential NRRs in the LjHAR1 and MtSUNN promoters were found in the MEME3 motifs, whereas only a variant form of a NRR in the GmNARK promoter was found in this region. Additionally, an identical semi-palindromic sequence was also observed in the MEME3 motifs of the three orthologous promoters. Based on these findings, the semi-palindromic sequence and the variant form of the NRR are proposed to be positive and negative regulatory elements for the phloem-specific expression of GmNARK, respectively. The computational approaches also identified two potential TATA elements in the GmNARK promoter. Rapid amplification of 5' cDNA ends and promoter deletion analysis have confirmed that they were functional. The two TATA elements in GmNARK promoter appeared to cooperatively direct transcription of GmNARK, but either was adequate for basal transcription. The finding that the expression of AON receptor-like kinase genes is phloem-specific has contributed to a better understanding of AON signalling pathways. The QRT-PCR study and the discovery of cis-acting regulatory regions have also provided crucial information on the transcriptional regulation of GmNARK as well as plant genes in general. Additionally, the promoters of GmNARK and LjHAR1 could potentially be used to drive phloem-specific expression in legume biotechnology research.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300203 Plant Improvement (Selection, Breeding and Genetic Engineering)</field><field name="subject">legumes</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158587</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparative ecophysiology of Graptophyllum species in Australia</field><field name="creator">Le, Buu Thach</field><field name="description">Ecophysiological attributes could be causes for rarity in plants. We tested the hypothesis that a species&#146; ability to regulate photosynthesis and growth in response to environmental factors is indicative of its environmental resilience and that this is linked to its conservation status. In this study, the ecophysiology of Graptophyllum reticulatum, an Australian endangered endemic species, was compared with that of its three closely related and more common congeners G. ilicifolium, G. excelsum and G. spinigerum. Ecophysiological attributes were measured on the four species in their natural habitats and under artificially imposed environmental stresses, including changed soil conditions, excess light and low water availability, in a glasshouse experiment. Photosynthesis was determined at the photosystem II and leaf level using chlorophyll a fluorescence and gas exchange techniques. Applied to the chlorophyll fluorescence transient of leaves, the JIP test provides a Performance Index which quantifies the main steps in PSII photochemistry including light energy absorption, excitation energy trapping, and conversion of excitation energy into electron flow. At the leaf level, gas exchange measurements allow determination of maximum CO2 assimilation rates, intercellular CO2 concentrations, stomatal conductance for water vapour and instantaneous water use efficiency. Growth analysis was performed to assess relative growth rates and physiological and morphological responses. Analysis of physiological differences and responses indicated that, compared to its more common relatives, the endangered G. reticulatum was an intrinsically slow growing species, exhibited the lowest fitness when growing in favorable environments and was most sensitive to excess light stress. Photoinhibition is therefore likely to restrict the endangered species to shade habitats. Compared with the endangered G. reticulatum, the vulnerable G. ilicifolium and common G. spinigerum species were better adapted to high light and changed nutrient levels, but were more susceptible to water stress. The rare G. excelsum had the fastest growth rate and the highest fitness in favorable environments. Based on the ecophysiological attributes examined here, it is proposed that excess light is likely to be the most critical abiotic factor restricting distribution of the endangered species in a fragmented landscape. The survival of the species may be most dependent on the intactness of the habitat over-storey. In contrast, the vulnerable G. ilicifolium showed strong susceptibility to water limitation, and survival might be threatened if climate change alters habitat water relations to cause, for example, more pronounced dry periods. The rare G. excelsum which had highest carbon gain and growth in the experiments carried out in this study, may become the most successful adaptation out of the rainforest environment due to its tolerance to higher light and limited water availability. To examine the generality of the link between rarity and ecophysiology with Graptophyllum species, two dipterocarp species, narrowly endemic Dipterocarpus condorensis and local common Shorea roxburghii that are actually co-located in South-eastern Vietnam were studied. Findings in this case study confirmed the usefulness of the comparative approach based on physiological measurements, either in situ or ex situ, to explain plant rarity. The results of this study indicate ecophysiological research is a tool for examining causes of rarity and possible abiotic threats. The information gained allows assessment of environmental resilience of species and contributes essential knowledge for management and conservation of threatened plants. Such knowledge is also useful for ex situ conservation including propagation, translocation and re-introduction in restoration programs.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270400 Botany</field><field name="subject">270402 Plant Physiology</field><field name="subject">ecophysiology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158670</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An analysis of the underlying biochemical and genetic mechanisms that control gender and fertility in the Kuruma shrimp, Marsupenaeus japonicus (Bate)</field><field name="creator">Sellars, Melony J.</field><field name="description">Centuries of experience with terrestrial agriculture have demonstrated the value of domestication and selective breeding to improve production efficiency, profitability and sustainability. Compared to terrestrial agriculture there are remarkably few aquaculture industries that have progressed beyond the use of wild or unselected genotypes. This presents a major opportunity for the global aquaculture industry to capitalize on the benefits of domestication and selective breeding. However, there is a parallel need to ensure that a balance is achieved between optimizing genetic gains and conserving the biodiversity of the captive and wild stocks from which they are derived. In progressing towards domestication and genetic improvement, one of the key areas of interest includes the factors that control gender and fertility. Gender is of particular interest in species that are sexually dimorphic, with one gender being more attractive from a production point of view. Fertility is of broad interest as a key aspect of reproductive performance. Controlling fertility is also one method of protecting unwanted or unlicensed breeding of elite genotypes and preventing escapees from mating with wild stocks. For most aquacuculture species there is a fundamental lack of knowledge of the underlying biochemical and genetic mechanisms that control gender and fertility. The focus of this study was on developing methods for controlling gender and fertility in the Kuruma shrimp Marsupenaeus japonicus (Bate). This high value species has been farmed for several decades using the progeny of wild broodstock and, more recently, progeny of domesticated, selectively bred captive broodstock. The biological, biochemical and genetic processes that control gender and fertility in M. japonicus are of direct commercial interest and of wider interest to science. Commercial interest is for two reasons: First, M. japonicus are sexually dimorphic with females growing 30% larger than males and second, recent success in the genetic improvement of M. japonicus has prompted farmers to seek ways to protect superior genetic stocks from unlicensed breeding and to prevent escapees from genetically contributing to natural fishery populations. Thus, the knowledge and technology that could permit farmers to cost-effectively produce all-female, sterile stocks could be of significant commercial value. More broadly, research directed towards this goal could provide new insights into the underlying biological, genetic and biochemical processes that control gender and reproduction in penaeid shrimp. Previous studies on inducing sterility have demonstrated that this can result in altered gende r ratios in the target species. Accordingly, the approach adopted in this study was to investigate these traits simultaneously. There were three principal research components in this project, each of which focused on a different approach to achieving gender and/or fertility control in M. japonicus. The three components were; (1) the potential of ploidy manipulation to control gender and fertility; (2) the effect of ionizing radiation on fertility; (3) the potential of genetic engineering to control gender determination and germ cell specification. PLOIDY MANIPULATION Previous research on M. japonicus has shown that triploids produced by preventing polar body (PB) II extrusion are always female and sterile, however, induction rates never result in 100% triploid progeny. Therefore, experiments in the present study focused on developing a technique to produce triploids with a 100% induction rate. As mating of tetraploids and diploids is the only documented technique that has achieved 100% triploids in other cultured species, the present study investigated methods to induce tetraploidy in M. japonicus. First I attempted to prevent the first division in mitosis using temperature and chemical shocks. Second I attempted to inhibit extrusion of PBI and both PBI and II using chemical shocks only. I was successful at stopping the first mitotic division, preventing the extrusion of PBI and preventing the extrusion of both PBI and II in M. japonicus by applying different shocks at different times post-spawning for different durations. Tetraploid M. japonicus embryos were produced by stopping the first division in mitosis, however, they were not viable and did not hatch. The most suitable treatment regime for inducing tetraploidy, giving frequency (number of spawnings induced that result in some polyploids) and induction rate (number of individuals within a spawning induction which are tetraploid or triploid) equal importance, was a 36&#176;C shock administered 23 min post-spawning for a 5 or 10 min duration. Preventing the extrusion of PBI and both PBI and II using 150 &#181;M 6-dimethylaminopurine at 1 to 3 min post-spawning for either a 4 to 5 min duration (timed to stop PBI extrusion) or a 16 min duration (timed to stop both PBI and II extrusion) consistently resulted in the production of viable triploid M. japonicus embryos, which hatched into nauplii. No tetraploids were produced by preventing the extrusion of PBI or both PBI and II. This is the first report of successful PBI, and PBI and II prevention in shrimp, and production of triploids using the reported treatment regimes. These findings indicate that manipulation of the ploidy level may not be suitable for producing 100% all-female, sterile M. japonicus, as all tetraploids produced to-date are not viable and all known triploidy induction techniques never result in 100% triploid progeny. There may, however, be commercial value in utilising the PBI triploidy induction methods of the present study in an attempt to improve productivity as: - PBI triploids are believed to have increased heterozygosisty over PBII triploids and diploids, and possibly better growth performance, and - Stocking of ponds with spawnings that have received shocks to prevent PBI extrusion would result in a greater proportion of females to males (as the frequency of induction is always 100%), therefore resulting in improved farm profit based on greater total harvestable product in terms of weight, and the fact that females attract higher prices per kilogram due to their larger size class. IONIZING RADIATION Ionizing radiation (IR) has been successfully used to prevent reproduction in a wide range of organisms and can be effective at sterilizing 100% of treated individuals. IR also plays a role in producing monosex populations through gynogenesis and androgensis in a range of aquatic species. Despite this, there is no information on the effects of IR on penaeid shrimp reproduction. Experiments in the present study assessed the capacity of IR to confer sexual sterilization in female and male M. japonicus. Initial experiments were focused on optimizing IR dose ranges. For these experiments, harvest age shrimp were treated with 0, 10 or 20 gray (Gy) of IR and their ability to produce viable offspring was assessed by performing rigorous reproductive evaluations. Later experiments assessed the reproductive performance of 10 month old M. japonicus treated with IR at postlarval stage 15 (PL15) (15 days since metamorphosis from mysis to postlarval stage 1). Initially, a lethal dose curve of IR for PL15 M. japonicus was established. Based on these results, PL15 shrimp were treated with IR at 0, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 Gy to examine the effect of IR dose on their reproductive capacity at 10 months of age. IR was found to impair the reproductive performance of M. japonicus when treated at harvest age and when treated as postlarvae and reared to reproductive maturity. IR was, however, not 100% effective at preventing the production of viable offspring at the reported doses. Harvest age male shrimp were more sensitive to IR, being reproductively impaired at 10 Gy as compared to 20 Gy for harvest age females. PL15 females treated with 0 Gy of IR matured and spawned more frequently than PL15 females treated with 10, 15 and 20 Gy of IR. There were, however, no other significant effects of IR observed on M. japonicus reproductive performance when treated at PL15. IR doses higher than 35 Gy resulted in 100% mortality (i.e. lethal dose rate) of PL15 M. japonicus within 30 days after treatment, whilst doses of 25 and 30 Gy significantly reduced postlarval survival compared to controls. From preliminary research, dose rates of 25 Gy or more resulted in 100% mortality of harvest age females, whilst 20 Gy significantly reduced harvest age male survival. These findings indicate that IR doses that do not result in 100% mortality of harvest age and postlarval M. japonicus can reduce their reproductive capacity, however, these doses of IR can not confer 100% sterility. GENETIC ENGINEERING The combined use of molecular biotechnology and genetics to investigate mechanisms of gender and fertility determination in numerous animal phyla has gained increased research attention over the last decade. However, to-date there is only one known penaeid shrimp gene for which the complete coding sequence has been isolated (but not functionally characterized) that is known to be involved in gender and fertility determination of other species. The present study assessed the potential of using genetic engineering methodologies to control gender and fertility of M. japonicus using a multi-step approach. Initially this study attempted to identify one or more candidate genes in M. japonicus that had been previously selected from a comprehensive literature search (sex-lethal, transformer, double-sex and vasa), and subsequently characterize their complete coding sequence. Expression profiles of the isolated genes were then determined throughout embryonic, larval and postlarval development, and in female and male gonad tissue to identify key periods during early development when their expression is naturally up-regulated. Using an RNAi approach, this study then attempted to silence the candidate genes from being expressed during these key developmental periods and assess the resulting loss-of-function genotypes. In addition to these experiments, this study also investigated the suitability of different real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) assay methodologies for the studied diverse morphological sample set (relative vs absolute quantitation) and investigated different methodologies to deliver nucleic acids into shrimp embryos (electroporation vs a polyethylenimine (PEI) transfection reagent). A partial coding sequence for a dsx-like gene homologue, DMRT2, and a complete coding sequence for a PL10 vasa-like gene was isolated from M. japonicus. The PL10 vasa-like gene was named Mjpl10. Both genes were differentially expressed during embryonic, larval and postlarval development, and in female and male gonad. Using absolute qRT-PCR, I demonstrated that dsx-like gene transcripts were present at low levels throughout the first 5 h of embryogenesis after which transcript abundance increased significantly by the time embryos were 6 h old, suggesting a functional role for dsx transcripts at this developmental stage. Expression of the dsx-like gene was consistently high but variable throughout the remainder of embryogenesis and during larval and postlarval development up until PL48 at which point dsx transcripts were no longer detectible. This expression pattern indicated a functional role for the isolated dsx-like gene from 6 h post-spawning until PL30. Transcripts of the dsx-like gene were also detected in testes at low levels and were close to undetectable in the ovary of mature adults. Using absolute qRT- PCR I also demonstrated that Mjpl10 transcripts were present in the first developmental stage sampled (2-cell embryos) onwards, suggesting it is maternally expressed, and continually at low levels throughout embryogenesis. Mjpl10 expression increased significantly in the first 25 h after hatching (nauplii IV) and then decreased in a linear fashion by 316-fold over the next 52 day period. Its continued expression throughout embryonic and larval development is compatible with a conserved role in early germ cell specification. Transcript levels of Mjpl10 were also detected in the ovary and testes of mature adults. To silence expression of the identified candidate genes in vivo, short hairpin RNA (shRNA) DNA expression vectors were constructed that were capable of in vivo transcription of a dsxlike and Mjpl10 shRNA molecule. These shRNA molecules would theoretically trigger the RNAi pathway and result in gene-specific silencing of the target dsx-like gene and Mjpl10 gene transcripts. The white spot syndrome virus immediate early 1 (WSSV IE1) promoter was chosen to drive expression of the shRNA molecules. The WSSV IE1 promoter was initially isolated and cloned into a vector to drive expression of a luciferase mRNA. WSSV IE1 promoter function was found to be &gt;56% as efficient as the Orgyia pseudotsugata (Douglasfir Tussock moth) multicapsid nucleopolyhedrosis virus immediately-early 2 (OpIE2) promoter when compared in Fall Army worm, Spodopterea frugiperda (Sf) 9 insect cell culture. The vector containing the WSSV IE1 promoter was subsequently used to construct three recombinant DNA vectors capable of in vivo expression of a shRNA fragment of either the dsx-like gene, Mjpl10 or a placebo control luciferase gene. Three additional recombinant vectors were constructed with each containing a fragment of either the dsx-like gene, Mjpl10 or luciferase gene (identical to the sense strand of the shRNA fragments) that was inserted behind coding sequence for a green fluorescent protein and before the polyA tail. These three GFP fusion vectors were co-transfected with their corresponding shRNA expression vectors in Sf 9 cell culture. Theoretically mRNAs expressed by the GFP fusion vectors would be silenced and unable to express GFP if the corresponding shRNA expression vector was transcribing shRNA molecules that were capable of cleaving the GFP fusion mRNA polyA tail off the molecule through the RNAi pathway. Using this approach all three shRNA expression vectors constructed in this study were shown to be functional and capable of inducing a gene-specific silencing response in Sf 9 insect cell culture. Relative to a positive control, treatments transfected with the dsx-like shRNA expression vector had a reduced percentage of insect cells expressing GFP (i.e.18.07 &#177; 0.38% and 8.75 &#177; 0.15% compared to 100% in two independent experiments). Treatments transfected with the Mjpl10 shRNA expression vector also had a reduced percentage of cells expressing GFP relative to a positive control (i.e. 14.63 &#177; 0.59% and 9.19 &#177; 0.02% compared to 100% in two independent experiments). Similarly, treatments transfected with the luciferase shRNA expression vector had a reduced percentage of cells expressing GFP relative to a positive control (1.64 &#177; 0.02 and 0.47 &#177; 0.06% compared to 100% in two independent experiments). From these experiments it was evident that the WSSV IE1 promoter was functional, and that the shRNA fragments of the recombinant vectors were being expressed, folding and initiating a specific RNAi response. The three shRNA expressing recombinant DNA vectors and the positive transfection control luciferase mRNA expression vector were transfected into 1-cell M. japonicus embryos using the commercially available jetPEITM transfection reagent. Using qRT-PCR I demonstrated that jetPEITM DNA complexes were successfully transfected into 1-cell embryos as evidenced by the presence of in vivo transcribed exogenous luciferase mRNA in the positive transfection controls. Using qRT-PCR I then demonstrated that the Mjpl10 shRNA molecules were able to induce a small, but significant non-specific gene silencing response in vivo. The number of Mjpl10 mRNA copies detected per ng of total RNA was 14,108 &#177; 1,763 in the control compared to 6,701 &#177; 494 in the placebo shRNA treatment and 8,151 &#177; 1,151 in the genespecific Mjpl10 shRNA treatment. In comparison, the dsx-like shRNA molecules did not result in a non-specific silencing response. No specific gene silencing response was observed for either of the shRNA expression vectors. Given that the Mjpl10 and luciferase shRNA expression vectors were capable of reducing the total number of Mjpl10 mRNAs but no specific gene silencing was observed; the fact that the two endogenous targets, the dsx-like homologue and Mjpl10, are known to be expressed in specific cell types (i.e. the genital ridge and the germ cell lineage respectively) and a measurable gene silencing result would therefore require that large numbers of shRNA be in vivo transcribed in these specific cell types; and that the shRNA expression vectors had been demonstrated to be functional in Sf 9 cell culture, these results indicate that the WSSV IE1 promoter was not strong enough to drive in vivo expression of suitable quantities of shRNA molecules to induce a measurable gene silencing response. Future research should isolate alternative shrimp specific constitutive promoters such as &#946;-actin which are highly active at all life-history stages in the majority of cell types. The use of such promoters instead of the WSSV IE1 promoter would ensure a high level of expression of recombinant DNA vectors that are transfected in vivo. Comparison of the relative and absolute qRT-PCR quantitation approaches revealed significant differences in transcript level profiles between the two procedures for both target genes, the dsx-like gene and Mjpl10. When 18S rRNA was used as a reference, target gene expression was more similar to that of the absolute method than when &#946;-actin was used as a reference. Variability between the relative and absolute procedures occurred for a greater Percentage of the embryonic stages compared to later developmental stages. This study indicates that the use of 18S rRNA or &#946;-actin as reference genes for studying gene expression patterns in M. japonicus embryonic, larval, postlarval and gonad samples will give significantly variable results, and illustrates the proposition that housekeeping genes are not necessarily appropriate references for qRT- PCR data normalization. Until suitable reference genes are characterized, gene expression experiments using the studied M. japonicus tissues of different morphological developmental stages should use absolute quantification procedures. Finally, comparison of electroporation and the polyethylenimine (PEI) transfection reagent procedures demonstrated the jetPEITM transfection reagent was the most suitable means by which to transform 1-cell M. japonicus embryos. Electroporation was not found to be suitable for delivering nucleic acids into 1-cell M. japonicus embryos at quantities greater than what is detectible from nucleic acids attached to the outer embryo surface after DNase or RNase treatment. However, the commercially available jetPEITM transfection reagent was able to deliver nucleic acids into 1-cell M. japonicus embryos when soaked in the transfection media for between 50 min to 4 h post-spawning. Transfection was most successful when complexation was performed for 15 min in a sodium chloride buffer, followed by a 3 to 4 h incubation in sterile seawater prior to the addition of embryos. Greatest transformation rates (as measured by the number of exogenous mRNA template copies per ng of total RNA) were achieved when 1 mL of seawater and embryos were added to complexation mixtures within the first 5 min of spawning.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158613</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Scientists in Conflict: Hans Bethe, Edward Teller and the Shaping of United States Nuclear Weapons Policy, 1945-1972</field><field name="creator">Bird, Jacqueline Maree</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the adversarial roles of nuclear physicists Hans Bethe and Edward Teller as political advisors during the first three decades of the nuclear era and the part each played in the shaping of US nuclear weapons policy. It focuses on four episodes - post-war arms control, the development of the hydrogen bomb, the banning of nuclear weapons testing and the deployment and subsequent banning of a limited system of missile defence, and in each episode, it contrasts the scientists&#146; individual motives, political agendas, means of affecting policy and respective degrees of success. Thereafter, it assesses the pair as Cold War political advisors by considering the validity of their advice as regards the Soviet nuclear program. Whereas a number of scholarly works have been devoted to the political career of Teller, these have typically focused on his role in the hydrogen bomb controversy. In contrast, very little has been written about Bethe&#146;s political role, despite its obvious significance. Interestingly, no work to date has focused specifically on the openly confrontational roles of these two scientific advisors, who remained at the forefront of the decision-making process over nuclear weapons policy for many years. This thesis meets this objective by providing an historical voice to Bethe, a largely overlooked historical figure, while offering fresh insight into Teller, a contentious Cold War character. In doing so, it utilizes a range of recently declassified sources to shed further light on previously documented episodes, such as the hydrogen bomb affair, while chronicling largely untold episodes, including the pair&#146;s involvement in the debate over missile defence. At the same time, it challenges a commonly-held conception that Teller, by utilizing his connections to influential Washington conservatives, was able largely to dictate the course of nuclear policy throughout this period. Indeed, a central contention of this study is that Bethe, by effectively employing both his personal and professional reputation, was able to moderate the influence of his well-placed colleague. Finally, through the use of recently published sources on the Soviet nuclear progam, this study assesses the validity of the political advice of the two scientists, concluding that both men were hindered to a certain extent by the rigidity of their respective positions. Specifically, it argues that Bethe&#146;s advice was characterized by an unduly benign view of Soviet intentions, and Teller&#146;s by an exaggeration of Soviet capabilities.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">430104 History - North American</field><field name="subject">780199 Other</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158344</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The limits of liberal justice: Normative constraints on multicultural policies and indigenous policies in Australia</field><field name="creator">Antal, Ildiko Barbara</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the question of the extent to which theories of citizenship, especially as developed in political liberalism, help to formulate an understanding of cultural diversity in relation to political stability and justice. Taking the recent debates over liberal and communitarian political philosophy as the object of inquiry, it explores the social and political character of multiculturalism and indigenous rights movements in Australia&#146;s political culture. The principal aim is to establish that political liberalism provides appropriate political and ethical norms for adjudicating multicultural and indigenous rights claims. Thus, the exposition is twofold: first the thesis explores the concepts of justice as fairness as expounded in Rawlsian political liberalism. Second it applies the Rawlsian perspective to analyse the implications of multiculturalism and indigenous politics for the Australian liberal state. Interpreted in the light of the problems of contemporary patterns of pluralism, Rawls&#146; theory demonstrates the necessity and desirability of applying justice as fairness to the &#145;special rights&#146; challenges confronting Western liberal states, including Australia.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">430101 History - Australian</field><field name="subject">780199 Other</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158112</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Socio-economic evaluation of forestry development opportunities for Wik people on Cape York Peninsula</field><field name="creator">Venn, Tyron James</field><field name="description">Wik, Wik-Way and Kugu people (Wik people) in Aurukun Shire on Cape York Peninsula (CYP) are among the most socio-economically disadvantaged groups in Australia. While Wik people are presently reliant on government work for welfare programs for income, elders have a vision of economic independence and self-reliance. The large area of native Darwin stringybark (Eucalyptus tetrodonta) forest on traditional Wik land is a potential engine for economic development, which could provide meaningful employment, and contribute to other Wik socio-economic objectives, including facilitating population decentralisation and consolidation of cultural obligations to manage country through provision of on country employment, reducing welfare dependency and expenditure on timber purchases from outside CYP, and increasing income and skill levels in the community. A large proportion of the higher-quality timber resource on traditional Wik land is situated on bauxite mining leases and the current practice is to clear, windrow and burn this timber prior to commencement of mining. A Wik native forest timber industry could make use of this wasted high-quality timber resource. The objectives of this thesis were to: determine the property rights of Wik people to the timber resource on their traditional land; assess whether forestry operations in Darwin stringybark forests in the study area are likely to be financially viable; and generate a suite of optimal timber utilisation strategies for Wik people, subject to cultural, ecological and economic constraints. This required economic research in the areas of indigenous property rights, private and social costs and benefits of forestry, timber markets, and evaluation and application of economic analysis techniques for appraisal of forestry development opportunities. A social cost-benefit analysis of the privately optimal timber utilisation policies has also been performed to support the decision-making of government policy-makers. This research project was a demanding and complex undertaking, not least because the research was being performed in a unique and diverse indigenous cultural environment where there is a need to respect cultural and research ethics protocols, where formal participatory research methods are inappropriate and where gatekeepers are particularly zealous about &#145;protecting&#146; Wik people from &#145;outsiders&#146;. In addition, the property rights of Wik people to timber resources had never previously been analysed methodically, timber inventory and timber market information was lacking for CYP, and there are difficulties in transferring parameter estimates from the industrial hardwood timber industry of Australia to culturally appropriate indigenous operations on CYP. A critical research step was to develop a rapport with Wik people and gain an insight into their forestry objectives, through a number of visits to Aurukun Shire and informal discussions with elders on country. The property rights of Wik people to timber resources have been assessed by reviewing Federal and State Government legislation, court rulings, regional development policies and the Queensland Code of Practice for Native Forest Timber Production on State-owned lands. A timber inventory was conducted over 580,000 ha of Darwin stringybark forest, individual-tree volume and taper models were developed, and a geographical information system was used in estimation of harvestable timber volume and its spatial distribution. To facilitate information transfer to Wik people, expertise was gained in the use of forest visualisation software to pictorially display timber inventory data. A review of literature and discussions with experts identified technically feasible timber processing opportunities for CYP timbers. An informal telephone and in-person survey of 46 businesses, local councils and government agencies in north and south Queensland and the Northern Territory provided market information about CYP timbers. Concepts of a culturally appropriate working week and culturally appropriate rate of production were developed to assist the estimation of cost structures for a Wik timber industry, based on cost estimates for non-indigenous Australian hardwood forestry enterprises that had been obtained from discussion with forestry experts and &#145;grey literature&#146;. Generation and evaluation of a suite of privately optimal timber utilisation strategies for Wik people has been supported by the development of a mixed-integer goal programming (GP) model using the GAMS software package. The social analysis of the privately optimal strategies has been performed by adjusting private net present values (NPV) estimated by the GP model with shadow prices and transfer payments. In particular, a carbon model has been developed to estimate the value of carbon emitted by the Wik timber industry. The GP model analysis suggests that a Wik timber industry can generate a positive financial NPV if seed funding of at least $0.5 M is available. In general, privately optimal forestry strategies for Wik people generated by the GP model utilise relatively low-technology equipment, including portable sawmills and air-drying sheds, and produce undressed timber products such as structural timber. This contrasts strongly with Wik visions of an industry selling mostly unprocessed logs or woodchips and non-indigenous representatives of Wik people favouring the manufacture of high-value strip-flooring and furniture. The social analysis of privately optimal timber utilisation strategies reveals that social NPVs are much higher than financial NPVs, even when accounting for the costs of ecosystem services foregone by logging native forest. The establishment of a culturally appropriate Wik timber industry can be expected to generate net social benefits for Australia.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">720204 Industry policy</field><field name="subject">340213 Economic Development and Growth</field><field name="subject">340202 Environment and Resource Economics</field><field name="subject">communal forestry</field><field name="subject">goal programming</field><field name="subject">Aurukun community</field><field name="subject">native title</field><field name="subject">indigenous land rights</field><field name="subject">native forest management</field><field name="subject">timber markets</field><field name="subject">volume and taper modelling</field><field name="subject">timber inventory</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157984</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Randomised Cluster Study of an Intervention Aimed at Improving the Health Outcomes of Adults with an Intellectual Disability</field><field name="creator">Lennox, Nicholas</field><field name="description" /><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321212 Care for Disabled</field><field name="subject">730301 Health education and promotion</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158390</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transformative Power in Motherwork: A Study of Mothering in the 1950s and 1960s</field><field name="creator">Porter, Marie</field><field name="description">In this thesis I explore the experiences of a group of Australian women who became first-time mothers between 1950 and 1965. I interviewed twenty-four mothers, half of whom were selected as practising Roman Catholics. The other half was AnglicanfProtestant by co-incidence rather than selection. The data in this research have been collected via in-depth, unstructured interviews with the participants. The interviews were taped and transcribed verbatim, before the data were analysed. I present a grounded theory of transformative power in motherwork that has emerged from the analysis of interviews. The mothers talked about what they did in their active mothering years. I argue that despite being constrained by the gender bias in the patriarchal context, these mothers were agents who developed skills that enabled them to resist or creatively deal with the constraints they faced. Their emphasis was on their agency and the power to nurture their children into responsible adults. Their awareness of the importance of their motherwork acted as a motivator in this development. My thesis is that the relationship between each mother and each of her children is a transformative power relationship in which both mother and child are transformedthe child into an independent adult and the mother into a skilled self-motivated agent through her mothenvork. Any threat to this process resulted in the mother doing all she could to resist or counteract the constraintls she was encountering. Transformative power expressed in motherwork can be recognised analytically by several characteristics. It empowers both parties in the motherlchild duality. Complexity, diversity, fluidity, and responsiveness to the physical, intellectual, and emotional aspects of the relationship are all evident in transformative power relationships. Through their own transformation, the mothers saw the falsity of the master narratives of motherhood, prevalent in society in the 1950s and 1960s, which they had believed as inexperienced girls. From their stories about motherwork, I reveal a counter narrative that was portrayed not only in their telling of their stories: but in their discursivelreflexive practices as mothers.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">370104 Urban Sociology and Community Studies</field><field name="subject">440207 Religion and Society</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158105</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The undead : an unnatural history of vampires and troublesome corpses in Western Europe from the medieval period to the twentieth century</field><field name="creator">Keyworth, Gordon David</field><field name="description">In this thesis, I undertake a multi-disciplinary survey and descriptive analysis of vampires and other types of undead-corpse in Europe from the medieval period to the twentieth century. Broadly speaking, the first three chapters of the thesis discuss the typology and folklore of vampires and undead-corpses, and so too the burial practices associated with such revenants. The remaining chapters delve into the etiological explanations for the existence of undead-corpses, the vampire infestations of the eighteenth century, the reasons for declining belief in walking-corpses thereafter, and the increasingly popular notion of astral vampirism in the nineteenth century. In the early eighteenth century, popular belief in the existence of undead-corpses was fuelled by numerous reports of vampire outbreaks across Eastern and Central Europe. In his Treatise on Vampires and Revenants (1746), Augustin Calmet argued that although there may have been troublesome undead-corpses and &#145;vestiges of vampirism&#146; in the past, the vampires of eighteenth-century Europe were inherently unique. In the first chapter of this thesis, I investigate Calmet&#146;s assertion and compare/contrast the distinguishing features of the various types of undead-corpse that supposedly existed in Europe from the medieval period to the Enlightenment, and argue that the outstanding characteristic of eighteenth-century vampires was their implied thirst for blood, and that the vampire is indeed a unique type of undead-corpse. In the second chapter, I assess to what extent undead-corpses like the vampire acquired the characteristics formerly attributed to other folkloric beings. Subsequently, I undertake a folkloric analysis of vampires and undead-corpses in Europe from the twelfth to the eighteenth century and compare/contrast their features with that of other folkloric entities like ghosts, incubi/succubi, witches and fairies. I demonstrate that a distinction can be made between the folkloric vampire and &#145;historical&#146; vampires of the eighteenth century like Arnod Paole. And argue that although medieval revenants were very corporeal beings, subsequent undead-corpses like the spectrum of sixteenth-century Silesia, and so too the vampire of folklore, took on a more semi-corporeal nature, indulged in all manner of supernatural activity and acquired many features formerly attributed to other folkloric beings. In the third chapter, however, I delve into the various burial practices associated with vampires and revenants, the prophylactic measures used against them, and the methods employed to dispatch the undead. I argue that the main reason for impaling vampires with a wooden stake and other such practices was simply to hasten the decomposition of the deceased, given that there was no guarantee that a corpse was actually dead until the flesh had rotted from the bones. In the next chapter, I discuss eschatological notions like Purgatory and excommunication, and argue that by the end of the seventeenth century, three main theological/metaphysical notions had developed to explain the existence of undeadcorpses. Firstly, undead-corpses were inhabited and enlivened by the actual soul of the deceased individual and empowered by some sort of remnant energy or vestigium vitae, which took on a life of their own until the body had decomposed and the remnant energy had dissipated. Secondly, it was the Devil that reanimated the corpse, rather than the deceased soul, in the same manner that the Devil could possess and manipulate a living body. Furthermore, necromancers could raise the dead through sorcery, albeit with demonic help. Thirdly, the Devil could create a semi-corporeal body of congealed air and appear in the guise of someone recently deceased in order to torment the living. I argue that it was the earthbound soul of the deceased that supposedly animated the vampires of the eighteenth-century. In the fifth chapter, I outline the socio-religious topography of the vampire outbreaks in eighteenth-century Europe and discuss the reactions of the Austro-Hungarian authorities, under whose jurisdiction the outbreaks occurred. Similarly, I discuss the response of the intelligentsia and the hierarchy of the Catholic Church, the state religion of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, to the vampire infestations. I demonstrate that official belief in undead-corpses had waned by the Enlightenment, and that the civil authorities were keen to enlighten and re-educate the populace, and initiated official investigations into further outbreaks of vampirism, and introduced legislative measures to eradicate such beliefs. In particular, I review the various natural explanations furnished by the educated elite at the time to account for vampires. I argue that it was difficult for the authorities and educated elite to eradicate belief in undead-corpses largely because the masses and lower echelons of the Church at the time were fuelled by a pre-modern belief-system that had itself promoted belief in revenants. In the final chapters, I note that although the occasional vampire outbreak still arose in nineteenth century Europe and undead-corpses were reputedly responsible for consumption in late nineteenth-century New England (USA), popular belief in walking corpses per se had largely ceased. Nonetheless, the rise of spiritualism, theosophy and popular occultism at the time encouraged a reinterpretation of the traditional vampire and fuelled the notion of &#145;astral&#146; vampires. Finally, I elaborate upon the importance of the vampire to our own lives and note that occasional belief in flesh-and-blood vampires still occurs today, and that a contemporary Vampire subculture has arisen of &#145;living&#146; individuals who claim to be the &#145;real&#146; vampires.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">440207 Religion and Society</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158192</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Secularising the Veil: A Study of Legal and Cultural Issues Arising from the Wearing of the Islamic Headscarf in the 'affaire du foulard' in France.</field><field name="creator">Jones, Pamela Nicolette (Nicky) Louise</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a study of the institutions, forms and manifestations of secularism, or 'la&#239;cit&#233;', in France, in the context of a series of events which came to be called the 'affaire du foulard'. The first incidents in the affaire took place in September 1989 with the expulsion of three primary schoolgirls in Creil, in the north of France, who were insisting on wearing the Islamic headscarf (known in French as the 'foulard') to school. Their actions were deemed contrary to the fundamental Republican principle of secularism in public schools, and the events were reported in several newspapers, before becoming a national controversy in media around the country. In this case, however, it was difficult to know how to interpret and apply la&#239;cit&#233; in the context of a modern public school in the French Republic. The principle of secularism, or la&#239;cit&#233;, is a central tenet of French public policy, and public education in particular. La&#239;cit&#233; also represents a set of social and cultural values which have profound historical resonances for many French people. At the same time, the public schools were unsure of how to negotiate their students&#146; freedom of religious expression, which, according to historical and legislative texts, is protected and upheld by the concept of la&#239;cit&#233;, while also ensuring that the principle of la&#239;cit&#233; was maintained. In a bid to resolve the uncertainty, France&#146;s highest administrative court, the Conseil d&#146;&#201;tat, handed down a legal opinion in November 1989 in which it stated that the wearing of religious signs in public schools was not by itself incompatible with la&#239;cit&#233; in France, although the religious signs could be prohibited in certain circumstances. In addition, various ministerial circulars were issued by successive Education Ministers between 1989 and 1994 to advise schools on how the law was to be interpreted and applied in this matter. One of the circulars, issued in 1994 by Fran&#231;ois Bayrou, encouraged schools to prohibit the wearing of the foulard and to apply strict penalties if Muslim girls continued to wear it. These measures resulted in an increase in the number of Muslim schoolgirls expelled for wearing the foulard, as well as in the numbers of public protests against the expulsions and the circular itself. Some of the schoolgirls and their families appealed against the expulsion decisions, and their cases appeared before France&#146;s administrative courts over the years between 1992 and 1997. My thesis examines the key legal and administrative texts in the affaire du foulard, including the Conseil d&#146;&#201;tat&#146;s 1989 legal opinion and the ministerial circulars, noting the legal implications of successive circulars and the shifts in government policy which they represented. In addition, my thesis analyses the transcripts of many of the legal judgements in the &#147;headscarf&#148; legal cases. These judgements were important not only in deciding the future education of the schoolgirls, but also in clarifying the 1989 opinion. They established a consistent set of principles to define the circumstances in which wearing religious signs such as the foulard was considered compatible or not with la&#239;cit&#233; in public schools. The results of this analysis indicate that, contrary to popular opinion in relation to the affaire du foulard, the majority of cases were decided in the Muslim girls&#146; favour and upheld their right to wear a religious sign such as the Islamic headscarf at school. Recently, however, the legal regime in France governing the wearing of religious signs has changed. In early 2004, a new law on secularism was passed by the French Parliament to prohibit the wearing of the foulard (and indeed all visible religious signs) in public schools. The law has been welcomed by many sectors of the French community, but has also provoked extensive public protests. The passage of the new law does not alter either the analytical work or the conclusions of this thesis. Rather, the thesis offers an insight into the background of the affaire du foulard and thus a more informed appreciation of the potential legal and social consequences of the 2004 law in future years. The principal aim of this thesis is to provide a careful account of the institutions and operation of the principle of secularism, or la&#239;cit&#233;, in France. My research also explains some of the complexities of the legislative regime established by the Conseil d&#146;&#201;tat and the administrative courts, who worked to balance priorities of freedom of religion and la&#239;cit&#233; as well as to protect the education of many expelled Muslim schoolgirls, and in so doing, my thesis highlights the complexity of the principle of la&#239;cit&#233; itself.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">390305 Law and Society</field><field name="subject">780106 Political science and public policy</field><field name="subject">Secular</field><field name="subject">secularism</field><field name="subject">la&#239;cit&#233;</field><field name="subject">France</field><field name="subject">Islamic</field><field name="subject">veil</field><field name="subject">headscarf</field><field name="subject">hijab</field><field name="subject">foulard</field><field name="subject">affaire du foulard</field><field name="subject">secularism law</field><field name="subject">separation of Church and State</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158015</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hydatid infection in macropodids</field><field name="creator">Barnes, Tamsin</field><field name="description">Echinococcus granulosus is thought to have been introduced to Australia at the time of European settlement. Parasite transmission occurs in both a domestic cycle, between sheep and dogs, and a sylvatic cycle, in which many macropodid species and feral pigs serve as intermediate hosts and dingoes as definitive hosts. Infection with the larval stage of the parasite results in the development of hydatid cysts; in macropodids, cysts are usually found in the lungs. Fatalities, primarily due to pulmonary impairment, have been reported in some of the smaller threatened species, and this raises the question whether the parasite is contributing to the decline of these hosts. However, no extensive studies investigating the prevalence, risk factors and pathophysiology of infection in macropodids have been undertaken. The overall aim of this thesis was to determine the potential significance of hydatid infection to small macropodids. In doing so, the prevalence of hydatid infection in both commercially harvested kangaroos and a small, threatened rockwallaby species was estimated. Possible risk factors associated with infection were investigated and attempts made to develop an immunodiagnostic test. The pathology associated with natural infection in kangaroos was described and the pathophysiology following experimental infection of tammar wallabies monitored. The overall prevalence of hydatid infection in 2998 commercially harvested macropodids (predominantly eastern grey kangaroos), from 21 properties in south Queensland, was 2.4%. This survey revealed a marked clustering of hydatid infection by property, with prevalences varying from 0 &#150; 12%. Multilevel models were used to investigate putative risk factors at both kangaroo and property levels. At the kangaroo level, females were twice as likely to be infected as males, but no property level risk factors were identified. A survey was undertaken to establish baseline health data for the threatened brush-tailed rock-wallaby. Thoracic radiography, validated as a diagnostic technique in experimentally infected tammar wallabies, was used to estimate the prevalence of hydatid infection in three wild colonies of this macropodid in south-east Queensland. The overall prevalence was 15.3%, with 20% of adult animals infected. This survey also determined the burdens/prevalence of various endo- and ectoparasites and their xi associations with time of year, age of the animal, its condition and blood values. The seroprevalence of antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii, another parasite that is potentially fatal to macropodids, was 4.7%. As a serological test would be useful as a rapid, convenient means of diagnosis of hydatid infection, attempts were made to modify serodiagnostic tests validated in humans for use in macropodids. Both crude hydatid cyst fluid (HCF) antigens and the recombinant protein, EpC1, were optimized using sera from post-mortem positive and negative animals. HCF antigens had a very low specificity (20.8%) and rEpC1 a very low sensitivity (41.2 &#150; 47.9%), indicating that neither test was suitable for diagnosis of infection in individual macropodids. Post-mortem examinations of the commercially harvested macropodids revealed that all infected animals had cysts in the lung tissue, but two also had cysts in the pleural cavity and one animal had a liver cyst. The number of cysts in infected animals ranged from one to 17, with the majority of animals having one to three cysts. Estimated total cyst volume varied from 0.2 to 1,075cm3. In some animals, cysts resulted in a 55 &#150; 80% loss of functional lung capacity that is likely to have impacted significantly upon respiratory function. The pathophysiology of infection following experimental dosing of captive tammar wallabies with doses of 1000, 2500 and 8000 E. granulosus eggs was monitored for up to 16 months using thoracic radiography and a final post-mortem examination. The infection rate was low (11/33, or 35.5%). The number of cysts per animal varied from one to ten, with the majority (36/40 or 90%) of cysts establishing in the lungs. Cyst development was more rapid than has been reported in sheep, and this pattern was also observed in the naturally infected brush-tailed rock-wallabies. Cyst growth resulted in loss of functional lung capacity, up to an estimated 28% within 14 months of infection. Complications associated with lung cyst development included fatal anaphylaxis, pneumothorax and atelectasis. Seven of the eleven infected tammars died or were euthanased as a result of infection during the experiment. The onset of cyst fertility occurred early, from nine months onwards, compared to previous observations in sheep (2 - 6 years), suggesting that the importance of the sylvatic cycle to the epidemiology of E. granulosus in Australia could be far greater than previously thought. The histology of cysts from experimentally infected tammar wallabies and sheep was compared. Cysts of similar age had a thicker germinal membrane with greater nuclear content and a thicker laminated layer in the tammars. The hostproduced adventitial layer differed; the layer of degenerate collagen prominent in ovine cysts was absent in those from the tammars. These features underlie the rapid cyst growth and early onset of fertility seen in the tammars. Hydatid infection is widespread in macropodids and may be prevalent in colonies of the small threatened species. This thesis has demonstrated that rapid cyst growth results in loss of lung capacity that may have adverse effects on survival within a year of infection. Other potentially serious consequences of infection are also seen. Thus, hydatid infection is an important consideration in the development of conservation management plans for threatened macropodids and further work is required to determine effective control measures.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158611</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transitional Justice and South Africa: jus ad bellum, jus in bello and the promotion of national unity and reconciliation act (34) 1995</field><field name="creator">Castel, Heather Lorraine</field><field name="description">My thesis examines the evolution of the enabling legislation to the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act (34) 1995, through the historical, legal, philosophical and ideological issues that underpinned the Act. Transitional justice is an interregnum characteristic and comprises both accountability and the establishment of a moral society. Historically, the South African government's principal adversary, the African National Congress (ANC) advocated a just, multi-racial and equitable society through leaders such as Pixley ka Isaka Seme, Professor Z.K. Matthews and Chief Albert Luthuli. ANC leaders from 191 2-1 960 were mission educated and regarded segregation as the antithesis of their strong Christian principles and in opposition to Gospel values. They advocated the reformation of South African society through passive resistance and the attainment of the franchise. After the 1960 Sharpeville massacre and the entrenchment of "grand apartheid", the ANC adopted the armed struggle while the state committed numerous gross human rights violations to maintain apartheid. While exiled, the ANC established its just war claims with a meritorious cause, its jus ad bellum. By 1990 a settlement was negotiated between the principal adversaries. The interregnum was characterised by violence, commissions of inquiry and various requests for indemnification/amnesty. The ANC's just war claims were eroded with allegations of atrocities in its military camps that severely undermined its claims to the moral high-ground. Its poor conduct of the armed struggle, its jus in bello, was confirmed in various subsequent reports. The ANC's decisive election victory of April 1994 provided the Congress with an opportunity to structure transitional justice through the enabling legislation to the TRC on its own terms and prove through the self-incriminating evidence that emerged at the TRC hearings that apartheid was a crime against humanity and that the armed struggle was a just war with a meritorious jus ad bellum.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">430111 History - Other</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158109</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Handwriting of eight year old children with and without autistic spectrum disorder</field><field name="creator">Cartmill, Linda Joan</field><field name="description">Anecdotally it was found that Queensland occupational therapists reported a surprisingly high referral rate for handwriting problems amongst school aged children with Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD). A subsequent review of the literature revealed a number of anecdotal reports of disordered handwriting in this population but limited research in the area. This thesis presents a descriptive and exploratory study of the nature of handwriting in eight year old children with and without ASD. Issues of handwriting development and motor learning are canvassed followed by an examination of concepts of motor control. Next follows a review of current handwriting models. The Systems Model of Handwriting was proposed as a response to the evidence for both dynamic and motor programme aspects of handwriting. Using this model as an organizing structure, the literature on ASD and handwriting was then examined which led to the framing of three research questions: 1. Is the handwriting speed of children with ASD significantly different from that of children without ASD? 2. Is the handwriting legibility of children with ASD significantly different from that of children without ASD? 3. At what stage/s of the Sequential Handwriting Process, is the handwriting of children with ASD different from that of children without ASD? Twenty-eight eight year old children with ASD and a matched control group of twentyeight comparison children were recruited from state primary schools in Brisbane and surrounding areas. These fifty-six children were assessed on thirteen handwriting process variables and two handwriting outcome variables in order to answer the research questions. Data produced were analyzed primarily with t-tests for between group differences and by examination of correlations between process and outcome variables. Small but measurable differences were found in both speed and legibility between the two groups, with the handwriting of the children with ASD being both less legible (t=- 2.47, df=54, p=0.02) and slower (t=-2.47, df=54, p=0.02). Accuracy of letter formation was also found to be significantly worse for the children with ASD compared to children in the control group (t=3.53, df=54, p=0.001). Further, the two groups were found to differ in some aspects of the Sequential Handwriting Process. Specifically, the children with ASD showed significant correlations between legibility and Perceiving, Conceptualizing and Planning stages, while the comparison children showed significant correlations between legibility and Interpreting, Conceptualizing, Planning and Activating stages. Only one process variable (consistency of letter formation) showed a moderate correlation with handwriting speed &#150; all other variables were of only slight to fair strength. Finally, the implications of the research findings are discussed, limitations described and directions for future research canvassed. As a result of the present study, a revised Systems Model of Handwriting is proposed. Several recommendations for occupational therapy intervention in handwriting practices in the classroom are made, notably: clear and focussed initial tuition of letter formation and secondly, the development of automaticity of the handwriting skill.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158068</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Establishing the efficacy of telemedicine as a clinical tool for physiotherapists: From systems design to a randomised controlled trial</field><field name="creator">Russell, Trevor Glen</field><field name="description">High quality health services are often difficult to access in rural and remote areas of Australia. This is due to a shortage of health care professionals and specialists, inadequate and poorly distributed resources, and the tyranny of distance. The result is a reduced level of health and a higher mortality rate than seen in urban communities. Telemedicine, which is the use of various technologies to deliver a range of health care services over a distance, has the potential to increase equity and access to health care in rural and remote areas. To date there has been a poor uptake of telemedicine technology within the profession of physiotherapy. This undoubtedly stems from the perceived, and indeed, real difficulty of performing what is traditionally &#145;hands on&#146; therapy, via an electronic medium. Added to this is a paucity of rigorous clinical outcome studies to demonstrate the efficacy of performing successful treatment via this delivery method. The aim of this thesis was to establish the efficacy of telemedicine as a clinical tool for physiotherapists. To achieve this, the first major undertaking was the development of a telemedicine system to meet the unique needs of clinical physiotherapists and their patients. A series of studies was then performed to calibrate the system and establish its validity and reliability as a clinical assessment tool. Finally, a randomised controlled trial was conducted to assess the treatment efficacy of the telemedicine system. The telemedicine system was constructed using a human systems development approach, with close consultation with senior clinical physiotherapists and potential users of the system. The personal computer-based system was designed to connect patients in their home with physiotherapists in the hospital, via low-speed and low-cost communications. The system incorporated real-time videoconferencing and physical measurement tools to enable the remote assessment of patients. The validity and reliability of the telemedicine physical measurement tools were established through a series of five studies. The results demonstrated these measurements to be accurate and reliable, under various measurement conditions, when compared to reference instruments. A prospective randomised controlled trial was conducted to assess the treatment efficacy of the telemedicine system. The research model chosen for this study was the rehabilitation of subjects who had undergone total knee replacement surgery. Block randomisation was used to assign 65 participants to either a traditional face-to-face therapy group or a telemedicine rehabilitation group. Participants in both groups received treatment over a six week period. Data analysis focussed on comparing physical and functional rehabilitation outcomes achieved in each treatment group. The results of this study demonstrated that the rehabilitation outcomes produced via the telemedicine system were similar to those achieved in the traditional manner. Additionally, the telemedicine therapy was found to produce greater improvements in a number of functional outcome measurements. A high level of satisfaction was expressed by participants who received treatment via the telemedicine method. This thesis provides evidence of the efficacy of telemedicine as a clinical tool for physiotherapists. Furthermore, the work detailed in this thesis represents one of the first randomised control trials in telerehabilitation and makes a significant contribution towards the knowledge of low-bandwidth telemedicine in general. This thesis provides a framework upon which further research and telemedicine applications may be developed, with the ultimate goal of improving equity and access to high quality health services in rural and remote areas.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="subject">telemedicine</field><field name="subject">telerehabilitation</field><field name="subject">telehealth</field><field name="subject">physiotherapy</field><field name="subject">physical therapy</field><field name="subject">rehabilitation</field><field name="subject">total knee replacement</field><field name="subject">total knee arthroplasty</field><field name="subject">rural</field><field name="subject">remote</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157964</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Planctomycete diversity and cell biology: perspectives from the molecular, cellular and organism levels</field><field name="creator">Butler, Margaret Kay</field><field name="description">The Planctomycetes are a deep branching phylum of the domain Bacteria that incorporate a diverse group of organisms possessing a number of unusual and distinct characteristics. These features include budding reproduction, the planctomycetecharacteristic crateriform structures on their cell surface, a cell wall that lacks peptidoglycan, internal compartmentalisation and unique molecular features of their rRNA genes. This study chose to investigate a number of aspects of planctomycete cell biology and diversity to further our knowledge of this unique group. In a study of the diversity of ribonuclease P (RNase P) RNA, one molecule of relevance to cell biology and compartmentalisation in planctomycetes, RNase P RNA genes were sequenced for species from all genera of planctomycetes for which a pure culture exists. Secondary structures for RNase P RNA of these strains were deduced, taking to 26 the number of planctomycete RNase P RNA structures. Nucleotide positions were identified in which some planctomycetes possess a less common form, including one thought to be otherwise conserved within all Bacteria and Archaea. Phylogenetic analysis of RNase P RNA genes was relatively consistent with that of 16S rRNA genes with the exception that clustering of Gemmata and anammox sequences occurred, possibly due to either long-branch attraction or lateral gene transfer. Analysis of RNase P RNA secondary structures revealed unusual features of planctomycetes relative to all other bacteria, including an additional helix within the P13 helix of &#145;Candidatus Brocadia anammoxidans&#146;, &#145;Candidatus Kuenenia stuttgartiensis&#146; and all Gemmata sequences. The longest P12 helix of any bacteria type A RNase P RNA was found in a Gemmatalike isolate. The short tandem repeats in P12 helices of two Gemmata-like isolates are possibly analogous to short tandem repetitive repeat sequences of some cyanobacteria RNase P RNA. In experiments using Gemmata obscuriglobus as a model for planctomycete cell biology and compartmentalisation functions, electron microscope-level in situ hybridisation (EMISH), and subsequent statistical analysis, was developed to localise 16S rRNA, 23S rRNA and RNase P RNA to particular regions within Gemmata obscuriglobus, the first instance of EMISH being applied in this way to bacteria. Statistical analysis localised 16S rRNA to both nuclear body and to riboplasm outside this region but it was absent from paryphoplasm. While co-localisation of both 16S rRNA and 23S rRNA molecules, which might indicate assembled ribosomes, was rarely observed, 23S rRNA, like 16S rRNA, was distributed in both riboplasm-containing areas of the cell. While statistical analysis revealed minor DNA within riboplasm outside the nuclear body, the majority was localised to that body. These results suggest at least some uncoupling of translation from transcription involving ribosomes in the riboplasm. RNase P RNA was localised both to the nuclear body and to the riboplasm outside this region, suggesting that pre-tRNA processing occurs both within nuclear body, where RNA transcripts are presumably generated, and outside nuclear body, separated from the origin of these transcripts. This is also consistent with the hypothesis that processed tRNA is required in the riboplasm outside the nuclear body, due to occurrence of some uncoupled translation. In research on planctomycetes not yet examined with respect to cell plan or structure, 16S rRNA gene sequencing of isolate ATCC 35122 confirmed its very close relationship to the type strain of Pirellula staleyi and its membership of the phylum Planctomycetes. Morphological characteristics, including polar crateriform structures and the occurrence of a unique internal, single membrane-bounded compartment enclosing nucleoid and ribosome-like particles, the pirellulosome, and a polar cap region, are also consistent with its membership of the planctomycetes and of genus Pirellula. Cells often displayed pointed, hump-like protrusions opposite each other on the cell, constituting prosthecae. Also re-examined using a number of methods were uncultured species Planctomyces bekefii and Pl. guttaeformis. Samples could be enriched for Pl. bekefii via either addition of ferric citrate or ampicillin. An application of a novel approach, laser microdissection and pressure catapulting, was also used physically to enrich P. bekefii rosettes. Fluorescent in situ hybridisation provided the first molecular evidence of Pl. bekefii and Pl. guttaeformis as Planctomycetes. Also confirming Planctomycetes membership of Pl. bekefii was the presence of a cytoplasm divided into two regions by an intracytoplasmic membrane, consistent with membership to the genus Planctomyces. Two new planctomycete-like organisms, MBLW1 and MBLW2, were isolated in this study and possessed a Gemmata-like cell plan. 16S rRNA gene sequencing confirmed these isolates belonged to the Gemmata clade within phylum Planctomycetes, though they may comprise a separate but closely related genus. Via EMISH, both ATCC 35122 and MBLW1 were hybridised with a planctomycete-specific probe, consistent with membership to the planctomycetes. Statistical analysis showed that 16S rRNA was present in both regions of the riboplasm of MBLW1, identical to the distribution observed G. obscuriglobus. This is another example of possible uncoupled translation within a member of the planctomycetes and within organisms in the Gemmata clade of planctomycetes.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270399 Microbiology not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158079</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Political Economy of the Music Industry: Technological Change and the Political Control of Music</field><field name="creator">Cvetkovski, Trajce</field><field name="description">The task undertaken in this dissertation is to determine the extent of the challenge facing the major firms (majors) who currently control over 80% of global sound carrier and publishing revenue in the popular (pop) music industry. The aim of this thesis is to explain the disorganising effects currently being experienced. Specifically, the central question guiding this thesis asks: what will be the effect of new technologies on the future organisation of the music industry? I focus broadly on recent universally accessible digital technologies which have raised questions about the future of the industry&#146;s current organisational structure and processes both in terms of input (creation of music products in their commodified form) and output (access and consumption of music products). The industry&#146;s processes are highly integrated and its business model is complex because it centres around the sophisticated management and aggressive appropriation of intellectual property (namely copyright) for repeated exploitation for decades after its initial acquisition. The purpose of this research, therefore, is to examine not only the tangible aspects of the manner in which the industry&#146;s organises its products but also the intangible dimension. Significant recent changes experienced by the industry are identified. The literature is not conclusive in terms of explaining these developments. While existing research exists on recent developments, a comprehensive analysis of the organisation of the industry both in terms of input and output remains underdeveloped in the literature. In particular, in relation to product re-organisation and consumer behaviour, copyright development and corporate restructuring, the literature is not fully developed. Current research is focused on illegitimate technological attacks &#150; namely digital piracy. However these do not adequately or comprehensively explain current disorganisation in the industry. This dissertation remedies this deficiency by proposing four separate but interconnected factors are affecting the highly concentrated status quo. Together, the positive and negative impacts of emerging technologies have created a serious dilemma in terms of product commodification for the controllers of the industry. I argue interconnected illegitimate and legitimate technological challenges are at play suggesting re-organisation is occurring multidimensionally. The research undertaken is empirically grounded, and though primarily based on qualitative data (and subsequent quantitative data for statistical corroboration), the current work has implications for understanding the industry&#146;s methods. Together, these approaches form the basis of the dissertation&#146;s methodology. The research reported in this dissertation attempts to determine to what extent the use and consumption of these different technologies can be regarded as the primary catalyst for the challenge to corporate control of the music industry, and the manner in which it is structured. If the dominant few intend to identify and rationalise challenges in terms of their corporate model, then they must understand the dynamic nature of interacting technologies.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">popular music</field><field name="subject">copyright</field><field name="subject">internet</field><field name="subject">technology</field><field name="subject">creative industries</field><field name="subject">MP3</field><field name="subject">pop culture</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158010</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Avian patch occupancy and landscape genetics of logrunners (Orthonyx temminckii) in fragmented subtropical rainforests of South East Queensland</field><field name="creator">David Charles Pavlacky Jr.</field><field name="description">The local extinction of habitat patches and dispersal between the patches are important processes structuring animal populations in heterogeneous environments. Understanding these two processes is crucial for the conservation of wildlife populations in landscapes impacted by human land-use. Approximately 50% of the subtropical rainforest in South East Queensland, Australia has been lost to deforestation over the last 100 years. While large areas of rainforest are reserved, little is known about the distribution and population status of rainforest birds within smaller remnants in the region. The overall research problem for this thesis was to understand how deforestation and fragmentation of subtropical rainforest affects the occurrence of rainforest birds and the effective dispersal of a rainforest-restricted species, the logrunner (Orthonyx temminckii). Understanding why some bird species are lost from habitat patches while others remain will lead to improved conservation of extinction prone species in fragmented landscapes. Although the mechanisms underlying local extinctions are well established in temperate systems, the relative importance of local and regional processes on species occurrence in subtropical and tropical rainforests is poorly understood. Chapter 2 investigated the relative effects of life history and scale of habitat modification on avian site occupancy using observational data collected at 46 rainforest sites in South East Queensland. A probabilistic model for the joint site occupancy of 29 bird species was used to evaluate hypotheses for the effects of avian life history traits on the occurrence of multiple species. The single-species occurrence models incorporated habitat effects on detection, which may be especially important in rainforests because dense vegetation and idiosyncratic occurrence of species can interfere with sampling. Occupancy rates for each species were modelled to determine the relative influence of process operating at the stand, landscape and patch scales. The life history analysis indicated taxonomic Family, body mass, migratory strategy and feeding strata had large effects on avian site occupancy, whereas abundance traits such as mean density and extent of occurrence showed little predictive ability. After accounting for correlated extinction risk attributed to life history, the degradation of stand structure at the local scale was more important for species richness than habitat modification at landscape or patch scales. While individual species showed various responses to the different scales of habitat modification, the distribution of many species was limited by vegetation structure at the landscape scale. Maintaining stand basal area and restoring degraded rainforests at the local scale will increase the probability of occupancy for members of the rainforest bird community. However, revegetation and retention of forest cover at the landscape scale may be necessary for the successful colonisation of many species. Chapter 3 introduced a predictive hypothesis-driven approach for quantifying the relative contribution of historic and contemporary processes to genetic connectivity. Current analytic frameworks in population genetics have difficulty evaluating meaningful hypotheses about spatial processes in dynamic landscapes. Confronting genetic data with models of historic and contemporary landscapes allowed the identification of dispersal processes operating in naturally heterogeneous and human-altered systems. Two measures of indirect gene flow were estimated from microsatellite polymorphism among 11 logrunner populations. Of particular interest was how much information in the genetic data was attributable to processes occurring in a reconstructed historic landscape and a contemporary human-modified landscape. A linear mixed model was used to estimate appropriate sampling variance from non-independent data and information-theoretic model selection provided strength of evidence for alternate hypotheses. The historic and contemporary landscapes explained an equal proportion of variation in genetic differentiation and there was considerable evidence for a temporal shift in dispersal pattern. Migration rates estimated from genealogical information were primarily influenced by contemporary landscape change. Landscape heterogeneity appeared to facilitate gene flow prior to European settlement, but contemporary deforestation is rapidly becoming the most important barrier to logrunner dispersal. Understanding asymmetric dispersal is becoming an important consideration for the conservation metapopulations. Populations acting as net exporters of dispersing animals may be able to rescue local populations from extinction and allow metapopulations to persist in degraded landscapes impacted by habitat loss. In Chapter 4, I estimated bidirectional migration rates from genetic data to infer dispersal among 11 logrunner populations. The first question posed was, does logrunner dispersal correspond to the source-sink or balanced model of dispersal? The second question involved determining the strength of evidence for two hypotheses about how landscape structure has affected asymmetric dispersal. Hypothesis one proposed that asymmetric dispersal was primarily influenced by naturally occurring habitat heterogeneity. Hypothesis two asserted that asymmetric dispersal was predominantly influenced by anthropogenic landscape change. The data were confronted with the alternate hypotheses using linear mixed models and landscape covariates extracted from digital maps. The results showed the direction of asymmetric dispersal was consistent with source-sink population structure. I also discovered that the asymmetry in dispersal was influenced more by anthropogenic landscape change than by naturally occurring habitat heterogeneity. Intact landscapes were net exporters of dispersing logrunners while landscapes heavily impacted by rainforest clearing were net importers of individuals. Elevated immigration rates into landscapes impacted by rainforest clearing appeared to arrest population declines in accordance with the rescue effect. The primary conclusion emerging from the study of patch occupancy and dispersal was that logrunner populations in South East Queensland conformed to a mainland-island metapopulation. Asymmetric dispersal from the largest expanse of upland rainforest appeared to prevent fragmented rainforests in close proximity from going locally extinct. While the distribution of logrunners was limited by the spatial configuration of rainforest patches, other rainforest birds exhibited variable responses to scale of habitat modification. The most consistent pattern was several species dropping-out of the community in degraded stands affected by selective timber harvest. Deforestation at the landscape scale also played a role in the extremely low patch occupancy rates of Albert&#8217;s lyrebirds (Menura alberti) and green catbirds (Ailuroedus crassirostris).</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Asymmetric dispersal, bird conservation, coalescent theory, forest fragmentation, gene flow, habitat loss, life history, migration, notophyll vine forest, species richness.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159461</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Relationship between the music audiation capacities and language comprehension capacities of children age 5 years</field><field name="creator">Mrs Leah Shephard</field><field name="description" /><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">410000 The Arts</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159799</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Music, the Arts and the Dual Aesthetic in Seventeenth- and Early Eighteenth-Century English Thought</field><field name="creator">Barnaby Ralph</field><field name="description">This dissertation examines affect, rhetoric and aesthetics in relation to English thought of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, focusing in particular on music. It argues that a &#8220;dual aesthetic&#8221;, or a division in perception of an artistic experience between broad conceptions related to the intellectual and the sensual, was an implied discourse running through discussions of art, philosophy, music, education and other areas. I argue that both seventeenth- and eighteenth-century philosophers of the arts viewed the intellectual and sensual experiences as different things, and this distinction meant that they felt that an individual could perceive a painting, a work of music or another expression of artistic intent on two levels. A related division is between the macro-rhetorical, or broadly constructional, elements and the micro-rhetorical, or minutiae. In terms of music, ideas of affect and rhetoric were employed in three main ways in the period, given here in increasing order of their level of specific detail. The first was as concepts of general relation between different arts such as poetry, music and painting. Philosophical thought of the period held that the aim of any art was to move the passions and affections, and rhetoric was a template used to establish terms of discussion. The second way in which these ideas could be related to music was as general metaphors, such as the common metaphor of a piece as an oration. The third relation was on the constructional level, where ideas of musical affect were applied to instrumentation, rhythm, dynamics and other areas. Rhetoric served here as a specific constructional model, providing tools such as templates for the general structure of a work and figures that could be used in order to move the passions appropriately. The primary sources consulted are, for the most part, works either written in England, translated into English in the period, or well-known there during the seventeenth and the first half of the eighteenth century. Many of these were not concerned in the first instance with music, and explored instead aesthetics, philosophy or the arts in general. Such a contextual examination helps clarify terminological confusion, and many terms which have, for example, a musico-rhetorical function can thus be identified. There was no unified theory of affect and the passions, and certainly no definitive catalogue of musico-rhetorical devices in England in this period. Instead, this dissertation looks at commonalities of approach and the chronological development of affective and rhetorical elements in music. To this end, a wide range of sources have been discussed and contextualized, including works on classical rhetoric and its derivatives, education and medicine. General concepts are identified and information is then extrapolated from this. Ultimately, the elements combine in a hierarchy of construction, with overreaching principles coming from rhetoric, broad elements from affective theory and minutiae from both. The dual aesthetic, an implicit principle underlying seventeenth- and eighteenth-century thought about the arts, is thus made explicit in this dissertation.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">music, affect, rhetoric, aesthetics, England, philosophy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:171676</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Response of Helicoverpa armigera to agricultural environments diversified through companion planting.</field><field name="creator">Renee Herde</field><field name="description">This study investigated the potential of companion planting as a strategy to aid in the management of Helicoverpa armigera in tomato and capsicum cropping systems. The investigaitons showed that a companion planting type system is unlikely to confer any benefits to the management of H. armigera in these crops. The project has contributed to the understanding of H. armigera host selection and how the pest responds to a diversified environment. Companion planting and vegetational diversity are strategies for reducing pest incidence on crops. Many theories have been devised to explain how introducing more than one plant species to a cropping space may reduce the incidence of a pest. Five ecological theories formed the basis of experiments in this study: The resource concentration hypothesis - Herbivores are more likely to find and remain on hosts that are growing in dense or nearly pure stands (Root, 1973). Associational resistance/Plant apparency - Crop plants grown as monocultures are more apparent to herbivorous insects than plants in diverse natural systems (Tahvanainen and Root, 1972). Trap cropping &#8211; the use of plants within a cropping area to attract oviposition away from the main crop (Banks and Ekbom, 1999). The ability of H. armigera to learn in regard to host seleciton (Cunningham et al., 1998a). The natural enemies hypothesis - generalist and specialist natural enemies are expected to be more abundant in diverse rather than simple systems (Root, 1973) A tall variety of sorghum (the forage variety Chopper) was tested for its ability to disrupt host location. Sorghum was planted around plots of tomatoes to act as a screen to disrupt visual cues for host location by Helicoverpa spp. No difference was found in egg numbers on tomatoes with or without sorghum companions. However, significantly higher numbers of Helicoverpa spp. larvae were found in the sorghum at flowering than in the tomatoes. This suggested the sorghum was acting as a trap crop, diverting oviposition away from the tomato crop. However, due to a short period of flowering and therefore peak attractiveness to H. armigera, sorghum was not considered to be a suitable companion plant for inclusion in commercial tomato production systems. A host preference study was conducted to determine the preferences of H. armigera for crop plants and possible companions in the hope of finding a suitable trap crop species. Tomatoes were shown to be a highly preferred plant making it difficult to find a compatible trap crop species that would be more attractive than the main crop. However, capsicums were less prefered and therefore more suitable for this type of experimentation. Marigolds were also found to be a highly preferred plant and formed the basis for further investigations into trap cropping systems. Field experiments were conducted in successive years in two geographical locations to assess the suitability of marigolds as a trap crop for capsicums in a field situation. However, in both years H. armigera incidence was extremely and unusually low leading to inconclusive results. A glasshouse experiment was performed to assess if the ratio of capsicum plants to marigolds plants had an effect on which species H. armigera would choose for oviposition. It was found that as more capsicum plants were introduced, moths became less likely to oviposit on the supposedly more preferred marigold plant. The diminishing attractiveness of a more preferred host in the presence of other hosts is a new observation of H. armigera behaviour. This result suggests that marigolds would be unlikely to be a successful trap crop in a field situation. The ability of H. armigera to learn in regard to host selection and the influence of this on host selection in the field was investigated. No evidence of learning was found. This was the first study investigating the effect of learning in a field situation; previously the behaviour had only been investigated in a laboratory situation (Cunningham, et al. 1998a). The ability of the Australian assassin bug, Pristhesancus plagipennis (Walker) (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) to predate H. armigera larvae on capsicum plants was investigated. This predator has been sucessfully been used for H. armigera management in cotton (Grundy, 2000b), but had not been investigated in horticultural crops. Significant reductions in larvae were achieved in treatments where assassin bugs were introduced. This predator warrants further investigation for inclusion in commercial integrated pest managment programs for capsicums. Pest repellent plants were also considered. Previous to this study, very little research work had been conducted on repellent plants for H. armigera. The herbs investigated were catnip (Nepta cataria), tansy (Tanacetum vulgare), basil (Ocium basilicum) and coriander (Coriander sativum). An olfactometer system was designed and built to test H. armigera moths&#8217; responses to odours from the herbs. Glasshouse experiments were also conducted. No repellent activity was recorded with any of the herbs tested. The results of this study support the theory that Helicoverpa spp. employ a strategy of passive host selection as suggested by Firempong (1986). This means that all available plants in an area may be oviposited on with successful ovipostion and larval development leading to the future utilisation of a species as a host plant. The implication of this finding is that in-field trap cropping is unlikely to be a successful strategy for reducing H. armigera oviposition in tomato or capsicum production systems in Australia. In cotton crops in Australia, trap cropping is used as part of an area wide management strategy and aims to reduce the total Helicoverpa spp. population of a region. Such a strategy may also be successful in horticultural crops but only with the full participation of the growers of all crops that are attractive to H. armigera in a horticultural growing region. Due to the diverse nature of horticultural production this may be a difficult task.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences</field><field name="subject">Helicoverpa armigera, companion planting, trap cropping, learning, marigold, host selection, repellent plants, Pristhesancus plagipennis</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:183732</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mathematical Modelling of the Plasma Membrane</field><field name="creator">Valeriu Dan Nicolau</field><field name="description">Many crucial cellular processes take place at the plasma membrane. The latter is a complex, two-dimensional medium exhibiting significant lateral structure. As a result, a number of non-classical processes, including anomalous diffusion, compartimentalisation and fractal kinetics take place at the membrane surface. The evaluation of various hypotheses and theories about the membrane is currently very difficult because no general modelling framework is available. In this thesis, we present a stochastic, spatially explicit Monte Carlo model for the plasma membrane that accounts for illmixedness, mobile lipid microdomains, fixed proteins, cytoskeletal fence structures and other interactions. We interrogate this model to obtain three classes of results, regarding (1) the effect of lipid microdomains on protein dynamics on the membrane (2) the effects of microdomains, cytoskeletal fences and fixed proteins on the nature of the (anomalous) diffusion on the membrane and (3) the effects of obstructed diffusion on reaction kinetics at the membrane. We find that the presence of lipid microdomains can lead to nonclassical phenomena such as increased collision rates and differences between long-range and short-range diffusion coefficients. Our results also suggest that experimental techniques measuring long-range diffusion may not be sufficiently discriminating and hence cannot be used to infer quantitative information about the presence and characteristics of microdomains. With regard to anomalous diffusion in particular, we find that to explain this phenomenon at the levels observed in vivo, a number of interactions are required, including (but not necessarily limited to) obstacle-induced diffusion and segregation, or exclusion from microdomains. The effects of these different interactions upon the nature of the diffusion appear to be approximately additive. Finally, we show that a widely used non-spatial method, the Stochastic Simulation Algorithm, can be modified to take into account anomalous diffusion and that this significantly increases its predictive accuracy. The model presented in this thesis is expected to be of future value in evaluating different models of cell surface processes.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">membrane</field><field name="subject">modelling</field><field name="subject">lipid rafts</field><field name="subject">anomalous diffusion</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184519</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Communist Party and trade union work in Queensland in the third period: 1928-1935</field><field name="creator">Penrose, Beris Gene</field><field name="description" /><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1606 Political Science</field><field name="subject">Communist Party of Australia -- History</field><field name="subject">Labor unions and communism -- Queensland -- History.</field><field name="subject">Depressions -- 1929 -- Queensland</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185197</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental factors affecting teaching and learning in North Queensland, 1875-1905</field><field name="creator">De Jabrun, Mary</field><field name="description" /><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">13 Education</field><field name="subject">330102 History and Philosophy of Education</field><field name="subject">Public schools -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Education -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Queensland -- Social conditions -- 1788-1900</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:186226</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A new method for computing anharmonic rovibrational densities of states of interstellar and atmospheric clusters at arbitrary angular momenta</field><field name="creator">Sarah Windsor</field><field name="description">A new methodology is developed to calculate density of states of interstellar and atmospheric clusters that takes account of their loosely bound nature and incorporates kinetically important angular momentum constraints explicitly. The method is based on classical phase space integration for the intermonomer modes of the cluster with imposition of the constraints of selected total energy and total angular momentum. It achieves considerable efficiency via essentially analytic evaluation of the momentum space integrals coupled with efficient Monte Carlo sampling of configurations. The derivation for the equation for the density of states is outlined and all steps in the simplification of the accessible momentum space volume are detailed. The method is tested rigorously against an entirely analytic result obtained for the ideal case of a dimer with spherical top fragments and no interaction potential. Interstellar applications of the new approach are presented for (HCN)2 and (CO)2. The new intermononmer density of states has been integrated over metastable states to obtain the intermonomer partition function, which in turn is used to calculate the metastable equilibrium constants for interstellar clusters, which in turn is used tocalculate the second order rate constant of overall dimer formation in the interstellar environment. Atmospheric applications of the new approach are presented for (H2O)2. The new intermonomer density of states is convoluted with the intramonomer density of states to obtain the convoluted density of states. This convoluted density of states is then integrated over total energy and angular momentum to obtain the anharmonic partition function, which in turn is used to calculate the equilibrium constant for atmospheric clusters, which in turn is used to calculate the third order rate constant for overall dimer formation in the atmospheric environment. Kinetic quantities are also calculated with the intermonomer and convoluted density of states for interstellar and atmospheric clusters, respectively. These densities of states are combined with RRKM theory to compute unimolecular dissociation rate constants, which are then averaged with respect to the thermal capture flux distribution to compute average lifetimes as a function of temperature.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">interstellar, atmospheric, classical, density of states, metastable, partition function,</field><field name="subject">equilibrium constant, rate constant, lifetime</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:195299</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation and recombinant expression of antigens for the rapid diagnosis of West Nile virus infection</field><field name="creator">Jody Hobson-Peters</field><field name="description">West Nile Virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne pathogen of global significance. It is active on several continents and is responsible for recent outbreaks of fever and fatal encephalitis in humans and horses. While highly virulent strains have been reported in Europe, North, Central and South America, only a benign subtype of WNV (Kunjin virus &#8211; KUNV) occurs in Australia. However, virulent, exotic WNV strains are seen as a significant threat to Australia due to the ease with which this virus can move between continents and the presence of suitable vectors and hosts already within Australia. KUNV and WNV subtypes are antigenically and genetically very closely related and cross-react in traditional serological tests. This cross-reactivity makes it very difficult to differentiate between KUNV and WNV infections using standard serological tests. The aim of this thesis was to identify immunogenic epitopes unique to KUNV or WNV and to use these epitopes in the development of a rapid assay that would enable the diagnosis of and surveillance for exotic virulent strains of WNV in Australia. The rapid diagnostic platform chosen was a red blood cell (RBC) agglutination assay that was originally patented and commercialised by AGEN Biomedical Ltd. The RBC agglutination assay reagent consists of the Fab region of a human erythrocyte-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) conjugated to the epitope of interest (in this instance, a WNV-specific peptide). This bi-functional reagent causes the agglutination of the patient&#8217;s erythrocytes in the presence of WNV-specific antibody in the patient&#8217;s serum. Traditionally, these RBC agglutination reagents have been produced by chemical conjugation. However, a potentially easier and cheaper method involves the linking of the gene encoding the erythrocyte-specific antibody to that encoding the epitope to create a recombinant version of the bi-functional agglutination reagent through expression using prokaryotic or eukaryotic systems. To identify potential differential epitopes, 18 mAbs to WNV (NY99 strain) prM and envelope (E) proteins were assessed. One mAb (17D7) differentially recognised WNV and KUNV in ELISA and maintained recognition of its corresponding epitope upon reduction and carboxymethylation of the viral antigen, suggesting a continuous (linear) epitope. Using synthetic peptides, the epitope was mapped to a 19 amino acid sequence (WN19: E147-165) encompassing the WNV NY99 E protein glycosylation site at position 154. An amino acid substitution at position E156 of many KUNV strains abolishes this glycosylation moiety. The inability of WNV-positive horse and mouse sera to bind the synthetic peptides indicated that glycosylation was required for recognition of peptide WN19 by WNV-specific antibodies in sera. N-linked glycosylation of WN19 was achieved through expression of the peptide as a C-terminal fusion protein in mammalian cells and specific reactivity of WNV-positive horse sera to the glycosylated WN19 fusion protein was shown by Western blot. Additional sera collected from horses that had been infected with Murray Valley encephalitis virus (MVEV), which is similarly glycosylated at position E154 and exhibits high sequence identity to WNV NY99 in this region, also recognised the recombinant peptide. In contrast, no reactivity with the recombinant peptide was observed by sera from horses infected with the unglycosylated WNV subtype, KUNV. Failure of most WNV- and MVEV-positive horse sera to recognise the epitope as a deglycosylated fusion protein (75% and 100% respectively) confirmed that the N-linked glycan is important for antibody recognition of the peptide. Together, these results suggest that the induction of antibodies to the WN19 epitope during WNV infection of horses is generally associated with E protein glycosylation of the infecting viral strain. To assess the feasibility of using peptide WN19 in a rapid immunoassay, the peptide was recombinantly fused to a RBC (glycophorin)-specific single chain antibody (scFv) using previously published constructs which were developed for the bacterial expression of similar bi-functional reagents. To facilitate glycosylation of peptide WN19, the genes for the bi-functional agglutination reagents were subsequently cloned into eukaryotic expression vectors. An additional set of constructs were also produced in which the genes for the variable regions of the anti-RBC antibody were cloned into a vector for the secreted expression of an intact, humanised IgG1 molecule. Stable cell lines were produced for each of these constructs and secreted up to 700 ng/mL glycophorin-reactive antibody. The secreted recombinant protein could be harvested directly from the cell culture medium and used in RBC agglutination assays, where these bi-functional agglutination reagents could be cross-linked either with mAb 17D7 or by anti-peptide WN19 antibodies present in WNV-positive horse serum. The WNV NY99 prM protein was also identified as a useful marker of WNV-infection in horses, as well as a putative antigen to differentiate equine WNV NY99 and KUNV infections using Western blot. Two anti-WNV prM mAbs were also generated in this study and will be extremely valuable in future studies. Preliminary analysis of the prM epitope(s) bound by these mAbs and WNV-immune sera indicate that the binding site(s) is likely to be localised to pr and is conformational.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">06 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">West Nile virus</field><field name="subject">Kunjin Virus</field><field name="subject">Flavivirus</field><field name="subject">Monoclonal Antibody</field><field name="subject">single chain antibody</field><field name="subject">red blood cell agglutination</field><field name="subject">Recombinant Antibody</field><field name="subject">Epitope mapping</field><field name="subject">prM</field><field name="subject">Envelope Protein</field><field name="subject">Diagnostic Assay</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:203818</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The &#8216;Historically Informed Performance&#8217; Movement and its Influence on Violoncello Playing Since 1981: With Reference to Performances of Haydn&#8217;s Violoncello Concerto in C major by Anner Byslma, Pieter Wispelwey and Yo-Yo Ma</field><field name="creator">Courtenay Lind</field><field name="description">Investigation of the historically informed performance movement with regard to its influence on violoncello playing since 1981 is approached in this critical commentary through the analysis of three different interpretations of Haydn&#8217;s Cello Concerto in C major. These interpretations are recordings by prominent cellists who have influenced or been influenced by the rise in popularity of the historically informed performance movement, namely Anner Bylsma, Pieter Wispelwey and Yo-Yo Ma. The critical commentary includes a brief summary of the musical careers of each individual and reports on the publicity surrounding them in an attempt to discover each performer&#8217;s views on the importance of historical performance practice and the extent to which these views are reflected in their performances. In order to establish what constitutes a historically informed interpretation of Haydn&#8217;s Cello Concerto, this document provides a brief background to the historical performance movement and also to the work itself. In the critical commentary, this work is analysed in relation to six specific aspects of historically informed interpretation: instrumentation, pitch, vibrato, tempo, ornamentation and cadential improvisation. By examining and comparing these aspects in the aforementioned twentieth-century recordings, this critical commentary concludes in support of Taruskin&#8217;s (1984) position on the now fashionable debate of historical performance practice. Namely, that the historical performance movement has been influenced as much by modern taste and aesthetics as by the attempt to create historically &#8216;accurate&#8217; music.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">violoncello</field><field name="subject">historically informed performance practice</field><field name="subject">Bylsma</field><field name="subject">Wispelwey</field><field name="subject">Ma</field><field name="subject">Haydn</field><field name="subject">concerto</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206315</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Cop, a Thief, and a Priest ...and some bad grammar: An Unruly Un-Love Story and the First Nations Fiction Diction Essay That Goes With It</field><field name="creator">Jesse Macpherson</field><field name="description">This dissertation is comprised of two distinct but related components. The larger component is a short novel, titled A Cop, a Thief and a Priest. This is the story of three very different men, the woman they all want, her daughter who gets in the way, the secrets they all try to hide, and a few bedtime stories. Plus a Canadian Native or two. And maybe a bomb, as well. This work of fiction is written with a shifting perspective and varying degrees of adherence to the rules of grammar, depending on the narrator and characters in the scene. The story focuses on seriously flawed people in potentially harmful, though ceaselessly humorous, relationships and how they try to choose the best out of the poor options in front of them. In the course of the novel several Native Canadian/First Nations characters appear. Some are characters within the story, and others are cast members of several bedtime stories told by the three primary male characters. As I am not Canadian First Nations, I had concerns over writing dialogue and characterization of Canadian Native characters. In response to these misgivings, the accompanying critical essay component of this dissertation deals with the issue of a non-Native author writing Native characters. The thesis essay explores this question in the fiction of three Canadian authors who are not Canadian First Nations. I examine specifically their use of grammatical errors in the dialogue of their Native characters as a device to present diction as an element of the character&#8217;s status, education, gender, age, race or culture. The three authors chosen are W.P Kinsella, Anne Cameron, and Thomas King. These writers use diction variously, and each is scrutinized according to guidelines drawn from writing theory texts, commercial writing guides, and writing practice prescriptions from successful authors. The conclusions are considered in the crafting of my own First Nations characters.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">19 Studies in Creative Arts and Writing</field><field name="subject">orality, storyteller, grammatical error, voice appropriation, First Nations, Native, interfusional, dialogue, characterization, narrator</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:209719</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of the mechanics of high energy flames applied to the penetration of rocks</field><field name="creator">Just, G.

The thesis was conducted during a period when the Queensland Government began to recognize demands for more effective Indigenous cultural heritage legislation. Queensland's latest Aboriginal cultural heritage legislation, introduced in 2004, emerged from a history of legislation dominated by an archaeological model of cultural heritage. However, despite some improvements this new legislation has maintained a physically orientated model of cultural heritage. Therefore Queensland's Indigenous societies, their places, place knowledge and certain types of place-specific behaviours continue to be exposed to imposed change. The thesis examines the 'lifeworld', the 'everyday' experiences of place of the Dajarra community. A broad definition of culture and an interactive model of place, coupled with a phenomenological approach provide a theoretical framework to engage with and describe cultural heritage as Dajarra people themselves experience it. The cultural heritage of Dajarra people involves interactions with a diversity of places and various combinations of behavioural, knowledge and physical properties. All of the places examined were interrelated with other places to form both small and large-scale place complexes. This dissertation reveals that the cultural heritage of an Aboriginal community lies not just in the physical environment but also in the diverse everyday people-environment interactions of that community. Effective cultural heritage legislation must be capable of encompassing this diversity. Cultural heritage is essentially dynamic, it is found in processes of change, it is found in ongoing people-environment interactions as well as those of the past. It is argued that Aboriginal people hold 'active cultural heritage rights'; these are rights to interact with places and rights to control action in places. Ideal cultural heritage legislation would recognize these active rights and provide for Aboriginal control of them, that is, Aboriginal defined and controlled change. This study reveals that it is difficult to separate places in time and space from other places with which they are co-dependent or inextricably intertwined. Studies of Aboriginal people-environment interactions and legislative measures must respond to the broader place complexes within which individual places are embedded and within which the everyday experiences of place are had. It is shown that there is a range of ways that an Aboriginal cultural heritage community can be defined and a range of Aboriginal people that might have interests in the cultural heritage of an area. Lastly, the thesis calls for the adoption of an interactive model of place as a foundation to cultural heritage studies and legislation in order to respond to the cultural heritage of Aboriginal people as they themselves experience it and wish to experience it.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="subject">750309 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander development and welfare</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal cultural heritage</field><field name="subject">place</field><field name="subject">place theory</field><field name="subject">Dajarra</field><field name="subject">Georgina River</field><field name="subject">people-environment interactions</field><field name="subject">Waluwarra</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal environments</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:8675</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pedogeomorphic terrain analysis for forestland resource management: Science and practice</field><field name="creator">Thwaites, R.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300803 Natural Resource Management</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:105510</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of local government in local economic development</field><field name="creator">Jones, S.

H.</field><field name="description">Research on helping and altruism has been revitalized by the shift in focus from individual and interpersonal processed to group processed in the last decade. In particular, the social identity approach (Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1979; Turner, 1985; Turner, Hogg, Oakes, Reicher, &amp; Wetherell, 1987), which ahs been increasingly applied to helping situations, has provided a valuable group perspective on helping behaviour. The significance of social groups and shared identity for altruism has also been suggested (e.g., Monroe, 1996; Sober &amp; Wilson, 1998). Although helping and altruism are typically undifferentiated, central to altruism is the issue of motivation, which as additional theoretical and applied implications. The eight studies reported in this thesis aimed to build upon current social identity research on helping behaviour and to extend the social identity approach to altruism. In line with the social identity perspective, factors associated with group membership were expected to have important implication for individual helping decisions, especially among high identifying group members. Studies 1 to 3 tested the combined effects of target group membership and group identification on individual helping intentions. In all three studies, participant completed an ingroup identification scale and reported their intentions to help the target, who was either an ingroup or an outgroup member. Consistent with expectations, high identifiers were willing to offer more help to a more ingroup-like target in study 1 (N = 141). However, in Study 2 (N = 93). High identifiers offered more help to an outgroup than to an ingroup target. In an attempt to clarify these conflicting finding, Study 3 (N = 138) examined group members&#8217; helping responses in a group-relevant and a group-irrelevant helping situation. Results indicated that high identifiers were more willing to help an outgroup target when the helping situation was group-irrelevant rather than group-relevant. The helping intentions of low identifiers were largely unaffected by the group membership of the target or the group-relevance of the helping dimension. In a further analysis of the impact of target group membership on helping behaviour, Study 4 considered the moderating effects of perceived need on intergroup helping decisions. Using a realistic helping paradigm, participants (N = 94) heard a voice recording of a request for help from either an ingroup or an outgroup target, who expressed either a high or a low need for help. Where as people were more likely to help the ingroup than the outgroup target when there was a high need for help, the group membership of the target did not affect helping decisions when the need for help was low. While Studies 1 to 4 elaborated on the role of social identity factors in intergroup helping contexts, Studies 5 and 6 Focused on helping with intragroup contexts by considering how the intragroup position of the target can also influence people&#8217;s helping intentions. In Study 5 (N = 166), social identity salience was manipulated, whereas ingroup identification was measured in Study 6 (N = 118). Participants in both studies were then presented with a profile of either a prototypical or a non-prototypical target and were asked to indicate their helping intentions. As predicted, people who perceived their ingroup identity to be more salient (Study 5) or identified more highly with the ingroup (Study 6) were willing to offer more help to the prototypical than to the non-prototypical target. In addition, concern for the target was found to be a mediator in predicting individual helping intentions. The final two studies investigated social identity processed in field settings. Study 7 (N =618) assessed both helping intentions and behaviour in the context of a charity door-knock appeal. Respondents in both studies completed a survey, which included measures of group identification, concern, and helping intentions. Greater identification with the group was associated with increased willingness to contribute to the community (Study 7) and intentions to donate more money to the door-knock appeal (Study 8). Further more, the relationship between group identification and individual helping intentions was mediated by concern. Together, these eight studies highlighted the complexities of social identity influences on helping behavior as well as the contributions that the social identity approach can make to the study of helping and altruism.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:119790</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of Urban Growth in the Process of Impoverishment of Campesinos&#8217; Households Living in Peri-Urban Areas: A Case Study in Mexico City</field><field name="creator">Yadira Mireya M&#233;ndez de Mart&#237;nez</field><field name="description">In the last 50 years, Mexico, like many other countries in Latin America, Asia and Africa, has experienced accelerated urban growth. Urban growth has been accompanied by an increase in urban poverty. While the spatial distribution of poverty in urban areas in Mexico is varied, new settlements that tend to grow in the peri-urban hinterland of cities are largely associated with poverty. This is because inexpensive, but mostly illegal, agricultural land (ejido or private) has been alienated to satisfy the demands of low income population for housing. The focus of this study lay in the Metropolitan Area of Mexico City (MAMC), which is the habitat of diverse low-income groups. Among those groups are the campesinos (people with rural background engaged totally or partially in agricultural livelihoods). Some studies have suggested that campesinos are very vulnerable to urban growth, since population expansion has put severe pressure on their agricultural land, which, despite its marginal value, is used to produce crops for either semi-commercialisation or subsistence. Although such research has showed how poor campesinos have engaged in non-agricultural activities to make a living and how land and their communities are threatened by urban growth due to speculative pressures on land and/or environmental deterioration, little is known about the impact of urban growth in the process of impoverishment of campesinos living in peri-urban areas. This study aims to understand how the growth of the MAMC affects poverty in campesinos&#8217; households, in order to recommend directions for poverty reduction. Three villages in Chalco municipality, which is situated in the peri-urban fringe of Mexico City, were selected as the study area. Based on the development of a conceptual framework, this study considered three interconnected elements underpinning poverty: multi-dimensionality, complexity and dynamism. For this reason, the Sustainable Livelihoods approach was selected as an analytical tool, as it provided a flexible analytical framework that encompasses all those elements. The study is divided in three stages. In the first stage (namely documental investigation), a series of published and unpublished written materials were reviewed to determine how the growth of the MAMC transformed the nature and availability of resources in Chalco municipality from 1970 to 2000. This stage was followed by the empirical investigation that aimed to examine how those transformations affected campesinos&#8217; assets (human, natural, physical, productive and social), the strategies they used to adapt to such changes, and how they perceived changes in poverty status. Accordingly, for this stage, quantitative and qualitative longitudinal and cross-sectional data were collected from 110 campesinos&#8217; households living in the study area in 1997 and 2003 by using structured questionnaires. Qualitative data were also collected by using semi-structured interviews from 34 campesinos&#8217; households in 2000. The final stage, called recommendations, involved the synthesis of the results of the documental and empirical investigations and suggests a series of directions for poverty reduction in campesinsos&#8217; households in the study area. The documental and empirical investigations revealed that changes in asset ownership, between 1997 to 2003, depended on both transformation in the nature and availability of resources in Chalco and intra-household organization. Fundamental transformations in socio-demographic, economic, natural, physical and political/organisational resources of Chalco municipality were mainly, but not exclusively, associated with the growth of the MAMC. Climatic and physical characteristics of Chalco were also evident. To respond to such changes, campesinos implemented a series of strategies to get access to resources. Such strategies were based on campesinos&#8217; needs, priorities and the portfolio of assets available, and their functionality. It was clear that campesinos depleted some existing assets to acquire urban assets and preserve their rural assets. In some instances, such strategies led campesinos&#8217; families to satisfy their basic needs and, therefore, perceive themselves as non-poor. However, in other instances, such strategies prevented families from meeting their needs, leading them to the perception of being poor. The recommendation was made that in order to reduce poverty among campesinos in the study area, it was necessary to identify different alternatives to support their urban and rural assets and certain of their strategies that improve the wellbeing of individuals, families and communities and mitigate constraints to meeting their goals.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Poverty</field><field name="subject">peri-urban</field><field name="subject">sustainable livelihoods</field><field name="subject">poverty dynamics</field><field name="subject">Urban growth</field><field name="subject">adaptive strategies</field><field name="subject">Metropolitan Area of Mexico City</field><field name="subject">Campesinos</field><field name="subject">Chalco municipality</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:120634</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring the role of response anonymity in the provision of negative feedback</field><field name="creator">Huang Weixian</field><field name="description" /><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">380105 Social and Community Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:138995</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tourism destination development: Beyond Butler</field><field name="creator">Breakey, Noreen Maree</field><field name="description" /><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">150604 Tourism Marketing</field><field name="subject">Tourism -- Queensland -- Sunshine Coast.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158161</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Vulnerability-Stress-Coping Model Of Adjustment To The Individual Negative Symptoms Of Schizophrenia</field><field name="creator">Watson-Luke, Annette Robyn</field><field name="description">This research program represents the first systematic exploration of the subjective experience of alogia, anhedonia, attention problems, avolition, and emotional blunting, and its relation to other objective and subjective factors in schizophrenia. Using a combined rational-empirical approach, a vulnerability-stress-coping model of adjustment to the 5 negative symptoms was developed and tested. Three aspects of appraisal were examined, the primary appraisals of symptom severity and distress, and the secondary appraisal of control. The dimensions of coping with individual symptoms were initially examined using a rational approach, and then empirically using exploratory factor analyses. The Appraisal and Coping with Negative Symptoms Interview Schedule (ACNSIS) was developed for use in Study 1. Both qualitative and quantitative appraisal and coping data were examined for 20 people with negative symptoms. Responses to the ACNSIS demonstrated that appraisals and coping responses varied across participants and individual negative symptoms. Previously employed categorisations of coping behaviour were used to examine and quantify coping. Negative symptom-specific differences were found in awareness of negative symptom presence, degree of agreement with objective ratings, appraisals, reliance on different types of coping, and relations with participant characteristics. Participant coping responses from Study 1 were used to construct the self-report measure used in subsequent studies. Study 2 involved the development, administration, and evaluation of the selfreport Appraisal and Coping with Negative Symptoms Questionnaire (ACNSQ). Both an electronic and paper version of the ACNSQ were developed. The ACNSQ was administered to 120 people with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Participants were required to make severity, distress and control appraisals for each negative symptom they believed they were suffering from. Following symptom appraisals, a number of symptom-specific and general coping items were presented for each negative symptom. In Study 2A, the multidimensionality of coping responses and the nature of empirically derived subscales were explored individually for each negative symptom. Factor analyses of data from 119 participants resulted in 3 underlying coping dimensions for each symptom. These dimensions, which formed the basis of the ACNSQ coping subscales, were labelled as active, emotional, or avoidant forms of coping. Coping subscales were found to be moderately similar across symptoms. The subscales were shown to be internally consistent and largely independent within symptoms. It was found that the degree of reliance on particular coping subscales was negative symptom-specific, although participant coping was related across symptoms. In Study 2B, the nature of negative symptom appraisals and the psychometric properties of the ACNSQ were examined. There was evidence that the nature of appraisals varied according to negative symptom. Retest reliability analyses indicated that overall, ACNSQ appraisals had a low to moderate degree of reliability while coping subscales demonstrated a moderate to high degree of reliability. Differential associations between appraisal and coping and a range of theoretically related variables provided evidence of the construct validity of the ACNSQ. Study 3 used exploratory techniques to conduct cross-sectional tests of a vulnerability-stress-coping model of adjustment to individual negative symptoms based on the data of the 119 participants. Associations between the objective indicator of negative symptom stressor level, and the subjective experience variables of insight, appraisal and coping were examined in relation to adjustment using a multidimensional approach. Two models of the relations between negative symptom predictors and 3 separate domains of adjustment were investigated. Study 3A provided moderate support for a direct effects model for each of the 5 negative symptoms. Objective negative symptom level, insight, primary appraisals and coping subscales all had significant direct effects on one or more domains of adjustment. In general, higher objective negative symptom levels, higher severity and distress appraisals, and greater reliance on avoidant forms of coping were associated with poorer adjustment. The direct effects of active and emotional forms of coping were less consistent and varied across symptoms and adjustment domains. Study 3B extended these findings by providing a limited amount of support for a mediated effects model. Appraisal and coping were found to act as mediators in some of the relations between objective indicators and subjective experience variables for alogia, attention problems and avolition. There was evidence that the impact of insight on coping was partly mediated by control appraisals. Coping partly mediated the relation between stress and adjustment, and appraisal and adjustment. Overall, this series of exploratory studies make a unique contribution to understanding the subjective experience of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. The proposed vulnerability-stress-coping model demonstrated utility in identifying variables important in the prediction of adjustment to individual negative symptoms, and in delineating the nature of associations between variables. Further research is required to improve the psychometric properties of the ACNSQ. However, it offers promise as an instrument with which to assess negative symptom appraisals and coping responses, in both clinical and research settings. The present findings have important theoretical and clinical implications concerning the role of subjective and objective factors involved in adjustment to the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. This research program provides a valuable foundation for future research to test the vulnerability-stress-coping model in its entirety.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">negative symptoms</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158520</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Measurement of Task Complexity and Cognitive Ability: Relational Complexity in Adult Reasoning</field><field name="creator">Birney, Damian Patrick</field><field name="description">The theory of relational complexity (RC) developed by Halford and his associates (Halford et al., 1998a) proposes that, in addition to the number of unique entities that can be processed in parallel, it is the structure (complexity) of the relations between these entities that most appropriately captures the essence of processing capacity limitations. Halford et al. propose that the relational complexity metric forms an ordinal scale along which both task complexity and an individual&#146;s processing capacity can be ranked. However, the underlying quantitative structure of the RC metric is largely unknown. It is argued that an assessment of the measurement properties of the RC metric is necessary to first demonstrate that the scale is able to rank order task complexity and cognitive capacity in adults. If in addition to ordinal ranking, it can be demonstrated that a continuous monotonic scale underlies the ranking of capacity (the natural extension of the complexity classification), then the potential to improve our understanding of adult cognition is further realised. Using a combination of cognitive psychology and individual differences methodologies, this thesis explores the psychometric properties of RC in three high level reasoning tasks. The Knight-Knave Task and the Sentence Comprehension Task come from the psychological literature. The third task, the Latin Square Task, was developed especially for this project to test the RC theory. An extensive RC analysis of the Knight-Knave Task is conducted using the Method for Analysis of Relational Complexity (MARC). Processing in the Knight-Knave Task has been previously explored using deduction-rules and mental models. We have taken this work as the basis for applying MARC and attempted to model the substantial demands these problems make on limited working memory resources in terms of their relational structure. The RC of the Sentence Comprehension Task has been reported in the literature and we further review and extend the empirically evidence for this task. The primary criterion imposed for developing the Latin Square Task was to minimize confounds that might weaken the identification and interpretation of a RC effect. Factors such as storage load and prior experience were minimized by specifying that the task should be novel, have a small number of general rules that could be mastered quickly by people of differing ages and abilities, and have no rules that are complexity level specific. The strength of MARC lies in using RC to explicitly link the cognitive demand of a task with the capacity of the individual. The cognitive psychology approach predicts performance decrements with increased task complexity and primarily deals with aggregated data across task condition (comparison of means). It is argued however that to minimise the subtle circularity created by validating a task&#146;s complexity using the same information that is used to validate the individual&#146;s processing capacity, an integration of the individual differences approach is necessary. The first major empirical study of the project evaluates the utility of the traditional dual-task approach to analyse the influence of the RC manipulation on the dual-task deficit. The Easy-to-Hard paradigm, a modification of the dual-task methodology, is used to explore the influence of individual differences in processing capacity as a function of RC. The second major empirical study explores the psychometric approach to cognitive complexity. The basic premise is that if RC is a manipulation of cognitive complexity in the traditional psychometric sense, then it should display similar psychometric properties. That is, increasing RC should result in an increasing monotonic relationship between task performance and Fluid Intelligence (Gf) &#150; the complexity-Gf effect. Results from the comparison of means approach indicates that as expected, mean accuracy and response times differed reliably as a function of RC. An interaction between RC and Gf on task performance was also observed. The pattern of correlations was generally not consistent across RC tasks and is qualitatively different in important ways to the complexity-Gf effect. It is concluded that the Latin Square Task has sufficient measurement properties to allows us to discuss (i) how RC differs from complexity in tasks in which expected patterns of correlations are observed, (ii) what additional information needs to be considered to assist with the a priori identification of task characteristics that impose high cognitive demand, and (iii) the implications for understanding reasoning in dynamic and unconstrained environments outside the laboratory. We conclude that relational complexity theory provides a strong foundation from which to explore the influence of individual differences in performance further.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">380199 Psychology not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">780108 Behavioural and cognitive sciences</field><field name="subject">intelligence</field><field name="subject">relational complexity</field><field name="subject">cogntive complexity</field><field name="subject">reasoning</field><field name="subject">latin square</field><field name="subject">processing limitations</field><field name="subject">comprehension</field><field name="subject">cognitive psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157930</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Methods of Understanding and Designing For Mobile Communities</field><field name="creator">Axup, Jeffrey Charles</field><field name="description">Society is increasingly on the move, mobile devices are commonly being used to coordinate group actions, and group communication features are rapidly being added to existing technologies. Despite this, little is known about how mobile groups act, or how communications technologies should be designed to augment existing behaviour. This is partially due to minimal research being done on the topic, but also to the lack of research methods available to study the topic with. Mobile groups are challenging to study because of frequent and long-duration movement, frequent distribution, and the rapidly changing environments they operate within. To address these issues, this research focuses on methodological issues surrounding the development of mobile devices for mobile groups and communities. More specifically it addresses backpackers, who are a relevant example of this type of community. The research primarily explores the convergence of computer supported cooperative work (CSCW) and the field of mobile device development. This enables the combination of emphasis on designing technologies for groups, social implications, mobile device design, and mobile settings. Major research outcomes presented in this thesis lie in three areas: 1) methods, 2) technology designs, and 3) backpacker culture. Five studies of backpacker behaviour and requirements form the core of the research. The methods used are in-situ and exploratory, and apply both novel and existing techniques to the domain of backpackers and mobile groups. Methods demonstrated in this research include: field trips for exploring mobile group behaviour and device usage, a social pairing exercise to explore social networks, contextual postcards to gain distributed feedback, and blog analysis which provides post-hoc diary data. Theoretical contributions include: observations on method triangulation, a taxonomy of mobility research, method templates to assist method usage, and identification of key categories leading to mobile group requirements. Design related outcomes include: 57 mobile tourism product ideas, a format for conveying product concepts, and a design for a wearable device to assist mobile researchers. Our understanding of backpacker culture has also improved as a consequence of the research. It has also generated user requirements to aid mobile development, methods of visualising mobile groups and communities, and a listing of relevant design tensions. Additionally, the research has added to our understanding of how new technologies such as blogs, SMS and iPods are being used by backpackers and how mobile groups naturally communicate.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">280302 Software Engineering</field><field name="subject">mobile communities</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158352</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Spatial and Temporal Distribution of the Metal Mineralisation in Eastern Australia and the Relationship of the Observed Patterns to Giant Ore Deposits</field><field name="creator">Robinson, Larry</field><field name="description">The introduced mineral deposit model (MDM) is the product of a trans-disciplinary study, based on Complexity and General Systems Theory. Both investigate the abstract organization of phenomena, independent of their substance, type, or spatial or temporal scale of existence. The focus of the research has been on giant, hydrothermal mineral deposits. They constitute &lt;0.001% of the total number of deposits yet contain 70-85% of the world's metal resources. Giants are the definitive exploration targets. They are more profitable to exploit and less susceptible to fluctuations of the market. Consensus has it that the same processes that generate small deposits also form giants but those processes are simply longer, vaster, and larger. Heat is the dominant factor in the genesis of giant mineral deposits. A paleothermal map shows where the vast heat required to generate a giant has been concentrated in a large space, and even allows us to deduce the duration of the process. To generate a paleothermal map acceptable to the scientific community requires reproducibility. Experimentation with various approaches to pattern recognition of geochemical data showed that the AUTOCLUST algorithm not only gave reproducibility but also gave the most consistent, most meaningful results. It automatically extracts boundaries based on Voronoi and Delaunay tessellations. The user does not specify parameters; however, the modeller does have tools to explore the data. This approach is near ideal in that it removes much of the humangenerated bias. This algorithm reveals the radial, spatial distribution, of gold deposits in the Lachlan Fold Belt of southeastern Australia at two distinct scales &#150; repeating patterns every ~80 km and ~230 km. Both scales of patterning are reflected in the geology. The ~80 km patterns are nested within the ~230 km patterns revealing a self-similar, geometrical relationship. It is proposed that these patterns originate from Rayleigh-B&#233;nard convection in the mantle. At the Rayleigh Number appropriate for the mantle, the stable planform is the spoke pattern, where hot mantle material is moving upward near the centre of the pattern and outward along the radial arms. Discontinuities in the mantle, Rayleigh-B&#233;nard convection in the mantle, and the spatial distribution of giant mineral deposits, are correlative. The discontinuities in the Earth are acting as platforms from which Rayleigh-B&#233;nard convection can originate. Shallow discontinuities give rise to plumelets, which manifest at the crust as repeating patterns ranging, from ~100 to ~1,000 km in diameter. Deeper discontinuities give rise to plumes, which become apparent at the crust as repeating patterns ranging from &gt;1,000 to ~4,000 km in diameter. The deepest discontinuities give rise to the superplumes, which become detectable at the crust as repeating patterns ranging from &gt;4,000 to &gt;10,000 km in diameter. Rayleigh-B&#233;nard convection concentrates the reservoir of heat in the mantle into specific locations in the crust; thereby providing the vast heat requirements for the processes that generate giant, hydrothermal mineral deposits. The radial spatial distribution patterns observed for gold deposits are also present for base metal deposits. At the supergiant Broken Hill deposit in far western New South Wales, Australia, the higher temperature Broken Hill-type deposits occur in a radial pattern while the lower temperature deposits occur in concentric patterns. The supergiant Broken Hill deposit occurs at the very centre of the pattern. If the supergiant Broken Hill Deposit was buried beneath alluvium, water or younger rocks, it would now be possible to predict its location with accuracy measured in tens of square kilometres. This predictive accuracy is desired by every exploration manager of every exploration company. The giant deposits at Broken Hill, Olympic Dam, and Mount Isa all occur on the edge of an annulus. There are at least two ways of creating an annulus on the Earth's surface. One is through Rayleigh-B&#233;nard convection and the other is through meteor impact. It is likely that only 'large' meteors (those &gt;10 km in diameter) would have any permanent impact on the mantle. Lesser meteors would leave only a superficial scar that would be eroded away. The permanent scars in the mantle act as &#145;accidental templates&#146; consisting of concentric and possibly radial fractures that impose those structures on any rocks that were subsequently laid down or emplaced over the mantle. In southeastern Australia, the proposed Deniliquin Impact structure has been an 'accidental template' providing a 'line-of-least-resistance' for the ascent of the ~2,000 km diameter, offshore, Cape Howe Plume. The western and northwestern radial arms of this plume have created the very geometry of the Lachlan Fold Belt, as well as giving rise to the spatial distribution of the granitic rocks in that belt and ultimately to the gold deposits. The interplay between the templating of the mantle by meteor impacts and the ascent of plumelets, plumes or superplumes from various discontinuities in the mantle is quite possibly the reason that mineral deposits occur where they do.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158588</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An historical assessment of economic development, manufacturing and the political economy in Queensland, 1900 to 1930</field><field name="creator">Cameron, David Bruce</field><field name="description" /><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">210303 Australian History (excl.

M.</field><field name="description">Metal accounting systems of mining and processing operations are coming under increasing scrutiny, primarily because of poor agreement between the estimates of mined metal and the quantity of metal actually produced by the concentrator, refiner or smelter. This scrutiny comes in the wake of scandals in the financial accounting world, which has put increased pressure on financial accountants to improve accounting transparency and auditability. This has, in turn, put the onus on metal accountants to examine the quality of their systems, since they form the basis of mining company financial accounts and reports. One weakness that has been identified in the area of metal accounting is a lack of continuity between many mine and mill (processing plant) accounting systems, which often show major discrepancies in production estimates (Baker and Giacomo, 2001). Mine-mill reconciliation is the term applied to the area of comparing, balancing and adjusting production estimates between mine and mill for consistency in reporting, and this thesis seeks to evaluate the concerns in this area and to find robust strategies to ameliorate these concerns. A review of metal accounting and mine-mill reconciliation practices reveals a large number of cultural and technical barriers preventing consistent and high-quality mine-mill reconciliation practice. Current measurement technologies and mathematical/statistical techniques available to the mining industry were also reviewed, and it is clear that application of these underutilised tools has the potential to vastly improve the quality and usefulness of mine-mill production measurement and accounting. Thus, in addition to the benefit of better accounting standards compliance, significant operational improvements may be realised through application of many of these tools and techniques. The approach used to achieve the thesis objectives is to collate a wide variety of available tools and techniques (along with some novel techniques developed) into a practical framework/strategy for undertaking mine-mill accounting and reconciliation. This approach is based on the notion that knowledge of measurement sources and uncertainty (error) is essential to control and improve production efficiency of the overall operation (as opposed to individual areas within). As such, a conceptual approach to mine-mill reconciliation is first proposed, which addresses many of the problem areas identified in the review. A detailed, step-by-step methodology applicable to most metal mining operations is then expanded from this framework, illustrated through a fictitious operation. This methodology is divided into two main parts, consisting of a metal accounting site survey followed by the metal balancing, reconciliation and reporting process. One element of particular importance in this process is ore tracking through process hold-ups, and some approaches to examining this issue are discussed in detail and demonstrated. The proposed mine-mill metal accounting and reconciliation methodology was applied to two very different case studies, Northparkes Mines (NPM) and Potgietersrust Platinums Limited (PPRust). The NPM case study showed application of the entire methodology to a mining and processing operation. For PPRust, only particular elements of the methodology were applied to exhibit the flexibility of the methodology and demonstrate its application through example. The product of this methodology is a practical, yet still somewhat conceptual, methodology that can be applied to most metal mining operations in order to maximise the potential of their mine-mill accounting and reconciliation. The strategy proposed has uncovered a number of significant implications to the mining industry, such as: &#8226; Better understanding of the sources of and uncertainty in production estimates can lead to better system control, system auditability and reporting integrity, which should elevate operational credibility in the eyes of mining company financial accountants, analysts and stakeholders at a &#8220;license to operate&#8221; level. &#8226; Dissolving the traditional mine-mill boundary and focussing on best utilising the most accurate and precise production information over the entire operation provides an improved basis for operational decision making and economic calculations. &#8226; Using an ore tracking system that can link mill production measurements of in-process ore back to its original location in the deposit can provide a robust means of evaluating mine production efficiency, of evaluating mine model performance and, potentially, of updating reported reserve estimates based on statistically sound information. Though this work does not represent a complete solution to mine-mill reconciliation, it provides strong conceptual goals and a solid technical foundation for future work in this area.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:171412</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding indigenous entrepreneurship: A case study analysis</field><field name="creator">Foley. Denis L.</field><field name="description">This PhD research project views and examines the socio-economic environment of the urban Indigenous Australian entrepreneur. The proposed research project explores Indigenous entrepreneurs. As they experience enlightenment, empowerment and emancipation through success in business, do they identify less with Indigenous culture and more with the Anglo-European values of the dominant Australian or American culture? Do successful Indigenous entrepreneurs, in effect, need to take on or adopt values of the dominant Anglo-European culture to remain successful in business? Are there impediments/inhibitors existing that restrict business growth and subsequent success to the Indigenous entrepreneur? From case study analysis and literature review, is the Indigenous entrepreneur different in comparison with the non-indigenous entrepreneur? Does entrepreneurship free the Indigenous business person from the welfare system? These are the questions that this research attempts to answer. The project involved a case study analysis of twenty five contemporary urban Indigenous Australian entrepreneurs geographically spread from Hobart, Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane and Cairns and a few major regional centres. The Hawaiian study was similar with twenty five case studies from the major urban centres on the islands of Oahu, Molokai, Kauai, Hawaii and Maui. The Hawaiian study also included a control study of sixteen non-Hawaiian minority entrepreneurs to ensure that the Hawaiian findings were objective. Indigenous Standpoint theory was applied together with a Grounded theory approach to ensure that the research was based in an Indigenous epistemological approach to knowledge. Constant comparative coding was used to ensure the qualitative data was analysed using a semi structured format. The outcomes of the study provide a rich insight into the world of minority entrepreneurs who operate within post-colonial cultures of western dominance and negative stereotypes that have created welfare dependant societies. In summary the outcomes identify that the intrinsic motivator for Indigenous entrepreneurs is to provide for their family, to give their children a better life than what they experienced, and to escape the entrapments of poverty. Racism and discrimination combined with lack of capital and access to micro-credit were seen as the major inhibitors to business success. The Indigenous entrepreneurs are struggling to cast off the shackles of welfare, to no longer be at the mercy of successive government programmes. The study results indicate that success in small enterprise undertakings by Indigenous entrepreneurs is a move up from self management, success in entrepreneurial activity is self-determination for those entrepreneurs. The end result is one of micro-economic reform within the Indigenous families who benefit from the success in small business enterprise and entrepreneurial activity. Indigenous values in Hawaii were maintained with a strong connection to land and language, whether it be spoken or not by the entrepreneur. It was the values attached to language that included a strong work ethic, maturity and respect that were seen to be dominant issues. Within Indigenous Australia the result of genocide inflicted on successive Indigenous generations has not destroyed Indigenous Australian culture altogether. Strong views remain concerning protocol and ethics, what has evolved are contemporary Indigenous values that allow the Indigenous Australian to maintain cultural standards revolving around kinship in contemporary Australia.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field

It also studies the phe- nomenon of optical power limiting which utilizes self-focusing e ects. As an analytical tool, a mode decomposition method which uses an orthogonal and complete set of Gaussian-Laguerre modes as a basis set is used to treat these problems. Nonlinear media both in the thin and thick limits are investigated. For thin media, a closed form expression is derived which describes the optical eld of an initally Gaussian beam that is perturbed by a thin nonlinear material which exhibits nonlinear absorption as well as nonlinear refraction. This result is valid for any regime of nonlinearity in the thin medium approximation. Thick media are treated using a numerical extension of the Gaussian-Laguerre Mode Decomposition technique. Spatial scanning techniques such as the Z-scan that rely on self-focusing e ects and that are used to measure the nonlinear optical parameters of a material are studied in detail. Optical limiting in both thick and thin media is also investigated.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nonlinear self-focusing</field><field name="subject">Gaussian-Laguerre Mode Decomposition</field><field name="subject">Optical limiting</field><field name="subject">Z-scan</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:189372</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The economic impact of Noosa national park: An holistic assessment</field><field name="creator">Pearson, Leonie</field><field name="description" /><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">150601 Impacts of Tourism</field><field name="subject">340202 Environment and Resource Economics</field><field name="subject">729999 Economic issues not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">National parks and reserves -- Economic aspects -- Queensland -- Sunshine Coast Region.</field><field name="subject">Noosa National Park (Qld.)</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:189515</field></doc><doc><field name="title">High school musicals in Queensland</field><field name="creator">Collings, Paul</field><field name="description" /><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Musicals -- Queensland</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:189499</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Federalism and local government in Queensland</field><field name="creator">Berbudeau, C.

chromatin distribution in cell nuclei with application to cervical cancer screening</field><field name="creator">Andrew J. H. Mehnert</field><field name="description">This thesis describes a set of image analysis tools developed for the purpose of quantifying the distribution of chromatin in (light) microscope images of cell nuclei. The distribution or pattern of chromatin is influenced by both external and internal variations of the cell environment, including variations associated with the cell cycle, neoplasia, apoptosis, and malignancy associated changes (MACs). The quantitative characterisation of this pattern makes possible the prediction of the biological state of a cell, or the detection of subtle changes in a population of cells. This has important application to automated cancer screening. The majority of existing methods for quantifying chromatin distribution (texture) are based on the stochastic approach to defining texture. However, it is the premise of this thesis that the structural approach is more appropriate because pathologists use terms such as clumping, margination, granulation, condensation, and clearing to describe chromatin texture, and refer to the regions of condensed chromatin as granules, particles, and blobs. The key to the structural approach is the segmentation of the chromatin into its texture primitives. Unfortunately all of the chromatin segmentation algorithms published in the literature suffer from one or both of the following drawbacks: (i) a segmentation that is not consistent with a human's perception of blobs, particles, or granules; and (ii) the need to specify, a priori, one or more subjective operating parameters. The latter drawback limits the robustness of the algorithm to variations in illumination and staining quality. The structural model developed in this thesis is based on several novel low-, med-ium-, and high-level image analysis tools. These tools include: a class of non-linear self-dual filters, called folding induced self-dual filters, for filtering impulse noise; an algorithm, based on seeded region growing, for robustly segmenting chromatin; an improved seeded region growing algorithm that is independent of the order of pixel processing; a fast priority queue implementation suitable for implementing the watershed transform (special case of seeded region growing); the adjacency graph attribute co-occurrence matrix (AGACM) method for quantifying blob and mosaic patterns in the plane; a simple and fast algorithm for computing the exact Euclidean distance transform for the purpose of deriving contextual features (measurements) and constructing geometric adjacency graphs for disjoint connected components; a theoretical result establishing an equivalence between the distance transform of a binary image and the grey-scale erosion of its characteristic function by an elliptic poweroid structuring element; and a host of chromatin features that can be related to qualitative descriptions of chromatin distribution used by pathologists. In addition, this thesis demonstrates the application of this new structural model to automated cervical cancer screening. The results provide empirical evidence that it is possible to detect differences in the pattern of nuclear chromatin between samples of cells from a normal Papanicolaou-stained cervical smear and those from an abnormal smear. These differences are supportive of the existence of the MACs phenomenon. Moreover the results compare favourably with those reported in the literature for other stains developed specifically for automated cytometry. To the author's knowledge this is the first time, based on a sizable and uncontaminated data set, that MACs have been demonstrated in Papanicolaou stain. This is an important finding because the primary screening test for cervical cancer, the Papanicolaou test, is based on this stain.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321203 Health Information Systems (incl.

The central hypothesis of the thesis is that the equity risk premium, combined with the public nature of toll roads, makes private financing of this kind of public infrastructure undesirable. It attempts to test this hypothesis by valuing the project under standard CAPM and WACC frameworks, and then modelling the sensitivity of the project&#8217;s value to different assumptions regarding traffic flows, inflation, asset risk, and errors in operating-cost forecasts. The results show that with large equity contributions the project is inherently unstable and given the finance structure, was always susceptible to a downward price spiral of the type observed. The thesis then models the project value under a public finance option and concludes that this is a more beneficial option for investors, the government, and the community alike.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">14 Economics</field><field name="subject">Equity Premium Puzzle</field><field name="subject">Public finance</field><field name="subject">Public Private Partnerships</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:213089</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improved riffle washer design for the Australian sultana industry</field><field name="creator">Foley, Joseph P</field><field name="description">Thesis (MEng)--University of South Australia, 1996.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dried fruit industry</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/82644</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:43291</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Emergency nurses' encounters with difficult patients : an analysis of five published anecdotal accounts</field><field name="creator">Foley, David</field><field name="description">Thesis (MNursing (Advanced Practice))--University of South Australia, 1996.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Emergency nursing</field><field name="subject">Nurse and patient</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/84910</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:42991</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A randomised controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of different exercise frequencies for maintaining rehabilitation outcomes for older adults</field><field name="creator">Foley, Amanda Lee</field><field name="description">Research has shown the benefits of exercise are transient and gains achieved in geriatric rehabilitation progams are not maintained post discharge.

A different teaching approach, by committed experienced teachers, was used in each course. In evaluating their effectiveness, I focused on affective change in the students, relating this to their achievement. This study contributes to research on understanding good teaching of mathematics to adults. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected over several years. Methods included: a questionnaire (including mathematics attitude and belief scales as well as demographic and open questions); interviews with students to gather more affective data and explore their reactions to the course approach; and the individual supervised study course was audio-taped for six months. Teachers of the larger courses were also interviewed about their goals for, and experiences with, the students. These multiple strands of evidence provide a complex overall picture of three, largely successful, teaching approaches. Each measure had its own contribution to make, and taken together they illuminated the ways in which affective change was related to ackevement in the three contexts. The higher achieving groups in each of the two larger courses entered the courses with more positive attitudes and beliefs than the lower achieving groups and subsequent affective changes reinforced these differences. The lower achieving groups completed the courses affectively worse off than when they started, Students' reactions to these approaches were compared and found to reflect the nature of the approach. In addition to this finding, successhl students' beliefs about mathematics changed in two of the courses. In the one-to-one course the teacher focused initially on understanding the students' fear of mathematics and early mathematical experiences. The student-focused teaching approach trusted and encouraged the growth of ths student's mathematical thinking. Six months later the student felt empowered and had come to believe that mathematics as a creative and enjoyable process of discovering patterns. The second course focused on the mathematization of realistic situations. Successful students came to regard mathematics as useful, interesting, relating to real life. Successful students in the third course appreciated the carefully structured reintroduction to mathematics and were pleased they could finally do the mathematics they hadn't been able to understand at high school.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Education, Mathematics (0280)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/42</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multiple Objective Linear Programming in Radiotherapy Treatment Planning</field><field name="creator">Shao, Lizhen</field><field name="description">The aim of intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is to kill tumor cells while at the same time protecting the surrounding tissue and organs from the damaging effect of radiation. To achieve these goals computerized inverse planning systems are used. Given the number of beams and beam directions, beam intensity profiles that yield the best dose distribution under consideration of clinical and physical constraints are calculated. This is called beam intensity optimization problem. In this thesis, we first review existing mathematical models and computation methods for the beam intensity optimization problem. Next, we formulate the beam intensity optimization problem as a multiobjective linear programme (MOLP) with three objectives. For clinical cases this optimization problem involves thousands of variables and tens of thousands of constraints and existing methods such as multiobjective simplex methods can not handle it. The rest of the thesis is dedicated to developing methods to solve this large MOLP efficiently and to the application in the beam intensity optimization problem. Benson (1998c) argues that solving an MOLP in objective space needs less computation time than solving it in decision space if the number of objectives of the MOLP is much smaller than the number of variables. Moreover, the constraint matrix of the problem relies on the calculation of dose deposited in tissue. Since this calculation is always imprecise solving the MOLP exactly is not necessary in practice. This motivates us to develop algorithms for solving an MOLP in objective space approximately. We summarize Benson&#8217;s outer approximation algorithm for solving MOLPs in objective space and propose some small changes to improve computational performance. Then in order to approximate the true nondominated set we propose a modification of Benson&#8217;s algorithm which is called an approximation version of Benson&#8217;s algorithm. Our approximation algorithm computes an inner and an outer approximation of the nondominated set. We prove that the inner approximation provides a set of &#949;-nondominated points. The geometric duality theory of Heyde and L&#168;ohne (2006) defines a dual to an MOLP and it assures us to be able to find the nondominated set of the primal MOLP by solving its dual MOLP. Based on this we develop a dual variant of Benson&#8217;s outer approximation algorithm to solve the dual MOLP in objective space. We prove that solving the dual provides a weight set decomposition. We compare the primal algorithm and the dual algorithm on small illustrative and on radiotherapy examples. Furthermore, we propose an algorithm to solve the dual MOLP approximately but within specified tolerance. This approximate solution set can be used to calculate an approximation of the nondominated set of the primal MOLP.We show that this set is an &#949;-nondominated set of the original primal MOLP and provide numerical evidence that this approach can be faster than solving the primal MOLP approximately. Considering that the set of nondominated points is infinite, it is not very useful from the planners&#8217; point of view. We address the problem of finding well distributed nondominated points for an MOLP.We propose a method which combines the global shooting and normal boundary intersection methods. By doing so, we overcome the limitation of normal boundary intersection method that parts of the nondominated set may be missed. Discrepancy analysis of the nondominated points from a geometry point of view shows that this method produces evenly distributed nondominated  points. Moreover, the coverage error and the uniformity level can be measured. Finally, we apply the algorithms developed to the beam intensity optimization problem of 3D clinical cases with voxel size of 5mm and 3mm. A technique of reducing the resolution in normal tissue has been used to reduce the computation time. The results clearly illustrate the advantages of our methods.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2478</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ng&#257; whakawhitinga: standing at the crossroads :  M&#257;ori ways of understanding extra-ordinary experiences and schizophrenia.</field><field name="creator">Taitimu, Melissa</field><field name="description">Indigenous peoples and ethnic minorities are being diagnosed with schizophrenia at significantly higher rates than majority groups all around the world.  Aetiological literature reveals a wide range of causal explanations including biogenetic, social and cultural factors.  A major limitation of this body of research is the assumption of schizophrenia as a universal syndrome.  When viewed through an indigenous lens, experiences labelled schizophrenic by Western psychiatry have been found to vary from culture to culture in terms of content, meaning and outcome.  The current project aimed to investigate M&#257;ori ways of understanding experiences commonly labelled &#8216;schizophrenic&#8217;.  The philosophical frameworks that guided the research were Kaupapa M&#257;ori Theory and Personal Construct Theory.  A qualitative approach was used and semi-structured interviews were conducted with 57 participants including tangata whaiora (service users), tohunga (traditional healers), kaumatua/kuia (elders), P&#257;keh&#257; clinicians, M&#257;ori clinicians, cultural support workers and students.  Four categories were derived from qualitative thematic analysis.  These being: making sense of the experiences, pathways of healing, making sense of the statistics and what can we do about the statistics.  Overall, M&#257;ori constructions related to other indigenous constructions of mental illness and wellbeing cited in the international literature but were in stark contrast to current psychiatric constructions.  The current project indicated M&#257;ori participants held multiple explanatory models for extra-ordinary experiences with the predominant explanations being spiritual.  Other explanations included psychosocial constructions (trauma and drug abuse), historical trauma (colonisation) and biomedical constructions (chemical brain imbalance).  Based on these findings, recommendations for the development of culturally appropriate assessment and treatment processes are presented. Over the last couple of centuries a single paradigm, the medical model, has come to dominate the explanation and treatment of illness in Western society.  Via legal and political means, indigenous models of illness and wellness have been wiped out or forced to the margins of many societies.  This thesis aims to challenge the dominant medical model that has privileged psychiatric knowledges while suppressing others by repositioning indigenous construction at the centre of the research via a Kaupapa M&#257;ori framework. Chapter One aims to deconstruct current medical constructions by presenting psychiatry as a culture in itself as opposed to a discipline dedicated to scientific truths.  This chapter posits that the culture of psychiatry has lead many clinicians to suffer from &#8220;cultural blindness&#8221; when working with indigenous and ethnic minority groups.  Chapter One uses the tools of science to question the scientific validity and reliability of the construct &#8220;schizophrenia&#8221;.  I conclude that this construct is &#8220;unscientific&#8221; in itself.  I will also look at three themes highlighted by other researchers regarding the treatment of mental illness throughout Western history: treatments are used as a form of social control; treatments can be dehumanising; and the dominance and power of the medical model to define who and what is considered ill.   Chapter One also acknowledges the significant role of the consumer movement in developing more humane treatments.  Interactions between culture and psychiatry via colonisation are outlined in Chapter Two. I also critique research that is conducted cross culturally in terms of whether researchers attempt to establish the reliability of universal diagnoses or recognise local and unique constructions.  Chapter Two challenges the commonly cited finding of higher rates of schizophrenia for ethnic minorities and indigenous peoples by questioning the validity of foreign cultural constructs to explain indigenous forms of illness.  This chapter recognises indigenous and cultural constructions of what psychiatry labels &#8216;schizophrenic&#8217;.  To illustrate, three &#8216;culture bound syndromes&#8217; will be discussed.  The development of indigenous psychological paradigms is also presented to position the current research within this wider international movement.  Chapter Three summarises M&#257;ori constructions of illness and wellness.  This chapter predominantly draws from early anthropological literature and subsequent psychological studies to represent the resilience of M&#257;ori constructions of experiences commonly labelled schizophrenic.  In accordance with the experiences of other indigenous populations, this chapter also recognises the impact of colonisation on M&#257;ori beliefs and practices relevant to maintaining wellness.  To illustrate the effect of colonisation, disparities in statistics between M&#257;ori and non-M&#257;ori for admissions and readmissions to inpatients units for psychotic disorders will be discussed.  Explanations for these disparities will also be outlined.  Within Chapter Three, the resistance and revival of M&#257;ori constructions is also recognised as a function of the development of bicultural and Kaupapa M&#257;ori Services.  Chapter Four, summarises the theoretical orientation of the research.  This research is qualitative and assumes a post-modern critical paradigm.  Two theoretical frameworks were used within this research (Kaupapa M&#257;ori Theory and Personal Construct Theory) to represent the two worlds in which the research was conducted (Indigenous and Western).  Chapter Five outlines the methodology by recounting a somewhat layered journey.  Within the first section, &#8216;Who am I&#8217;, I have positioned myself by sharing my journey towards conducting this project.  The second section, &#8216;Where did I want to go&#8217;, outlines the research aims and process of consultation.  The final section summarises &#8216;What I did&#8217; in terms of qualitative interviews and the process undertaken for interpretation and presentation of the data.  Chapter Six presents the results of the research according to the four categories developed from qualitative analysis.  These were: &#8216;Making sense of extra-ordinary experiences&#8217;, &#8216;Pathways of healing&#8217;, &#8216;Making sense of the statistics&#8217; and &#8216;What can we do about the statistics&#8217;.  Within this chapter I have attempted to present quotes with as little interpretation as possible (over and above sorting of themes) to allow the reader to make their own interpretations before reading the discussion.  Chapter Seven summarises the major findings from each category and relates the results to the national and international literature.  Clinical and theoretical implications are discussed with recommendations for future research.  The limitations and strengths of the research are highlighted and conclusions drawn from the research journey.  The plan for dissemination is also presented.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">M&#257;ori psychology</field><field name="subject">schizophrenia</field><field name="subject">Kaupapa M&#257;ori theory</field><field name="subject">Indigenous psychology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::220000 Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts-General</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3367</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of UHF communications on overhead earth-wires in power transmission networks</field><field name="creator">Castle, N. J.</field><field name="description">The motivation for this research is a proposed UHF surface wave communication system in which the waveguides are the stranded, overhead earth wires of Power System transmission lines. Attention is confined largely to an investigation of certain aspects which affect the overall surfaces wave transmission loss, a full-scale system having been set up in the laboratory for experimental purposes. For the prediction of transmission loss the stranded conductor is assumed to be equivalent to a solid conductor of the same diameter but with surface anisotropy in the form of two mutually orthogonal surface impedances the major reactive component of which is attributed to the effects of the helical stranding. This reactance is determined from a consideration of the fields which are assumed to exist within the cavities between the strands, and externally. From a comparison between experimental and theoretical loss characteristics there is sufficient inducement to accept the anisotropic model of the stranded conductor for practical design purposes. Approximate equations are developed to simplify the calculation of transmission loss and the notion of &#8216;capture cross-section&#8217; is employed for the estimation of the efficiency of conical horn launchers. It is deduced from &#8216;sensitivity&#8217; relationships that the horn loss is relatively insensitive to small changes in the fictitious surface reactance representing the effects of helical stranding, which tends to justify the assumptions upon which the anisotropic model is based. On the other hand, variations in the helix angle are shown to have a marked effect upon the calculated horn loss. This influences the choice of the stranded conductor used as the waveguide for the experimental verification of the model. The Author&#8217;s experimental research is described at length, the principal objective being to establish the anisotropic model as an acceptable theoretical substitute for the stranded conductor. To reduce the horn loss, dielectric sheaths are ted to the waveguide in the vicinity of the horn apertures. The discrepancies which then appear between theory and experiment are attributed both to the scattering of the surface wave by the boundary discontinuities at the ends of the sheaths and to the anomalous behaviour of commercial-grade PVC dielectric. Considering the increase in the transmission efficiency which may be realised by fitting dielectric sheaths to the conductor near the horn apertures it is concluded that a theoretical investigation of the scattering properties of the discontinuities  s in order. Thus, the remainder of the Thesis is devoted, to this scattering effect as it may be encountered in the proposed scheme, the theoretical analysis following the lines of earlier documented research. A short-cut method is applied for the determination of certain &#8216;half-plane&#8217; functions which appear in the expressions for the scattered power. Theoretical results are presented together with a discussion of some experimental measurements and a brief theoretical examination of the effects on the horn loss of varying the thickness of the dielectric sheaths. It is argued that the horn loss may be reduced if the dielectric thickness is graded in steps to a value at the horn apertures consistent with the desired &#8216;power capture&#8217;. The Thesis is concluded with an Addendum which outlines a number of topics suggested by the Author for future research.</field><field name="date">1976</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290900 Electrical and Electronic Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2542</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The characterisation and application of natural fibre reinforcements for liquid composite moulding processes</field><field name="creator">Umer, Rehan</field><field name="description">Liquid Composite Moulding (LCM) processes are commonly used techniques for the manufacture of fibre reinforced plastic components. The range of LCM processes addresses manufacturing scenarios from low to high volume. This study explores the potential of natural fibres as reinforcement for LCM preforms, considering discontinuous fibre mats produced using several novel methods. Modified paper manufacturing techniques were employed to produce two types of wet formed wood fibre mats, the other two being manufactured using dry methods. The natural fibre reinforcements considered in this study have been characterised with regard to permeability and compaction response, such that their application to a wide range of LCM processes can be evaluated. Reinforcement permeability and compaction response data are required to simulate LCM processes. Permeability of all four types of wood fibre mats was measured as a function of fibre volume fraction. The dry compaction response of these mats has been investigated, with the compression loads being measured up to a fibre volume fraction of 0.4. A complex non-elastic compression response was observed which has significant influence on forces generated within moulds. Saturated compaction tests were also carried out, the samples infiltrated with a test fluid (mineral oil). These results were compared to typical glass fibre mats used for LCM processes. It was found that the wood fibre mats have permeability two orders of magnitude lower, and required significantly larger force to compact to at similar fibre volume fractions as compared to glass fibre reinforcements. Model fluids are used extensively for LCM characterisation experiments because of ease of handling and chemical stability. The influence of test fluid type on permeability and compaction response of four manufactured wood fibre mats has been determined using two different test fluids, a water based polar fluid (glucose syrup) and a non polar fluid (mineral oil). It was found that glucose syrup caused fibre softening and swelling which reduced the required compaction loads, and permeability of a wood fibre mat. On the other hand, mineral oil did not cause any fibre softening and swelling. The effect of geometrical parameters such as reinforcing fibre bundle diameter and length on characterisation was also determined. Six different types of flax fibre yarn mats were manufactured. A series of compaction tests were carried out on both dry and saturated samples. Saturated permeability was also measured at a number of fibre volume fraction levels. The fibre bundling reduced compaction forces and increased permeability of a mat. Composite panels were manufactured using an epoxy resin to visualise the penetration of resin into yarns and fibre cells. The reinforcement permeability and compaction response data were used to model two LCM variants, Resin Transfer Moulding (RTM), and Injection Compression Moulding (I/CM). A consolidation model approach was applied to simulate both RTM and I/CM processes, addressing a simple mould geometry. The RTM and I/CM clamping force traces, flow rates, and gate pressures were also measured. The simulation results have been compared with experiments completed for wood and glass fibre reinforcements at three different fibre volume fractions. It was found that at similar fibre volume fractions, the wood fibre mats produced longer mould filling times, and required larger forces to compact.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3371</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adaptation of Cambodians in New Zealand: achievement, cultural identity and community development</field><field name="creator">Liev, Man Hau</field><field name="description">This thesis has two foci: how Cambodians with a refugee background manage their new life in Aotearoa/New Zealand, and how an identity as a Khmer Kiwi transnational community has developed. Analytic concepts&#8212; such as forced migration, cultural bereavement, adaptation, integration, diaspora, transnationalism, identification, and community of practice&#8212; are used to trace the trajectory of the contemporary way of life of Cambodians, their community development, and their cultural identity. The data gathered from mixedmethod research reveal the various opinions, strategies, coping mechanisms, and paths that Cambodian participants have adopted in order to adapt to life in New Zealand and still maintain their Khmer heritage. The majority of participants were proud of their personal achievements, and now have found normalcy in their new life. Individual struggles to engage and integrate with multicultural New Zealand society have required negotiation and protection of group interests, and inevitably some of these have resulted in conflicts and fragmentation within the Khmer community. Religious practice, organisation, and leadership became the main driving forces for asserting Khmer community identity. Collective memory was harnessed to deal with shared cultural bereavement, and the quest for belonging lent momentum to the community&#8217;s development and management of its identity. Khmer Theravada Buddhism has emerged as a means by which the majority of Cambodians can achieve their spiritual wellbeing, and has become a platform for various community identity developments within the New Zealand social and legal contexts. Gender roles and structures are a significant part of community development and of my analysis. This development of Khmer identity in New Zealand is a new strand of Khmer identity: Khmer heritage, transnational experience, and &#8216;Kiwi-ism&#8217;. Such transformation of identity reflects geo-political influences on integration in the form of belonging to and identifying with two or more groups. For example, the majority of participants proudly identified themselves as Khmer Kiwis. Their transnational lives have been enriched by their country of origin (Cambodia) and their country of residence (Aotearoa/New Zealand). Key words: Cambodian refugees, forced migration, adaptation, integration, transnationalism, Buddhism, Khmer identity, community development, and community of practice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420305 New Zealand cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3362</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of chemical gradients across porous silicon sensors</field><field name="creator">Thompson, Corrina</field><field name="description">This thesis investigated the formation of compositional gradients across 0.5 &#8211; 1 cm of porous silicon layers which had thicknesses of 2 &#8211; 10 &#956;m. These compositional gradients were then characterised, and their potential use as vapour sensors was probed. Surface composition gradients have been reported on flat surfaces, but this is the first time that they have been reported on a three-dimensional material with controlled pore geometry. Chemical gradients have been generated across the surface of porous silicon by performing electrochemical attachment of organohalides with an asymmetric electrode arrangement, and by chemical hydrosilylation of alkenes in the presence of a diffusion gradient of diazonium salts across the porous silicon surface. Samples with electrochemical gradients of methyl, pentyl acetate, and decyl and using chemical hydrosilylation with gradients of undecanoic acid and decyl groups. The latter four gradient-modified porous silicon types have been &#8216;endcapped&#8217; with methyl groups to give improved stability and greater hydrophobicity. The pentyl acetate and undecanoic groups have been converted into pentanol and undecanoate groups respectively to increase the hydrophilicity of these porous silicon surfaces. The gradients have been characterised using two-dimensional FTIR microspectrophotometry and water contact angle measurements. The interaction of these gradient porous silicon samples with ethanol, heptane, toluene and 2-hexanol vapours have been monitored either by UV-Vis reflectance spectroscopy at selected points across the surface or more globally using a digital camera. The undecanoate gradient porous silicon sample showed a large difference in optical response between the undecanoate end and the methyl end of the gradient when exposed to water vapour, showing that imposition of a chemical gradient can alter the sensing character of porous silicon in a controllable manner.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5167</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Surface properties and finishing of aluminium casting alloys</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Chuong Luu</field><field name="description">Aluminium alloys are materials of huge practical importance. However their use is dependent on surface oxides and hydroxides which are critical in protecting the highly reactive underlying metal. The stability and integrity of the oxides and hydroxides are also crucial in finishing and bonding applications. Better understanding of these surfaces has significant implications in enhancing their application. LM6 and LM25 aluminium-silicon casting alloys were studied as these materials show a particularly inhomogeneous phase structure and complex surface behaviour. This complexity is of fundamental interest and leads to considerable practical difficulties, especially in surface finishing. The surfaces were characterised, subjected to thermal treatments and modified with Ion Assisted Deposition coatings of TiN. A characterisation method for these surfaces was also developed based around the layered structure of aluminium hydroxides. It was observed that the thermally induced surface segregation of minor elements, such as Mg and Na, is availability-limited. Surface concentrations of these elements are determined by the net effect of enriching via surface segregation and depleting through surface evaporation. The inhomogeneous phase structure of the alloys used in this study enables the observation of two migration processes driven by different forces. Below the oxide dominated surface layer, the migration of Mg is driven by chemical potential gradient and is primarily perpendicular to the surface. Closer to the surface, concentration driven horizontal diffusion of the element occurs. The deposition of a thin TiN layer has been used to probe the interface. While the deposition conditions of TiN coatings affect the chemistry of the coatings, substrate surface conditions determine how well bonding is achieved between the film and substrate. The height difference between silicon particles in the eutectic phase and the primary aluminium phase of the casting alloys provides surface roughening and optimal adhesion through mechanical interlocking with the coating. This height difference is achieved by preferentially removing the surface exposed primary aluminium phases with ion bombardment.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5633</field></doc><doc><field name="title">3D visualisation and analysis of skin lymphatic drainage patterns in melanoma</field><field name="creator">Reynolds, Hayley Maria</field><field name="description">This thesis aimed to improve visualisation and analysis of potential patterns of melanoma spread from the skin to lymph nodes. For this purpose, anatomically based geometric models of the skin and lymph nodes have been created. A three-dimensional (3D) finite element (FE) skin model has been constructed using the Visible Human (VH) male dataset and a Sawbones head and neck model. A discrete lymph node model was also created using the VH dataset. This study has been conducted in collaboration with the SydneyMelanoma Unit (SMU), in Sydney, Australia. Clinicians at the SMU have recorded an extensive lymphoscintigraphy (LS) database, accurately mapping skin lymphatic drainage from over 5000 patients with cutaneous melanoma. The SMU&#8217;s entire LS database was mapped from two-dimensional LS images onto the 3D anatomical model. Melanoma sites were mapped onto the skin model using free-form deformation and projection techniques, while draining node fields were mapped onto a reduced lymph node model. Spatial heat maps were created using field fitting to visualise the likelihood that any area of skin would drain to a particular node field, or a specified number of node fields. An interactive skin selection tool was also developed to provide dynamic predictions of the draining node fields from any region of skin. The heat maps and interactive skin selection tool quantified that lymphatic drainage of the torso was highly complex, where the most unpredictable regions were located near Sappey&#8217;s lines. Drainage from skin on the upper and lower limbs was the most predictable, almost always draining to ipsilateral axillary and groin node fields respectively. Skin on the head and neck were shown to usually drain to two or more node fields, where the most common node fields were the cervical level II and preauricular node fields. Detailed statistical analysis was then conducted to investigate widely accepted assumptions about lymphatic drainage. Sappey&#8217;s lines were shown to be highly inaccurate at predicting lymphatic drainage from the skin of the torso. At least 12.5% of all melanoma sites located on the torso showed drainage across Sappey&#8217;s lines, and nearly the entire torso demonstrated ambiguous lymphatic drainage. A multinomial statistical model was fitted to the LS data to investigate whether lymphatic drainage was symmetric about the body&#8217;s vertical midline. Results showed that a significant proportion of the skin was likely to have symmetric lymphatic drainage patterns. Asymmetry that was shown within specific regions was likely due to an asymmetric distribution of melanoma sites within that region and/or a sparsity of data. Regions that indicated symmetry were reflected, providing a larger LS dataset to improve the statistical accuracy of drainage predictions. A cluster analysis was conducted using this reflected LS dataset to group regions of skin that drained in a similar manner. Results indicated that the dominant axillary, groin, cervical level II and preauricular node fields drained significant areas of skin. Clustering resulted in division of the torso into regions similar to Sappey&#8217;s lines, although an additional cluster formed in the middle of the anterior and posterior torso where predominantly ambiguous lymphatic drainage occurred. Confidence intervals were calculated using non-parametric bootstrapping to further determine the statistical accuracy of drainage predictions from each of these clusters.

PR-104, a  hypoxia-activated prodrug in clinical trial, is a phosphate ester which is rapidly  converted to the alcohol PR-104A, and then activated by reduction to hydroxylamine  (PR-104H) and amine (PR-104M) metabolites selectively in hypoxic cells. This thesis  explores the pharmacology of PR-104. The primary objectives were to define  relationships between metabolic transformation of PR-104, its toxicity to normal  tissues, its clearance from the body, and its antitumour activity in preclinical models.  DNA damage responsible for cytotoxicity of PR-104A was characterised by comparing  sensitivity of repair-defective Chinese hamster ovary cell lines with their repair-competent  counterparts. The activated metabolites PR-104H and PR-104M showed a  repair profile similar to typical DNA interstrand crosslinking agents, including  dependence on the ERCC1-XPF endonuclease (implicated in unhooking DNA  interstrand crosslinks at blocked replication forks) and Rad51D (required for  homologous recombination repair). PR-104A cytotoxicity under hypoxia is accounted  for by DNA crosslinking by these reduced metabolites. This study showed that hypoxia, reductase activity, and DNA interstrand crosslink repair proficiency are key  variables that interact to determine PR-104A sensitivity.  PR-104 was rapidly excreted in mice, with approximately equal excretion in urine and  faeces. Investigation of pathways of biotransformation in mice, rats, dogs and humans  identified major species difference in biotransformation of PR-104 in that N-dealkylation  and subsequent metabolites from the mercapturic acid pathway was major  in rodents, while O-glucuronidation of PR-104A much more extensive in dogs and  humans. The nitroreduction pathway was found in all species, with different patterns in  that PR-104M was prominent in rodents but PR-104H was higher in humans. Overall,  the results suggest that rodents may not be appropriate for modelling human  biotransformation and toxicology of PR-104.  A rapid and sensitive UHPLC-MS/MS method was developed for quantitation of the  major metabolites of PR-104 in humans. Application to plasma samples from phase I  clinical trials demonstrated approximately dose-linear pharmacokinetics but high variability between individuals in concentrations of the glucuronide. The species and  individual difference in glucuronidation were further examined using a microsomal  metabolism model. Glucuronidation was fastest in dog liver microsomes, followed by  human then rodent microsomes. UGT2B7 appeared to be the only human isoform able  to conjugate PR-104A, which was further confirmed by a strong correlation between  UGT2B7 protein content and glucuronidation activity in microsomes from different  individuals. The results suggest that differences in UGT2B7 activity may contribute to  individual differences in PR-104A pharmacokinetics, and that the role of this enzyme in  the toxicology of PR-104 warrants further investigation.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5907</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Policy and reality : the teaching of oral communication by Japanese teachers of English in public junior high schools in Kurashiki City, Japan : a thesis presented in the fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Second Language Teaching at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Rapley, Douglas James</field><field name="description">In 2003 the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) unveiled their new junior high school (JHS) English as a Foreign Language (EFL) policy, which focused strongly on oral communication. Although there is evidence of policy noncompliance in schools until now there has been no English language research on the attitudes or practices of Japanese teachers of English (JTEs), or the views of the students, and their parents in regards to teaching/learning English speaking skills. The research, based on JHSs in a mid-sized Japanese city (pop. 475,000 approx.), focused predominantly on JTEs, but also included students, and their parents. Focus group sessions, questionnaires, and one-on-one interviews were used to collect data. The study reveals that learning English speaking skills is considered important, but passing the senior high school (SHS) entrance examination is the main concern and so, test impact from the SHS entrance examination exerts the greatest pressure on JHS JTEs. The JTEs also perceive themselves as facing other issues such as student motivation, JTE speaking proficiency, and large class sizes. Another finding is that JTEs appear to receive inadequate training&#8211; pre- and inservice&#8211; resulting in issues, such as a reliance on traditional methods (yakudoku), which are not in accordance with MEXT&#8217;s intentions, and JTE proficiency test achievement levels lower than those desired by MEXT. As a result of these issues gaps exist between MEXT JHS EFL policies and actual teaching practices, and have unfortunately led to a situation where JTEs believe that MEXT does not care about or understand the teaching environment. The study concludes that implementation of MEXT&#8217;s policy require a better match between the SHS entrance examination and JHS EFL policy, a decrease in class sizes, and JTEs receiving more adequate training. A more positive relationship between MEXT and JTEs would result from these two groups working collaboratively when designing JHS EFL policies and could better achieve a match between the SHS entrance examination and JHS EFL policy.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English language teaching</field><field name="subject">spoken English</field><field name="subject">policy</field><field name="subject">Japan</field><field name="subject">speaking English</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330200 Curriculum Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/794</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors influencing nutrition risk of older New Zealanders : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Human Nutrition at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Carr, Rosemary Joy</field><field name="description">As the population ages it is increasingly important to understand the factors influencing dietary habits of older people. Social, biological and psychological factors influence food intake and affect nutrition risk among older people living in the community. The purpose of this study was to identify food-related behaviours that place older people at nutrition risk and to evaluate older peoples&#8217; perceptions and experiences of various nutrition support options. Fifty-one community living people aged between 80 and 85 years were recruited in North Shore City. Food-related behaviours were explored with the use of three quantitative tools. Practitioner Assessment of Network Type (PANT) was used to evaluate social networks. Elderly Assessment System (EASY-Care) was used to evaluate physical and mental wellbeing. Seniors in the Community: Risk Evaluation for Eating and Nutrition Version II (SCREEN II) assessed nutrition risk. Five people participated in a qualitative interview about nutrition support they had received. A third of the participants (31 percent) were found to be at nutrition risk. Twothirds (67 percent) showed some evidence of disability and needed assistance with everyday tasks. Nearly half (47 percent) of these older people had supportive social networks including close relationships with local family, friends and neighbours. There was an inverse linear relationship between participants&#8217; self-rated health and nutrition risk (p&lt;.001). Those who perceived their health to be fair or poor were more likely to be at nutrition risk. The importance of social contact, a sense of gratitude, &#8216;getting a meal&#8217;, and &#8216;meeting the need&#8217; were common themes that emerged from interviews with participants who received nutrition support. These findings indicate that nutrition risk may be prevalent among community living older people in New Zealand. Strategies and initiatives are needed to encourage independent living and to help older people with the procurement, preparation, cooking and sharing of enjoyable meals.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nutrition</field><field name="subject">aged</field><field name="subject">old people</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321205 Nutrition and dietetics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/859</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nutritional characteristics of New Zealand export lamb and functional properties of selected beef forequarter muscles : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of technology in Bioprocess Engineering at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Jansen, Eion</field><field name="description">Richmond Ltd. has recently undergone a change in strategy, away from the traditional commodity based meat industry, towards the modern food business. To do this, opportunities to add value to their current product range must be identified. This involves the conversion of traditionally low value commodity based products into products that demand a premium. An example of this is converting muscles that are currently used for grinding meat into a further processed convenience food (i.e. ready meals). Another method is to add further value to premium products by making them more appealing to consumers (i.e. nutritional information on labels). This work details investigations into the functional properties of selected beef forequarter muscles (low value commodity products) and the nutritional properties of selected export lamb products (premium products). The functional properties of a number of beef forequarter muscles were measured to identify which had the best potential for further processing applications with respect to ready meals. The functional properties of tenderness, cook loss and shrinkage were measured for the Latissimus Dorsi, Pectorialis Profundus (Point End Brisket), Infraspinatus (Cross Cut Blade), Triceps Brachi Longhead (Main muscle in Bolar Shoulder Clod), Supraspinatus (Chuck Tender), Serratus Ventralis and Triceps Brachi Medialhead (Muscle in Bolar Shoulder Clod. From the tests conducted the Infraspinatus and the Triceps Brachi Longhead have been identified as having the best functional properties with respect to further processing for ready meal applications. As well as conducting tests to identify the forequarter muscles with the best potential for further processing applications, investigations were carried out to identify cooking regimes that would optimise the functional properties. This work confirmed that there are three major chemical reactions, which determine the resultant functional properties of cooked meat. They are the denaturation and aggregation of the myofibrillar proteins and the denaturation and solubilisation of connective tissue (collagen). At around 50&#176;C myosin (45% to 50% of the myofibrillar proteins) denatures, which results in a substantial increase in cook loss and reduction in water holding capacity. At around 60&#176;C collagen (main connective tissue protein) denatures, which results in a substantial increase in tenderness and increase in cook loss. This is because as the collagen denatures it loses it mechanical strength (increase in tenderness) and can no longer support its own structure, and causes it to contract. This contraction causes fluid within the meat and cook loss caused by the denaturation of myosin to be expelled from the meat by compressive forces (squeezed out). At around 70&#176;C actomyosin (22% of the myofibrillar proteins) denatures. This results in a substantial increase in the cook loss and firming of the meat. The increase in cook loss or decrease in water holding capacity that occurs with myofibrillar protein denaturation is due to the fact that when these proteins denature and aggregate their ability to bind water is greatly reduced. From the results of the cooking regime trials it is recommended that for functional property considerations that during the cooking of further processed meat products (i.e. ready meal applications) a meat temperature of 62&#176;C should be aimed for, for the slowest heating region during cooking (usually the centre). This is because it has been identified that a cooking temperature of 65&#176;C should not be exceeded otherwise detrimental effects can occur to the functional properties of the cooked meat. For health concerns a 7D bacterial death reduction has to be achieved. This means that for a cooking temperature of 62&#176;C the meat has to be held at this temperature for at least 5 minutes. Therefore the total cooking time would be the time needed to heat all the meat to 62&#176;C plus 5 minutes to ensure a safe product. The heating or cooking system employed should also ensure that a minimal amount of the meat is heated above 65&#176;C. This can be easily achieved by minimising the external cooking temperature, but long cooking times will result. An industrial cooking process will be a compromise between the cost associated with longer residence time and product functionality. As mentioned earlier another way to add value is to supply nutritional information for selected cuts. Consequentially one of the objectives of this project was to provide some nutritional information for selected meat cuts. Though the primary objective of this part of the project was to develop a method for producing the needed information, so that Richmond N.Z. Ltd. can develop further information on an as needs basis. The nutritional characteristics of a number of export lamb cuts from the saddle region has also been investigated and a method devised to allow further characterisation of other cuts. The method involves breaking down a standard cut into its constituent components (e.g. Frenched rack consists of loin eye, fat cap, intercostals and fatty tissue). The constituent components are tested for their nutritional properties. The frenched rack nutritional properties are calculated from the nutritional properties of the constituents components and the yield data (percentage of each constituent component within a frenched rack) for frenched racks. This method allowed the identification of the main sources of variation for nutritional characteristics. These differences were found to be caused by the lean to fat ratio, not nutritional differences in lean tissue from the same region of lamb (i.e. loin eye and tenderloin very similar nutritionally). The difference in lean to fat ration also accounts for the variation between grades (i.e. PX grade lamb cuts have a higher fat content than YX grade lamb cuts due to PX grade cuts having a higher percentage fat tissue in their cuts). The cuts characterised were the shortloin section (whole section or chop), rack section (whole section or chop), 75mm racks frenched 25mm, boneless loin and tenderloin for both PX and YX grade lamb. The method will be applicable to other regions of lamb (i.e. hindquarter and forequarter) for which nutritional information already exists, but for which yielding data will have to be collected. The method would also be applicable to other species such as beef and venison, but both nutritional data for constituent components and yielding data would have to be collected.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Infraspinatus</field><field name="subject">Triceps Brachi Longhead</field><field name="subject">ready meals</field><field name="subject">cooked meat</field><field name="subject">protein denaturation</field><field name="subject">nutritional properties</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290103 Food processing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/895</field></doc><doc><field name="title">High-pressure-induced starch gelatinisation and its application in a dairy system : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the Doctor of Philosophy in Food Science at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Oh, Hyunah Eustina</field><field name="description">This study investigated pressure-induced starch gelatinisation in water and milk suspensions. A rheological method, termed &#8216;pasting curves&#8217;, provided an objective and analytical means to determine the degree of pressure-induced starch gelatinisation. In addition, a polarised light microscope was used to observe birefringence of the starch granules and the degree of starch swelling was measured. The preliminary investigation into pressure-induced gelatinisation of six different starches showed that potato starch was the most pressure resistant and was not gelatinised after a pressure treatment of 600 MPa for 30 min at 20 &#176;C. Waxy rice, waxy corn and tapioca starches showed complete gelatinisation after the same treatment while normal rice and normal corn starches were only partially gelatinised despite the disappearance of birefringence. Based on the preliminary study, two starches (normal and waxy rice starches) were selected for more detailed studies. The effects of treatment conditions (pressure, temperature and duration) on the gelatinisation were investigated with these selected starches. The degree of gelatinisation was dependent on the type of starch and the treatment conditions. The results also indicated that different combinations of the treatment conditions (e.g. high treatment pressure for a short time and low treatment pressure for a longer time) could result in the same degree of gelatinisation. Both starch types exhibited sigmoidal-shaped pressure-induced gelatinisation curves and there was a linear correlation between the degree of swelling and the apparent viscosity of the starch suspension. After treatments at =500 MPa for 30 min at 20 &#176;C, both starches lost all birefringence although the apparent viscosity and the degree of swelling of normal rice starch did not increase to the same extent as observed in waxy rice starch. Pressure-induced gelatinisation of starch was retarded when starch was suspended in skim milk. This was attributed to the effect of soluble milk minerals and lactose present in the milk whereas milk proteins (casein and whey) did not affect the degree of gelatinisation at the levels present in 10% total solids skim milk. The presence of soluble milk and/or lactose may lead to less effective plasticising of starch chains by the suspension medium. Interactions between milk components and starch molecules may also play a role in retarding gelatinisation by reducing the mobility of starch chains. The functionality of starch in a dairy application was tested using acid milk gels as a model system. Skim milk with added starch (waxy rice or potato starch) was either pressure treated (500 MPa, 20&#176;C, 30 min) or heat treated (80&#176;C, 30 min) and subsequently acidified to form acid milk gels. The addition of waxy rice starch resulted in firmer acid milk gels, and increasing the amount of starch caused an increase in the firmness of both pressure-treated and heat-treated samples. However, pressure-treated samples with added potato starch did not show significant changes in the firmness whereas the heat-treated counterparts showed a marked increase in the firmness as the level of potato starch increased. The difference between the effects of the two different starches can be explained by the extent of starch gelatinisation in skim milk. Starch granules absorb water during gelatinisation whether induced by pressure or heat which effectively increases milk protein concentration in the aqueous phase to form a denser protein gel network on acidification. The firmness of acid milk gels can be increased by adjusting the pH at pressure or heat treatment to higher than the natural pH of milk. The effect of pH at pressure or heat treatment and addition of starch on the acid milk gel firmness was additive and independent of each other up to a starch addition level of 1%. This study provided an insight into pressure-induced gelatinisation of starch by showing gelatinisation properties of starches of different botanical origins and the effects of the treatment conditions (treatment pressure, treatment temperature and duration) on the degree of gelatinisation. Furthermore, the results from the pressure treatments of starch in dairy-based suspensions showed that pressure-induced gelatinisation was affected by other components in the system. These results demonstrate the importance of understanding the gelatinisation properties of starch in complicated food systems in which a number of other components are present. In terms of the application of starch in dairy systems, when starch was added to milk and gelatinised by pressure treatment, the acid milk gel produced by subsequent acidification was firmer than the acid milk gel made from skim milk alone.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">birefringence</field><field name="subject">skim milk</field><field name="subject">rice starch</field><field name="subject">potato starch</field><field name="subject">acid milk gel</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290103 Food processing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1075</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Motor memory : reworking the past : a thesis (or dissertation, etc.) presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Masters in Fine Arts at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Titheridge, Johnathon Daniel</field><field name="description">Taking my own personal history as a starting point this paper will look at how we inherit culture and in turn shape it through the stories and objects that drive its formation.

This is also a personal journey, taking place in varying sites, from a rusting car hulk in a back yard in North Canterbury, to a University in Wellington and another rusted car, which has gone through a strange restoration. The Morris Minor has been embraced as a narcissistic object that I have chosen to double in order to explore my individual and wider national cultural history and identity. One of the key themes of this inherited identity is largely based around Nostalgia for an ideal past. This ideal is a fiction, a layering of intended futures as well as a selective past. This works in the same way as the modern artistic preoccupation with gothic histories, but instead of a positive ideal we have the creation of a basement of horrors that lurks beneath the surface. Be it positivist idealism or Gothic inversion, one way of focusing on the way these fictions differ markedly from the reality of the objects existence, is to show the artifice of the stories told by enhancing the components of the story that are already exaggerated, for the Morris Minor this means getting as far away from its existence as a rusting hulk in the backyard as possible. The longing for a past that may or may not exist, is less important as existing in reality but instead for what these fictions supply in their retelling. The concept of the Uncanny is integral to this retelling of memory, in that through a memories reanimation it can only approximate the original event leaving gaps for circumspection and invention. This retelling necessitates a reorientation in the relationship between the teller of the tale and the listener and between the viewer and the object viewed. The research culminates in the alteration of a Morris Minor to appear as one continuous surface. The intention of which is to engage with the differing versions of the objects past through taking an active part in its reconstruction as artwork with the aim of reassessment not only of my individual approach to the object but also the viewers.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Morris Minor</field><field name="subject">Cultural artifacts</field><field name="subject">New Zealand culture</field><field name="subject">Fine arts</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410200 Visual Arts and Crafts Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1325</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evolution in a marine gastropod : rocks, clocks, DNA and diversity : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Evolutionary Biology</field><field name="creator">Hills, Simon Francis Kahu</field><field name="description">Comprehensive integration of paleontological and molecular data remains a sought-after goal of evolutionary research. This thesis presents a dataset unlike any previously studied to document changes over time in the evolutionary history of the New Zealand marine mollusc genus Alcithoe. In order to study evolutionary relationships in the Alcithoe, DNA sequence of approximately 8Kb of mitochondrial DNA was generated using universal and newly developed PCR primers. The gene composition of the resulting sequences has been thoroughly analysed, using a novel splits-based approach, to gain a clear understanding of the underlying phylogenetic signals in the data. Refinement of the phylogeny was achieved by considering subsets of both the taxa and genes. Taking these analyses into account the combined a robust phylogeny for the Alcithoe is presented for use in subsequent analyses. The Alcithoe genus includes species that are exemplars of the problem of correctly identifying species by morphological traits, in both the living and extinct taxa. Taxonomic assignments were explored in a population level analysis of the highly morphologically variable species A. wilsonae. Analyses revealed that the various recognised forms of A. wilsonae are genetically indistinguishable and that the previously recognised species A. knoxi is a synonym of A. wilsonae. This result has significant implications for the interpretation of the paleontological data, as A. knoxi specimens are known from the Tongaporutuan stage (10.92 &#8211; 6.5 Ma) of the New Zealand geological timescale. Therefore, this finding also has implications on the assignment of calibration data in molecular clock analysis. To ensure accurate estimation of divergence times and rates of molecular evolution, extensive explorations of parameter space in molecular-clock analyses were carried out. These analyses identified the most appropriate models and calibration settings for Alcithoe the dataset. The fossil data used to calibrate this analysis is amongst the most robust applied to molecular clock analyses to date. Statistical sampling uncertainty derived from the paleontological data was included in the calculation of prior distributions. Divergence dates inferred for the extant Alcithoe are largely consistent with the fossil record. However, the root of the tree was consistently inferred to be younger then expected. Rates of evolution in the species of Alcithoe included in this analysis are broadly consistent. However, some small rate differences are observed in some branches, for example, Alcithoe fusus appears to have a faster rate then the rest of the genus. This rate increase is the likely cause of topological inconsistencies observed for four closely related taxa, including A. fusus, and indicates that slight rate differences can cause phylogenetic instability when small genetic distances are involved. Direct comparison of diversification rates between the molecular and paleontological data for the Alcithoe illustrated that modern Alcithoe species have origins that are around 13 millions years younger then the oldest known Alcithoe fossils. The suggestion that A. fusus is descended from a series of fossil Leporemax species is directly contradicted by the molecular tree. In light of the molecular evidence this result highlights the problem of morphological convergence in the interpretation of fossil Alcithoe species. Comparison of the molecular and paleontological datasets was difficult for absolute speciation and extinction rates, as errors inherent to each dataset led to disparate estimates. For example, the fossil record clearly fails to record most recent speciation events observed in the molecular phylogeny, but the molecular data cannot sufficiently account for the amount of extinction evident in the fossil record. It is clear that the assumption of a constant and equal probability of speciation and extinction for all lineages is violated in the Alcithoe. However, the general long-term trends estimated for both datasets are concordant, and demonstrate an increase in both speciation and extinction rates over the Cenozoic era. The research described in this thesis represents significant progress toward the goal of more thorough integration of molecular and paleontological in the study of evolution. I have shown that reconciliation of molecular and paleontological data is not only possible, but can substantially improve the resulting interpretation of evolution. This study is the broadest analysis of the evolution in a single genus using combined molecular and paleontological data that the author is currently aware of. It illustrates the advantage of having quality paleontological data to compare to emerging molecular data, and how the molecular data can further inform the paleontological data. Furthermore, it adds support to the shift in perspective from an adversarial to a complementary approach to the consideration of molecular and paleontological data. This thesis is a comprehensive first step in the synthesis of molecular and paleontological data in the study of evolution of the New Zealand mollusc fauna, and alludes to many promising avenues for future study.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Alcithoe</field><field name="subject">Gastropod phylogenetics</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270200 Genetics::270208 Molecular evolution</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1628</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A socio-cultural interpretation of young children's playful and humorous communication : a thesis presented in the fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Education at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Alcock, Sophie Jane</field><field name="description">This qualitative and interpretive study explores how young children experience humour and playfulness in their communication. Data were gathered in three early childhood education centres. The ethnographic method used was primarily participant observation, with the aid of a video camera and tape-recorder. Socio-cultural historical activity theory informs both the methodological paradigm of the research and the framework for data analysis. The research focuses on systems of interactions rather than individuals. The diversity and complexity in children's playful and humorous communication is illuminated by presenting 24 narrative-like "events" involving such communication. This presentation makes clear the dynamic qualities and artifact-mediated dialectical nature of playful and humorous communication activity. "Artifacts" include material and non-material tools, symbols, and semiotic signs (Wartofsky, 1979). Relationships between the roles, rules, and the community of children and teachers engaged in each event are discussed. Tensions and contradictions in these relationships (including children's playful subversion of adult rules) are explored. This thesis argues that humour, playfulness, and imagination are shared and distributed across groups of children. Thus children's imaginations, including their individual experiences, are dynamically shared with and connect the group. Playful and humorous communication involves words, sounds, gestures, posture, rhythm, and movement. At times the synchronous movements and speech of children having fun together are like a spontaneously improvised dance. Boundaries between children are blurred by the activity. The children become united by shared and distributed imagination in playful and humorous diversity. This study suggests that individual children in early childhood centres should be viewed as fundamentally connected to each other. Individuals exist in relation to others. Children's relationships with others, their environment, and artifacts are central to understanding children's experience of playful and humorous communication.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Play assessment</field><field name="subject">Child psychology</field><field name="subject">Culture</field><field name="subject">Interpersonal communication in children</field><field name="subject">Social interaction in children</field><field name="subject">Early childhood education</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330110 Early childhood education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1663</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of the intestinal microbiota in health and disease : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Molecular Microbiology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Stewart, Jessica Anne</field><field name="description">The intestinal microbiota is a massive and complex community, essential to the human host for good health and well-being. However, this population has been associated with gastrointestinal disease, and remains poorly understood. The aim of this study was to develop and validate DNA-based assays for the intestinal microbiota and to apply these methodologies to faecal samples collected from healthy volunteers and patients with gastrointestinal disease. Over 250 faecal samples were analysed using temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE) and real time PCR. Validated assays had high sensitivity and reproducibility. Healthy individuals displayed a high level of temporal stability during short term studies (&#8804; 6 weeks) and long term studies (1-4years). Analysis of faecal samples provided by identical and fraternal twins demonstrated an influence of host genetics over the composition of the predominant bacteria in children. Two intervention studies, bowel lavage and the Atkins' diet, were carried out to monitor the impact of environmental change on the population's stability in healthy volunteers. Following bowel lavage, microbial populations rapidly recovered to control densities, however the stability of the population was disturbed. Introduction of the Atkins' diet, led to a significant change in the composition of the microbial population. A preliminary study of the intestinal microbiota in disease groups was undertaken. Significant differences were detected between inflammatory bowel disease groups and controls. Cluster analysis in these patients indicated a potential association between the composition of the predominant bacterial population and disease localisation. The studies reported here demonstrate that the faecal microbiota in healthy individuals is a highly stable population under the influence of both host genetics and environmental variables, however the population present in patients with inflammatory bowel disease exhibits differences compared to healthy controls.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Intestines Diseases</field><field name="subject">Molecular Microbiology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270300 Microbiology::270307 Microbial ecology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1664</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of the quality of artificial drainage under intensive dairy farming and the improved management of farm dairy effluent using 'deferred irrigation' : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Soil Science, Institute of Natural Resources, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Houlbrooke, David John</field><field name="description">The last decade has been a period of great expansion and land use intensification for the New Zealand dairy farming industry with a 44% increase in national dairy cow numbers. Intensive dairy farming is now considered to be a major contributor to the deterioration in the quality of surface and ground water resources in some regions of New Zealand. Previous research has demonstrated intensive dairy farming is responsible for accelerated contamination of wateways by nutrients, suspended solids, pathogenic organisms and faecal material. A number of common dairy farming practices increase the risk of nutrient leaching. In particular, farm dairy effluent (FDE) has been implicated as a major contributor to the degradation of water quality. With the introduction of the Resource Management Act in 1991, the preferred treatment for FDE shifted away from traditional two-pond systems to land application. However, on most farms, irrigation of FDE has occurred on a daily basis, often without regard for soil moisture status. Therefore, it has been commonplace for partially treated effluent to drain through and/or runoff soils and contaminate fresh water bodies. The objectives of this thesis were to design and implement a sustainable land application system for FDE on difficult to manage, mole and pipe drained soils, and to assess the impacts of FDE application, urea application and cattle grazing events on nutrient losses via artificial drainage and surface runoff from dairy cattle grazed pasture. To meet these objectives a research field site was established on Massey University's No.4 Dairy farm near Palmerston North. The soil type was Tokomaru silt loam, a Fragiaqualf with poor natural drainage. Eight experimental plots (each 40 x 40 m) were established with two treatments. Four of the plots represented standard farm practice including grazing and fertiliser regimes. Another four plots were subjected to the same farm practices but without the fertiliser application and they were also irrigated with FDE. Each plot had an isolated mole and pipe drainage system. Four surface runoff plots (each 5 m x 10 m) were established as subplots (two on the fertilised plots and two on the plots irrigated with FDE) in the final year of the study. Plots were instrumented to allow the continuous monitoring of drainage and surface runoff and the collection of water samples for nutrient analyses. An application of 25 mm of FDE to a soil with limited soil water deficit - simulating a 'daily' irrigation regime - resulted in considerable drainage of partially treated FDE. Approximately 70% of the applied FDE left the experimental plots with 10 mm of drainage and 8 mm of surface runoff. The resulting concentrations of N and P in drainage and runoff were approximately 45% and 80% of the original concentrations in the applied FDE, respectively. From this single irrigation event, a total of 12.1 kg N ha-1 and 1.9 kg P ha-1 was lost to surface water representing 45% of expected annual N loss and 100% of expected annual P loss. An improved system for applying farm dairy effluent to land called 'deferred irrigation' was successfully developed and implemented at the research site. Deferred irrigation involves the storage of effluent in a two-pond system during periods of small soil moisture deficits and the scheduling of irrigation at times of suitable soil water deficits. Deferred irrigation of FDE all but eliminated direct drainage losses with on average &lt;1 % of the volume of effluent and nutrients applied leaving the experimental plots. Adopting an approach of applying 'little and often' resulted in no drainage and, therefore, zero direct loss of nutrients applied. A modelling exercise, using the APSlM simulation model, was conducted to study the feasibility of practising deferred irrigation at the farm scale on No 4 Dairy farm. Using climate data for the past 30 years, this simulation exercise demonstrated that applying small application depths of FDE, such as 15 mm or less, provided the ability to schedule irrigations earlier in spring and decreased the required effluent storage capacity. A travelling irrigator, commonly used to apply FDE (a rotating irrigator), was found to have 2-3 fold differences in application depth and increased the risk of generating FDE contaminated drainage. New irrigator technology (an oscillating travelling irrigator) provided a more uniform application pattern allowing greater confidence that an irrigation depth less than the soil water deficit could be applied. This allowed a greater volume to be irrigated, whilst avoiding direct drainage of FDE when the soil moisture deficit is low in early spring and late autumn. A recommendation arising from this work is that during this period of low soil water deficits, all irrigators should be set to travel at their fastest speed (lowest application depth) to minimise the potential for direct drainage of partially treated FDE and associated nutrient losses. The average concentrations of N and P in both 2002 and 2003 winter mole and pipe drainage water from grazed dairy pastures were all well above the levels required to prevent aquatic weed growth in fresh water bodies. Total N losses from plots representing standard farm practice were 28 kg N ha-1 and 34 kg N ha-1 for 2003 and 2004, respectively. Total P losses in 2003 and 2004 were 0.35 kg P ha-1 and 0.7 kg P ha-1, respectively. Surface runoff was measured in 2003 and contributed a further 3.0 kg N ha-1and 0.6 kg P ha-1. A number of common dairy farm practices immediately increased the losses of N and P in the artificial drainage water. Recent grazing events increased NO3--N and DIP concentrations in drainage by approximately 5 mg litre-1 and 0.1 mg litre-1, respectively. The duration between the grazing and drainage events influenced the form of N loss due to a likely urine contribution when grazing and drainage coincide, but had little impact on the total quantity of N lost. Nitrogen loss from an early spring application of urea in 2002 was minimal, whilst a mid June application in 2003 resulted in an increased loss of NO3--N throughout 80 mm of cumulative drainage suggesting that careful timing of urea applications in winter is required to prevent unnecessary N leaching. Storage and deferred irrigation of FDE during the lactation season caused no real increase in either the total-N concentrations or total N losses in the winter drainage water of 2002 and 2003. In contrast, land application of FDE using the deferred irrigation system resulted in a gradual increase in total P losses over the 2002 and 2003 winter drainage seasons. However, this increase represents less than 4% of the P applied in FDE during the lactation season. An assessment of likely losses of nutrients at a whole-farm scale suggests that it is standard dairy farming practice (particularly intensive cattle grazing) that is responsible for the great majority of N and P loss at a farm scale. When expressed as a proportion of whole-farm losses, only a very small quantity of N is lost under an improved land treatment technique for FDE such as deferred irrigation. The management of FDE plays a greater role in the likely P loss at a farm scale with a 5% contribution to wholefarm P losses from deferred irrigation.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Irrigation</field><field name="subject">Dairy waste</field><field name="subject">Soil moisture</field><field name="subject">Drainage</field><field name="subject">Dairy farms</field><field name="subject">Waste disposal</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300100 Soil and Water Sciences::300105 Applied hydrology (drainage, flooding, irrigation, quality etc)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1665</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Informal relationships in the workplace : associations with job satisfaction, organisational commitment and turnover intentions</field><field name="creator">Lopes Morrison, Rachel</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis was to develop and test a theoretical model of fiendships in the workplace. Friendships within organisations may have a profound effect on an employee's experience of work, potentially either hindering or facilitating organisational functioning, yet friendships have seldom been studied in an organisational context. The association between friendships at work and organisational outcomes such as job satisfaction, organisational commitment and turnover intentions were investigated in three studies, assessing support for a theoretical model. In the first study, employees of a large Auckland hospital Waitemata District Health Board, Auckland (NZ) (n = 124) were surveyed using a written questionnaire. Results indicated that cohesiveness and opportunities for friendship were related to increased job satisfaction, leading to increased organisational commitment and decreased turnover intentions. The actual prevalence of friendships was primarily related to decreased turnover intentions. Overall there was good support for the proposed model. The need for further research to ascertain the generalisability of the findings was highlighted. A second study was conducted using an Internet based questionnaire, accessed both from within New Zealand and worldwide. A diverse sample of employees responded (n = 412). The analysis (structural equation modelling) indicated further support for most aspects of the model, suggesting that the findings are generalisable and the model is robust. The model of workplace relationships was cross-validated in a third study, confirming linkages between friendships at work and organisational outcomes. The model was then tested for intergroup invariance. The model was invariant across groups reporting differing needs for affiliation, autonomy and achievement, but non-invariant across groups occupying relatively less or more interdependent jobs. Results suggest that the interdependence of individuals' jobs affects the salience of work friendships more than respondents' subjective need. Overall, the research suggests that the presence of workplace friendships has a significant effect on several workplace variables, with the effect of friendships being more salient for individuals in interdependent work roles. The implications of the research findings are potentially far reaching. Not only do workplace friendships improve employees' experiences of work, but they also have the potential to affect the financial "bottom line" through factors such as enhanced organisational commitment, job satisfaction and reduced intentions to leave.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Industrial psychology</field><field name="subject">Psychology of work</field><field name="subject">Interpersonal relations</field><field name="subject">Corporate culture</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380108 Industrial and organisational psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1666</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Language, migration and continuity of being : notions of migrant language proficiency and self-concept among multilingual migrants in Aotearoa-New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Walker, Ute Gerda</field><field name="description">Migration entails adjustment and change, a process crystallized in the way language use patterns, proficiencies and identifications change. Although migrants are often bi/ multilingual, their language proficiency tends to be associated with fluency in the host language. Such a monolingual approach is fundamentally at odds with the ethnolinguistic diversity in migration contexts and has prevented a more holistic approach to the dynamic realities of bi/multilinguals. It has also perpetuated a view of linguistic proficiency as technical skill, judged according to idealized monolingual norms. Little is known of speakers' own notions of proficiency in their existing migrant languages (ML) and the impact on their socialpsychological makeup as their linguistic repertoire undergoes changes in use, function and status. This research investigated proficiency as a matter of conceptualization through its users, including its role for migrants' continued sense of self in the face of sociolinguistic discontinuities. A three-phase research design involving focus groups, a postal survey and follow-up interviews was used with a sample of migrants from a wide range of ethnolinguistic backgrounds. The study found evidence for a multidimensional conceptualization of migrant language proficiency (MLP) with a complex range of underlying motivations and a strong emotional attachment to ML, revealing ML as a linguistic resource crucial for self-construction. The present study aimed to provide a deeper understanding of the dynamic nature of these matters to contribute to a socio-culturally grounded view of proficiency and self-concept to help reveal some of the complex processes associated with migrants' social, cultural and psychological wellbeing. The study proposes bi/multilingualism as a settlement target to facilitate this outcome and to foster a sense of self that accommodates multiple identities. Investment in languages promotes an inclusive society of global citizens and complements New Zealand's official M&#257;ori/English bilingualism.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Immigrants</field><field name="subject">Language</field><field name="subject">Bilingualism</field><field name="subject">Language attrition</field><field name="subject">Language maintenance</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420100 Language Studies::420199 Language studies not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1667</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Positive airway pressure for obstructive sleep apnoea : systematic evaluation versus clinical and technological drift : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Public Health at Massey University, Wellington Campus, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Marshall, Nathaniel Stuart</field><field name="description">Content removed due to copyright restrictions: Marshall, N.

Phosphorus (P) deficiency and high P fixing capacity of some volcanic ash soils (e.g. Allophanic Soil) may constrain radiata productivity. This thesis investigates the role of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) root processes in the acquisition of P by P. radiata fiom native soil and soil fertilised with two reactive phosphate rock (RPR) fertilisers. The application of finely-divided RPRs to a P deficient Allophanic Soil significantly increased P. radiata seedling growth and P uptake in 10 month pot trials. RPR dissolution was high in this soil, and it was further enhanced by the radiata rhizosphere processes. The development and formation of ECM in radiata seedlings was stimulated by low rates of RPR application but was hindered in unfertilised soils and high rates of RPR application. The P. radiata ECM roots induced acidification and increased oxalate concentration and phosphatase activities in the rhizosphere soil. These changes in rhizosphere biochemical properties were associated with enhanced solubilisation of fertiliser and soil inorganic P and increased mineralisation of organic P, leading to increased P bioavailability in the rhizosphere. ECM inoculation of P. radiata roots with Rhizopogen rubescens and Suillus luteus stimulated production of phosphatase enzymes and oxalate and induced acidification in the rhizosphere. The extent of root-induced changes in the rhizosphere soils was associated with ECM hyphae length density. A technique using pulse labelling of radiata shoots with 14CO2 showed promise in estimating the active ECM hyphae density. The 14C activity was highly correlated with ECM hyphae density measured by an agar film technique. Overall, observations made in this thesis indicate that sparingly soluble forms of organic and inorganic P in soils low in plant-available P are readily solubilised and utilised for P. radiata growth through ECM rhizosphere processes.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Soils</field><field name="subject">Phosphorus content</field><field name="subject">Phosphatic fertilizers</field><field name="subject">Forest soils</field><field name="subject">Pinus radiata</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300100 Soil and Water Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1669</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The indole-diterpene gene cluster from the ryegrass endophyte, Neotyphodium lolii, is required for the biosynthesis of lolitrem B, a bioprotective alkaloid : this thesis is presented as a partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of  Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.

Yet mothers' returning to work after time out bearing and raising children are reliant on a booming economy to obtain even limited entry to the labour market, and the work obtained is very often inferior to the jobs held by women before becoming mothers. Currently due to lower fertility rates and the ageing populations of the world's richer nations, a shortage of working-age people is predicted to continue into at least the middle of the twenty-first century. To overcome this shortfall, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) advises its member states to assist mothers to return to paid work sooner. Most OECD nations are complying, with varying degrees of success. Some policy frameworks make this goal more easily attainable than others. Mothers in liberal welfare states often return to paid work later than they might otherwise prefer. Many returners are overqualified for the work they are doing. While there appears to be relatively few barriers to re-entry, the choice of re-entry occupations are limited and returners are predominantly offered low status jobs with no career opportunities at the back of the job queue and gender queue. Mothers who interrupt their careers by taking a career break for childbearing and rearing generally face downward occupational mobility and loss of lifetime incomes. This thesis assesses the experiences of mothers who return to employment in one liberal nation, New Zealand. It applies Esping-Andersen's three models of welfare states and Reskin and Roos' gender queues model to the situation of returners. The study investigates the precise nature of the obstacles and processes encountered by a number of mothers attempting to resume a career. It argues that social policies matter: returners in countries where state intervention is more widespread and where there is universal, extensive and generous social provision and support for working mothers are economically better off. The research methods include in-depth interviews and a focus group with mothers, a mail questionnaire and interviews with employers, and a study of recent and current New Zealand and overseas government policies to assist working parents. The findings of this thesis are that regardless of skill levels, New Zealand returners are consigned to low status occupations where they are not fully integrated into the 'normal' full-time workforce with career opportunities. These mothers generally suffer more than one episode of returning to the back of the queue. They also earn less (weekly and annually) than mothers who do not take career breaks. The study identifies social policy frameworks and employers' policies and practices as factors contributing to the processes whereby returners are relegated to the back of the queue. Although New Zealand has recently brought in policies to assist mothers to return to paid work these initiatives have not addressed the processes that currently confine returners in low status, part-time employment. Policies similar to those created to specifically target the needs of ex-servicemen would go a long toward assisting mothers to access higher status and better-paid jobs at the head of the queue. The thesis concludes with policy recommendations to facilitate mothers' integration into such jobs.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mothers</field><field name="subject">Employment</field><field name="subject">Working mothers</field><field name="subject">Discrimination in employment</field><field name="subject">Sex discrimination in employment</field><field name="subject">Work and family</field><field name="subject">Government policy</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370200 Social Work::370203 Social policy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1671</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The New Zealand controversy over the Johnson report : the context of the Report of the Committee on Health and Social Education, Growing, Sharing, Learning (1977) : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Education at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Bowler, Josephine</field><field name="description">In 1975 the New Zealand Department of Education established a Committee on Health and Social Education, with the aim of addressing curriculum issues that had remained unresolved since the Thomas Report of 1944. Among these concerns was the issue of sex education. This Committee, also known as the Johnson Committee, was conceived under a liberal Labour government but its recommendations were debated during the terms of office of two subsequent National Ministers of Education. The work of the Committee on Health and Social Education was undertaken concurrently with the movements known as the Maori Renaissance and second wave feminism and within a climate of social and legislative change which included the Contraception, Sterilisation and Abortion Bill of 1977. When the Report of the Committee on Health and Social Education, Growing, Sharing, Learning (1977), was published there was little controversy over its sixty-nine recommendations on physical health, outdoor education, parent education, or community involvement in curriculum development. Its two recommendations on sex education however provoked a polarised debate lasting more than five years. In the context of this controversy a coalition of groups representing the Religious Right worked concurrently to oppose further liberalisation of the primary school health education syllabus. This lobby was led by the Concerned Parents' Association, the executive of which assumed the role of the "moral entrepreneur" to raise public awareness on issues of sex and moral education. A range of theory is used to discuss the contextual antecedents of the controversy, the reasons for the controversy and why it became increasingly difficult for the educational policy community to exercise hegemony over the outcomes of the Report. This thesis reveals that the Report of the Committee on Health and Social Education encompassed a bicultural dimension, and was the work of a liberal educational community of interest. It examines the underlying causes of the ideological tensions of the controversy and the construct of moral cathexis is introduced, to explain the means by which the Religious Right was able to influence subsequent policy. It is argued that the same ideological tensions are inherent in contemporary attempts to encompass sex education within the state school curriculum.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Moral education</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Public opinion</field><field name="subject">New Zealand Committee on Health and Social Education</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330104 Educational policy, administration and management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1672</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The quicksilver quest : two psychological studies investigating the effects of mercury in dentistry : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Psychology at Massey University, Wellington Campus, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Jones, Linda Miriam</field><field name="description">Content removed due to copyright restriction: Jones, L.

A sample of 114 adults with hearing loss who had accessed hearing therapy services participated in the study. It was hypothesised that hope would interact with the individual and disability characteristics and therefore function as a moderating variable. The second hypothesis was that hope may be related to individual and disability characteristics as well as adjustment but actually provides the only significant pathway to adjustment; more simply, hope may be a mediator of adjustment. The results indicate that the degree of loss was the only statistically significant individual and disability characteristic related to adjustment. The trait of hope did not produce an interaction effect of statistical significance in the moderation model. However, the study does provide support for the hypothesis that the trait of hope serves is a mechanism by which the degree of loss affects adjustment. Hearing loss affects hope which in turn affects adjustment. In other words, hope was found to act as a mediating variable. The extent of this mediating role was substantial as hope was found to account for 45% of the relationship between the degree of loss and adjustment. Additionally, the study found that self-efficacy and personal meaning may influence hope and despair dimensions in different ways. The perception of one's ability to influence events is a major contributor to hopefulness while the construction of meaning appears to be related to lower levels of despair. Current research in the area of positive psychology indicates that individual traits are modifiable and therefore hope finding, hope bonding, hope enhancement, and hope reminding can instil and increase hope. The implication of these findings is that hearing rehabilitation programmes need to consider the role of hope in intervention strategies. The study suggests possibilities for future research including the investigation of more complex mediational chains, refining individual and disability variables, and assessing the effect of hope-focussed intervention strategies.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Deafness</field><field name="subject">Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321212 Care for disabled</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1674</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'What's wrong with being sexy?'

In this study, several of these growth limiting factors were investigated. The toxicity of the hydroxyl ion (OH-) was examined using a solution culture system developed to allow studies at high pH without nutritional limitations. Also using this solution culture system, the effect of the high Na and Mg concentrations of bauxite residue on the Ca nutrition of plants was investigated. As the toxicity of Al at high pH is not known, a study was conducted to examine the rhizotoxicity of aluminate (Al(OH)4-) and polycationic Al at high pH. The ability of plant roots to reduce rhizosphere pH in bauxite residue was also considered. A novel gypsum application method was assessed for its efficiency at improving the Ca status of bauxite residue. Manual adjustment, ion exchange resins and automated titration were examined for their suitability for nutrient solution pH control in alkaline conditions. For short-term studies, it was found that a solution without supply of Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn, and aerated with CO2 depleted air, greatly reduced nutrient precipitation at high pH, thus eliminating nutritional differences between treatments. Manual pH adjustment and the use of ion exchange resins as pH buffers were unsuitable methods of pH control. In contrast, pH control by automated titration had little effect on solution composition while maintaining constant pH. The solution culture system was used to examine OH- toxicity in mungbeans (Vigna radiata (L.) Wilczek cv. Emerald), with root length reduced at a bulk solution pH of 8.5 and greater. The effect of Ca activity ratio (CAR) and pH on Ca uptake by mungbeans and Rhodes grass (Chloris gayana cv. Pioneer) in Na dominated solution cultures and in soil was investigated. Changes in pH in the alkaline range were shown to have no effect on the critical CAR of 0.024 (corresponding to 90 % relative root length) for mungbeans grown in solution culture. Results from soil grown mungbeans confirmed those from solution culture, with a critical CAR of 0.025. A critical CAR of 0.034 was also established for soil grown Rhodes grass. However, using dilute nutrient solutions dominated by Mg at pH 9.0, root growth was found to be more limited than had been observed for Na solutions, with growth reduced beneath a critical CAR of 0.050. Using a CAR equation modified with plasma membrane binding constants (to incorporate the differing antagonistic effects of Mg and Na), new critical CAR values were calculated for Na (0.56) and Mg (0.44) dominated solutions. This modified CAR equation permits the calculation of CAR irrespective of the dominant salt present. Solubilities of various gypsum sources and size fractions in seawater were studied to investigate the effectiveness of gypsum addition to the residue sand pipeline, rather than as a direct field application. The dissolution rate constant varied with gypsum source (analytical grade (AR) &gt; phosphogypsum (PG) &gt; mined gypsum (MG)) due to reactivity and surface area differences, generally reaching saturation within 15 s (AR) to 30 min (MG &gt; 2.0). The ability of bauxite residue to remove Ca from solution (due to cation exchange and precipitation) was also examined; the quantity of the total solution Ca adsorbed was found to be small (5 %). These low rates of solution Ca adsorption, comparatively rapid dissolution rates, and long pumping times (20 min), preclude the application of gypsum to the residue sand/seawater slurry as a method for residue amelioration. Dilute, alkaline (pH 9.5) nutrient solutions were used to investigate the effects of aluminate (Al(OH)4-) on mungbean root growth. Although root growth in Al(OH)4- solutions was slightly limited, the symptoms associated with this growth reduction were observed to be similar to those caused by the Al13 polycation at concentrations lower than that which can be detected. Also, when roots displaying these symptoms were transferred to fresh Al(OH)4- solutions, no root tip lesions were observed, and root hair growth on the lateral roots improved. Thus, Al(OH)4- is considered to be non-toxic, with the observed reduction in root growth in solutions containing Al(OH)4- due to the gradual formation of toxic Al13 in the bulk nutrient solution resulting from the acidification of the alkaline nutrient solution by the plant roots. The effect of Mn deficiency in Rhodes grass and of legume inoculation in lucerne (Medicago sativa L. cv. Hunter River), on the rhizosphere pH of plants grown in highly alkaline bauxite residue was investigated. In response to Mn deficiency in residue sand, Rhodes grass was observed to increase acidification of its rhizosphere (being up to 1.22 pH units lower than the bulk soil). Due to its ability to fix atmospheric N2 rather than relying on soil N (NO3-) reserves, inoculated lucerne (1.75 pH unit decrease) was also found to acidify its rhizosphere to a greater extent than non-inoculated lucerne (1.16 pH unit decrease).</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300804 Environmental Impact Assessment</field><field name="subject">770806 Remnant vegetation and protected conservation areas</field><field name="subject">Aluminate toxicity</field><field name="subject">alkalinity</field><field name="subject">salinity</field><field name="subject">rhizosphere pH</field><field name="subject">gypsum dissolution</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157976</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Origins and Evolution of the North-Eastern and Central Polabian (Wendish) Religious and Political System</field><field name="creator">Zaroff, Roman</field><field name="description">The term Polabian Slavs is a generic name applied to the westernmost branch of the Western Slavs, now almost extinct. Those people are often referred to as Wends, but mainly in older historiography. In the Middle Ages they occupied the territory more or less corresponding to the former state of East Germany, the region enclosed by the Baltic Sea in the North, the Oder-Neisse rivers in the East, the Ore mountains in the South and the Elbe-Saale rivers in the West (see map 1). In Central Europe, with the exception of the Baltic Prussians and Lithuanians, some of the Polabian Slavs resisted Christianisation and remained stubbornly pagan until the middle of the twelfth century. In the course of history the Polabian Slavs came under increasing political pressure from the Franks and later from the Empire, in the period between the eighth and the twelfth centuries. From the north they were also hard pressed by the Danes and in some periods from the east by the growing strength in Poland of the Piast dynasty. By the end of the twelfth century most of the Polabian Slavs fell under German or Danish political control. Some of them in the central region, what is now the Land of Brandenburg, and the tribes in the South were fully incorporated into the Empire. Others, like the Obodrites and some of the Veleti in Western Pomerania, became part of the Empire as autonomous duchies ruled by the local princes, while the island of R&#252;gen and the adjacent mainland territories, although they continued to be ruled by the Slavic dynasts, had to acknowledge Danish suzerainty. The whole territory, despite some areas being under the Danish crown, became subject to strong German political and cultural influence. Assimilation and German colonization facilitated the process of the Germanization of almost the entire area between the Saale-Elbe and Oder-Neisse rivers. Over the centuries the Polabian Slavs have almost entirely disappeared as a distinct people. However, the process is not fully completed even today, for a small Sorb minority still retains its distinct cultural identity. The modern Sorbs, numbering around 100,000 people are living today in eastern Germany in the region of Lusatia (Lausitz in German or &#163;u&#158;ica in Sorbian), mainly around Bautzen and Cottbus. Approximately 60,000 of them still speak a Slavonic language. Although this work does not deal directly with the Sorbs of Lusatia, it is dedicated to those surviving Polabian Slavs. [No abstract available - text taken from Introduction]</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">430108 History - European</field><field name="subject">Medieval</field><field name="subject">Slavs</field><field name="subject">Western Slavs</field><field name="subject">Slavic</field><field name="subject">Slavonic</field><field name="subject">Polabian</field><field name="subject">Religion</field><field name="subject">Paganism</field><field name="subject">Sventovit</field><field name="subject">Theocracy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157891</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inconsistencies in the rights of review of the merits of Commonwealth administrative decisions</field><field name="creator">Thackeray, Vincent Gregory</field><field name="description">Government intervention in the financial and social affairs of citizens has increased dramatically in the last fifty years. As a result, government administrative decisions continually affect the everyday lives of people. Many of these decisions are discretionary. Modern administrative law has grown to meet the need for governments, rather than the courts, to supervise the exercise of administrative power so that injustice resulting from misuse of power can be avoided. The merits review system is an integral part of this administrative law. The effectiveness of the merits review system is dependent upon how Parliament makes provision for merits review in the legislative process. The object of this thesis is to analyse and evaluate the effectiveness of the scope of the Commonwealth administrative law merits review system. An evaluation of the availability of rights of review of the merits of Commonwealth administrative decisions will determine the extent to which Commonwealth law provides for merits review of administrative decisions. This thesis makes such an evaluation by undertaking an empirical study of the merits review provisions in Commonwealth legislation. The empirical study analyses 1,070 Commonwealth statutes and establishes that there are 340 statutes that confer power to make a reviewable decision or decisions. However, only 30 percent of these statutes provide for merits review of all reviewable decisions, while 44 percent provide for merits review of some decisions and 26 percent do not provide for merits review of any decisions. Consequently, the empirical study identifies inconsistencies in the provision of merits review of Commonwealth administrative decisions. The Australian parliamentary executive system of government has permitted a breakdown in the legislative drafting process that has allowed these inconsistencies to develop. Moreover, the executive arm of the Commonwealth government has diminished its accountability to Parliament for some of the administrative decisions made by it. A person affected by an unreviewable administrative decision may be treated unjustly as a result.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">350200 Business and Management</field><field name="subject">720400 Management and Productivity Issues</field><field name="subject">Inconsistencies</field><field name="subject">rights</field><field name="subject">merits</field><field name="subject">review</field><field name="subject">Commonwealth</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">administrative</field><field name="subject">decisions</field><field name="subject">Kerr</field><field name="subject">Executive</field><field name="subject">unaccountable</field><field name="subject">Parliament</field><field name="subject">injustice</field><field name="subject">empirical</field><field name="subject">study</field><field name="subject">statutes</field><field name="subject">legislation. breakdown</field><field name="subject">legislative</field><field name="subject">drafting</field><field name="subject">process</field><field name="subject">Parliamentary</field><field name="subject">Counsel</field><field name="subject">Administrative</field><field name="subject">Review</field><field name="subject">Tribunal</field><field name="subject">Council</field><field name="subject">Attorney-General</field><field name="subject">appeal</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157885</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Practical approaches to improve the value of the Falkland Islands' sheep and wool industry</field><field name="creator">Miller, Sean Michael</field><field name="description">Studies were conducted to determine basic aspects of intake and digestion of native pastures by young sheep in the Falkland Islands, and to evaluate practical methods to improve the productivity of these animals. The studies were conducted in support of Industry and Government initiatives to reinvigorate Falklands&#146; agriculture. The current industry is based on broad diameter wools harvested from sheep grazing poor quality native pastures, and sheep suffer low growth rates, poor productivity and high mortality, and farmers rely on small flocks to produce a single commodity for their total income. The dramatic collapse of wool markets in the 1980&#146;s crippled the Falklands&#146; wool industry and farmers have relied heavily on subsidies for more than 12 years. The studies in this thesis were initiated to support the efforts to reinvigorate Falklands&#146; agriculture, and they examined basic aspects of the nutrition provided to sheep by native pastures and evaluated practical methods to improve the survival of sheep, their subsequent rate of growth and productive value to the economy. Five studies examined specific hypotheses posed at the outset of the research programme and they were broadly supported by the data presented in the thesis: &#183; A wether trial was used to benchmark the productivity of wool sheep in the Islands, and the trial demonstrated that substantial genetic variation exists within the national flock that may be exploited in the future to improve the productivity of the wool industry, &#183; Microhistological techniques were used in conjunction with n-alkane marker technology to investigate the diets consumed by sheep grazing native pastures. The diet studies concluded that the low quality of native pasture in the Falklands during autumn, winter and spring restricts growth and productivity of young sheep, &#183; Studies with weaner sheep treated with controlled release anthelmintics established that infection with gastrointestinal nematodes exacerbates poor nutrition of young sheep consuming native pastures, &#183; A short-term metabolism study demonstrated that native pasture hay fortified with molasses and urea, or winter forage crops may be used as supplements to enhance sheep productivity, and &#183; Forage crops were grown and evaluated under Falklands&#146; conditions, and when lambs were fed the resulting highly productive and nutritious forages, the study demonstrated that lamb growth can be increased significantly, and lamb carcasses offer local farmers the potential to diversify farm income by using existing Falklands&#146;-bred lambs to develop an export meat industry The data presented in this thesis demonstrate that the potential to improve the productive and financial position of Falklands&#146; farmers is substantial. If both the local Industry and Government maintain their joint commitment to industry-restructure, pastoral development and enterprise diversification, the Falklands&#146; agricultural economy stands to benefit considerably by adopting low risk solutions to address widespread problems.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">630102 Sheep-wool</field><field name="subject">native pasture</field><field name="subject">alkanes</field><field name="subject">wool quality</field><field name="subject">sheep diets</field><field name="subject">gastrointestinal parasitism</field><field name="subject">urea-molasses treatment</field><field name="subject">brassicas</field><field name="subject">carcass quality</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157933</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The design and analysis of high frequency phased array coils for MRI</field><field name="creator">Li, Bing Keong Joe</field><field name="description">This thesis is focussed on extending the use of phased array radiofrequency (RF) coils for use in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Phased arrays are very useful as receiver coils and have been used over the last 15 years or so to improve receiver coil coverage and to speed up image acquisition. These arrays have almost invariably been constructed and used at mid- to highfrequency (&amp;lt128 MHz), thus there is clearly an opportunity to increase the operating frequency of the phased array and also use these systems in transceive mode. Using phased array coils in transceive mode has the advantage of gaining better spatial specificity of excited regions. Also as the operating wavelength in high field strength is shortened by the dielectric properties of the patient and approaches the size of conventional transmitter coils, there are distinct advantages in using the smaller coils in the phased array system for transmission. In addition, with the ability to independently control the magnitudes and phases of the transmission power on each element of a transceiver phased array system, RF focussing or shimming can be performed during RF transmission. The research work presented in this thesis is therefore, primarily focussed on designing and analysing high frequency phased array coils for MRI applications with transceive and RF focussing capability and investigating the possibility of using focussing transceive phased array coils to ameliorate image distortions that appear in high field MR images. The second major area of work concerns evaluation of the performance of partial parallel imaging when used at high field strength and the compatibility with transceive phased array systems. Common to both areas are investigation into other approaches for the design of high field RF coils, exploring the possibility of new mutual decoupling techniques and the consideration of other numerical computational methods that can assist in designing future high frequency phased array coils and help evaluate the complex field-tissue interactions at high field strength.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">291500 Biomedical Engineering</field><field name="subject">671402 Medical instrumentation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158146</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Playing musical hopscotch: How Indigenous Australian women perform around, within and against Aboriginalism.</field><field name="creator">Barney, Katelyn Sarah</field><field name="description">Indigenous Australian women who perform contemporary music are acutely aware that Aboriginalist discourse has created unrealistic expectations and public perceptions of Indigenous Australian performance. The theory of Aboriginalism is critiqued and interrogated in this thesis in relation to Indigenous Australian women, performance, and race. This thesis addresses the complex and contradictory ways that Aboriginalist discourse fixes non-Indigenous expectations of Indigenous Australian performance, gender, and race by exploring how the performers themselves work within and against these Aboriginalist constructions through their music. One of the immediate effects of Aboriginalism is that it silences Indigenous Australians. In academic discourse and popular media, the voices of Indigenous women who perform contemporary music are rarely heard and often overlooked or ignored. This thesis aims to redress and understand this gender imbalance by focusing on Indigenous women and their contemporary music and illustrate how Indigenous Australian women performers are enacting new types of agency to negotiate their way through, around, and over one-dimensional Aboriginalist constructions of themselves to self-define more positive and diverse identities as Indigenous Australian women. This thesis is divided into four parts. Part One (Chapters One, Two, and Three) provides necessary background to the study. Chapter One introduces the topic and poses research questions in relation to Aboriginalism, Indigenous women, and contemporary performance. Chapter Two examines a number of themes which emerge in the existing literature relating to Indigenous Australian musicians performing contemporary music. Chapter Three locates Indigenous Australian women in this academic discourse and explores some possible reasons for the increasing number of contemporary music recordings by Indigenous Australian women since the 1990s. Part Two (Chapters Four, Five, and Six) positions this study theoretically and methodologically. Chapter Four outlines the theoretical framework that informs this project while Chapter Five discusses the methodological issues and challenges I faced throughout the research process. Chapter Six introduces the Indigenous women performers who took part in this study. This chapter uses the literary convention of a &#147;playlet&#148; by weaving together comments of Indigenous Australian women performers from one-on-one interviews I conducted, media excerpts about the performers, as well as my own questions and comments into a conversation which tells a story about the performers&#146; backgrounds, experiences, albums, and achievements. Part Three (Chapters Seven, Eight, and Nine) comprises the analysis chapters and examines Aboriginalism in relation to race, gender, and performance. Each of these chapters utilise theoretical discussions of Aboriginalism, excerpts from interviews with Indigenous women performers, song texts, and media representations to examine how Indigenous women perform within and against Aboriginalism. Chapter Seven focuses on how Indigenous women performers resist Aboriginalist constructs of race through performance while Chapter Eight turns the gaze to gender and Aboriginalism to explore how the performers challenge Aboriginalist representations of Indigenous women by attempting bring Indigenous women&#146;s experiences, history, and topics to the foreground through song. Chapter Nine examines the way in which Indigenous women performers steer their way through Aboriginalism in music performance by blurring musical boundaries and drawing on a diverse range of musical styles. Finally, Part Four (Chapter Ten) discusses the possibilities of moving beyond Aboriginalism and reflects on my own contribution to discourse concerning Indigenous women performers.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">410101 Music</field><field name="subject">420303 Culture, Gender, Sexuality</field><field name="subject">410104 Indigenous Performing Arts</field><field name="subject">750201 The performing arts (incl. music, theatre and dance)</field><field name="subject">751005 Communication across languages and cultures</field><field name="subject">750309 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander development and welfare</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158217</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physiology of the PNSB Genus Rhodobacter: Volatile Fatty Acid Metabolism and Global Metabolic Regulation</field><field name="creator">Miss Jessica Welch</field><field name="description" /><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159346</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating re-purchase intention in an experiential context using operations and marketing perspectives</field><field name="creator">Hume, Margee</field><field name="description">Abstract The purpose of this thesis is to undertake theory development and testing particular to re-purchase intention in an experiential service context, specifically the cultural performing arts. Services researchers suggest implementing a multi-disciplinary approach to research that uses theories and methods from several of the management fields will advance the domain of services research. This thesis aims to contribute to the field of service research by drawing from methods and theories offered in both service operations and services marketing fields. To date, service research has been preoccupied primarily with consumer behaviour aspects of services marketing such as satisfaction but underestimates the importance of constructs such as re-purchase intention and the subsequent implications for strategy formulation and implementation. Further to this, the current approach to services research has overlooked the nexus between marketing and operations and the importance of the implementation of strategy to achieve objectives. It is argued that failing to integrate service operations both practically and theoretically into the re-purchase intentions research framework confines its potential effectiveness. In addition, the lack of specific service context application has been identified as a significant oversight in previous services research. Construct measurements and findings have been difficult to replicate across contexts and contextual examination of constructs and relationships has been suggested as a solution. One such context deserving of attention is that of the experiential services, specifically the performing arts. Therefore, using measures and theories developed specifically for this context, this thesis will offer a more comprehensive approach to re-purchase intention research in a performing arts setting. This thesis adopts a mixed method approach by implementing a series of three integrated studies, which amalgamates both operations and marketing fields. This thesis aims to identify the aspects of a performing arts encounter that are relevant to the customer by conducting a two-staged set of qualitative interviews. This process is based on the operations technique Service Transaction Analysis (STA). First, consultant consumers and organisational personnel were used to formulate a consensus definition of a typical performing arts experience and, second, 26 in-depth interviews were conducted with potential future consumers of the performing arts based on this description of the offering. These two studies, coupled with extant literature, informed the research instrument designed for the main survey. This instrument was conducted on 273 potential future consumers of the performing arts. Qualitative work undertaken in Study 1 identifies the service experience description. Study 2 highlights the service management and marketing issues relating to re-purchase intention especially focusing on value, customer satisfaction, show experience and service quality and discloses a set of specific issues incorporated into the wording of the survey instrument. Study 3 measures and tests the key constructs of service quality, show experience, value, satisfaction and the significance of the hypothesised pathways to re-purchase intention. The proposed model is then analysed using the AMOS 5.0 Structural Equation Modelling package. This thesis is structured in the journal paper format with each of the chapters representing each of the five journal papers. In addition, an introductory and concluding chapter are appended with the concluding chapter providing an in-depth discussion of the contributions of this thesis. The papers are based on the progressive results of the research program and offer an integrated set of findings and discussions. The papers are not mutually exclusive but interrelated to comprehensively illuminate the central research theme of the thesis and discuss many aspects of marketing and operations significant to re-purchase intention. The entire thesis is drawn from the data set generated from the three integrated studies developed to address the overall research theme. The central research theme is to investigate the nature of re-purchase intention in an experiential setting using marketing and operations theories as platforms of analysis. Interestingly, the tested model of this thesis found empirically that the subjective and experiential aspects of the service, such as the emotional and artistic quality of the show, did not have a significant and direct relationship with re-purchase intention. This finding is of interest, in particular, to scholars of experiential consumption and marketing practitioners offering these types of services. Previous research has supported the desire to fulfil experiential needs as driving the initial purchase. Conversely, this finding suggests that the desire to visit again is driven by utility and value. As customer maintenance and repeat patronage are of utmost importance to practice, this is an exciting development. Offering further support, the tested model found service quality and show experience were mediated by value to satisfaction, with satisfaction inturn mediating the relationship between value and re-purchase intention. Collectively, these findings have lead to several developments and contributions for both scholarship and practice. The contributions to knowledge of this thesis highlight five main theoretical contributions and four main managerial implications. These encompass: &#183; Advancing the &#145;service management trinity&#146;, specifically strengthening the importance of the relationship between service marketing and service operations. &#183; Advancing service management theory by understanding the service offering more intricately and the importance of service description. &#183; Clarifying the roles of experiential and utilitarian attributes of the service experience in an experiential setting extending knowledge related to re-purchase intention. &#183; Particularizing and measuring the construct of re-purchase intention to the performing arts and clarifying the predictors of this construct in the context of experiential performing arts. . &#183; Testing and clarifying the relationships of value and satisfaction to re-purchase intention extending the understanding of re-purchase intention in this field and elaborating the approach and understanding of this construct for future research. This thesis further contributes to knowledge by offering several managerial contributions. These incorporate: &#183; Market segmentation and targeting strategies as critical for performing arts management. &#183; Operations service design and creation strategies in the performing arts by including important aspects of the service experience as highlighted by customer driven research. &#183; Specific recommendation for streamlining delivery through standardised mass customisation. &#183; Offering value frameworks for creating value in service delivery and targeting customer perceptions of superior value. This extending the understanding of the customer perceived value equation. By contributing to the field of service management and advancing enquiry in the field of services marketing and service operations, this thesis offers a new perspective and practical approach to service marketing context analysis making a valuable contribution to scholarship. This approach is based on improving organisational performance in experiential services specifically by applying operations and marketing theory from a customer-perspective. By doing this, findings inform organisations of ways to better meet the needs and wants of consumers through design, delivery and marketing. Moreover, the findings assist researchers in further advancing the field of services research. This research positions the future research program to focus on continuing the advancement of service management by examining the higher order constructs of service quality and show experience and examining the impact of additional customer motivations such as emotional goal attainment and involvement in experiential settings.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">720401 Marketing</field><field name="subject">350204 Marketing and Market Research</field><field name="subject">services marketing</field><field name="subject">services operations</field><field name="subject">performing arts</field><field name="subject">service quality</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158043</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Emperor and the Roman Elite from Commodus to Maximinus (A.D. 180-238)</field><field name="creator">Davenport, Caillan James Roderick</field><field name="description">Rome had twelve masters between the years A.D. 180-238, eleven of whom were murdered or killed in battle. The age of the Antonines came to an end with the death of Commodus and four years of divisive civil war. The eventual victor, Septimius Severus, established a new dynasty, but it was short-lived, coming to an ignominious end in a camp on the Rhine. Thus began the era of the soldier emperors. This thesis will argue that the rapid turnover of emperors in these fifty-eight years precipitated a crisis among the Roman elite. Senators and equestrians competed with each other, and with less exalted members of society, such as freedmen, to become members of the emperor&#146;s inner circle. Dio Cassius, a senator who began his Roman History during the reign of Septimius Severus, serves as an effective contemporary witness to the upheavals taking place at court and within society at large. Contrary to the views of scholars such as Crook and Syme, who place great emphasis on the continuity of policy provided by the emperor&#146;s amici, this thesis will demonstrate that there was significant discontinuity at the imperial court. Imperial advisers were not a fixed group retained from reign to reign &#150; instead, each new emperor chose to install his own supporters in key positions in order to put his own stamp on the administration of the empire. This has given rise to a tendency to label some rulers as &#145;anti-senatorial&#146; and others as &#145;pro-senatorial&#146;. Even those emperors who executed large numbers of senators, such as Commodus and Septimius Severus, had amici from within the senate whom they trusted and relied upon. The favour bestowed on such senators who formed part of the emperors&#146; exclusive cabal was a source of continual tension among the Roman elite. The amici formed a heterogeneous group, whose only common link was that they had earned the favour of the emperor of the day.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">430110 History - Classical Greek and Roman</field><field name="subject">780199 Other</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158140</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Entanglement, geometry and quantum computation</field><field name="creator">Dowling, Mark</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses a number of problems within the emerging field of quantum information science. Quantum information science can be said to encompass the more-established disciplines of quantum computation and quantum information, as well as rather more recent attempts to apply concepts, tools and techniques from these disciplines to gain greater understanding of quantum systems in general. The role of entanglement &#151; non-classical correlation &#151; has been of particular interest to date. Part I contributes to this later goal. In particular, we establish a connection between the energy of a many-body quantum system and the idea of an entanglement witness from the theory of mixed-state entanglement. This connection allows mathematical results about entanglement witnesses to be translated into physical results about many-body quantum systems, specifically energy and temperature thresholds for entanglement. For the case of two qubits we are able to establish fairly detailed results about the behaviour of entanglement with temperature. We also study entanglement in systems of indistinguishable particles, where even the question of which quantum states should be regarded as entangled has been the subject of much controversy. We aim to clarify this issue by applying Wiseman and Vaccaro&#146;s notion of entanglement of particles to a number of wellunderstood model systems. We discuss the advantages of the entanglement of particles approach compared with other methods in common use. Finally, we study the operational meaning of superselection rules in quantum physics, in particular the connection to the existence or not of an appropriate reference frame. We propose an experiment that aims to exhibit a coherent superposition of an atom and a molecule, apparently in violation of the commonly-accepted particle-number superselection rule. This result sheds light on the entanglement of particles approach to entanglement of indistinguishable particles. Part II returns to a fundamental question at the heart of quantum computation and quantum information, namely: how many quantum gates are required to perform a particular quantum computation? In other words, how efficiently can a quantum computer solve a particular computational problem? We establish a connection between this question and the field of Riemannian geometry. Intuitively, optimal quantum circuits correspond to &#147;free-falling&#148; along the shortest path between two points in a curved space. This opens up the possibility of using Riemannian geometry to study quantum computation, a possibility that was previously unknown. We provide explicit calculations of all the basic geometric quantities associated with the space, and give some preliminary results of applying geometric ideas to quantum computing. Finally, we explore more generally the connection between optimal control and quantum circuit complexity, of which the Riemannian metric described above can be viewed as a special case.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">240301 Atomic and Molecular Physics</field><field name="subject">780102 Physical sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158661</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Models of fault-tolerant quantum computation</field><field name="creator">Dawson, Christopher Malcolm</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with certain theoretical problems that arise naturally in the context of fault-tolerant quantum computation. Fault-tolerance can be defined as the art of building reliable devices from unreliable components, and is of particular importance for quantum computers that aim to precisely control the dynamics of extremely sensitive quantum systems. A model of quantum computation is a specification of the basic building blocks by which a quantum computation is implemented. The best known model is the quantum circuit model, where computations are implemented by means of unitary quantum gates that are applied to two-level quantum systems known as qubits. In a physical implementation of a quantum circuit, the gates and qubits will inevitably be affected by noise. Fault-tolerant quantum circuits are designed to be resilient against the effects of this noise, provided that it is not too strong. Fault-tolerance in the quantum circuit model is well developed thanks to the theory of quantum error-correcting codes. These codes allow for the correction of small numbers of errors introduced by a variety of noise processes. In a fault-tolerant quantum circuit, qubits are replaced with encoded qubits, and quantum gates with encoded gates that are immediately followed by special quantum circuits for error correction. Provided the rate at which errors occur is below a constant threshold value, the accumulation of errors can be checked so that the correct output of the computation correctly determined. The threshold acts as both a measure of how good the design of a quantum circuit is, and also as a target for experimenters aiming to implement quantum circuits. Much current research in quantum computation is aimed at designing quantum circuits that increase the noise threshold, hopefully to the point where it becomes within the reach of experimenters. A fault-tolerant encoded quantum gate must limit the propagation of errors so that the code&#146;s corrective capabilities are not overwhelmed. It is not so easy to design encoded gates that satisfy this property, and to date only a finite handful of such gates are known. In a faulttolerant quantum circuit, all quantum gates must be decomposed or compiled in terms of those that may be implemented fault-tolerantly. In the first part of this thesis, we present two results that may be applied to this problem of gate compilation. The first is a generic method based on the Solovay-Kitaev theorem that may be applied to all quantum gates, but is most effective for those that act on single qubits. We present the Solovay-Kitaev theorem in its simples known form as an algorithm, together with novel constructions that can be used to implement it. Following this we give a two specialized methods for two-qubit gate decomposition, based on the Cartan decomposition of the Lie group SU(4). The cluster-state model of computation is an alternative to the quantum circuit model, and makes use of quantum measurements and highly entangled cluster-states to implement a quantum computation. The fault-tolerant techniques developed for quantum circuits are not immediately applicable in this model, so in order for it to be a realistic candidate for performing computations we prove that such techniques are possible. In the second part of the thesis we prove that constant fault-tolerance thresholds may be achieved in the cluster-state model, and in particular in an adaption to an optical implementation. Following this we design a complete error correction scheme for optical cluster-state computation, and numerically determine the threshold of this model in the face of the dominant noise models likely to affect such an implementation.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">249999 Physical Sciences not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158120</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of bovine colostrum supplementation on immune variables and exercise performance in trained cyclists</field><field name="creator">Shing, Cecilia Mary</field><field name="description">Bovine colostrum is homologous in composition to human colostrum but contains greater concentrations of key bioactive components that contribute directly to growth and immunity. It has been used by humans to treat and prevent enteric pathogens and to promote wound healing and intestinal repair. Moreover, bovine colostrum has been promoted and used by athletes as a supplement to enhance immune function and improve exercise performance. This is despite limited data in support of its value to athletes and the relative absence of strong data that identify mechanisms that could improve exercise performance and immune function. The aim of the three studies that comprise this thesis was therefore to investigate the influence of a bovine colostrum protein concentrate (CPC) on immune variables, hormone concentrations, autonomic activity and exercise performance in highly-trained endurance cyclists. Study one involved monitoring exercise performance and immune variables during an eight week bovine CPC supplementation period, which included five consecutive days of high-intensity training (HIT). Twenty-nine highly-trained male road cyclists completed an initial 40-km time trial (TT40) and were then randomly assigned to either a supplement (n=14, 10 g bovine CPC per day) or placebo group (n=15, 10 g whey protein concentrate per day). Following five weeks of supplementation, the cyclists completed a second TT40 before undertaking five consecutive days of high-intensity training (HIT) that included another TT40. A final TT40 was completed one week following the HIT. Venous blood and saliva samples were collected immediately before and after each TT40, and upper respiratory illness symptoms were recorded over the experimental period. Supplementation with bovine CPC elicited improvements in TT40 performance at the end of the HIT period, when compared to the placebo group, (1.9&#177;2.2%; mean&#177;90% confidence limits) and maintained ventilatory threshold following the HIT (4.6&#177;4.6%). When compared to the placebo group, bovine CPC supplementation significantly increased pre-exercise serum soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor 1 during the HIT period (p&lt;0.039).

When compared to the placebo group, bovine CPC supplementation significantly increased pre-exercise serum soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor 1 during the HIT period (p&lt;0.039). Supplementation also suppressed the post-exercise decrease in cytotoxic/suppressor T cells during the HIT period (bovine CPC=- 1.0&#177;2.7%, placebo=-9.2&#177;2.8%; mean&#177;SE, p=0.017) and during the following week (bovine CPC=1.4&#177;2.9%, placebo=-8.2&#177;2.8%, p=0.004). In addition, bovine CPC supplementation prevented a post-exercise decrease in serum IgG2 concentration at the end of the HIT period (bovine CPC=4.8&#177;6.8%, p=0.88; placebo=-9.7&#177;6.9%, p=0.013) and there was a trend towards reduced incidence of upper respiratory illness symptoms in the bovine CPC group (p=0.055). Study one demonstrated that low dose bovine CPC supplementation elicited improvements in TT40 performance during a HIT period and maintained ventilatory threshold following five consecutive days of HIT. Supplementation was also found to modulate immune variables during normal training and following an acute period of intense exercise, which may have contributed to the trend toward reduced upper respiratory illness in the bovine CPC group. The maintenance of performance, prevention of post-exercise suppression of IgG2 and cytotoxic/suppressor T cells and increase in anti-inflammatory serum soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor 1 suggest that bovine CPC supplementation is beneficial to cyclists during a period of high-intensity training. The aim of Study two was to investigate the hormonal, immune and autonomic responses of competitive cyclists over a five-day stage race following eight weeks of bovine CPC supplementation. Ten highly-trained male road cyclists were randomly assigned to a placebo (n=6, 10 g whey protein concentrate/day) or bovine CPC group (n=4, 10 g bovine CPC/day). Cyclists provided a baseline saliva sample before commencing supplementation that culminated in a five day competitive cycle race. The cyclists provided daily saliva samples and heart rate variability (HRV) was measured on each day of the race. A Profile of Mood States questionnaire was completed on days one, three and five of the race and cyclists recorded upper respiratory illness symptoms throughout the experimental period. While there was no influence of bovine CPC on salivary IgA, supplementation maintained testosterone concentrations over the competition period (p&lt;0.05) and prevented a decrease in parasympathetic activity (p&lt;0.05). There was also a trend towards improved mood state (p=0.06) in the bovine CPC group. These data indicate that bovine CPC supplementation may prevent disturbances in autonomic function and the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis associated with consecutive days of cycle racing The aim of study three was to assess whether bovine CPC would directly stimulate cytokine production of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), with and without lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and phytohemagglutinin (PHA) stimulation. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was added to cell cultures as a potent enhancer of monocyte and macrophage cytokine release and a model of exercise stress. Phytohemagglutinin was added to PBMC to stimulate T cell proliferation. Blood was sampled from four healthy, male endurance cyclists who had abstained from exercise for 48 hours. PBMC were separated and cultured with bovine CPC concentrations of 0 (control), 1.25, 2.5 and 5% with and without LPS (3&#181;g&#183;mL-1) and PHA (2.5&#181;g&#183;mL-1). Cell supernatants were collected at 6 and 24 hours of culture for the determination of tumour necrosis factor (TNF), interferon (IFN)-y, interleukin (IL)-10, IL-6, IL-4 and IL-2 concentrations. Following six hours of PBMC incubation at 37&#176;C with 5% CO2, IFN-y, IL-10 and IL-2 secretion were increased with increasing concentrations of bovine CPC (p&lt;0.05). In a dose dependent manner, IFN-y and IL-2 remained elevated following 24 hours of incubation (p&lt;0.05). Data from this final study showed that bovine CPC modulates in vitro cytokine production of human PBMC. In conclusion, the present data suggest that bovine CPC supplementation is beneficial to highlytrained cyclists during periods of high-intensity training and competition. Bovine CPC promotes the release of cell mediated cytokines from PBMC and has the potential therefore to influence a number of physiological systems. Supplementation was associated with enhanced recovery over consecutive days of high-intensity training and competition, as evidenced by maintained exercise performance, ventilatory threshold and testosterone concentrations. Bovine CPC modulated immune function, particularly at the end of a HIT period, and there was a trend for reduced incidence of upper respiratory symptoms following bovine CPC supplementation in Study one. The data collectively suggest that bovine CPC supplementation may influence a combination of physiological pathways including the autonomic nervous system and the hypothalamic-pituitary axis.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321401 Exercise Physiology</field><field name="subject">750203 Organised sports</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158236</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Antigenic, genetic and biological characterization of the flavivirus Alfuy.</field><field name="creator">May, Fiona J.</field><field name="description">Alfuy virus (ALFV) is a member of the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) antigenic complex of flaviviruses and is currently classified as a subtype of Murray Valley encephalitis virus (MVEV). However, while MVEV and JEV pose significant health risks to regions of Northern Australia, there is little evidence that ALFV causes disease in humans or other animals. Due to the apparent low pathogenicity of ALFV, few studies have previously focused on this virus, therefore, very little is known about it. This thesis aims to improve our understanding of this virus, with the potential of using ALFV, or markers of attenuation discovered within its genome, to develop novel vaccines for use against MVEV, JEV, and even other members of the Flavivirus genus. Previously, nucleotide sequence analysis of a small portion of the genome of ALFV was used to reclassify the virus as a subtype of MVEV. During this project the entire genome of ALFV was sequenced and compared with other members of the genus. Phylogenetic relationships revealed that although ALFV is closely related to MVEV, it is no closer to MVEV than to JEV or to Usutu virus, suggesting that ALFV should not be classed as a subtype of MVEV. Indeed, antigenic studies comparing ALFV, MVEV and JEV, using mAbs produced to MVEV, show a distinct antigenic profile for ALFV. Several unique genetic markers that may affect the virulence of ALFV were observed in the genome. Within the envelope (E) protein, the conserved Nlinked glycosylation motif contained a substitution causing a loss of glycosylation. Also within the E protein, the hinge region, involved in low-pH dependent conformational changes in the protein, also showed several amino acid differences when compared with MVEV and other related viruses. In addition, the highly conserved terminal dinucleotide was deleted. This region is thought to be important for replication of viral RNA. Virulence studies of different strains of ALFV in three-week old Swiss outbred mice also show a different pattern of virulence to MVEV. While MVEV is highly neurovirulent and neuroinvasive in these animals, ALFV exhibits weak neuroinvasiveness, producing very little disease in mice infected intraperitoneally, and producing ALFV-specific antibody only in mice infected with high doses. Even in the highly susceptible IFN-alphaR-/- mice (deficient in the receptor for interferon-alpha), ALFV caused significantly delayed mortality. This data suggests that ALFV is inefficient at replicating in the periphery of these animals. ALFV also exhibited a different tropism to MVEV in vitro, showing significantly reduced replication in Vero cells, a line of African Green Monkey kidney cells that supports efficient replication of all other members of the JEV complex. Binding studies showed that ALFV was able to bind to the surface of these cells, but electroporation of viral RNA directly into the cytoplasm was unable to initiate infection, suggesting inefficient replication or translation of ALFV viral RNA in this cell type. To determine the motifs responsible for these unique phenotypic characteristics of ALFV, three chimeric viruses were engineered based on a previously constructed infectious clone of MVEV. One, containing the structural (prM and E) genes of ALFV in the MVEV backbone, exhibited weak neuroinvasiveness, similar to ALFV, but unlike ALFV, was able to replicate efficiently in Vero cells, and produced ALFVspecific antibody in mice infected with low viral doses. This suggests that the structural genes of ALFV are associated with poor neuroinvasion, but are not responsible for poor extraneural replication in mice, or lack of growth in Vero cells. Another mutant virus was constructed by deleting the terminal dinucleotide in the MVEV infectious clone. This clone spontaneously reverted to the wild type sequence, preventing phenotypic analysis of this mutation. The final chimera contained the nonstructural genes of ALFV with the structural genes and the UTRs of MVEV. Unfortunately, despite several attempts, this clone was unstable in the bacterial host, and insertions or deletions were spontaneously introduced into the genome. Based on phylogenetic, antigenic and virulence data, ALFV is sufficiently different from MVEV to be classified as a separate virus within the genus. Determinants of the low neuroinvasiveness of ALFV have been localized to the structural genes of ALFV, probably within the hinge region of E, and/or due to the lack of glycosylation of the E protein. The cause of the delayed growth in Vero cells was unable to be determined, but is not due to a motif within the structural genes.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270206 Genetic Immunology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158119</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Palynology, sequence stratigraphy, and palaeoenvironments of Middle to Upper Jurassic strata, Bayu-Undan Field, Timor Sea region</field><field name="creator">Mantle, Daniel</field><field name="description">Detailed palynological analysis of 230 core and sidewall core samples from the uppermost Plover, Elang, and lower Frigate formations, Bayu-Undan Field, Timor Sea, reveals the presence of diverse and moderately well preserved palynomorph assemblages (predominantly dinoflagellate cysts, together with acritarchs, spores, and pollen grains) that facilitate biostratigraphic, sequence stratigraphic, and palaeoenvironmental interpretations. The palynomorph assemblages, detailed systematically herein, comprise 96 spore and pollen species, 84 dinoflagellate species, and 15 acritarch species. Of these, the following 14 dinoflagellate cyst species are newly instituted: Ampulladinium aiax, Batiacasphaera macbethiae, Broomea fusticulum, Cauca bayuiana, Egmontodinium elongatum, Ellipsoidictyum fenestellum, Evansia? lacryma, Leberidocysta? strigosus, Leptodinium? ancoralium, Meiourogonyaulax baculata, Nannoceratopsis reticulata, Paragonyaulacysta? feneseptata, P. helbyi, and Yalkalpodinium playfordii. A further five species are not formally named due to a lack of adequately preserved specimens. One genus, Broomea COOKSON&amp;EISENACK, is formally emended. The palynostratigraphic sequence has previously been assessed as latest Bathonian to early Oxfordian in age, based mainly on correlations with European dinoflagellate assemblages dated by ammonite faunas. Ten subzones (TB1-5 and VT1-5) are informally erected, collectively encompassing the Ternia balmei and Voodooia tabulata dinoflagellate cyst Interval Zones. The subzones are defined variously on first and last appearance datums, first and last common occurrences, and species acmes. The acme events are coincident with marine flooding surfaces and enable precise correlation across the Bayu-Undan Field. The Elang Formation &#150; the prime focus of this study &#150; is divided into three third order sequences, each comprising a lowstand, transgressive, and highstand systems tract. These tracts and their delimiting stratal horizons or flooding surfaces possess distinctive palynological or palynodebris assemblages. Qualitative and quantitative variations of these assemblages correlate very closely with gamma-ray log profiles and can be consistently placed within a sequence stratigraphic framework across the Bayu- Undan Field. Palynofacies analyses provide additional means to distinguish among the systems tracts; viz., microphytoplankton diversity increases through transgressive systems tracts to a peak diversity at the maximum flooding surface; atypically brown wood frequencies may also peak at maximum flooding surfaces; and black debris frequencies increase higher in the highstand systems tracts. Palaeoenvironmental interpretations based primarily on palynological assemblages (especially microphytoplankton groupings and palynodebris distribution) provide a means to identify depositional settings in non-cored intervals. For instance, the occurrences of Ternia balmei, the Meiourogonyaulax group, the Ctenidodinium group, and the Rigaudella group represent an approximate gradient from very nearshore to offshore environments or possibly an increase in salinities from euryhaline to stenohaline conditions.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">260113 Palynology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158275</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transformative Power in Motherwork: A Study of Mothering in the 1950s and 1960s</field><field name="creator">Porter, Marie</field><field name="description">In this thesis I explore the experiences of a group of Australian women who became first-time mothers between 1950 and 1965. I interviewed twenty-four mothers, half of whom were selected as practising Roman Catholics. The other half was AnglicanfProtestant by co-incidence rather than selection. The data in this research have been collected via in-depth, unstructured interviews with the participants. The interviews were taped and transcribed verbatim, before the data were analysed. I present a grounded theory of transformative power in motherwork that has emerged from the analysis of interviews. The mothers talked about what they did in their active mothering years. I argue that despite being constrained by the gender bias in the patriarchal context, these mothers were agents who developed skills that enabled them to resist or creatively deal with the constraints they faced. Their emphasis was on their agency and the power to nurture their children into responsible adults. Their awareness of the importance of their motherwork acted as a motivator in this development. My thesis is that the relationship between each mother and each of her children is a transformative power relationship in which both mother and child are transformedthe child into an independent adult and the mother into a skilled self-motivated agent through her mothenvork. Any threat to this process resulted in the mother doing all she could to resist or counteract the constraintls she was encountering. Transformative power expressed in motherwork can be recognised analytically by several characteristics. It empowers both parties in the motherlchild duality. Complexity, diversity, fluidity, and responsiveness to the physical, intellectual, and emotional aspects of the relationship are all evident in transformative power relationships. Through their own transformation, the mothers saw the falsity of the master narratives of motherhood, prevalent in society in the 1950s and 1960s, which they had believed as inexperienced girls. From their stories about motherwork, I reveal a counter narrative that was portrayed not only in their telling of their stories: but in their discursivelreflexive practices as mothers.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">370104 Urban Sociology and Community Studies</field><field name="subject">440207 Religion and Society</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158105</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Secularising the Veil: A Study of Legal and Cultural Issues Arising from the Wearing of the Islamic Headscarf in the 'affaire du foulard' in France.</field><field name="creator">Jones, Pamela Nicolette (Nicky) Louise</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a study of the institutions, forms and manifestations of secularism, or 'la&#239;cit&#233;', in France, in the context of a series of events which came to be called the 'affaire du foulard'. The first incidents in the affaire took place in September 1989 with the expulsion of three primary schoolgirls in Creil, in the north of France, who were insisting on wearing the Islamic headscarf (known in French as the 'foulard') to school. Their actions were deemed contrary to the fundamental Republican principle of secularism in public schools, and the events were reported in several newspapers, before becoming a national controversy in media around the country. In this case, however, it was difficult to know how to interpret and apply la&#239;cit&#233; in the context of a modern public school in the French Republic. The principle of secularism, or la&#239;cit&#233;, is a central tenet of French public policy, and public education in particular. La&#239;cit&#233; also represents a set of social and cultural values which have profound historical resonances for many French people. At the same time, the public schools were unsure of how to negotiate their students&#146; freedom of religious expression, which, according to historical and legislative texts, is protected and upheld by the concept of la&#239;cit&#233;, while also ensuring that the principle of la&#239;cit&#233; was maintained. In a bid to resolve the uncertainty, France&#146;s highest administrative court, the Conseil d&#146;&#201;tat, handed down a legal opinion in November 1989 in which it stated that the wearing of religious signs in public schools was not by itself incompatible with la&#239;cit&#233; in France, although the religious signs could be prohibited in certain circumstances. In addition, various ministerial circulars were issued by successive Education Ministers between 1989 and 1994 to advise schools on how the law was to be interpreted and applied in this matter. One of the circulars, issued in 1994 by Fran&#231;ois Bayrou, encouraged schools to prohibit the wearing of the foulard and to apply strict penalties if Muslim girls continued to wear it. These measures resulted in an increase in the number of Muslim schoolgirls expelled for wearing the foulard, as well as in the numbers of public protests against the expulsions and the circular itself. Some of the schoolgirls and their families appealed against the expulsion decisions, and their cases appeared before France&#146;s administrative courts over the years between 1992 and 1997. My thesis examines the key legal and administrative texts in the affaire du foulard, including the Conseil d&#146;&#201;tat&#146;s 1989 legal opinion and the ministerial circulars, noting the legal implications of successive circulars and the shifts in government policy which they represented. In addition, my thesis analyses the transcripts of many of the legal judgements in the &#147;headscarf&#148; legal cases. These judgements were important not only in deciding the future education of the schoolgirls, but also in clarifying the 1989 opinion. They established a consistent set of principles to define the circumstances in which wearing religious signs such as the foulard was considered compatible or not with la&#239;cit&#233; in public schools. The results of this analysis indicate that, contrary to popular opinion in relation to the affaire du foulard, the majority of cases were decided in the Muslim girls&#146; favour and upheld their right to wear a religious sign such as the Islamic headscarf at school. Recently, however, the legal regime in France governing the wearing of religious signs has changed. In early 2004, a new law on secularism was passed by the French Parliament to prohibit the wearing of the foulard (and indeed all visible religious signs) in public schools. The law has been welcomed by many sectors of the French community, but has also provoked extensive public protests. The passage of the new law does not alter either the analytical work or the conclusions of this thesis. Rather, the thesis offers an insight into the background of the affaire du foulard and thus a more informed appreciation of the potential legal and social consequences of the 2004 law in future years. The principal aim of this thesis is to provide a careful account of the institutions and operation of the principle of secularism, or la&#239;cit&#233;, in France. My research also explains some of the complexities of the legislative regime established by the Conseil d&#146;&#201;tat and the administrative courts, who worked to balance priorities of freedom of religion and la&#239;cit&#233; as well as to protect the education of many expelled Muslim schoolgirls, and in so doing, my thesis highlights the complexity of the principle of la&#239;cit&#233; itself.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">390305 Law and Society</field><field name="subject">780106 Political science and public policy</field><field name="subject">Secular</field><field name="subject">secularism</field><field name="subject">la&#239;cit&#233;</field><field name="subject">France</field><field name="subject">Islamic</field><field name="subject">veil</field><field name="subject">headscarf</field><field name="subject">hijab</field><field name="subject">foulard</field><field name="subject">affaire du foulard</field><field name="subject">secularism law</field><field name="subject">separation of Church and State</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158015</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bivalves and the Bucephalidae: A parasitic system on the Great Barrier Reef</field><field name="creator">Bott, Nathan James</field><field name="description">This study set out to examine, for the first time, both the molluscan intermediate and the teleost definitive hosts of a major assemblage of trematode parasites present on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). The parasite taxon was the Bucephalidae which occur in piscivorous fishes as sexually reproducing adults and in bivalves as asexually reproducing stages. The goal was to characterise the overall richness of the system and to explore patterns of host-specificity. Because of the size of this fauna it was not possible to incorporate all the taxa found in this study. This thesis reports the results of a survey of bivalves from this region, taxonomic studies on several elements of the fauna of fishes, and efforts to link life-cycles between bivalves and fishes. I surveyed 2256 bivalve individuals (47 species, 17 families) from South-east Queensland, Heron Island (southern GBR) and Lizard Island (northern GBR). Infections of trematode species from three families, Bucephalidae, Gorgoderidae and Monorchiidae, were found. Overall prevalence of infection was 2.3%. The Bucephalidae (11 species) was the most commonly found family. A single gorgoderid infection was found from a venerid, Lioconcha castrensis. This is the first report of a gorgoderid from a marine bivalve and phylogenetic analysis suggests that the species belongs to the Gorgoderinae. Monorchiids (5 species) were found from Tellinidae and Lucinidae. All infections are new host/parasite records. I deduce that this study produced lifecycle information, but no actual identifications, for 10% of the species of trematodes that infect bivalves of Queensland marine waters. Prosorhynchoides apogonis n. sp. is described from the intestine of the apogonid Cheilodipterus macrodon from the southern GBR. This is the first bucephalid to be described from the teleost family Apogonidae. Prosorhynchoides lamprelli n. sp. is described from the intestine of the carangid Caranx papuensis from off Lizard Island, GBR. This is the first bucephalid to be described from Caranx papuensis. A new trematode genus, Grammatorcynicola n. g. (Dolichoenterinae), and two new species, G. brayi n. sp. and G. nolani n. sp., are described from the intestines of the scombrids, Grammatorcynus bicarinatus and Gr. bilineatus respectively. Grammatorcynicola n. g. differs from other dolichoenterine genera in having a simple sucker-like rhynchus, the ovary anterior to the testes and by not having a particularly thick cirrus-sac wall. Six new species of bucephalid trematodes from the prosorhynchine bucephalid genera Prosorhynchus Odhner, 1905 and Neidhartia Nagaty, 1937 are reported from the epinepheline serranid genera Cephalopholis, Cromileptes, Epinephelus and Variola from the GBR. Two species of Prosorhynchus and one Neidhartia are reported from Epinephelus spp., P. jexi n. sp. from E. quoyanus, P. lafii n. sp. from E. fuscoguttatus, and N. epinepheli n. sp. from E. maculatus. The other species are P. robertsthomsoni n. sp. from several species of Cephalopholis, P. conorjonesi n. sp. from Cromileptes altivelis, and P. milleri n. sp. from Variola louti. I examined three species of Plectropomus (Serranidae: Epinephelinae), Pl. laevis, Pl. leopardus and Pl. maculatus from off Heron Island and Lizard Island on the GBR. Nine bucephalid species from the Prosorhynchinae were found, three species of Neidhartia and six species of Prosorhynchus. The three species of Neidhartia, N. haywardi n. sp., N. plectropomi n. sp. and N. tyleri n. sp., are readily distinguishable by morphology. Two of the six species of Prosorhynchus (P. lesteri n. sp. and P. wrightae n. sp.) are easily distinguished from their other congeners by morphology but the other four species (P. adlardi n. sp., P. heronensis n. sp., P. munozae n. sp. and P. plectropomi n. sp.) are highly similar in morphology and were only distinguished convincingly by comparing their ITS2 rDNA sequences. Both P. adlardi n. sp. and P. wrightae n. sp. have also been found once in V. louti at Lizard Island. This is also the first study to identify life-cycle matches of the Bucephalidae using molecular techniques. I found two perfect life-cycle matches (identical sequences). The bivalve host of Prosorhynchoides lamprelli is a tellinid, Exotica clathrata; Rhipidocotyle sp. from the sphyraenid Sphyraena jello also has E. clathrata as its first intermediate host. Bayesian Inference Analysis shows that all seven species from bivalves that were sequenced belong to the Bucephalinae. Perhaps the most striking finding of the study was that one bivalve species, E. clathrata, was shown to harbour four separate species. Matching of ITS2 rDNA sequences between life-cycle stages is highly effective in circumstances of great richness such as the Great Barrier Reef. Based on my data collected, the total bucephalid species in the system is estimated to be 84.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300508 Parasitology</field><field name="subject">780105 Biological sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158287</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Respect for the world: Universal ethics and the morality of terraforming</field><field name="creator">York, Paul Francis</field><field name="description">This dissertation aims to develop an ethical system that can properly frame such questions as the morality of large-scale efforts to transform inanimate parts of nature, for example, proposals to terraform Mars. Such an ethics diverges from traditional approaches to ethics because it expands the class of entities regarded as morally considerable to include inanimate entities. I approach the task by building on the environmental ethical theory of Paul W. Taylor, as developed in his 1986 book Respect for Nature: A Theory of Environmental Ethics. I discuss various criticisms of Taylor and propose two extensions to his theory: an expansion of the scope of moral considerability to include all concrete material objects and the introduction of the concept of variable moral significance (the notion that all entities have inherent worth but some have more than others). Using Taylor&#146;s modified and extended theory as a foundation, I develop something I call universal ethics. This is an ethical framework whose key elements are a fundamental ethical attitude of respect for the world and a principle of minimal harm. Universal ethics regards all concrete material entities, whether living or not, and whether natural or artefactual, as inherently valuable, and therefore as entitled to the respect of moral agents. I offer a defence of this ethical framework and discuss a number of practical applications, including criticism of proposals for the terraforming of Mars. I conclude that terraforming Mars or any other celestial body at this point in our history would be morally wrong. I also suggest that universal ethics provides an ethical foundation for efforts to protect Antarctica, and that it has implications for our relations to other inanimate parts of our world, including artefacts.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">780199 Other</field><field name="subject">440103 Ethical Theory</field><field name="subject">environmental philosophy</field><field name="subject">environmental ethics</field><field name="subject">environment</field><field name="subject">inherent worth</field><field name="subject">complexity</field><field name="subject">integrity</field><field name="subject">information</field><field name="subject">moral considerability</field><field name="subject">moral significance</field><field name="subject">moral standing</field><field name="subject">principle of minimal harm</field><field name="subject">imperative to knowledge</field><field name="subject">Mars</field><field name="subject">Antarctica</field><field name="subject">inanimate nature</field><field name="subject">artefacts</field><field name="subject">vandalism</field><field name="subject">extraterrestrial</field><field name="subject">Paul W Taylor</field><field name="subject">anthropocentrism</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158029</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Existence and Time : ethical and metaphysical questions concerning immortality and longevity</field><field name="creator">O'Brien, Carol Ann</field><field name="description">This dissertation is arranged in three parts which address issues concerning death and immortality. These issues all revolve around the temporal limit imposed by death. I have endeavoured to pose some questions which have relevance to a society clutching onto traditional notions of an afterlife despite its headlong thrust into a technologically advanced future where ethical confusions abound. In the first chapter I examine the metaphysics of the soul because postulating an afterlife is the conventional response to death anxiety. I have noticed that many people cling to hope of immortality without having any understanding of the metaphysical architecture of this hope. Consequently, from a philosophical perspective, I contrast arguments on the soul by Plato, Aristotle, Aquinas and Descartes. The second chapter emerges from a fascination with Epicurus's theory of living and, derivatively, of dying. It involves a comparison with (1) Aristotle's distinction between energeia (actuality) and kinesis (movement), and (2) the sybaritic hedonism of the Cyrenaics. Although the theme of this chapter is pleasure, it will be seen that pleasure lies embedded in the living project and is an important component in the drive for survival. In the third chapter I reflect on the meaning of life in conjunction with length of time lived. Here I compare the meaninglessness experienced by Leo Tolstoy (because his life is too short) and the meaninglessness experienced by the fictional character Elena Makropulos (because her life is too long). The Makropulos "case", both a play by Karel Capek and an opera by Leos Janacek, was introduced into the philosophical world by Bernard Williams.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">440103 Ethical Theory</field><field name="subject">Death</field><field name="subject">Immortality</field><field name="subject">longevity</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157928</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Planctomycete diversity and cell biology: perspectives from the molecular, cellular and organism levels</field><field name="creator">Butler, Margaret Kay</field><field name="description">The Planctomycetes are a deep branching phylum of the domain Bacteria that incorporate a diverse group of organisms possessing a number of unusual and distinct characteristics. These features include budding reproduction, the planctomycetecharacteristic crateriform structures on their cell surface, a cell wall that lacks peptidoglycan, internal compartmentalisation and unique molecular features of their rRNA genes. This study chose to investigate a number of aspects of planctomycete cell biology and diversity to further our knowledge of this unique group. In a study of the diversity of ribonuclease P (RNase P) RNA, one molecule of relevance to cell biology and compartmentalisation in planctomycetes, RNase P RNA genes were sequenced for species from all genera of planctomycetes for which a pure culture exists. Secondary structures for RNase P RNA of these strains were deduced, taking to 26 the number of planctomycete RNase P RNA structures. Nucleotide positions were identified in which some planctomycetes possess a less common form, including one thought to be otherwise conserved within all Bacteria and Archaea. Phylogenetic analysis of RNase P RNA genes was relatively consistent with that of 16S rRNA genes with the exception that clustering of Gemmata and anammox sequences occurred, possibly due to either long-branch attraction or lateral gene transfer. Analysis of RNase P RNA secondary structures revealed unusual features of planctomycetes relative to all other bacteria, including an additional helix within the P13 helix of &#145;Candidatus Brocadia anammoxidans&#146;, &#145;Candidatus Kuenenia stuttgartiensis&#146; and all Gemmata sequences. The longest P12 helix of any bacteria type A RNase P RNA was found in a Gemmatalike isolate. The short tandem repeats in P12 helices of two Gemmata-like isolates are possibly analogous to short tandem repetitive repeat sequences of some cyanobacteria RNase P RNA. In experiments using Gemmata obscuriglobus as a model for planctomycete cell biology and compartmentalisation functions, electron microscope-level in situ hybridisation (EMISH), and subsequent statistical analysis, was developed to localise 16S rRNA, 23S rRNA and RNase P RNA to particular regions within Gemmata obscuriglobus, the first instance of EMISH being applied in this way to bacteria. Statistical analysis localised 16S rRNA to both nuclear body and to riboplasm outside this region but it was absent from paryphoplasm. While co-localisation of both 16S rRNA and 23S rRNA molecules, which might indicate assembled ribosomes, was rarely observed, 23S rRNA, like 16S rRNA, was distributed in both riboplasm-containing areas of the cell. While statistical analysis revealed minor DNA within riboplasm outside the nuclear body, the majority was localised to that body. These results suggest at least some uncoupling of translation from transcription involving ribosomes in the riboplasm. RNase P RNA was localised both to the nuclear body and to the riboplasm outside this region, suggesting that pre-tRNA processing occurs both within nuclear body, where RNA transcripts are presumably generated, and outside nuclear body, separated from the origin of these transcripts. This is also consistent with the hypothesis that processed tRNA is required in the riboplasm outside the nuclear body, due to occurrence of some uncoupled translation. In research on planctomycetes not yet examined with respect to cell plan or structure, 16S rRNA gene sequencing of isolate ATCC 35122 confirmed its very close relationship to the type strain of Pirellula staleyi and its membership of the phylum Planctomycetes. Morphological characteristics, including polar crateriform structures and the occurrence of a unique internal, single membrane-bounded compartment enclosing nucleoid and ribosome-like particles, the pirellulosome, and a polar cap region, are also consistent with its membership of the planctomycetes and of genus Pirellula. Cells often displayed pointed, hump-like protrusions opposite each other on the cell, constituting prosthecae. Also re-examined using a number of methods were uncultured species Planctomyces bekefii and Pl. guttaeformis. Samples could be enriched for Pl. bekefii via either addition of ferric citrate or ampicillin. An application of a novel approach, laser microdissection and pressure catapulting, was also used physically to enrich P. bekefii rosettes. Fluorescent in situ hybridisation provided the first molecular evidence of Pl. bekefii and Pl. guttaeformis as Planctomycetes. Also confirming Planctomycetes membership of Pl. bekefii was the presence of a cytoplasm divided into two regions by an intracytoplasmic membrane, consistent with membership to the genus Planctomyces. Two new planctomycete-like organisms, MBLW1 and MBLW2, were isolated in this study and possessed a Gemmata-like cell plan. 16S rRNA gene sequencing confirmed these isolates belonged to the Gemmata clade within phylum Planctomycetes, though they may comprise a separate but closely related genus. Via EMISH, both ATCC 35122 and MBLW1 were hybridised with a planctomycete-specific probe, consistent with membership to the planctomycetes. Statistical analysis showed that 16S rRNA was present in both regions of the riboplasm of MBLW1, identical to the distribution observed G. obscuriglobus. This is another example of possible uncoupled translation within a member of the planctomycetes and within organisms in the Gemmata clade of planctomycetes.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270399 Microbiology not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158079</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Political Economy of the Music Industry: Technological Change and the Political Control of Music</field><field name="creator">Cvetkovski, Trajce</field><field name="description">The task undertaken in this dissertation is to determine the extent of the challenge facing the major firms (majors) who currently control over 80% of global sound carrier and publishing revenue in the popular (pop) music industry. The aim of this thesis is to explain the disorganising effects currently being experienced. Specifically, the central question guiding this thesis asks: what will be the effect of new technologies on the future organisation of the music industry? I focus broadly on recent universally accessible digital technologies which have raised questions about the future of the industry&#146;s current organisational structure and processes both in terms of input (creation of music products in their commodified form) and output (access and consumption of music products). The industry&#146;s processes are highly integrated and its business model is complex because it centres around the sophisticated management and aggressive appropriation of intellectual property (namely copyright) for repeated exploitation for decades after its initial acquisition. The purpose of this research, therefore, is to examine not only the tangible aspects of the manner in which the industry&#146;s organises its products but also the intangible dimension. Significant recent changes experienced by the industry are identified. The literature is not conclusive in terms of explaining these developments. While existing research exists on recent developments, a comprehensive analysis of the organisation of the industry both in terms of input and output remains underdeveloped in the literature. In particular, in relation to product re-organisation and consumer behaviour, copyright development and corporate restructuring, the literature is not fully developed. Current research is focused on illegitimate technological attacks &#150; namely digital piracy. However these do not adequately or comprehensively explain current disorganisation in the industry. This dissertation remedies this deficiency by proposing four separate but interconnected factors are affecting the highly concentrated status quo. Together, the positive and negative impacts of emerging technologies have created a serious dilemma in terms of product commodification for the controllers of the industry. I argue interconnected illegitimate and legitimate technological challenges are at play suggesting re-organisation is occurring multidimensionally. The research undertaken is empirically grounded, and though primarily based on qualitative data (and subsequent quantitative data for statistical corroboration), the current work has implications for understanding the industry&#146;s methods. Together, these approaches form the basis of the dissertation&#146;s methodology. The research reported in this dissertation attempts to determine to what extent the use and consumption of these different technologies can be regarded as the primary catalyst for the challenge to corporate control of the music industry, and the manner in which it is structured. If the dominant few intend to identify and rationalise challenges in terms of their corporate model, then they must understand the dynamic nature of interacting technologies.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">popular music</field><field name="subject">copyright</field><field name="subject">internet</field><field name="subject">technology</field><field name="subject">creative industries</field><field name="subject">MP3</field><field name="subject">pop culture</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158010</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Validation of a CFD Solver for Hypersonic Flows</field><field name="creator">Elford, Michael Charles</field><field name="description">In this thesis the validation of a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code against published experimental data and alternative CFD results is explored. Six case studies are presented with flow speeds ranging from mid supersonic to hypersonic. The studies include complex compressible flow phenomena such as the interaction of shockwaves with boundary layers, vortices and other shockwaves. Two of the six validation cases also consider complex thermodynamic behaviour such as vibrational and chemical nonequilibrium. The problems chosen are limited in scope to flows which are planar or axisymmetric and remain laminar throughout the region of flow studied. This allows the studies to focus on simulating the fundamental behaviour of the flow without the added complication of turbulence or the need for large scale computing facilities. The problems which arose during the validation studies and a background to why they occurred and, wherever possible, strategies to avoid their occurrence are discussed. General modelling strategies in compressible CFD are also discussed. In this thesis the software suite CFD-FASTRAN is used to construct and analyse the CFD models.

I developed field-based feeding assays with practical relevance to preventative action and remedial treatment of infestations of xylophagous insects in the built environment. Essential to this work is facilitating a high termite risk by maintaining an environment conducive to sustained foraging by termites. Feeding assays conducted in low termite risk areas are unduly prolonged, with inherently erratic termite feeding responses. I successfully developed feeding assays with a high termite risk. To establish whether a physical barrier, retrofitted as a sleeve, could prevent termites from damaging wooden poles, eighty poles were established within Beerburrum State Forest, south-east Queensland, Australia. Poles within sets were interconnected with buried timber to facilitate a high risk to Coptotermes acinaciformis (Froggatt). Mesh sleeves to a depth of 1.5m did not prevent termite damage to the poles. Hoop pine Araucaria cunninghamii Ait. ex D.Don dowels ("dip-sticks") were useful termite monitoring devices on the poles. The depth of foraging by termites has implications for the effectiveness of retrofitted physical and chemical barriers in general. Timber quantity and quality has a pivotal influence on the aggregation of large numbers of feeding termites necessary for baiting work and for producing efficacy data of relevance to the protection of timber-in-service from termites. Seasonal variation in termite foraging was examined. Both C. acinaciformis and Coptotermes lacteus (Froggatt) were more active feeding in summer than in autumn. In general, mass loss followed mean ambient temperature. Suppression of C. acinaciformis feeding responses relative to C. lacteus during summer, particularly during January, is thought to be due to excessive temperatures in the containers attached to infested trees. Termite foraging behaviour and responses to both varying masses of softwood timbers and varying exposure times were investigated. The rate of mass loss was independent of the number of test specimens and appeared linear. Colonies regulate the number of foragers directly according to the mass of susceptible timber available. This phenomenon was exploited throughout the remainder of the thesis. Of particular significance was the considerable intra- and inter-specific variation in susceptibility of softwoods to C. acinaciformis and Mastotermes darwiniensis Froggatt. The sapwoods tested were susceptible, but the heartwoods were generally resistant to damage by termites. These data confirm that termites are discriminating feeders, and some more so than others. A novel methodology, developed to maintain an environment conducive to sustained foraging by termites during field-testing, is presented. Consistency in timber acceptance and susceptibility to termites is considered to be important in determining the frequency of inspection and the success of bait systems. I evaluate the termiticidal activity of the bait toxicants hexaflumuron and chlorfluazuron for the management of the subterranean termite C. acinaciformis in the field. The Sentricon&#61650; Colony Elimination System with Baitube&#61650;-devices containing 0.1% and 1% mass/mass (m/m) hexaflumuron bait toxicant in dry wood flour (Recruit&#61650;) was successful in eliminating field colonies of C. acinaciformis. Similarly, the Exterra&#61668; Termite Interception and Baiting System with cellulose-acetate powder containing either 0.05% m/m or 0.25% m/m chlorfluazuron (Requiem&#61668;) eliminated C. acinaciformis. Indicators (including "dip-sticks") used to monitor colony health were reliable. By using C. acinaciformis, which builds mounds (epigeous nests) in northern Australia, I was able to avoid the use of multiple mark-release schemes to verify the effects of the bait toxicant on the termite colonies. Problems with multiple mark-release schemes, used elsewhere in the world, are discussed. I continued the focus on bait quality and placement by evaluating termite responses to two aspects of treated stakes, their attractiveness and their susceptibility. Three experiments were undertaken near Townsville and at Beerburrum, with Coptotermes and Schedorhinotermes. Whilst there were no significant differences in the rate of location and foraging, with respect to treatments, differences in foraging, with respect to C. acinaciformis and Schedorhinotermes seclusus (Hill) were significant. Coptotermes acinaciformis displayed greater foraging site tenacity than S. seclusus at Beerburrum. Increased consumption of bait, due to the addition of a phagostimulant, needs to be observed in the field before an increase in the efficacy of baits in a termite management program can be claimed. In Australia, softwood timbers are extensively used in building construction and are generally highly susceptible to damage by termites. I focussed on field feeding assays to test efficacy of borate-treated softwoods against termites and to define "adequate" protection thresholds. Laboratory and field data reported in the literature were confusing with regard to what constitutes "adequate" protection thresholds. The confusion was compounded by differences in termite species, timber species used and test methodology. Laboratory data indicated a borate loading of 0.5% m/m boric acid equivalent (BAE) would cause &gt; 90% termite mortality and restrict mass loss in test specimens to 5%. Field data generally suggested that borate loadings in excess of 0.5% m/m BAE were required. The main contribution of the work to increasing our understanding of management options for termites in the built environment was in resolving the confusion between laboratory and field data for borate wood-preservatives. These apparently conflicting results were explained by the presence or absence of untreated feeder material in the test environment. In the absence of untreated feeder material, retention of 0.5% BAE provides adequate protection from Coptotermes sp., whereas in the presence of untreated feeder material, increased retentions are required. Furthermore, the retentions required increase with increased amounts of susceptible material. Some termites, Nasutitermes sp. and M. darwiniensis, for example, are borate-tolerant and borate wood-preservatives are not a viable management option. The lack of uniform standards for termite-test methodology and assessment criteria for efficacy across the world is recognized as a difficulty with research into the performance of wood preservatives with termites. The many variables in laboratory and field assays make "prescriptive" standards difficult to recommend. The use of "performance" standards to define efficacy criteria ("adequate" protection) is discussed. Whilst the majority of the work involves subterranean termites ("termites"), I examine the question of how to define a hardwood timber species as "not susceptible" to lyctine beetle damage. Aspects of the biology, behaviour and management of Lyctus brunneus (Stephens) are reviewed and a novel field sampling and testing protocol to establish lyctine susceptibility of timber species is presented. A sound understanding of the biology and behaviour of xylophagous insects in the field is essential to ensure that management options implemented in the built environment have a strong ecological basis. The success of this study in achieving stated aims, the need for further work and the implications for test methodologies in the field with practical relevance to infestations of xylophagous insects in the built environment are discussed.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300603 Pests, Health and Diseases</field><field name="subject">620304 Harvesting and transport of forest products</field><field name="subject">Xylophagous insects</field><field name="subject">borers</field><field name="subject">Lyctus</field><field name="subject">termites</field><field name="subject">Coptotermes</field><field name="subject">Mastotermes</field><field name="subject">Schedorhinotermes</field><field name="subject">field-based feeding assays</field><field name="subject">preventative action</field><field name="subject">remedial treatment</field><field name="subject">bait toxicant</field><field name="subject">attraction</field><field name="subject">susceptibility</field><field name="subject">borate wood-preservatives</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157981</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Complexity approach to national IT policy making: The case of Malaysia's Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC)</field><field name="creator">Abdul Wahab, Amirudin</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT This dissertation examines the design and implementation of Malaysia's national Information Technology (IT) policy with a focus on the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) project. Qualitative research methods, including in-depth interviews, document analysis and literature analysis, were used to build an understanding of the development of the MSC. The analysis adopts a holistic approach that draws upon the multidisciplinary perspectives of complex adaptive systems in order to understand how social, economic, political and institutional forces interact in a changing environment. This research contributes a policy framework called Goal-Policy-Implementation-Outcome (GPIO), which is used to understand, describe and assess the MSC policy design and methods. It is one of the first public studies of the MSC and one of very few complex systems analyses of a socio-economic system in a developing country. It has been argued that many countries around the world are competing rapidly to produce 'visionary' reports and policy statements on the future of their nations and societies in the 'Information Age'. This is due to the belief that IT can play critical role in stimulating the socio-economic growth of the countries. In Malaysia, the government embarked on an ambitious program to establish the MSC as an attempt to achieve Vision 2020, a national vision and Malaysia's statement of national goals that articulates the country's objective for developed-nation status, while moving towards the creation of an information-rich society by the year 2020. Despite the importance of national IT policies and the major commitment of resources to implement them, there are few critical studies of the positive and negative impacts of 'post-industrial' or 'information society' policy, particularly in the developing countries like Malaysia. This study seeks in part to fill this gap by providing a critical assessment of a Malaysian national IT policy. This research argues that IT policy for national development must be viewed holistically, taking into consideration innovations needed in the social, economic, political and institutional spheres, rather than taking limited view of IT as an economic growth engine. This is a paradigm shift that represents a movement from the traditional worldview (TWV), that was based on the Cartesian/Newtonian paradigm into new ways of thinking and action that is labelled here as the emerging worldview (EMV). The EMV is grounded in complexity theory, an interdisciplinary endeavour that draws upon ideas from a number of fields and seeks to understand and model systems with many interacting parts. This approach can help policy makers and analysts to understand, assess and develop a more balanced and comprehensive policy for the evolution of new technology such as IT and to tackle the complexity of socio-economic change of a dynamic real world setting. The data collection method is from in-depth, open-ended interviews and document analysis. This qualitative exploratory approach was chosen to understand and capture the points of view of other people without specifically limiting the lines of inquiry through questionnaires etc. This research was influenced by multiple theoretical frameworks, because taking one framework alone in analysing the complex issues involved in ICT would not provide a comprehensive understanding of the interplay of the socio-technical and techno-economic paradigms. This resulted in the contribution of a policy framework called Goal-Policy-Implementation-Outcome (GPIO), which is used to understand, describe and assess the MSC policy design and method. This research found that the MSC policy plan and process were not working as intended to achieve the goals of Vision 2020. The strategy of clustering businesses in one physical location to establish synergy did not work as anticipated because: (1) Cyberjaya was not yet fully ready with all the necessary people, infrastructure and community since many basic amenities have yet to be competed; (2) The distance of Cyberjaya to key cities were perceived to be too far; (3) Operational costs in Cyberjaya were perceived as high; (4) The Cyberjaya ecosystem lacks attractive incentives; and (5) Most of the current and potential MSC firms, customers and suppliers were already located outside Cyberjaya with existing networks of people and facilities in other locations. (6) The current environment of the MSC was also found not to be conducive to facilitating a self-organizing system due to the lack of a wide consultative and participatory process. Consequently, drastic changes to the organizational structure and behaviour are needed before success can happen. It was found that the key challenges and barriers to the transformation process in and through the MSC lie in the nature of the existing mindset, the operational practice, culture and power structural arrangements within and among the policy, people and institutions of the MSC. Discussion on the MSC tends to be centred on the technological and commercial without recognizing that technological change relies on concomitant social and political shifts. By succumbing to technology driven views and 'information society' rhetoric, policy makers are allowing real economic and social choices to be smothered. This dissertation argues that instead of presenting technology as something which is external to the society, with a dynamics of its own, and to which society must learn to adapt, effective debate about new technology must acknowledge the related political choices, power relationships and value judgments about the shape and direction of the society using the technology. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop policies to ensure that the economic benefits and social engineering associated with Malaysia&#146;s knowledge economy are managed through participatory and partnership methods at all levels of the country. This research has shown that complex systems analysis can lay the groundwork for a new approach that more accurately represents societal choices and outcomes than past approaches. Few researchers have undertaken complex systems analyses of social systems, with still fewer examining the context of a national public IT policy in a developing country like Malaysia. Further, there are very few thorough public studies done of the MSC itself, with most studies on the MSC either being done in confidence and/or being conducted by foreign consultants appointed by the government or by the Multimedia Development Corporation (MDC). As such, public accessibility to critical studies on the MSC or public documents on them is rarely available. This research, if not the first, is one of the first attempts made to provide a thorough constructive critical study on the MSC policy project since its official launch in 1996. It is also, if not the first, one of the first attempts made to apply the emerging paradigm or the new science of complexity in a real world national policy case study, specifically the MSC policy project. Moreover, there is a huge lacking of research done on behalf of 'marginalized communities'. This research is not carried out on behalf of private enterprise or national governments but rather it is done on behalf of its citizens.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">360203 Research, Science and Technology Policy</field><field name="subject">729901 Technological and organisational innovation</field><field name="subject">Multimedia Super Corridor</field><field name="subject">MSC</field><field name="subject">Malaysia</field><field name="subject">Complexity</field><field name="subject">IT Policy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157967</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Expression of hnRNPs A/B in cancer cells and their roles in carcinogenesis</field><field name="creator">He, Yaowu</field><field name="description">The identification of specific and reproducible biomarkers is critical for the early diagnosis of cancer, which has a profound effect the survival rate of patients. Comprehensive laboratory and clinical evidence needs to be collected to confirm the accuracy of the biomarkers prior to their clinical use. Heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) A2 and B1 have been suggested as biomarkers for cancer since 1988 when hnRNP A2/B1 overexpression was first linked with the occurrence of lung cancer. Later studies established a correlation between the expression levels of these hnRNPs and other cancers, such as breast, pancreatic, and lymphatic tumours. In this study, the expression of hnRNPs A1, A2, A3, and B1 has been investigated in various cancer cell lines. hnRNPs A1 and A3, in addition to A2 and B1, were found to be overexpressed in some cancer types. However, the overexpression of none of the hnRNP A/B proteins was universal, and their upregulation may be limited to a few cell types, suggesting they may be effective biomarkers for a subset of cancers. The upregulation of hnRNP A/B proteins in tumours and cancer cell lines led to the hypothesis that they are involved in the uncontrolled cell growth in cancer. According to our Western blot analysis, expression of the hnRNP proteins, A1, A2, and B1, is dependent on the cell cycle whereas no significant change was detected for hnRNP A3, implying that the former three are needed during certain cell cycle stages. The results, together with the transcription factor analysis of the promoter regions of the HNRPA1, HNRPA2, and HNRPA3 genes, suggest that hnRNPs A1, A2, and A3 may have distinct regulatory machineries and cellular functions although they have high amino acid sequence identity. However, their mRNA levels were unchanged across the cell cycle, suggesting the cell-cycle-dependent expression of hnRNPs A1, A2, and B1 is modulated at the translational level. Previous studies showed higher expression of hnRNPs A1 and A2 in rapidly proliferating cells than in quiescent cells, suggesting a role of these proteins in cell proliferation. Though interruption of hnRNP A1 expression did not result in significant change in the viability of murine CB3 cells, simultaneous suppression of hnRNPs A1 and A2 caused apoptosis in a few cell lines. Consistent with this, suppression of hnRNP A1 or A3 expression in our study in Colo16 squamous cells using RNA interference did not affect cell proliferation, but simultaneous suppression of both caused slow cell proliferation. By contrast, reduction of the hnRNP A2 level alone slowed the proliferation of Colo16 cells. These results suggest that although hnRNPs A1, A2, and A3 share some roles in cell proliferation, each of them may have distinct tasks. This conclusion is supported by the data from the comparative analysis of the downstream targets of hnRNPs A1, A2, and A3, which has shown that these three proteins share a limited number of common downstream proteins. The observed impact on cell proliferation of suppressing hnRNP A2 subfamily proteins is in accord with our finding that the downstream targets of hnRNP A2 are overrepresented by genes involved in proliferation regulation, as shown in microarray and real-time PCR analysis. These include cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors, p21 and p27, and their regulatory proteins, such as Skp2 and Rpn10. Skp2 controls the ubiquitination of p21 and p27, and Rpn10 links them to the 26S proteasome, the complex that degrades these two CDK inhibitors. hnRNP A2 also regulates the transcription of securin and separin, which are essential for sister chromatid separation during late anaphase. In addition, hnRNP A2 can also influence cell proliferation through cell growth factors, including fibroblast, vascular endothelial, transforming, and insulin growth factors. Our gene array and real-time PCR analysis have shown that hnRNP A2 regulates the expression of these factors, their receptors, or associated proteins such as IGFBP7 and TGFBR2. The data presented in this thesis link the overexpression of hnRNP A/B proteins, in particular the A2/B1 subfamily, in cancer with their regulatory roles in cell division and cell proliferation. Our findings provide mechanistic evidence that these proteins may be a driving force for the uncontrolled cell growth in cancer, suggesting that some of hnRNP A/B proteins may be potential therapeutic targets for cancer. However, further studies are needed to obtain a global view of the roles of these proteins in cancer.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270201 Gene Expression</field><field name="subject">780105 Biological sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158357</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Formal concept analysis applications to requirements engineering and design</field><field name="creator">Tilley, Thomas Alan</field><field name="description">Currently, the bulk of applications of Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) in software engineering have focussed on software maintenance and re-engineering. In this thesis we broaden the approach by applying FCA to a number of early-phase activities within the software engineering life-cycle. With respect to the requirements engineering phase, a case study is presented comparing two class hierarchies that model aspects of a mass-transit railway ticketing system. The first hierarchy was produced for an existing Object-Z specification of the system while the second was derived using FCA. Contrasting the two hierarchies revealed that they were essentially the same, however, the differences highlighted specification artefacts in the existing hierarchy. With respect to the design phase, the thesis discusses the use of FCA for the navigation and visualisation of Formal Specifications written in Z. In response to the continued call for formal methods tool support, we implement and explore a prototype specification browser that exploits the abstractions afforded by FCA. The research hypothesis is an integrated architecture for navigating formal specifications using FCA. This architecture is realised using ZML and ToscanaJ to produce a practical research tool. The thesis also includes the first broad survey of FCA in the domain of software engineering and an FCA-based methodology for surveying academic literature in general.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">280111 Conceptual Modelling</field><field name="subject">700199 Computer software and services not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">formal concept analysis</field><field name="subject">requirements analysis</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">software engineering</field><field name="subject">formal specification</field><field name="subject">Z</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157991</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Selective transport of attached particles across the froth phase</field><field name="creator">Seaman, David Richard</field><field name="description">Over many years, researchers in the field of flotation have developed an in-depth understanding of processes occurring in the pulp phase of flotation machines. Until recently, however, the froth phase has received little attention. The froth phase serves to separate bubble-particle aggregates from suspended slurry in a flotation cell. The mechanism of recovery by entrainment, its relationship to water recovery and particle size dependency is well understood. Froth recovery, (the fraction of particles entering the concentrate launder that entered the froth phase attached to air bubbles), is not well understood. Up until now, there has been doubt over whether this property is dependent on particle size and hydrophobicity. Difficulties in measuring froth recovery had previously prevented researchers from gaining a deeper understanding of the transport of attached particles across the froth phase. A novel device was designed and tested to measure froth recovery by isolating bubble-particle aggregates in the pulp-phase of flotation machines through the determination of the bubble loading in the pulp phase (mass of particles attached per unit volume of air bubbles). This technique can be used with other measurements to investigate froth selectivity by directly comparing these captured particles to those found in the froth phase. Evidence was collected at Red Dog Mine, Alaska and Newmont Golden Grove Operations, Western Australia which showed that the froth phase selectively transported more hydrophobic and smaller sized particles across the froth than less hydrophobic and larger particles. Particles collected in the device were compared to those found in the concentrate stream on a size by mineral by liberation class. Froth recovery was also calculated on a size by mineral by liberation class for two valuable sulphide minerals in a continuous 3m&#179; flotation cell. These results show that the froth phase is responsible for the upgrading of attached particles across the froth phase as well as for the separation of bubble-particle aggregates from suspended slurry. The pulp phase is responsible for creating bubble-particle aggregates through the attachment of hdyrophobic mineral particles to air bubbles. Many complex factors affect the extent to which this occurs including the size and hdyrophobicity of the particles, the size and number of air bubbles produced by the flotation machine, the rate of collisions between particles and bubbles and the overall chemistry of the system. This measurement of bubble loading presents an opportunity to measure the impact of all these factors on the successful creation of bubble-particle aggregates. Based on a literature review suggesting that there was a high probability of particles being detached at the pulp-froth interface due to the aggregates change in momentum, a three phase description of a flotation cell was proposed. The three phases were: pulp, pulp-froth interface and upper froth zones. A second froth recovery measurement technique (changing froth depth) was used in combination with the bubble load technique to determine the recovery across each of the two froth zones. It was found that the pulp-froth interface appears to be responsible for the selectivity observed across the froth phase as a whole. These findings will enable more in-depth research into the sub-process of the froth phase as well as assisting flotation cell design through a better understanding of the roles of the pulp-froth interface and the upper froth region.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">290702 Mineral Processing</field><field name="subject">640300 First Stage Treatment of Ores and Minerals</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158293</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An exploration of the performer-composer dynamic</field><field name="creator">Morgan, Christy J.</field><field name="description">The purpose of this critical commentary is to explore the concept of the composerperformer relationship.

PHA production by pure culture has been extensively studied, enabling high production yields and a variety of polymer characteristics. Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate (3HB)-co-3-hydroxyvalerate (3HV) (PHBV) has been commercially available under the trade name Biopol. However, the high production costs of these biopolymers are a major barrier for their widespread acceptance as substitute for traditional non-biodegradable polymers. The main costs are associated with maintaining the sterile conditions required by pure cultures, the use of expensive feed materials (eg. sugars) and also the polymer extraction process. Producing PHAs using mixed cultures (such as activated sludge) can drastically simplify the production process and significantly reduce the feed costs due to the use of cheap substrates. It also has the additional benefits in reusing waste materials. To date, substantial efforts have been put into improving PHA productivity in mixed cultures, with the characteristics of these bio-polyesters largely unexplored. The main product is typically PHB, which has several inherent deficiencies in properties. These include brittleness due to its high crystallinity, and thermal instability near its melting point of 175-180&amp;degC. To overcome the drawbacks of PHB, non-3HB monomer units are incorporated in the bio-polymerisation process, but this generally requires the addition of specific and often complex precursor substrates. Glycogen accumulating organisms (GAOs) are emerging as an attractive alternative to other heterotrophic PHA producers due to their special metabolism. GAOs were initially identified as competitors to the polyphosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs) in alternating anaerobic/aerobic wastewater treatment systems. Under anaerobic conditions, GAOs generate energy and reducing power from glycogen hydrolysis, which are used for taking up carbon sources (eg. acetate or propionate) and their synthesis into PHAs as intracellular storage products. Under aerobic conditions, the stored PHAs is partly oxidised for energy generation with the remainder used for biomass growth and glycogen replenishment. The anaerobic hydrolysis of glycogen yields both acetyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA which can be condensed to form 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA and 3-hydroxyvaleryl-CoA, the precursors of 3HB and 3HV. Therefore GAOs are capable of producing multiple 3- hydroxyalkanoate (3HA) monomers even when only a single carbon source (eg., acetate) is supplied. The potential of producing copolymers without addition of particular monomer-relevant carbon sources provides GAOs an advantage over other mixed culture heterotrophs in terms of polymer quality. So far, two main bacterial species have been identified to display the GAO phenotype, namely, Candidatus Competibacter phosphatis (henceforth referred to as Competibacter) and Defluviicoccus vanus-related GAOs belonging to the Alphaproteobacteria phylum (henceforth referred to as DvGAOs). This thesis focuses on the PHA production by GAOs. The capability of GAOs to produce heterogeneous PHAs from a single carbon source is investigated by characterising the PHA products and optimising the polymer productivity. Moreover, DvGAOs are comprehensively studied for their ability to yield novel four-monomer copolymers of 3HB, 3HV, 3-hydroxy-2-methylvalerate (3HMV) and 3-hydroxy-3- methylbutyrate (3HMB) with controllable composition and favourable physical properties. The main contributions from this thesis are summarised below. The polymers consisting of 3HB, 3HV and minor amounts of 3HMV and 3HMB, produced by Competibacter-dominated GAOs using acetate as a sole carbon source, were identified to be true copolymers based on a detailed characterisation using &amp;sup1H and &#185;&amp;sup3C Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The monomer sequence distribution analysis using a known polymer characterisation model suggests that these polyesters are mixtures of random copolymers and thus likely possess desirable properties for practical use, which was confirmed experimentally. This demonstrates that GAOs have a true potential for producing high-quality polymers from a simple and cheap carbon source. The PHAs produced by GAOs under anaerobic and aerobic conditions were characterized using size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The acetate-derived copolymers possessed characteristics similar to those of commercially available PHBV products. The anaerobically produced PHA contained a relatively constant proportion of non-3HB monomers (30&#177;5 C-mol%), irrespective of the amount of acetate assimilated. In contrast, under aerobic conditions, GAOs only produced 3HB monomers from acetate causing a gradually decreasing 3HV fraction. The 3HV fraction thus obtained ranged from 7 to 35 C-mol%, depending on the amount of acetate supplied under aerobic conditions. The PHAs produced under solely anaerobic conditions featured lower melting points and crystallinity, higher molecular weights, and narrower molecular weight distributions compared to the aerobically produced polymers. However, the anaerobic production yield was limited at 28% of dry cell weight (DCW) due to the shortage of glycogen, while aerobic production obtained a maximum polymer content of 41% based on DCW. To increase the PHA yield from anaerobic production, a novel three-stage strategy was developed. It was demonstrated to be an effective approach to optimise both the quantity and quality of the copolymers produced by GAOs. Using the Competibacterdominated GAO culture, up to 48 wt% poly(3HB-co-3HV-co-3HMV) based on DCW was achieved from acetate as the sole carbon source, close to the highest copolymer yield reported to date produced by mixed cultures but using specific precursor substrates. The optimisation method comprised of an aerobic famine, an aerobic feast, and an anaerobic feast period. The glycogen storage was enhanced through the initial two aerobic periods and hence increased the energy and reducing power available for the final anaerobic polymer synthesis step. The terpolymers/copolymers thus produced displayed high molecular weights (380-460 kg/mol) with a narrow distribution range. A feeding strategy based on pH-stat was demonstrated to achieve the automatic control of feed addition. Using a highly enriched DvGAO mixed culture (95&#177;3%) copolymers of 3HB, 3HV, 3HMV and 3HMB with controllable monomer fractions were obtained from acetate and propionate substrates. Through manipulating the ratio of acetate and propionate in the medium, the 3HB and 3HMV monomer portions could be varied extensively (10 to 66 mol% 3HB and 2 to 41 mol% 3HMV). The microstructure study revealed that the PHAs produced were likely random copolymers or mixtures of random copolymers. These PHA products were demonstrated to possess favourable properties. The weight-average molecular weights were in the range 390-560 kg/mol, while the DSC traces showed melting temperatures in the range of 70 to 161 &amp;degC, glass transition temperatures between -8 and 0 &amp;degC, and melting enthalpies (&#916;Hm) between 9.1 and 31.5 J/g. The incorporation of considerable amounts of 3HMV and 3HMB constituents greatly lowered the crystallinity, potentially providing the ductile and tough materials required for many practical applications. The anaerobic metabolism of DvGAOs with acetate and propionate was found to be well described by the metabolic models previously proposed for GAOs and verified with experimental data obtained with other types of GAO cultures. The results suggested DvGAOs likely use metabolic pathways similar to those used by other GAOs for anaerobic acetate and propionate uptake. However, when both acetate and propionate were present simultaneously, DvGAOs took up these two carbon sources sequentially, with propionate uptake preceding acetate uptake. As a result, mixtures of 3HV&amp;3HMV-rich copolymers and 3HB&amp;3HV-rich copolymers were formed. Through model-based analysis, it was hypothesised that DvGAOs prefer propionate in order to maximise their production of PHAs with the same glycogen consumption, which would enhance their growth potential in the following aerobic period. This feature may explain the more efficient PHA production by DvGAOs with propionate as the carbon substrate compared to acetate. Despite very low acetate consumption when propionate was available in excess, the presence of acetate considerably stimulated the uptake of propionate in comparison to the case where only propionate was present. This was likely due to the difference of the intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) level in the two cases. A lower intracellular ATP level detected in the simultaneous presence of acetate and propionate might stimulate the glycolysis process resulting in a higher propionate uptake rate. This thesis shows that GAOs have indeed a good potential as cost-effective PHA producers. They are able to efficiently generate true copolymers of up to four 3HA monomers with desirable properties from simple carbon sources. Through manipulating the feed composition, comonomer fractions can vary in a wide range resulting in a variety of polymer properties. The contribution from this work could be very useful for the current drive to cost-effectively produce good quality PHAs to replace conventional petrol-derived polymers.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">279900 Other Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">779999 Other</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158279</field></doc><doc><field name="title">World War II Nominal Roll database: accurate record or true record?</field><field name="creator">William A. Park</field><field name="description">The Australian Government Internet database, the World War Two Nominal Roll, is problematised and then analysed as a document of patron-sponsored alternative journalism as described by Atton and Hamilton, because it attempts to fulfill functions previously completed in Australia by newspaper publishers and television producers. These functions &#8211; of discovering, establishing, editing, contextualizing, recording and publishing memory &#8211; have long been regarded as roles of journalism. Later they have been seen as roles also of literary publishing and documentary filmmaking, and most recently of online records management. They became especially evident in the 1990s, the decade of the 50th anniversary of many World War II events, during which many anniversary supplements were published in Australian newspapers and in television documentaries. Partly as a result of this major anniversary, the Australian Government undertook the tasks of discovering, establishing, editing, recording, contextualizing, and publishing World War II military memories as an online database known as the World War Two Nominal Roll. The enactment of this large task required the engagement of a subcontractor who tendered on the basis of skills in records management, and the adoption of a methodology which offered some level of quality assurance of the outputs. The problematisation of this project suggests that the engagement of the subcontractor and the methodology adopted for the World War Two Nominal Roll are analogous to the engagement of professionalized journalists, and the adoption of recognised journalistic methods, for the publication of a media artifact such as an anniversary supplement. In that light, this thesis compares the error rates evident in the Nominal Roll with the literature of error rates in contemporary newspapers, and compares some of the audience effects of publishing the Nominal Roll with those of publishing newspapers. This involves a comprehensive examination and critique of the physical nature of the Roll and the processes of its production. The analysis in the first place suggests that the database Roll is overall more trustworthy than established journalism artifacts but in detail more susceptible to errors of fact and context and less likely to be corrected. This leads to the second assessment that the publication of the database Roll is less effective than newspapers as a means of memorialisation. Finally, the findings suggest that the processes deployed in the compilation of the database Roll would have benefitted from the adoption of aspects of ordinary journalistic routines not used by the database publishers. Reasons for this are proposed and discussed.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">400000 Journalism, Librarianship and Curatorial Studies</field><field name="subject">Records</field><field name="subject">Alternative journalism</field><field name="subject">Journalism</field><field name="subject">Newspapers</field><field name="subject">Accuracy</field><field name="subject">World War 2 Nominal Roll Database</field><field name="subject">Veterans</field><field name="subject">Commemoration</field><field name="subject">Retention</field><field name="subject">Military recruitment</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178508</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New Insights into Diffusion-Controlled Bimolecular Termination using &#8216;Controlled/Living&#8217; Radical Polymerisation</field><field name="creator">Geoffrey Johnston-hall</field><field name="description">Free-radical polymerisation (FRP) has been one of the most important techniques for producing materials used in a very wide variety of applications and has enhanced the lives of millions of people around the world. However, for many years a number of fundamental questions regarding the key kinetic processes involved in FRP have remained unresolved. In particular, an accurate description of the mechanism for diffusion-controlled bimolecular termination has proven elusive. As a result, conventional modelling tools for FRP have often proven unreliable. The aim of this thesis, therefore, was to accurately study the evolution of the bimolecular termination rate coefficient during free radical polymerisation using a new and more accurate methodology based on &#8216;controlled/living&#8217; reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerisation. This was undertaken in order to develop a more precise understanding of bimolecular termination and thereby develop a more reliable modeling approach capable of predicting the rates of reaction and evolution of molecular weight distributions for a wide range of experimental conditions and a wide range of functional monomers. The RAFT-CLD-T (RAFT Chain-Length-Dependent Termination) Method was used to determine accurate values for the conversion and chain-length-dependent termination rate coefficient, kti,i(x), as a function of various parameters. These parameters included the chain size, i, polymer concentration (or conversion, x), chain length size distribution and chain architecture/structure. The accuracy of the RAFT-CLD-T Method was crucial to this work, therefore, an important part of this thesis was devoted to evaluating the reliability of this technique. Below 5 % conversion and above 80 % conversion the method was found to be unreliable due to the effects of chain-length-dependent propagation, high PDI&#8217;s and short-long termination. However, between 5 % and 80 % conversion it was found that the method is extremely robust and a series of easy-to-use experimental guidelines were determined for accurately applying the RAFT-CLD-T Method. The effects of chain size, chain size distribution, solution polymer concentration, and matrix architecture were examined for the RAFT-mediated polymerisations of methyl methacrylate (MMA), styrene (STY) and methyl acrylate (MA). It was found that four distinct scaling regimes of termination are observed: (1) a &#8216;short&#8217; chain dilute solution regime, (2) a &#8216;long&#8217; chain dilute solution regime, (3) a semi-dilute solution regime and (4) a concentrated solution regime. In dilute polymer solutions, chain-length-dependent power law exponents, &#61537;&#8217;s, determined during the polymerisation of MMA, STY and MA (where kti,i(x) &#61621; i-&#61537;) indicated that termination follows two major scaling regimes with exponents of approximately ~0.5 to 0.6 for &#8216;short&#8217; chains and and ~0.12 to 0.16 for &#8216;long&#8217; chains. Importantly, these exponents are in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions for translational and segmental diffusion-controlled termination, respectively. At increasing polymer concentrations, kti,i(x) falls rapidly coinciding with the onset of the gel effect. By comparing results from the RAFT-mediated polymerisations of MMA, STY, MA, and vinyl acetate (VAc) with theoretical models, we found that the onset of the gel effect coincided closely with the theoretical onset of chain overlap. Considerable uncertainty has plagued the evaluation of this phenomenon, but using a difunctional RAFT agent we showed this uncertainty arises from the influence of broad MWD&#8217;s on chain overlap and short-long termination. Finally, critical tests of this theory involving the bimolecular termination of linear radicals in solutions of star polymer confirmed that the gel effect coincided with chain overlap. Beyond the gel effect termination slows enormously, passing through the &#8216;semi-dilute solution&#8217; regime and into the &#8216;concentrated solution&#8217;. In semi-dilute solution, theoretical predictions based on scaling theory (i.e. the &#8216;blob&#8217; model) were in excellent agreement with results for the polymerisation of PSTY in linear and star polymer solutions, indicating that the solvent quality diminished both with increasing chain length and through the addition of a star polymer matrix. In concentrated solutions, the chain-length-dependent power law exponent increased linearly with conversion. For example, for MMA the chain length dependence of kt in the gel regime scaled as &#61537;gel = 1.8x + 0.056, suggesting that reptation alone does not describe termination in the concentrated solution. Values of &#61537;gel for PSTY, MA, and VAc were in similar agreement, indicating that a mechanism intermediate between unentangled and entangled semi-dilute scaling laws applies in the concentrated solution regime. Interestingly, &#61537;gel values for these monomers were found to decrease with increasing chain flexibility in the order &#61537;gel(MMA)&gt; &#61537;gel(STY)&gt; &#61537;gel(VAc)&gt; &#61537;gel(MA), suggesting matrix mobility is rate determining in concentrated solutions. Similarly, &#61537;gel values were also larger in star polymer solutions, coinciding with decreasing matrix mobility. Thus, although it has been commonly believed that polymer chains diffuse via reptation above the gel effect, these results show that this only occurs for solutions containing rigid and/or highly immobile macromolecules and in very high concentrations. To describe these behaviours, a semi-empirical &#8216;composite kt model&#8217; was also developed to describe kti,i(x) as a function of i and x up to high conversions. We showed that the model is very simple to implement and accurate for modelling a wide range of functional monomers and experimental conditions. In particular, we showed the method was accurate for modelling RAFT-mediated polymerisations of a very wide range of monomers (MA, MMA, and PSTY) and was even accurate for modelling conventional FRP&#8217;s. Thus, the model provides a simple, flexible and accurate method for predicting the rate of reaction and evolution of molecular weight distributions across a range of experimental conditions based on accurate kti,i(x) values.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Radical Reactions</field><field name="subject">Kinetics</field><field name="subject">Diffusion</field><field name="subject">Bimolecular Termination</field><field name="subject">Reversible Addition-Fragmentation Chain Transfer</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:183739</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Response of Helicoverpa armigera to agricultural environments diversified through companion planting.</field><field name="creator">Renee Herde</field><field name="description">This study investigated the potential of companion planting as a strategy to aid in the management of Helicoverpa armigera in tomato and capsicum cropping systems. The investigaitons showed that a companion planting type system is unlikely to confer any benefits to the management of H. armigera in these crops. The project has contributed to the understanding of H. armigera host selection and how the pest responds to a diversified environment. Companion planting and vegetational diversity are strategies for reducing pest incidence on crops. Many theories have been devised to explain how introducing more than one plant species to a cropping space may reduce the incidence of a pest. Five ecological theories formed the basis of experiments in this study: The resource concentration hypothesis - Herbivores are more likely to find and remain on hosts that are growing in dense or nearly pure stands (Root, 1973). Associational resistance/Plant apparency - Crop plants grown as monocultures are more apparent to herbivorous insects than plants in diverse natural systems (Tahvanainen and Root, 1972). Trap cropping &#8211; the use of plants within a cropping area to attract oviposition away from the main crop (Banks and Ekbom, 1999). The ability of H. armigera to learn in regard to host seleciton (Cunningham et al., 1998a). The natural enemies hypothesis - generalist and specialist natural enemies are expected to be more abundant in diverse rather than simple systems (Root, 1973) A tall variety of sorghum (the forage variety Chopper) was tested for its ability to disrupt host location. Sorghum was planted around plots of tomatoes to act as a screen to disrupt visual cues for host location by Helicoverpa spp. No difference was found in egg numbers on tomatoes with or without sorghum companions. However, significantly higher numbers of Helicoverpa spp. larvae were found in the sorghum at flowering than in the tomatoes. This suggested the sorghum was acting as a trap crop, diverting oviposition away from the tomato crop. However, due to a short period of flowering and therefore peak attractiveness to H. armigera, sorghum was not considered to be a suitable companion plant for inclusion in commercial tomato production systems. A host preference study was conducted to determine the preferences of H. armigera for crop plants and possible companions in the hope of finding a suitable trap crop species. Tomatoes were shown to be a highly preferred plant making it difficult to find a compatible trap crop species that would be more attractive than the main crop. However, capsicums were less prefered and therefore more suitable for this type of experimentation. Marigolds were also found to be a highly preferred plant and formed the basis for further investigations into trap cropping systems. Field experiments were conducted in successive years in two geographical locations to assess the suitability of marigolds as a trap crop for capsicums in a field situation. However, in both years H. armigera incidence was extremely and unusually low leading to inconclusive results. A glasshouse experiment was performed to assess if the ratio of capsicum plants to marigolds plants had an effect on which species H. armigera would choose for oviposition. It was found that as more capsicum plants were introduced, moths became less likely to oviposit on the supposedly more preferred marigold plant. The diminishing attractiveness of a more preferred host in the presence of other hosts is a new observation of H. armigera behaviour. This result suggests that marigolds would be unlikely to be a successful trap crop in a field situation. The ability of H. armigera to learn in regard to host selection and the influence of this on host selection in the field was investigated. No evidence of learning was found. This was the first study investigating the effect of learning in a field situation; previously the behaviour had only been investigated in a laboratory situation (Cunningham, et al. 1998a). The ability of the Australian assassin bug, Pristhesancus plagipennis (Walker) (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) to predate H. armigera larvae on capsicum plants was investigated. This predator has been sucessfully been used for H. armigera management in cotton (Grundy, 2000b), but had not been investigated in horticultural crops. Significant reductions in larvae were achieved in treatments where assassin bugs were introduced. This predator warrants further investigation for inclusion in commercial integrated pest managment programs for capsicums. Pest repellent plants were also considered. Previous to this study, very little research work had been conducted on repellent plants for H. armigera. The herbs investigated were catnip (Nepta cataria), tansy (Tanacetum vulgare), basil (Ocium basilicum) and coriander (Coriander sativum). An olfactometer system was designed and built to test H. armigera moths&#8217; responses to odours from the herbs. Glasshouse experiments were also conducted. No repellent activity was recorded with any of the herbs tested. The results of this study support the theory that Helicoverpa spp. employ a strategy of passive host selection as suggested by Firempong (1986). This means that all available plants in an area may be oviposited on with successful ovipostion and larval development leading to the future utilisation of a species as a host plant. The implication of this finding is that in-field trap cropping is unlikely to be a successful strategy for reducing H. armigera oviposition in tomato or capsicum production systems in Australia. In cotton crops in Australia, trap cropping is used as part of an area wide management strategy and aims to reduce the total Helicoverpa spp. population of a region. Such a strategy may also be successful in horticultural crops but only with the full participation of the growers of all crops that are attractive to H. armigera in a horticultural growing region. Due to the diverse nature of horticultural production this may be a difficult task.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences</field><field name="subject">Helicoverpa armigera, companion planting, trap cropping, learning, marigold, host selection, repellent plants, Pristhesancus plagipennis</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:183732</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Communist Party and trade union work in Queensland in the third period: 1928-1935</field><field name="creator">Penrose, Beris Gene</field><field name="description" /><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1606 Political Science</field><field name="subject">Communist Party of Australia -- History</field><field name="subject">Labor unions and communism -- Queensland -- History.</field><field name="subject">Depressions -- 1929 -- Queensland</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185197</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental factors affecting teaching and learning in North Queensland, 1875-1905</field><field name="creator">De Jabrun, Mary</field><field name="description" /><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">13 Education</field><field name="subject">330102 History and Philosophy of Education</field><field name="subject">Public schools -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Education -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Queensland -- Social conditions -- 1788-1900</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:186226</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A new method for computing anharmonic rovibrational densities of states of interstellar and atmospheric clusters at arbitrary angular momenta</field><field name="creator">Sarah Windsor</field><field name="description">A new methodology is developed to calculate density of states of interstellar and atmospheric clusters that takes account of their loosely bound nature and incorporates kinetically important angular momentum constraints explicitly. The method is based on classical phase space integration for the intermonomer modes of the cluster with imposition of the constraints of selected total energy and total angular momentum. It achieves considerable efficiency via essentially analytic evaluation of the momentum space integrals coupled with efficient Monte Carlo sampling of configurations. The derivation for the equation for the density of states is outlined and all steps in the simplification of the accessible momentum space volume are detailed. The method is tested rigorously against an entirely analytic result obtained for the ideal case of a dimer with spherical top fragments and no interaction potential. Interstellar applications of the new approach are presented for (HCN)2 and (CO)2. The new intermononmer density of states has been integrated over metastable states to obtain the intermonomer partition function, which in turn is used to calculate the metastable equilibrium constants for interstellar clusters, which in turn is used tocalculate the second order rate constant of overall dimer formation in the interstellar environment. Atmospheric applications of the new approach are presented for (H2O)2. The new intermonomer density of states is convoluted with the intramonomer density of states to obtain the convoluted density of states. This convoluted density of states is then integrated over total energy and angular momentum to obtain the anharmonic partition function, which in turn is used to calculate the equilibrium constant for atmospheric clusters, which in turn is used to calculate the third order rate constant for overall dimer formation in the atmospheric environment. Kinetic quantities are also calculated with the intermonomer and convoluted density of states for interstellar and atmospheric clusters, respectively. These densities of states are combined with RRKM theory to compute unimolecular dissociation rate constants, which are then averaged with respect to the thermal capture flux distribution to compute average lifetimes as a function of temperature.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">interstellar, atmospheric, classical, density of states, metastable, partition function,</field><field name="subject">equilibrium constant, rate constant, lifetime</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:195299</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation and recombinant expression of antigens for the rapid diagnosis of West Nile virus infection</field><field name="creator">Jody Hobson-Peters</field><field name="description">West Nile Virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne pathogen of global significance. It is active on several continents and is responsible for recent outbreaks of fever and fatal encephalitis in humans and horses. While highly virulent strains have been reported in Europe, North, Central and South America, only a benign subtype of WNV (Kunjin virus &#8211; KUNV) occurs in Australia. However, virulent, exotic WNV strains are seen as a significant threat to Australia due to the ease with which this virus can move between continents and the presence of suitable vectors and hosts already within Australia. KUNV and WNV subtypes are antigenically and genetically very closely related and cross-react in traditional serological tests. This cross-reactivity makes it very difficult to differentiate between KUNV and WNV infections using standard serological tests. The aim of this thesis was to identify immunogenic epitopes unique to KUNV or WNV and to use these epitopes in the development of a rapid assay that would enable the diagnosis of and surveillance for exotic virulent strains of WNV in Australia. The rapid diagnostic platform chosen was a red blood cell (RBC) agglutination assay that was originally patented and commercialised by AGEN Biomedical Ltd. The RBC agglutination assay reagent consists of the Fab region of a human erythrocyte-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) conjugated to the epitope of interest (in this instance, a WNV-specific peptide). This bi-functional reagent causes the agglutination of the patient&#8217;s erythrocytes in the presence of WNV-specific antibody in the patient&#8217;s serum. Traditionally, these RBC agglutination reagents have been produced by chemical conjugation. However, a potentially easier and cheaper method involves the linking of the gene encoding the erythrocyte-specific antibody to that encoding the epitope to create a recombinant version of the bi-functional agglutination reagent through expression using prokaryotic or eukaryotic systems. To identify potential differential epitopes, 18 mAbs to WNV (NY99 strain) prM and envelope (E) proteins were assessed. One mAb (17D7) differentially recognised WNV and KUNV in ELISA and maintained recognition of its corresponding epitope upon reduction and carboxymethylation of the viral antigen, suggesting a continuous (linear) epitope. Using synthetic peptides, the epitope was mapped to a 19 amino acid sequence (WN19: E147-165) encompassing the WNV NY99 E protein glycosylation site at position 154. An amino acid substitution at position E156 of many KUNV strains abolishes this glycosylation moiety. The inability of WNV-positive horse and mouse sera to bind the synthetic peptides indicated that glycosylation was required for recognition of peptide WN19 by WNV-specific antibodies in sera. N-linked glycosylation of WN19 was achieved through expression of the peptide as a C-terminal fusion protein in mammalian cells and specific reactivity of WNV-positive horse sera to the glycosylated WN19 fusion protein was shown by Western blot. Additional sera collected from horses that had been infected with Murray Valley encephalitis virus (MVEV), which is similarly glycosylated at position E154 and exhibits high sequence identity to WNV NY99 in this region, also recognised the recombinant peptide. In contrast, no reactivity with the recombinant peptide was observed by sera from horses infected with the unglycosylated WNV subtype, KUNV. Failure of most WNV- and MVEV-positive horse sera to recognise the epitope as a deglycosylated fusion protein (75% and 100% respectively) confirmed that the N-linked glycan is important for antibody recognition of the peptide. Together, these results suggest that the induction of antibodies to the WN19 epitope during WNV infection of horses is generally associated with E protein glycosylation of the infecting viral strain. To assess the feasibility of using peptide WN19 in a rapid immunoassay, the peptide was recombinantly fused to a RBC (glycophorin)-specific single chain antibody (scFv) using previously published constructs which were developed for the bacterial expression of similar bi-functional reagents. To facilitate glycosylation of peptide WN19, the genes for the bi-functional agglutination reagents were subsequently cloned into eukaryotic expression vectors. An additional set of constructs were also produced in which the genes for the variable regions of the anti-RBC antibody were cloned into a vector for the secreted expression of an intact, humanised IgG1 molecule. Stable cell lines were produced for each of these constructs and secreted up to 700 ng/mL glycophorin-reactive antibody. The secreted recombinant protein could be harvested directly from the cell culture medium and used in RBC agglutination assays, where these bi-functional agglutination reagents could be cross-linked either with mAb 17D7 or by anti-peptide WN19 antibodies present in WNV-positive horse serum. The WNV NY99 prM protein was also identified as a useful marker of WNV-infection in horses, as well as a putative antigen to differentiate equine WNV NY99 and KUNV infections using Western blot. Two anti-WNV prM mAbs were also generated in this study and will be extremely valuable in future studies. Preliminary analysis of the prM epitope(s) bound by these mAbs and WNV-immune sera indicate that the binding site(s) is likely to be localised to pr and is conformational.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">06 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">West Nile virus</field><field name="subject">Kunjin Virus</field><field name="subject">Flavivirus</field><field name="subject">Monoclonal Antibody</field><field name="subject">single chain antibody</field><field name="subject">red blood cell agglutination</field><field name="subject">Recombinant Antibody</field><field name="subject">Epitope mapping</field><field name="subject">prM</field><field name="subject">Envelope Protein</field><field name="subject">Diagnostic Assay</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:203818</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Folio of Compositions with Critical Commentary: An exploration of musical influences and composing techniques.

The compositions in the folio draw on the inspiration of a number of composers associated with the &#8220;Western Classical&#8221; tradition, as well as the influence of other musical styles and traditions such as Jazz. The commentary explores various aesthetic principles, musical influences and technical compositional approaches that stimulated the development towards an individual compositional output. A focus of the commentary is to draw attention to the unique synthesis of significant musical influences as evidenced in the folio, thereby elucidating a gradual development towards the attainment of a personal compositional style during candidature. The folio consists of an eclectic collection of works, including many vocal works, chamber works and orchestral pieces. A seminal chamber work in the folio, Le Tombeau de Monk, exhibits the synthesis of several influential composers and styles. Also included in the folio is an extended symphonic work for combined orchestral and choral forces, Symphony for a Busy World, which represents the culmination of many compositional features that were developed throughout candidature. To provide background and perspective to the folio of compositions, the commentary highlights a number of influential compositional techniques and idiosyncrasies with regard to thematic development and harmonic language, as well as specific features of rhythm, orchestration and vocal writing. Detail regarding these compositional processes is provided, discussing the influence of particular compositional approaches relevant to the body of works in the folio within a music history context, whilst also identifying the application of compositional processes and approaches encountered in the folio.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Music Composition, New Music, Australian Music, Choral Music, Orchestral Music, Chamber Music, Jazz, Symphony.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:209873</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pencils &amp; Erasers: Interactions between motion and spatial coding in human vision</field><field name="creator">Thomas Wallis</field><field name="description">Visual information about the form of an object and its movement in the world can be processed independently. These processing streams must be combined, since our visual experience is of a unitary stream of information. Studies of interactions between motion and form processing can therefore provide insight into how this combination occurs. The present thesis explored two such interactions between motion and spatial coding in human vision. The title of the thesis, &#8220;Pencils and Erasers&#8221;, serves as an analogy for the thesis&#8217; principal findings. I investigate one situation in which moving patterns can impair the visibility of stationary forms, and another in which the visibility of form is enhanced by motion. In motion-induced blindness (MIB; Bonneh, Cooperman, &amp; Sagi, 2001), salient stationary objects can seem to disappear intermittently from awareness when surrounded by moving features. Static forms proximate to motion can be &#8220;erased&#8221; from awareness. The thesis contributes to the answer to a simple question: why does MIB happen? My interpretation of this phenomenon emphasises the possible functional benefit of such an eraser around moving form: to suppress artifacts of visual processing from awareness. Chapter 2 demonstrates that motion per se is not required for MIB (Wallis &amp; Arnold, 2008). MIB depends on the rate of luminance change over time, rather than the velocity (or change in position) of the inducing mask. MIB can therefore be characterised as a temporal inhibition, which does not critically depend on direction selective (motion) mechanisms. A similar mechanism of temporal inhibition that does not depend on motion is that which suppresses motion streaks from awareness. The human visual system integrates information over time. Consequently, moving image features produce smeared signals, or &#8220;motion streaks&#8221;, much like photographing a moving object using a slow shutter speed. We do not experience motion streaks as much as might be expected as they are suppressed from awareness in most circumstances. Evidence suggests that this suppression is enacted by a process of local temporal inhibition, and does not depend on motion mechanisms &#8211; much like MIB. These similarities led us to propose that MIB and motion streak suppression might reflect the same mechanism. In the case of MIB, physically present static targets may not be differentiated from signals arising from within the visual system, such as a motion streak. Chapter 3 of the thesis presents four converging lines of evidence in support of this hypothesis (Wallis &amp; Arnold, 2009). The link between MIB and a mechanism of temporal inhibition that serves to suppress motion streaks is further strengthened by a recent report from our laboratory of a new visual illusion, Spatio-Temporal Rivalry (STR; Arnold, Erskine, Roseboom, &amp; Wallis, in press), that is included in the present thesis as an appendix. Why does MIB occur? I suggest that at its base level, MIB reflects the activity of this simple visual mechanism of temporal inhibition (see Gorea &amp; Caetta, 2009). This mechanism might usually serve a functional role in everyday vision: for example, by suppressing the perception of motion streaks. The second motion and form interaction investigated in the thesis represents a situation in which motion can improve form sensitivity. In some situations, observing a moving pattern can objectively improve sensitivity to that pattern after the offset of motion. The visual system can &#8220;pencil in&#8221;, or improve the visibility of, subsequent visual input. When a form defined by its motion relative to the background ceases to move, it does not seem to instantly disappear. Instead, the form is perceived to remain segregated from the background for a short period, before slowly fading. It is possible that this percept represents a consequence of bias or expectation, not a modulation of static form visibility by motion. Contrary to this possibility, Wallis, Williams and Arnold (2009) demonstrate that alignment sensitivity to spatial forms is improved by pre-exposure to moving forms (Chapter 4). I suggest that the subjective persistence of forms after motion offset and this spatial facilitation may represent two consequences of the same signal. The experiments herein address one situation in which moving patterns can impair the visibility of stationary forms and one in which moving patterns enhance the visibility of stationary forms. Therefore, the present thesis characterises two interactions between form and motion processing in human vision. These mechanisms of &#8220;pencil&#8221; and &#8220;eraser&#8221; facilitate the clear perception of objects in our visual world.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Visual Perception</field><field name="subject">vision</field><field name="subject">visual neuroscience</field><field name="subject">form perception</field><field name="subject">Motion Perception</field><field name="subject">motion-induced blindness</field><field name="subject">visual illusions</field><field name="subject">Psychophysics</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:211656</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Role of Non-Structural Protein NS2A in Flavivirus Assembly and Secretion</field><field name="creator">Jason Leung</field><field name="description">Flaviviruses are a group of medically relevant pathogens, known to cause serious disease in animals and humans. The previously defined roles of the flavivirus non-structural protein 2A (NS2A) in RNA replication, and modulation of the host antiviral response, has recently been extended to include virus assembly and secretion. In West Nile virus subtype Kunjin (KUN), an Isoleucine (I)-to-Asparagine (N) substitution at position 59 of the NS2A protein blocked the production of secreted virus particles in cells electroporated with viral RNA carrying this mutation. In this study, prolonged incubation of mutant KUN NS2A-I59N replicon RNA, in an inducible BHK-derived packaging cell line (expressing KUN structural proteins C, prM, and E), generated escape mutants that rescued the secretion of infectious virus-like particles. Sequencing identified three groups of revertants that included (i) reversions to wild-type, hydrophobic Ile, (ii) pseudorevertants to more hydrophobic residues (Ser, Thr, and Tyr) at codon 59, and (iii) pseudorevertants retaining Asn at NS2A codon 59, but containing a compensatory mutation (Thr-to-Pro) at NS2A codon 149. Engineering hydrophobic residues at NS2A position 59, or the compensatory T149P mutation into NS2A-I59N replicon RNA, restored the assembly of secreted virus-like particles in packaging cells. T149P mutation also rescued virus production when introduced into the full-length KUN RNA containing an NS2A-I59N mutation. Immunofluorescence and electron microscopy analyses of NS2A-I59N replicon-expressing cells showed a distinct lack of virus-induced membranes normally present in cells expressing wild-type replicon RNA. The compensatory mutation NS2A-T149P restored the induction of membrane structures to a level similar to those observed during wild-type replication. These results further confirm the role of NS2A in virus assembly, demonstrate the importance of hydrophobic residues at codon 59 in this process, implicate the involvement of NS2A in the biogenesis of virus-induced membranes, and suggest a vital role for these induced membranes in virus assembly. To further our understanding of how mutations within NS2A are able to affect the induction of virus-induced membranes, leading to a block in virus assembly, the membrane topology of KUN NS2A was investigated. Using a plasmid encoding NS1 and NS2A proteins with C-terminal c-myc and FLAG epitopes, NS2A proteins containing N-linked acceptor sites and C-terminal truncations were generated. Assays were performed to identify the subcellular localization of specific sequences within NS2A by Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses. While the membrane topology could not be determined experimentally, the findings of this study support the assertion that cleavage at the NS1/NS2A junction requires the majority, if not all of the NS2A protein for proper processing to occur, and suggests that the interaction between hydrophilic loops and &#61537;-helical transmembrane segments plays an important role in the formation and stability of the flavivirus NS2A protein topology. Based on the knowledge of polyprotein processing events, and utilizing a range of software packages, a topology model of NS2A was predicted. The likelihood of additional sequences within NS2A affecting the ability to induce virus-specific membranes, and facilitate virion assembly, has led to the development of an invasive bacterial screening system, as a delivery vehicle to screen libraries of mutated KUN replicon clones. Using these invasive bacteria to deliver mutated KUN replicons into BHK-derived packaging cells, mutations causing a deficiency in either RNA replication or encapsidation can be identified by performing &#61538;-gal assays on cells maintained in the presence, or absence of Doxycycline (suppressing the expression of structural proteins), respectively. Furthermore, this system was adapted for use in a 96-well plate format, allowing for high-throughput screening. Thus, KUN replicon clones capable of RNA replication, but unable to assemble and secrete virus-like particles can be identified and further analyzed, in the hope of mapping amino acid residues and motifs involved in encapsidation of flavivirus RNA. Finally, a range of hypotheses are discussed, explaining the possible mechanisms by which NS2A is involved in flavivirus assembly. A number of future directions and applications are also presented.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Kunjin</field><field name="subject">Flavivirus</field><field name="subject">Assembly</field><field name="subject">NS2A</field><field name="subject">Nonstructural</field><field name="subject">Membrane biogenesis</field><field name="subject">Invasive bacteria</field><field name="subject">Topology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:211671</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Auditor expert performance in fraud detection: The case of internal auditors</field><field name="creator">Grace Yanchi Mui</field><field name="description">Fraud is an inevitable cost of doing business. Organisations are responding to the pervasiveness of fraud by employing increased fraud risk management strategies. Internal audit is the most effective corporate control available to management to address the threat of fraud. Internal audit as an effective corporate control is studied in the context of the mandatory obligation imposed by The Institute of Internal Auditors&#8217; 2009 International Professional Practices Framework (hereafter, IPPF). This mandatory obligation requires the internal audit function to &#8216;evaluate the potential for the occurrence of fraud and [to evaluate] how the organisation manages fraud risk&#8217; (IPPF performance standard 2120.A2 Risk Management). At the individual auditor level, the internal auditor is required to &#8216;possess the knowledge, skills, and other competencies to perform their individual responsibilities&#8217; (IPPF attribute standard 1210 Proficiency). These standards have the potential to increase expectations on the internal audit profession to prevent and detect the threat of fraud. This expectations gap raises two research questions: (1) What are the determinants of auditors&#8217; fraud detection capabilities? and (2) What constitutes expert performance in the fraud detection task? This thesis aims to address these research questions through the performance of two studies. Study 1 used interviews to investigate the determinants of fraud detection capabilities of both the external auditor and internal auditor. Study 2 drew on the results from Study 1 and was an online survey of Australian internal audit practitioners. Study 1 confirmed that the determinants of auditor expert performance in other audit tasks established in literature, namely, certification, continuous learning, practical experience, analytical reasoning, data analysis skills, communication skills, are also applicable to the fraud detection task. Further, the fraud detection task requires key, unique capabilities because fraud has an inherent element of deception and concealment by fraud perpetrators. The determinants of auditor expert performance unique to the fraud detection task include mentoring, technical skills, and the ability to work in a team. An additional finding is the identification of an effective control environment as a determinant related to the environment where the auditor performs audit work. The resulting model of auditor expert performance in fraud detection depicts the relationship of these determinants (independent variables) with expert performance in fraud detection (the dependent variable). The inclusion of new determinants and the revision of the definitions of determinants established in literature provided the solution to Research Question 1. Subsequently, auditor expert performance in fraud detection was defined based on the resulting combination of determinants. This was the solution to Research Question 2. Study 2 was an online survey with new scales of measurement that were developed from Study 1 interview data. Expert studies and pilot studies were conducted to validate these new scales of measurement. The online survey captured the perceptions of Australian internal audit practitioners about the determinants identified in Study 1. The survey data was applied to the model of auditor expert performance in fraud detection. The main findings of this study are: (1) the assessment of the effectiveness of the strategies to develop auditors&#8217; knowledge of fraud and fraud detection - mentoring, practical experience, continuous learning, and certification; (2) the assessment of the effectiveness of each determinant in contributing towards auditor expert performance in fraud detection. The findings of this thesis supported the expectation that the uniqueness of the fraud detection task impacted on the composition of auditors&#8217; fraud detection capabilities and subsequently, the composition and definition of auditor expert performance in fraud detection. The participation of practitioners &#8211; internal auditors, external auditors, and fraud investigators - and academics in the data collection and validation processes provided valuable insight into the research design and provided helpful data for the two studies. The main contribution of this thesis is the extension of Bonner and Lewis&#8217; (1990) model of auditor expert performance to the fraud detection task. Next, the resulting model of auditor expert performance in fraud detection provides the internal audit profession, organisations, and the individual internal auditor with an understanding of the factors that impact on the individual internal auditor&#8217;s fraud detection capabilities. Therefore, this practical understanding of internal auditors&#8217; fraud detection capabilities has the potential to: (1) contribute to the development and improvement of an organisation&#8217;s fraud risk management strategy; (2) inform the policy debate regarding the promulgation of professional and mandatory standards; and (3) contribute to auditing practice and the audit profession through the identification of strategies to educate the audit profession about fraud detection. The final contribution is the research design where the qualitative study (Study 1) contributed to the development of the survey instrument and provided insights into the results of the structural mode (Study 2).</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">auditing, internal auditor, fraud detection</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:211780</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biology of Sex Determination and Sexual Development in the Cane Toad (Bufo marinus)</field><field name="creator">Oganes Abramyan</field><field name="description">To date, the majority of studies into sex determination and sexual development have focused on the mammalian system due to the mouse model being an excellent tool for developmental biology as well as obvious implications to human health and development. However, the focus on the mammalian system has caused a large fraction of other vertebrate groups to be overlooked. The last decade has seen an array of studies into various non-mammalian organisms like fishes, birds, reptiles, and amphibians. These studies have unveiled a remarkably conserved molecular background utilized for sexual differentiation amongst all vertebrates, ranging from the alligator which employs temperature dependent sex determination to the mouse, which employs genotypic sex determination In this project, I implemented molecular methods traditionally used to study model organisms, to investigate an amphibian species, the cane toad (Bufo marinus). The cane toad was chosen due to its invasive status in Australia, as well as being a representative of one of the most successful and specious families of vertebrates, Bufonidae. Since, its introduction, this species has rapidly spread across the continent, adversely effecting native species throughout its introduced range. Recent studies have identified the disruption of the sex-determination pathway as a realistic goal in an otherwise, seemingly futile, effort to curtail their expansion. We decided to approach the study of cane toad sex determination and development on three levels, in order to have a broader understanding of the similarities between toads and other groups, and additionally, to better assess the feasibility of utilizing molecular means to control cane toads in non-native habitats. Firstly, I used a candidate gene approach to clone and characterize five genes which were previously known to be involved in both mammalian as well as amphibian sex determination: Sox9, Dmrt1, p450arom, Sf1, and Dax1. I chose Sox9 and Dmrt1 due to their known involvement in the male-specific pathway of mammals. Dmrt1 was also known to be male specific in other groups, including amphibians. Conversely, I also decided to investigate p450arom and Dax1, due to their affiliation with the female pathway, while Sf1 has a role in both sexes. All of these genes were expressed in the gonads of both sexes of cane toads. However, Sox9 exhibited strong transcriptional up-regulation in testes at the time of sexual differentiation, similar to mammals. Thus, using the candidate gene approach, I was successful in identifying a sex-specific marker which could be utilized in the manipulation of the sex determination pathway (e.g. female to male sex reversal). VIIThe second approach involved the study of sex determination on a cytogenetic level. Traditionally, Bufonids have been assumed to utilize a ZZ/ZW (male homogametic/female heterogametic) sex chromosome system, yet only one recent study has been successful in the identification of sex chromosomes in a toad species. Moreover, the authors identified the sex chromosomes in only one population (of 18 studied), highlighting the scarcity of discernible sex chromosomes in toads. When we began to investigate the karyotype of cane toads, we were able to identify a female-specific length polymorphism in the nucleolus organizer region (NOR) of chromosome 7, making this chromosome pair a strong candidates for the Z and W sex chromosomes. In order to verify our hypothesis, we also performed chromomycin A3 staining to reveal a differential signal between the chromosome pair, indicative of heterochromatin accumulation on the brighter NOR. This study lent strong support to the observed difference between the chromosomes, yet we required further investigation in order to identify the W and the Z chromosomes, specifically. By utilizing comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), I was able to identify a female specific region on the chromosome with the larger NOR, identifying it as the W chromosome. This study was successful in identifying the sex chromosomes in the cane toad. Moreover, it allows us to make a more accurate prediction of the possible sex determination method utilized: either a dosage dependent male determination system, or a female-specific gene in a female determination system. The third approach focused on the Bidder&#8217;s organ and its role in sexual development of cane toads. The Bidder&#8217;s organ is a gonadal structure comprised of ovary-like tissue, found in both males and females, with no known function. Since our study was focused on female to male sex-reversal of cane toads, we decided to investigate the potential of the Bidder&#8217;s organ to interrupt this process. By utilizing the candidate genes, which I had previously cloned, I was able to identify the Bidder&#8217;s organ as having an entirely distinct transcriptional pattern in comparison to the gonads of either sex. Additionally, the Bidder&#8217;s organ showed significantly higher levels of p450arom expression than the gonads, identifying it as a possible key player in the production of aromatase enzyme for oestrogen production. Moreover, gene expression patterns in the Bidder&#8217;s organ strongly correlated with the significant developmental time points in the sexual development of the toads, implying a possible function in the development process of toads. In conclusion, I have performed the first study of the molecular, cytogenetic and anatomical aspects of sexual development in a toad. I was able to verify that cane toads utilize a ZZ/ZW chromosome system and furthermore, likely utilize the mammalian male-linked gene, Sox9, in male development. I was also able to show that the Bidder&#8217;s organ is transcriptionally active at key time points, likely indicative of a functional role during development.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cane toad</field><field name="subject">Bufo marinus</field><field name="subject">amphibian</field><field name="subject">sex chromsomes</field><field name="subject">gonad</field><field name="subject">sex determination</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:212661</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of the mechanics of high energy flames applied to the penetration of rocks</field><field name="creator">Just, G.

There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy -

Nonlinear behaviour: the component parts do not act in linear ways, that is the superposition of the actions of the parts is not the output of the system. 2. Emergent behaviour: the output of the system may be inexpressible in terms of the rules or equations of the component parts. 3. Self-organisation: order appears from the chaotic interactions of individuals and the rules they obey. 4. Layers of description: in which a rule may apply at some higher levels of description but not at lower layers. 5. Adaptation: in which the environment becomes encoded in the rules governing the structure and/or behaviour of the parts (in this case strictly agents) that undergo selection in which those that are by some measure better become more numerous than those that are not as &#8220;fit&#8221;. A single cell is a complex system: we cannot explain all of its behaviour as simply the sum of its parts. Similarly, DNA structures, social networks, cancers, the brain, and living beings are intricate complex systems. This thesis tackles all of these topics from a complex systems approach. I have skirted some of the philosophical issues of complex systems and mainly focussed on appropriate tools to analyse these systems, addressing important questions such as: &#8226; What is the best way to extract information from DNA? &#8226; How can we model and analyse mutations in DNA?  &#8226; Can we determine the likely spread of both viruses and ideas in social networks? &#8226; How can we model the growth of cancer? &#8226; How can we model and analyse interactions between genes in such living systems as the fruit fly, cancers, and humans? &#8226; Can complex systems techniques give us some insight into the human brain?</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">complex systems; cancer; signal processing; metabolomics, gene regulatory networks, nonlinear dynamics, EEG, mutation</field><field name="subject">Signal processing</field><field name="subject">System analysis.</field><field name="subject">DNA--Analysis.</field><field name="subject">Mutation (Biology)</field><field name="subject">Genetic regulation.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/40682</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Affective change in adult students in second chance mathematics courses : three different teaching approaches</field><field name="creator">Miller-Reilly, Barbara Joy</field><field name="description">A case study approach was used to explore second-chance mathematics through two larger courses and one individual study program. A different teaching approach, by committed experienced teachers, was used in each course. In evaluating their effectiveness, I focused on affective change in the students, relating this to their achievement. This study contributes to research on understanding good teaching of mathematics to adults. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected over several years. Methods included: a questionnaire (including mathematics attitude and belief scales as well as demographic and open questions); interviews with students to gather more affective data and explore their reactions to the course approach; and the individual supervised study course was audio-taped for six months. Teachers of the larger courses were also interviewed about their goals for, and experiences with, the students. These multiple strands of evidence provide a complex overall picture of three, largely successful, teaching approaches. Each measure had its own contribution to make, and taken together they illuminated the ways in which affective change was related to ackevement in the three contexts. The higher achieving groups in each of the two larger courses entered the courses with more positive attitudes and beliefs than the lower achieving groups and subsequent affective changes reinforced these differences. The lower achieving groups completed the courses affectively worse off than when they started, Students' reactions to these approaches were compared and found to reflect the nature of the approach. In addition to this finding, successhl students' beliefs about mathematics changed in two of the courses. In the one-to-one course the teacher focused initially on understanding the students' fear of mathematics and early mathematical experiences. The student-focused teaching approach trusted and encouraged the growth of ths student's mathematical thinking. Six months later the student felt empowered and had come to believe that mathematics as a creative and enjoyable process of discovering patterns. The second course focused on the mathematization of realistic situations. Successful students came to regard mathematics as useful, interesting, relating to real life. Successful students in the third course appreciated the carefully structured reintroduction to mathematics and were pleased they could finally do the mathematics they hadn't been able to understand at high school.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Education, Mathematics (0280)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/42</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ng&#257; whakawhitinga: standing at the crossroads :  M&#257;ori ways of understanding extra-ordinary experiences and schizophrenia.</field><field name="creator">Taitimu, Melissa</field><field name="description">Indigenous peoples and ethnic minorities are being diagnosed with schizophrenia at significantly higher rates than majority groups all around the world.  Aetiological literature reveals a wide range of causal explanations including biogenetic, social and cultural factors.  A major limitation of this body of research is the assumption of schizophrenia as a universal syndrome.  When viewed through an indigenous lens, experiences labelled schizophrenic by Western psychiatry have been found to vary from culture to culture in terms of content, meaning and outcome.  The current project aimed to investigate M&#257;ori ways of understanding experiences commonly labelled &#8216;schizophrenic&#8217;.  The philosophical frameworks that guided the research were Kaupapa M&#257;ori Theory and Personal Construct Theory.  A qualitative approach was used and semi-structured interviews were conducted with 57 participants including tangata whaiora (service users), tohunga (traditional healers), kaumatua/kuia (elders), P&#257;keh&#257; clinicians, M&#257;ori clinicians, cultural support workers and students.  Four categories were derived from qualitative thematic analysis.  These being: making sense of the experiences, pathways of healing, making sense of the statistics and what can we do about the statistics.  Overall, M&#257;ori constructions related to other indigenous constructions of mental illness and wellbeing cited in the international literature but were in stark contrast to current psychiatric constructions.  The current project indicated M&#257;ori participants held multiple explanatory models for extra-ordinary experiences with the predominant explanations being spiritual.  Other explanations included psychosocial constructions (trauma and drug abuse), historical trauma (colonisation) and biomedical constructions (chemical brain imbalance).  Based on these findings, recommendations for the development of culturally appropriate assessment and treatment processes are presented. Over the last couple of centuries a single paradigm, the medical model, has come to dominate the explanation and treatment of illness in Western society.  Via legal and political means, indigenous models of illness and wellness have been wiped out or forced to the margins of many societies.  This thesis aims to challenge the dominant medical model that has privileged psychiatric knowledges while suppressing others by repositioning indigenous construction at the centre of the research via a Kaupapa M&#257;ori framework. Chapter One aims to deconstruct current medical constructions by presenting psychiatry as a culture in itself as opposed to a discipline dedicated to scientific truths.  This chapter posits that the culture of psychiatry has lead many clinicians to suffer from &#8220;cultural blindness&#8221; when working with indigenous and ethnic minority groups.  Chapter One uses the tools of science to question the scientific validity and reliability of the construct &#8220;schizophrenia&#8221;.  I conclude that this construct is &#8220;unscientific&#8221; in itself.  I will also look at three themes highlighted by other researchers regarding the treatment of mental illness throughout Western history: treatments are used as a form of social control; treatments can be dehumanising; and the dominance and power of the medical model to define who and what is considered ill.   Chapter One also acknowledges the significant role of the consumer movement in developing more humane treatments.  Interactions between culture and psychiatry via colonisation are outlined in Chapter Two. I also critique research that is conducted cross culturally in terms of whether researchers attempt to establish the reliability of universal diagnoses or recognise local and unique constructions.  Chapter Two challenges the commonly cited finding of higher rates of schizophrenia for ethnic minorities and indigenous peoples by questioning the validity of foreign cultural constructs to explain indigenous forms of illness.  This chapter recognises indigenous and cultural constructions of what psychiatry labels &#8216;schizophrenic&#8217;.  To illustrate, three &#8216;culture bound syndromes&#8217; will be discussed.  The development of indigenous psychological paradigms is also presented to position the current research within this wider international movement.  Chapter Three summarises M&#257;ori constructions of illness and wellness.  This chapter predominantly draws from early anthropological literature and subsequent psychological studies to represent the resilience of M&#257;ori constructions of experiences commonly labelled schizophrenic.  In accordance with the experiences of other indigenous populations, this chapter also recognises the impact of colonisation on M&#257;ori beliefs and practices relevant to maintaining wellness.  To illustrate the effect of colonisation, disparities in statistics between M&#257;ori and non-M&#257;ori for admissions and readmissions to inpatients units for psychotic disorders will be discussed.  Explanations for these disparities will also be outlined.  Within Chapter Three, the resistance and revival of M&#257;ori constructions is also recognised as a function of the development of bicultural and Kaupapa M&#257;ori Services.  Chapter Four, summarises the theoretical orientation of the research.  This research is qualitative and assumes a post-modern critical paradigm.  Two theoretical frameworks were used within this research (Kaupapa M&#257;ori Theory and Personal Construct Theory) to represent the two worlds in which the research was conducted (Indigenous and Western).  Chapter Five outlines the methodology by recounting a somewhat layered journey.  Within the first section, &#8216;Who am I&#8217;, I have positioned myself by sharing my journey towards conducting this project.  The second section, &#8216;Where did I want to go&#8217;, outlines the research aims and process of consultation.  The final section summarises &#8216;What I did&#8217; in terms of qualitative interviews and the process undertaken for interpretation and presentation of the data.  Chapter Six presents the results of the research according to the four categories developed from qualitative analysis.  These were: &#8216;Making sense of extra-ordinary experiences&#8217;, &#8216;Pathways of healing&#8217;, &#8216;Making sense of the statistics&#8217; and &#8216;What can we do about the statistics&#8217;.  Within this chapter I have attempted to present quotes with as little interpretation as possible (over and above sorting of themes) to allow the reader to make their own interpretations before reading the discussion.  Chapter Seven summarises the major findings from each category and relates the results to the national and international literature.  Clinical and theoretical implications are discussed with recommendations for future research.  The limitations and strengths of the research are highlighted and conclusions drawn from the research journey.  The plan for dissemination is also presented.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">M&#257;ori psychology</field><field name="subject">schizophrenia</field><field name="subject">Kaupapa M&#257;ori theory</field><field name="subject">Indigenous psychology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::220000 Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts-General</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3367</field></doc><doc><field name="title">High level support for performance engineering, and model integration and model transformation</field><field name="creator">Cai, Rainbow Yuhong</field><field name="description">This thesis provides high level support for Performance Engineering in software architecture design via  two research projects - Argo/MTE and MaramaMTE+.

Passive tags are used in commercial offices for access control, while a more active and powerful tag is deployed in highways for electronic road toll collections. Other non-contact, close range methods are popular in subways and other public transport systems.  The use of RFID in supply chain management is an emerging technological trend that has attracted a lot of attention in the U.S., Europe, and Asia. This is largely driven by the potential benefits that RFID technology is perceived to deliver in the supply chain, particularly, supply chain visibility. Major retailers and leading corporations around the globe are already testing and implementing RFID, and claiming to have achieved competitive advantages and return on their investments. It is, therefore, important to understand the adoption of RFID in New Zealand supply chains, so that appropriate actions can be taken to ensure that New Zealand companies are not lagging behind.  This research study explores and explains the adoption of RFID in supply chains using exploratory survey and case study. The research questions are:  1. What specific benefits can be achieved in organisations by using RFID?  2. What are the barriers to realising these benefits?  3. How and why do organisations adopt or not adopt RFID in supply chains?  Three factors were found to be important in the adoption of RFID in New Zealand supply chains. They are the compatibility of RFID with existing organisation's systems and values, the availability of supports to facilitate RFID adoption, and the readiness of the internal and external organisation's environment. It was also found that complexity of the technology and the relative advantage of using RFID were to a certain extent influencing users' perception of RFID compatibility. Dependency on trading partners was found to have some effects on RFID adoption.  A theoretical framework of RFID adoption in supply chains is proposed. This framework helps to bring out the important factors in the adoption of RFID in supply chains. While most IS research is focused on individual technology adoption or on intra-organisational technology adoption, this research is focused on technology adoption that involves or has impacts on trading partners, that is, at supply chain level. It provides a three-dimensional evaluation framework which includes technological, organisational, and environmental aspects of inter-organisational technology adoption.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5807</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Glasses have two lenses: the use of an acronymous metacognitive learning strategy to improve reading comprehension on the Internet</field><field name="creator">Pope, Kevin Barry</field><field name="description">This exploratory study took place in a New Zealand Intermediate School and demonstrated the use of an acronymous metacognitive learning strategy designed to improve reading comprehension outcomes for student participants reading material directly sourced on the Internet (web-text). The strategy, WWW SSURF, was formulated by the researcher from the results of existing research into reading comprehension for print-based text and web-text. The research was conducted in two phases: the original study and a replication study. In the original study two class groups used the strategy; in the replication study one class group used the strategy while a second class group did not. The original study provided evidence that uptake of the strategy elements by participants was relatively quick and that participant increased use of strategy elements persisted over a six-month period without any further specific strategy instruction or scaffolding. The replication study groups were comparable with respect to their reading comprehension of print-based text, however the group using the strategy performed much better on the reading tasks in the study than the group that did not use the strategy (effect size = 1.08). A structural equation model (SEM) model for successful reading comprehension of web-text was tested from which it was determined that the use of a metacognitive strategy for processing cognitive strategies made a greater contribution than just possession of the cognitive strategies, while the usability features of web-text, such as navigability, discourse features, presence of multi-media elements and general appearance, made a negative contribution. This thesis provides details of the WWW SSURF strategy and its implementation and articulates practical implications for the classroom practitioner using the Internet as a source of authentic materials for their participants, and questions that merit future research.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5840</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling and analysis of hydrogen-based wind energy transmission and storage systems : HyLink system at Totara Valley : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Technology in Energy Management at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Sudol, Peter</field><field name="description">Distributed generation has the potential to reduce the supply-demand gap emerging in New Zealand&#8217;s electricity market. Thereby it can improve the overall network efficiency, harness renewable energy resources and reduce the need for upgrading of existing distribution lines. A typical New Zealand rural community consisting of three adjacent farms at Totara Valley near Woodville represents a demonstration site on distributed generation for Massey University and Industrial Research Limited. Local renewable energy resources are being used for the purpose of sustainable development. Alternative micro-scale technologies are being combined to achieve a valuable network support. This paper is an in-depth report on the implementation process of the HyLink system; a system which utilises hydrogen as an energy carrier to balance and transport the fluctuating wind power. The report documents its development from the laboratory stage to commissioning at Totara Valley, which was carried out under direction of Industrial Research Limited. The PEM electrolyser&#8217;s performance at different stack temperatures was investigated. It was found that hydrogen production increases at the same voltage with a higher stack temperature. This is due to the improved kinetics of the electrochemical reactions and decreased thermodynamic energy requirement for water electrolysis. The electrolyser efficiency measurement at the half of its maximal power input (247 W) resulted in 65.3%. Thereby the stack temperature attained less than half of the allowed limit of 80&#176;C. The capture of the excess heat by insulation can improve the electrolyser&#8217;s efficiency. Pressure tests were performed on the 2 km long pipeline at Totara Valley using hydrogen and natural gas in order to test their permeability. The results were compared with previous studies at Massey University and with data obtained from the industry. The hydrogen permeability was measured to be 5.5 * 10[to the power of]-16 mol m m[to the power of]-2 s[to the power of]-1 Pa[to the power of]-1 for a 2 km MDPE pipe. This is about half the result obtained from previous studies on hydrogen permeability through MDPE at Massey University which was undertaken at room temperature. The reason for this discrepancy is likely to be the lower ambient temperature during the measurement at Totara Valley, which can be supported with the Arrhenius equation. It was furthermore measured that the power loss due to hydrogen diffusion through the pipeline walls during the fuel cell operation is about 1.5 W at the current system operation mode. A techno-economic analysis of the system was undertaken applying the micro-power optimisation software HOMER as a simulation tool. Two operation modes of the system were investigated, the load following and the peak demand compensating. The simulation results reveal that the durability and the cost of the electrochemical energy conversion devices; electrolyser and fuel cell, are the main hurdles which need to be overcome on the path in introducing hydrogen based energy systems like HyLink. Finally, economic optimisation modelling of the small-scale system by best component alignment was performed. It was found that the electrolyser capacity down-rating of 80% in relation to the wind turbine capacity, leads to a minimal system levelised cost. In addition to this, the impact of various wind turbine/electrolyser subsystems and pipeline storage capacities on the fuel cell capacity factor and on the system levelised cost in the load following operation mode was analysed. The outcomes can be useful for further HyLink related energy system planning.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hydrogen</field><field name="subject">energy carrier</field><field name="subject">fluctuating wind power</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290900 Electrical and Electronic Engineering::290901 Electrical engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/786</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding guest retention : an examination of New Zealand accommodation establishments : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Management, Massey University</field><field name="creator">Barnett, Shirley Jean</field><field name="description">Abstract  The importance of customer retention has become a major theme in the literature since the 1990s when empirical studies showed that retaining 5% of customers could lead to an increase in profits ranging from 25% to 85%.  However, customer retention does not appear to have moved from the theoretical into the practical world.  Specifically, there were few empirical studies which focused on customer retention and none were identified in the New Zealand accommodation sector.  The travel and tourism industry contributes approximately 9% to New Zealand&#8217;s GDP, and 10% of all spending by travellers and tourists is in the accommodation sector.  Impacts, such as seasonality, characterise the accommodation sector and many establishments have occupancy rates which can fluctuate from 90% to 30% in the off-season.  With average annual occupancy rates for New Zealand hotels and motels hovering around 55%, retention is a strategy that owners and managers could implement in order to increase occupancy and profits.  In this study the research question was based on a review of the literature and the a priori knowledge and experience of the researcher.  To ensure the research question framing this study was answered in the most exhaustive and comprehensive manner a seven step research process based on work by Bourgeois (1979) was followed.  Data was gathered using both deductive and inductive methods in order to nullify the two main research problems raised by Bourgeois (1979).  First, that theories are cast at a high level which is removed from reality and second that empirical studies often result in just a description of the data.  In the deductive phase of this study a survey was mailed to New Zealand accommodation establishments that provided accommodation and meals, and had a liquor licence.  The main focus of this survey was to learn what owners and managers understood about guest retention and to answer the first research objective.  It was discovered that New Zealand accommodation managers: actively work to retain their guests; know the value of guest retention; understand the links between guest satisfaction, loyalty and retention; understand the specific reasons behind guest defections; understand the importance service recovery; and understand how loyalty schemes lead to guest retention.  The second phase was a case study involving three accommodation establishments.  These findings added depth to the study and allowed for new knowledge to be extrapolated from the findings.  It was discovered that in two establishments the focus was guest satisfaction and building relationships with customers.  Whilst the resort hotel did have a strategy to encourage lapsed business to return this wasn&#8217;t measured or monitored.  Thus the second research objective was answered.  In the penultimate chapter an amended profit chain has been proposed which included &#8216;Building Customer Relationships&#8217; as the link between satisfaction and profitability.  This is based on the finding that the case establishments saw retention as a proxy for satisfaction and, therefore, focused on satisfying guests and building personal relationships as methods of guest retention. The research question framing this study can be answered by saying that the strategies used by owners and managers in New Zealand accommodation establishments to manage guest retention tend to be related to guest satisfaction and building personal relationships.  However, this is not because they do not understand guest retention but see it as part of the bigger picture involving the building of relationships with guests.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">guest retention</field><field name="subject">hotel management</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">customer loyalty</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350500 Tourism</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/791</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Policy and reality : the teaching of oral communication by Japanese teachers of English in public junior high schools in Kurashiki City, Japan : a thesis presented in the fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Second Language Teaching at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Rapley, Douglas James</field><field name="description">In 2003 the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) unveiled their new junior high school (JHS) English as a Foreign Language (EFL) policy, which focused strongly on oral communication. Although there is evidence of policy noncompliance in schools until now there has been no English language research on the attitudes or practices of Japanese teachers of English (JTEs), or the views of the students, and their parents in regards to teaching/learning English speaking skills. The research, based on JHSs in a mid-sized Japanese city (pop. 475,000 approx.), focused predominantly on JTEs, but also included students, and their parents. Focus group sessions, questionnaires, and one-on-one interviews were used to collect data. The study reveals that learning English speaking skills is considered important, but passing the senior high school (SHS) entrance examination is the main concern and so, test impact from the SHS entrance examination exerts the greatest pressure on JHS JTEs. The JTEs also perceive themselves as facing other issues such as student motivation, JTE speaking proficiency, and large class sizes. Another finding is that JTEs appear to receive inadequate training&#8211; pre- and inservice&#8211; resulting in issues, such as a reliance on traditional methods (yakudoku), which are not in accordance with MEXT&#8217;s intentions, and JTE proficiency test achievement levels lower than those desired by MEXT. As a result of these issues gaps exist between MEXT JHS EFL policies and actual teaching practices, and have unfortunately led to a situation where JTEs believe that MEXT does not care about or understand the teaching environment. The study concludes that implementation of MEXT&#8217;s policy require a better match between the SHS entrance examination and JHS EFL policy, a decrease in class sizes, and JTEs receiving more adequate training. A more positive relationship between MEXT and JTEs would result from these two groups working collaboratively when designing JHS EFL policies and could better achieve a match between the SHS entrance examination and JHS EFL policy.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English language teaching</field><field name="subject">spoken English</field><field name="subject">policy</field><field name="subject">Japan</field><field name="subject">speaking English</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330200 Curriculum Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/794</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nutritional characteristics of New Zealand export lamb and functional properties of selected beef forequarter muscles : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of technology in Bioprocess Engineering at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Jansen, Eion</field><field name="description">Richmond Ltd. has recently undergone a change in strategy, away from the traditional commodity based meat industry, towards the modern food business. To do this, opportunities to add value to their current product range must be identified. This involves the conversion of traditionally low value commodity based products into products that demand a premium. An example of this is converting muscles that are currently used for grinding meat into a further processed convenience food (i.e. ready meals). Another method is to add further value to premium products by making them more appealing to consumers (i.e. nutritional information on labels). This work details investigations into the functional properties of selected beef forequarter muscles (low value commodity products) and the nutritional properties of selected export lamb products (premium products). The functional properties of a number of beef forequarter muscles were measured to identify which had the best potential for further processing applications with respect to ready meals. The functional properties of tenderness, cook loss and shrinkage were measured for the Latissimus Dorsi, Pectorialis Profundus (Point End Brisket), Infraspinatus (Cross Cut Blade), Triceps Brachi Longhead (Main muscle in Bolar Shoulder Clod), Supraspinatus (Chuck Tender), Serratus Ventralis and Triceps Brachi Medialhead (Muscle in Bolar Shoulder Clod. From the tests conducted the Infraspinatus and the Triceps Brachi Longhead have been identified as having the best functional properties with respect to further processing for ready meal applications. As well as conducting tests to identify the forequarter muscles with the best potential for further processing applications, investigations were carried out to identify cooking regimes that would optimise the functional properties. This work confirmed that there are three major chemical reactions, which determine the resultant functional properties of cooked meat. They are the denaturation and aggregation of the myofibrillar proteins and the denaturation and solubilisation of connective tissue (collagen). At around 50&#176;C myosin (45% to 50% of the myofibrillar proteins) denatures, which results in a substantial increase in cook loss and reduction in water holding capacity. At around 60&#176;C collagen (main connective tissue protein) denatures, which results in a substantial increase in tenderness and increase in cook loss. This is because as the collagen denatures it loses it mechanical strength (increase in tenderness) and can no longer support its own structure, and causes it to contract. This contraction causes fluid within the meat and cook loss caused by the denaturation of myosin to be expelled from the meat by compressive forces (squeezed out). At around 70&#176;C actomyosin (22% of the myofibrillar proteins) denatures. This results in a substantial increase in the cook loss and firming of the meat. The increase in cook loss or decrease in water holding capacity that occurs with myofibrillar protein denaturation is due to the fact that when these proteins denature and aggregate their ability to bind water is greatly reduced. From the results of the cooking regime trials it is recommended that for functional property considerations that during the cooking of further processed meat products (i.e. ready meal applications) a meat temperature of 62&#176;C should be aimed for, for the slowest heating region during cooking (usually the centre). This is because it has been identified that a cooking temperature of 65&#176;C should not be exceeded otherwise detrimental effects can occur to the functional properties of the cooked meat. For health concerns a 7D bacterial death reduction has to be achieved. This means that for a cooking temperature of 62&#176;C the meat has to be held at this temperature for at least 5 minutes. Therefore the total cooking time would be the time needed to heat all the meat to 62&#176;C plus 5 minutes to ensure a safe product. The heating or cooking system employed should also ensure that a minimal amount of the meat is heated above 65&#176;C. This can be easily achieved by minimising the external cooking temperature, but long cooking times will result. An industrial cooking process will be a compromise between the cost associated with longer residence time and product functionality. As mentioned earlier another way to add value is to supply nutritional information for selected cuts. Consequentially one of the objectives of this project was to provide some nutritional information for selected meat cuts. Though the primary objective of this part of the project was to develop a method for producing the needed information, so that Richmond N.Z. Ltd. can develop further information on an as needs basis. The nutritional characteristics of a number of export lamb cuts from the saddle region has also been investigated and a method devised to allow further characterisation of other cuts. The method involves breaking down a standard cut into its constituent components (e.g. Frenched rack consists of loin eye, fat cap, intercostals and fatty tissue). The constituent components are tested for their nutritional properties. The frenched rack nutritional properties are calculated from the nutritional properties of the constituents components and the yield data (percentage of each constituent component within a frenched rack) for frenched racks. This method allowed the identification of the main sources of variation for nutritional characteristics. These differences were found to be caused by the lean to fat ratio, not nutritional differences in lean tissue from the same region of lamb (i.e. loin eye and tenderloin very similar nutritionally). The difference in lean to fat ration also accounts for the variation between grades (i.e. PX grade lamb cuts have a higher fat content than YX grade lamb cuts due to PX grade cuts having a higher percentage fat tissue in their cuts). The cuts characterised were the shortloin section (whole section or chop), rack section (whole section or chop), 75mm racks frenched 25mm, boneless loin and tenderloin for both PX and YX grade lamb. The method will be applicable to other regions of lamb (i.e. hindquarter and forequarter) for which nutritional information already exists, but for which yielding data will have to be collected. The method would also be applicable to other species such as beef and venison, but both nutritional data for constituent components and yielding data would have to be collected.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Infraspinatus</field><field name="subject">Triceps Brachi Longhead</field><field name="subject">ready meals</field><field name="subject">cooked meat</field><field name="subject">protein denaturation</field><field name="subject">nutritional properties</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290103 Food processing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/895</field></doc><doc><field name="title">General biology and reproductive fitness of Tasmanian lacewing, Micromus tasmaniae Walker : a thesis presented in partial fulfllment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Plant Protection at the Institute of Natural Resources, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Yadav, Anand</field><field name="description">Tasmanian lacewing, Micromus tasmaniae Walker, is an important predator of a number of economically important pests such as aphids. This study was conducted to investigate some aspects of general biology and factors affecting the reproductive fitness of this species Emergence of M. tasmaniae peaked 3 h before light off and there was no significant difference in emergence patterns between males and females. Males became sexually mature earlier than females. Mating success significantly increased from the first to the eleventh hour after lights on. Predation, development and oviposition of M. tasmaniae were affected when reared under different photoperiods [i.e. 24:0, 16:8, 12:12, 0:24 h (light:dark)]. Results indicate that no individuals entered diapause at either an immature or adult stage. M. tasmaniae larvae could feed in both the photophase and scotophase and late instar larvae consumed significantly more aphids than early instar larvae. M. tasmaniae reared at 16:8 h developed faster and had lower mortality, heavier adult body weight and higher reproductive output in terms of fecundity and fertility rate. Therefore, mass-rearing programmes are recommended to be carried out at 16:8 h to obtain the higher quality of individuals and faster increase of populations. The larger-the better theory predicts that the reproductive fitness is positively linearly associated with body size or weight. However, the body weight of female M. tasmaniae had no effect on the reproductive fitness in terms of fecundity, fertility, fertility rate, oviposition period and longevity. The male body weight may contribute to the population growth of M. tasmaniae as the average females that mated with average or heavy males had significantly higher fecundity, fertility and fertility rate and longer reproductive period. These results suggest that development of any control method that should selectively mass-produce heavy and average individuals in the laboratory would help increasing M. tasmaniae quality and populations. M. tasmaniae is a polygamous species. Results indicate that female remating either with the same or different males was crucial for maximizing their reproductive success. Males could inseminate up to eight females and father about one thousand offspring during their life span.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tasmanian lacewing</field><field name="subject">Micromus tasmaniae</field><field name="subject">pest predators</field><field name="subject">plant protection</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300300 Horticulture::300303 Plant protection (pests, diseases and weeds)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1029</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Un i form "consisting of one" : a written component presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Design at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Clement, Julie</field><field name="description">Uni form is an exploration into the act of getting dressed.

This extends into how these objects proliferate within our culture and the way in which the passing of History impacts on the way we view them and as a consequence ourselves as individuals and as a group. Identity is then passed on through generations through the act of storytelling, and this process is integral to this research paper. This is also a personal journey, taking place in varying sites, from a rusting car hulk in a back yard in North Canterbury, to a University in Wellington and another rusted car, which has gone through a strange restoration. The Morris Minor has been embraced as a narcissistic object that I have chosen to double in order to explore my individual and wider national cultural history and identity. One of the key themes of this inherited identity is largely based around Nostalgia for an ideal past. This ideal is a fiction, a layering of intended futures as well as a selective past. This works in the same way as the modern artistic preoccupation with gothic histories, but instead of a positive ideal we have the creation of a basement of horrors that lurks beneath the surface. Be it positivist idealism or Gothic inversion, one way of focusing on the way these fictions differ markedly from the reality of the objects existence, is to show the artifice of the stories told by enhancing the components of the story that are already exaggerated, for the Morris Minor this means getting as far away from its existence as a rusting hulk in the backyard as possible. The longing for a past that may or may not exist, is less important as existing in reality but instead for what these fictions supply in their retelling. The concept of the Uncanny is integral to this retelling of memory, in that through a memories reanimation it can only approximate the original event leaving gaps for circumspection and invention. This retelling necessitates a reorientation in the relationship between the teller of the tale and the listener and between the viewer and the object viewed. The research culminates in the alteration of a Morris Minor to appear as one continuous surface. The intention of which is to engage with the differing versions of the objects past through taking an active part in its reconstruction as artwork with the aim of reassessment not only of my individual approach to the object but also the viewers.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Morris Minor</field><field name="subject">Cultural artifacts</field><field name="subject">New Zealand culture</field><field name="subject">Fine arts</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410200 Visual Arts and Crafts Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1325</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evolution in a marine gastropod : rocks, clocks, DNA and diversity : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Evolutionary Biology</field><field name="creator">Hills, Simon Francis Kahu</field><field name="description">Comprehensive integration of paleontological and molecular data remains a sought-after goal of evolutionary research. This thesis presents a dataset unlike any previously studied to document changes over time in the evolutionary history of the New Zealand marine mollusc genus Alcithoe. In order to study evolutionary relationships in the Alcithoe, DNA sequence of approximately 8Kb of mitochondrial DNA was generated using universal and newly developed PCR primers. The gene composition of the resulting sequences has been thoroughly analysed, using a novel splits-based approach, to gain a clear understanding of the underlying phylogenetic signals in the data. Refinement of the phylogeny was achieved by considering subsets of both the taxa and genes. Taking these analyses into account the combined a robust phylogeny for the Alcithoe is presented for use in subsequent analyses. The Alcithoe genus includes species that are exemplars of the problem of correctly identifying species by morphological traits, in both the living and extinct taxa. Taxonomic assignments were explored in a population level analysis of the highly morphologically variable species A. wilsonae. Analyses revealed that the various recognised forms of A. wilsonae are genetically indistinguishable and that the previously recognised species A. knoxi is a synonym of A. wilsonae. This result has significant implications for the interpretation of the paleontological data, as A. knoxi specimens are known from the Tongaporutuan stage (10.92 &#8211; 6.5 Ma) of the New Zealand geological timescale. Therefore, this finding also has implications on the assignment of calibration data in molecular clock analysis. To ensure accurate estimation of divergence times and rates of molecular evolution, extensive explorations of parameter space in molecular-clock analyses were carried out. These analyses identified the most appropriate models and calibration settings for Alcithoe the dataset. The fossil data used to calibrate this analysis is amongst the most robust applied to molecular clock analyses to date. Statistical sampling uncertainty derived from the paleontological data was included in the calculation of prior distributions. Divergence dates inferred for the extant Alcithoe are largely consistent with the fossil record. However, the root of the tree was consistently inferred to be younger then expected. Rates of evolution in the species of Alcithoe included in this analysis are broadly consistent. However, some small rate differences are observed in some branches, for example, Alcithoe fusus appears to have a faster rate then the rest of the genus. This rate increase is the likely cause of topological inconsistencies observed for four closely related taxa, including A. fusus, and indicates that slight rate differences can cause phylogenetic instability when small genetic distances are involved. Direct comparison of diversification rates between the molecular and paleontological data for the Alcithoe illustrated that modern Alcithoe species have origins that are around 13 millions years younger then the oldest known Alcithoe fossils. The suggestion that A. fusus is descended from a series of fossil Leporemax species is directly contradicted by the molecular tree. In light of the molecular evidence this result highlights the problem of morphological convergence in the interpretation of fossil Alcithoe species. Comparison of the molecular and paleontological datasets was difficult for absolute speciation and extinction rates, as errors inherent to each dataset led to disparate estimates. For example, the fossil record clearly fails to record most recent speciation events observed in the molecular phylogeny, but the molecular data cannot sufficiently account for the amount of extinction evident in the fossil record. It is clear that the assumption of a constant and equal probability of speciation and extinction for all lineages is violated in the Alcithoe. However, the general long-term trends estimated for both datasets are concordant, and demonstrate an increase in both speciation and extinction rates over the Cenozoic era. The research described in this thesis represents significant progress toward the goal of more thorough integration of molecular and paleontological in the study of evolution. I have shown that reconciliation of molecular and paleontological data is not only possible, but can substantially improve the resulting interpretation of evolution. This study is the broadest analysis of the evolution in a single genus using combined molecular and paleontological data that the author is currently aware of. It illustrates the advantage of having quality paleontological data to compare to emerging molecular data, and how the molecular data can further inform the paleontological data. Furthermore, it adds support to the shift in perspective from an adversarial to a complementary approach to the consideration of molecular and paleontological data. This thesis is a comprehensive first step in the synthesis of molecular and paleontological data in the study of evolution of the New Zealand mollusc fauna, and alludes to many promising avenues for future study.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Alcithoe</field><field name="subject">Gastropod phylogenetics</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270200 Genetics::270208 Molecular evolution</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1628</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Positive airway pressure for obstructive sleep apnoea : systematic evaluation versus clinical and technological drift : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Public Health at Massey University, Wellington Campus, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Marshall, Nathaniel Stuart</field><field name="description">Content removed due to copyright restrictions: Marshall, N.

While various associations have been drawn or hypothesised between specific cultural factors and a more favourable outcome, attention has also frequently been drawn to the methodological, analytic and diagnostic inadequacies of these studies. The work for this thesis was undertaken with these criticisms in mind and also in part as a counter to the perceived inadequacies of a solely bio-medical approach to psychopathology. The specific purpose of the research was to assess the role that culture plays in the construction and experience of both psychological well-being and psychopathology in a "traditional" society in Sarawak, Malaysia. There was an equal concern to ascertain and examine the ways in which explanations and understandings about identity, illness and wellness differ from current western models and approaches and how they are realised and lived out in the experience of individuals. The ethnographic data was collected during intensive participant-observation conducted over two years in the Mukah District of Sarawak, Malaysia, a region which has a long association with the Melanau ethnic group. Drawing on the ethnographic evidence, this thesis argues that psychopathological experiences (as psychological phenomena) embody characteristics that make it possible to identify them as culturally constructed artifacts. A theory is advanced which locates the source of psychopathology within the context of human being-in-the-world and which suggests that features of the mental illness experience such as chronicity and stigma are historically and culturally constructed within the illness concept itself. The argument draws on the theory and insights of existentialism, phenomenology. Turner's ritual theory, and Jung's concept of the shadow, extended to include a concept of the cultural shadow. It concludes that a failure to take account of the cultural dimensions of mental illness may also result in a failure to perceive not only the source of our psychopathologies but also a solution.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mental illness</field><field name="subject">Melanau (Malaysian people)</field><field name="subject">Health and hygiene</field><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="subject">Social life and customs</field><field name="subject">Social anthropology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370300 Anthropology::370302 Social and cultural anthropology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1675</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Prediction of peoples' intentions and actual consumption of functional foods in Palmerston North: a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Food Technology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Sukboonyasatit, Duljira</field><field name="description">Functional foods are a growing category in the food market, but little is known about New Zealanders&#8217; views or use of them. A study was carried out in Palmerston North over the period 2005-2006 to investigate determinants of functional food use. The study had two stages: firstly focus groups (5 focus groups, n=42) to understand more of the consumer&#8217;s perspective, and then a detailed consumer survey. The questionnaire was based on the theory of Planned Behaviour (TBP), the Health Belief Model (HBM) and information gathered from the focus groups. The results from the study showed that participants knew little about the functional food concept. There was also a strong indication of scepticism, with people concerned about adequate dosage and efficacy. Dietary supplements were seen as a way to achieve the benefit without some of the barriers associated with functional foods. Therefore, a significant proportion of the respondents (&gt;30%) preferred to have the functional ingredients in pill form. Other respondents preferred to have functional ingredients delivered in a staple food that was consumed on a daily basis and the most preferred food vehicle was a drink. Nutrition and health were ranked highest as influencers of food choice, with taste and cost also ranked as important. Women were more likely than men to identify nutrition and health as their main influence. An ANOVA model was used to establish the relationships between socio-demographics, health condition and health behaviour and the five attitudes factors (from exploratory factor analysis). No single attitude factor was significantly correlated with all the sociodemographic variables: women had less positive attitudes towards functional foods in general, were more likely to be sceptical and had less belief in the efficacy of functional foods. While more educated respondents considered functional foods to have less personal benefit, and those with lower income had less confidence in their own ability to consume functional foods. Talking to others about functional foods was found to be significantly negatively correlated with all attitude dimensions and intentions indicating that when people talk to others that their views about functional foods become more negative. In addition, people who Prediction of peoples&#8217; intentions and actual consumption of functional foods in Palmerston North currently used dietary supplements had less positive attitudes and lower intentions to consume functional foods in general. Those who had existing CHD or arthritis symptoms had lower intentions than others to consume functional foods directed towards these diseases. Exploratory factor analysis also identified two factors related to intention to consume functional foods; one for functional foods in general and another for disease (arthritis and CHD) functional foods. Women had less intention to consume functional foods in general, while older adults were more likely to intend to consumer disease specific functional foods. A series of models were evaluated by using structural equation modelling to see how well they could predict peoples&#8217; intentions to purchase and their actual purchase of functional foods in general, as well as disease specific functional foods. The analysis showed that the TPB model (R2=57%) and a modified TPB (R2=61%) better predicted peoples&#8217; intention to consume general functional foods than the theory of reasoned action model (R2=55%). However, a model that included the modified TPB model plus 2 constructs (perceived benefits, perceived barriers) from the health belief model was best of all (R2=72%) at predicting peoples&#8217; intention to consume general functional foods. Perceived barriers were the most influential predictor of intention (barriers included uncertainty about efficacy and dose; surprisingly taste and cost were not significant predictors, but this was probably due to the fact these constructs were not explored as multi-dimensional constructs. The models were poor at predicting intentions to consume specific functional foods, but the addition of perceived susceptibility and perceived severity improved prediction of intentions towards anti-CHD functional foods (R2 = 43%). Perceived susceptibility, but not perceived severity, improved prediction of intention to consumer anti arthritis functional foods (R2=37%). The research suggests that attitudes towards the concept of functional foods are generally positive, but scepticism is evident. Functional foods are not necessarily seen as &#8216;healthy&#8217;, nor are they considered a way to treat existing conditions. Thus careful marketing will be required to target product and messages to relevant segments of the market.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Healthy food consumption</field><field name="subject">Nutrition</field><field name="subject">Attitudes to food</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321205 Nutrition and dietetics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1676</field></doc><doc><field name="title">He p&#257;taka momo-k&#333;rero, he kete momo k&#299;peha : M&#257;ori text types and figures of speech : he kaupapa i tuhia m&#333; te Tohu Kairangi, Te P&#363;tahi-&#257;-Toi, Te Kunenga ki P&#363;huroa, Papaioea, Aotearoa</field><field name="creator">Joseph, Darryn James</field><field name="description">I roto i ng&#257; toru ngahuru tau kua tupu haere ng&#257; kaupapa m&#257;tauranga m&#333; te reo M&#257;ori mai i te k&#333;hanga reo, ki te kura kaupapa M&#257;ori, ki te whare kura tae atu ki ng&#257; whare w&#257;nanga M&#257;ori.

It is caused by infection with pathogenic Leptopsira species. Leptospirosis encompasses a wide spectrum of clinical or subclinical disease in both humans and animals. In New Zealand (NZ), leptospirosis is considered to be the most important occupational zoonosis. Livestock farming plays an important role as a major occupational risk factor for human leptospirosis and farmed deer is one of the contributing factors. Commercial farming of deer began in NZ in the early 1970s. It remains the world&#8217;s largest and most advanced deer farming industry. Leptospirosis in farmed deer can cause illness and possibly sub-clinical production losses. Farmed deer also play an important role in the transmission of leptospirosis by shedding the organisms in their urine, putting both other animals and humans at risk. Leptospira serovars Hardjobovis and Pomona are the most commonly found serovars in this stock group. The first substantial case report of leptospirosis in farmed deer was in the 1980s but it was not until 2006 that a substantial epidemiological study of this disease in farmed deer was reported. The purpose of this research was to improve and extend current knowledge on the epidemiology of leptospirosis on mixedspecies deer farms, to develop and validate a novel molecular diagnostic tool and to enhance understanding of control measures and their outcomes by means of vaccination. A pilot longitudinal seroprevalence survey of leptospirosis on mixed-species deer farms was conducted. Results from this study revealed that leptospiral infection averaged 70% in all species on mixed-species farms in the lower North Island of NZ. Co-grazing with infected sheep and/or cattle was positively associated with deer herd serological status to both serovars Hardjobovis and Pomona which suggests the possibility of inter-species transmission. Results from this study justify further investigation of leptospirosis on mixedspecies farm at the national level. A collaborative study between Massey University and the WHO/FAO/OIE reference laboratory for leptospirosis in Brisbane to investigate for exotic serovars in farmed deer revealed seropositivity to Arborea which has never been found before in NZ. Attempts to isolate Arborea from kidney samples of farmed deer were unsuccessful and require further investigation. Real-time PCR assay was developed and validated against culture as the gold standard for use on deer kidney tissue and urine as a research and diagnostic tool for determining infection, carrier and shedding status of deer. This research revealed that the real-time PCR assay was highly sensitive (sensitivity: 85% for kidney and 96.7% for urine) and specific (specificity: 99.2% for kidney and 100% for urine). It is a useful tool for the rapid and cost-effective detection of pathogenic leptospires in clinical samples. It can also be used to quantify the concentration of leptospires from clinical samples and identify the likely infecting serovar in NZ when adjunct with a DNA sequencing technique. Vaccination control for leptospirosis has proven to be efficacious and likely to be costeffective. Present research has determined the effect of a commercial bivalent leptospiral vaccine (Leptavoid-2, Intervet/Schering-Plough Animal Health Limited, NZ) on leptospiral shedding, growth and reproduction of farmed deer under NZ pastoral conditions. The study was designed to simulate an infection-free herd scenario followed by exposure to natural challenge. Results have shown the potential of vaccine to improve mean weight gain (up to 6.5 kg) and weaning rate (average 6.9%) in infected herds and prevent urinary shedding after natural challenge with Hardjobovis. It also provides the first evidence of adverse subclinical effects on deer production by Hardjobovis alone. A pilot study to investigate the presence and localisation of pathogenic Leptospira in the uterus and foetus of female deer revealed evidence of a foetal infection using real-time PCR. This finding suggests a possible explanation for effects of leptospiral infection on NZ farmed deer reproduction. However, further study is required to justify this proposition. This research has contributed significantly to understanding of epidemiology of leptospirosis in NZ farmed deer, providing objective data to assist producers in decision-making on leptospirosis control. Furthermore, this study has made available a valuable diagnostic resource for future leptospirosis studies, and has provided direction for future research into leptospirosis on farmed deer and mixed-species farms.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hardjo-bovis</field><field name="subject">Pomona</field><field name="subject">Leptospiral infection</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300500 Veterinary Medicine::300503 Epidemiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1678</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Maori voices in the construction of indigenous models of counselling theory and practice : a thesis completed in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Psychology at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Love, Catherine Maarie Amohia</field><field name="description">Irregular pagination: Page numbers 572 to 582 &amp; 755 missing, 754 is not numbered</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Counselling</field><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380107 Health, clinical and counselling psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1682</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Co-production in health management : an evaluation of Knowing the People Planning : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the dgree of Doctor of Philosophy in Management at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Welsh, Barry Donald</field><field name="description">Treating chronic health conditions consumes a significant portion of the health care resource. Two&#8211;thirds of UK hospital admissions consist of people with chronic conditions (Singh, 2005). To date, health management has tended to focus on service redesign, rather than focusing on the patients, as a way to facilitate improved outcomes and control costs. Typically, these management approaches are premised on the patient as a consumer/end user. An alternative view to the patient being a consumer is that of the patient being a co&#8211;producer of the service. Co&#8211;production recognises the client (patient) as a resource, in that value cannot easily be created or delivered, unless the patient actively contributes to the service (Alford, 1998). Patients gain health value when they are well and are independent of the health care system and its costs. Health care organisations gain economic value, when chronic patients require less health care. This thesis examines co&#8211;production, in the context of contemporary patient involvement and heath services management. &#8216;Knowing the People Planning&#8217; (KPP), an innovative health management method, is evaluated for its patient management co&#8211;production potential. KPP is based on ten key features of service provision. Four of the key features relate to the patient, whilst the remaining six features relate to the organisation. It is the management of these patient and organisation features that better facilitates chronic long-term mental health patients as co&#8211;producers. The empirical findings, from this evaluation of KPP provide evidence for the efficacy of co&#8211;productive health management theory and practice. Patient health value and health care organisation economic value are created, when both the organisation and the patient co&#8211;produce the health service. KPP was initially implemented by eight of New Zealand&#8217;s 21 District Health Boards. Socio-ecological action research methodology was used to evaluate KPP &#8212; by taking a &#8216;people-in-environments&#8217; approach. The evaluation covers fourteen action research cycles for 2,021 chronic long-term patients over four years. Measurements include the amount of time these long-term patients spent in hospital and employment rates. The integration of the action research cycles, using the socio-ecological method supported the generation of (what I have called) &#8216;co&#8211;productive health management theory&#8217;. Analyses of secondary data, across organisational and patient domains, supplement the action research findings, in order to assess for confounding factors. The organisation outcomes relate to costs and staff turnover. Patient outcomes relate to service utilisation measures, for approximately 60,000 adult patients per year, who access New Zealand&#8217;s secondary mental health services. A pivotal finding of this research was that, as the rate of patients with treatment plans increased from 50% to 90%, inpatient bed use decreased by 26%. However, increased funding for mental health services had only a minor impact on decreasing inpatient bed use. Patient employment rates increased, whilst the number of patients who required access to general practitioners and changes to their housing situation, decreased. The patient management co&#8211;production view offers a significant opportunity for health care managers and researchers to significantly improve both patient and organisation value. Co&#8211;production views the patient as a resource, who contributes to her/his health outcome, rather than a person who simply consumes services. The better patients can co&#8211;produce their health outcome the better their health, and the lower their demand for health services.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chronic health management</field><field name="subject">Patient involvement</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321215 Health care administration</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1680</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Automatisation of programming of a PLC code : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements of the degree of  Masters of Engineering in Mechatronics</field><field name="creator">Mastilovich, Nikola</field><field name="description">Appendix D, CD content can be found with print thesis held at Turitea library, Palmerston North.

Change in colour perception with changing light conditions induce errors that may escape a user's awareness. Colour constancy algorithms are based on inferring light properties (usually the white point) to correct colour. Other attempts using more data for colour correction   such as (ICC based) colour management   characterise a capturing device under given conditions through an input device pro le. This pro le can be applied to correct for deviating colour perception. But this pro le is only valid for the speci c conditions at the time of the characterisation, but fails with changes in light. This research presents a solution to the problem of long time observations with changes in the scene's illumination for common natural (overcast or clear, blue sky) and arti cial sources (incandescent or  uorescent lamps). Colour measurements for colour based reasoning need to be represented in a robustly de ned way. One such suitable and well de ned description is given by the CIE LAB colour space, a device-independent, visually linearised colour description. Colour transformations using ICC pro le are also based on CIE colour descriptions. Therefore, also the corrective colour processing has been based on ICC based colour management. To verify the viability of CIE LAB based corrective colour processing colour constancy algorithms (White Patch Retinex and Grey World Assumption) have been modi ed to operate on L a b  colour tuples. Results were compared visually and numerically (using colour indexing) against those using the same algorithms operating on RGB colour tuples. We can take advantage of the fact that we are dealing with image streams over time, adding another dimension usable for analysis. A solution to the problem of slowly changing light conditions in scenes with a static camera perspective is presented. It takes advantage of the small (frame-to-frame) changes in appearance of colour within the scene over time. Reoccurring objects or (background) areas of the scene are tracked to gather data points for an analysis. As a result, a suitable colour space distortion model has been devised through a  rst order Taylor approximation (a ne transformation). By performing a multidimensional linear regression analysis on the tracked data points, parameterisations for the a ne transformations were derived. Finally, the device pro le is updated by amalgamating the corrections from the model into the ICC pro le for a single, comprehensive transformation. Following applications of the ICC based colour pro les are very fast and can be used in real-time with the camera's capturing frame rate (for current normal web cameras and low spec desktop computers). As light conditions usually change on a much slower time scale than the capturing rate of a camera, the computationally expensive pro le adaptation generally showed to be usable for many frames. The goal was to set out and  nd a solution for consistent colour capturing using digital cameras, which is capable of coping with changing light conditions. Theoretical backgrounds and strategies for such a system have been devised and implemented successfully.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer colour image processing</field><field name="subject">Colour perception</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280200 Artificial Intelligence and Signal and Image Processing::280208 Computer vision</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1683</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing an integrated system for automated picking and sorting using an ABB flexpicker robot : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements of the degree of Master of Engineering in Mechatronics at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Wu, Hongda</field><field name="description">Content on CD can be found with print thesis held at Turitea library, Palmerston North.

This will involve a discussion of debates surrounding the political efficacy of postmodern narrative forms. I will consider Mitchell&#8217;s prolific use of intertextual and intratextual allusion and his mimicry of a wide range of narrative modes and genres. These techniques, along with the complex structural iterations in the novel and the &#8216;recurrence&#8217; of characters between its parts, appear to reinforce a thematic concern with the interconnectedness &#8212; indeed, the repetition &#8212; of human activity, through time and a fatalistic conception of being that draws on two central Nietzschean notions, eternal recurrence and the will to power. The vision of humanity and human relations of power that is expressed within Cloud Atlas is open to extended analysis in Foucauldian terms. Against this apparently nihilistic backdrop, Mitchell appears to promote a notion of (albeit limited) individual agency and the capacity for creative narration and reinterpretation of the past as a means to devise new &#8216;truths&#8217; and explore new &#8216;meanings&#8217; for the present and the future. I will explore the ways in which Mitchell&#8217;s metafictional self-reflexivity (and that of his protagonists), offers a vision of hope and political agency that counters the apparent (Nietzschean) fatalism of the novel.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">David Mitchell</field><field name="subject">Cloud atlas</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420200 Literature Studies::420204 British and Irish</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1685</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of systematic behavioural observation to quantify ongoing cognitive activity limitations after brain injury : a dissertation presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Psychology at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Lewis, Mark</field><field name="description">One of the goals of cognitive rehabilitation following traumatic brain injury is to help people perform everyday tasks. However, options for the rigorous assessment of everyday cognitive effectiveness after rehabilitation are limited. Performance on neuropsychological tests is only moderately correlated with everyday functioning, while previous measures of everyday functioning include only fairly general estimates of overall cognitive functioning. The aim of the current study was to develop an ecologically valid measure that captured a number of subdomains of executive functioning, using systematic behavioural observation of an everyday task. The initial phase of the research involved identifying an everyday task that was sufficiently complex to ensure that executive functioning was utilised in the completion of the task. Participants with traumatic brain injury were then asked to prepare chocolate brownies, using a recipe provided, and a hot drink. Participants were allowed to use any compensatory strategy to help complete the task. Participant performance was directly observed by an examiner and videotaped for subsequent inter-rater reliability. Two independent raters assessed nine components of executive functioning. During this phase, the examiner manuals were modified improving inter-rater reliability. The final version of the measure was then trialled with participants with and without traumatic brain injury. Final inter-rater reliability indicated the approach had merit. Significant and moderate correlations were found between traditional measures of executive functioning and the everyday task. This study employed systematic behavioural observation to obtain fine-grained information regarding a person&#8217;s cognitive functioning. With further development, this approach may prove useful for targeting and monitoring specific functional difficulties during cognitive rehabilitation.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">traumatic brain injury</field><field name="subject">Brain injured patients</field><field name="subject">Behavioural assessment</field><field name="subject">Cognitive limitations</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380107 Health, clinical and counselling psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1686</field></doc><doc><field name="title">To investigate the health status and health promotion activities among Chinese migrant women in Hong Kong</field><field name="creator">CHOW, Mei Kuen</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy(PhD)</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chinese migrant women</field><field name="subject">health status</field><field name="subject">health promotion</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/6616</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multidimensional viscous flows at superorbital speeds</field><field name="creator">Silvester, Todd</field><field name="description">A combined experimental and numerical study of multidimensional viscous flows at speeds exceeding 8 km/s is reported. Experiments were performed in the X3 superorbital expansion tube with air and nitrogen test flows at a Mach number and total enthalpy of 10 and 40 MJ/kg, respectively. Laminar skin friction, heat flux and pressure measurements were obtained at regular intervals along one wall of a rectangular duct. The spatial resolution of the transducers was chosen to capture the multidimensional flow phenomena within the duct. Quasi-steady flow periods were established along the entire length of the duct in the test times offered by the expansion tube. Direct skin friction measurements were accomplished through the use of &#145;in house&#146; acceleration compensated transducers. The successful operation of these skin friction transducers in a high performance expansion tube was demonstrated. Furthermore, the systematic uncertainty in measured shear stress was significantly reduced with the development of a new pressure calibration technique. For the conditions tested, Reynolds analogy was shown to be valid to within experimental uncertainty. The experimental data was in excellent agreement with numerical estimates. Three-dimensional numerical simulations of the diverging duct revealed that the flowfield structure in the vicinity of the corners differs from that of an unbounded corner or a constant area duct. Real gas effects other than those present in the residual nonequilibrium levels of freestream dissociation were negligible for the conditions tested. A computational study of two waverider configurations recently tested in the X3 superorbital expansion tube was conducted to assist in the interpretation of past results. The off-design aerodynamic performance was also analyzed and showed that blunting the leading edges dramatically degraded the performance by increasing drag and decreasing lift for the conditions considered.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">780102 Physical sciences</field><field name="subject">290207 Satellite, Space Vehicle and Missile Design</field><field name="subject">viscous flows</field><field name="subject">expansion tubes</field><field name="subject">hypervelocity</field><field name="subject">skin friction</field><field name="subject">Reynolds analogy</field><field name="subject">CFD</field><field name="subject">real gas effects</field><field name="subject">multidimensional flows</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158032</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using group learning to promote deep learning, life skills and integration in veterinary science</field><field name="creator">Mills, Paul Christian</field><field name="description">A research-based model of Group Project Work was introduced to encourage deep learning in second-year students enrolled in the School of Veterinary Science (SVS) at The University of Queensland (UQ). The model was developed in response to the concern that students may avoid deep learning strategies in pre-clinical courses of the program particularly if there is little perceived relevance to their chosen career as a veterinary surgeon. The impetus for the development and introduction of Group Project Work was provided by concerns that students may be using superficial learning techniques due to the heavy content and perceived lack of relevance of pre-clinical courses. This was exemplified in the secondyear course, Musculoskeletal Structure and Function, where knowledge taught by traditional approaches did not appear to be satisfactorily retained in later courses of pathology and surgery. It was also apparent that students tended to form small groups to facilitate understanding. However, the traditional approach to structured group learning in medicallyorientated programs involved Problem-Based Learning (PBL) which required substantial resources and presented some concerns about the way students learned and were supported in solving problems. As a result of these concerns, a search of the literature on group learning was conducted. During this research, it was also realised that interactions between students undertaking group learning could engender the development of life skills, such as decision making, teamwork, problem solving and communication skills. These skills have traditionally been considered difficult to 'teach' yet appear to be essential to the successful transition to professional life. The specific structure and formation of groups towards the model of Group Project Work was therefore developed to maximise the group dynamics that would encourage life skills in individual group members. It was understood that group learning was not a novel concept but the specifics of the model, particularly group size and selection of group members, were critical to its success in terms of deep learning and the development of life skills. The small group size of four to five students was substantially lower than PBL groups commonly used in veterinary curricula. More importantly, engineering of group membership based on previous achievement exposed students to differing viewpoints and motivation and, importantly, removed the comfort zone of familiar peer support. This approach was analogous to initial entry into clinical practice and had also been shown to maximise group dynamics. Based on the literature, a model of Group Project Work was developed. An important aspect of model development was to therefore link course content to 'real life' aspects of veterinary clinical practice, which will drive motivation and learning. The model was also developed within the constraints of large class sizes and limited resources in terms of staff and facilities. A highly successful outcome was the integration of students within each cohort, particularly international students. The resultant collegiate atmosphere appeared to support students within each year and motivate appropriate learning strategies. Several iterations of the model have now been implemented with considerable success. Reflections on the learning from this experience have led to enhanced professional knowledge on the application of group work in large veterinary science cohorts and outcomes have been shared with the wider professional community through conference presentations and a number of publications in educational journals. This thesis begins by describing the context of Group Project Work and the concerns that provided the catalyst for this project. A review of the literature consulted then explains the basis of the model that was developed and supports the key features incorporated. Five significant publications arising from the Group Project Work experience comprise the body of this thesis. These include: 1. Group Project Work with Undergraduate Veterinary Science Students.

The theory of Aboriginalism is critiqued and interrogated in this thesis in relation to Indigenous Australian women, performance, and race. This thesis addresses the complex and contradictory ways that Aboriginalist discourse fixes non-Indigenous expectations of Indigenous Australian performance, gender, and race by exploring how the performers themselves work within and against these Aboriginalist constructions through their music. One of the immediate effects of Aboriginalism is that it silences Indigenous Australians. In academic discourse and popular media, the voices of Indigenous women who perform contemporary music are rarely heard and often overlooked or ignored. This thesis aims to redress and understand this gender imbalance by focusing on Indigenous women and their contemporary music and illustrate how Indigenous Australian women performers are enacting new types of agency to negotiate their way through, around, and over one-dimensional Aboriginalist constructions of themselves to self-define more positive and diverse identities as Indigenous Australian women. This thesis is divided into four parts. Part One (Chapters One, Two, and Three) provides necessary background to the study. Chapter One introduces the topic and poses research questions in relation to Aboriginalism, Indigenous women, and contemporary performance. Chapter Two examines a number of themes which emerge in the existing literature relating to Indigenous Australian musicians performing contemporary music. Chapter Three locates Indigenous Australian women in this academic discourse and explores some possible reasons for the increasing number of contemporary music recordings by Indigenous Australian women since the 1990s. Part Two (Chapters Four, Five, and Six) positions this study theoretically and methodologically. Chapter Four outlines the theoretical framework that informs this project while Chapter Five discusses the methodological issues and challenges I faced throughout the research process. Chapter Six introduces the Indigenous women performers who took part in this study. This chapter uses the literary convention of a &#147;playlet&#148; by weaving together comments of Indigenous Australian women performers from one-on-one interviews I conducted, media excerpts about the performers, as well as my own questions and comments into a conversation which tells a story about the performers&#146; backgrounds, experiences, albums, and achievements. Part Three (Chapters Seven, Eight, and Nine) comprises the analysis chapters and examines Aboriginalism in relation to race, gender, and performance. Each of these chapters utilise theoretical discussions of Aboriginalism, excerpts from interviews with Indigenous women performers, song texts, and media representations to examine how Indigenous women perform within and against Aboriginalism. Chapter Seven focuses on how Indigenous women performers resist Aboriginalist constructs of race through performance while Chapter Eight turns the gaze to gender and Aboriginalism to explore how the performers challenge Aboriginalist representations of Indigenous women by attempting bring Indigenous women&#146;s experiences, history, and topics to the foreground through song. Chapter Nine examines the way in which Indigenous women performers steer their way through Aboriginalism in music performance by blurring musical boundaries and drawing on a diverse range of musical styles. Finally, Part Four (Chapter Ten) discusses the possibilities of moving beyond Aboriginalism and reflects on my own contribution to discourse concerning Indigenous women performers.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">410101 Music</field><field name="subject">420303 Culture, Gender, Sexuality</field><field name="subject">410104 Indigenous Performing Arts</field><field name="subject">750201 The performing arts (incl. music, theatre and dance)</field><field name="subject">751005 Communication across languages and cultures</field><field name="subject">750309 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander development and welfare</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158217</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Not blind enough: Living in the borderland called legal blindness</field><field name="creator">Omansky, Beth Fay</field><field name="description">This qualitative study explored the experiences of people categorised as legally blind. Adopting a phenomenological approach, the study gathered four life stories of three recruited participants and my own story as a legally blind person. These case studies revealed that people who are legally blind traverse a borderland between sighted and blind worlds, a position which carries with it experiences that are vastly different than both totally blind and sighted people. Located in disability studies, the thesis examined the experience of legal blindness in a unique way, cross-fertilising the best elements of an American cultural studies approach with a British social model of disability. The British social model, rooted in sociological materialist analysis, is often positioned by its proponents as at odds with the United States humanities-based cultural or minority model of disability. This thesis sought to discover if a bridge could be built between the two models to allow for several theoretical analyses with the higher goal of understanding both phenomenological and social aspects of borderland blindness. Another original aspect of this study is the use of the postmodern metaphor &#147;borderland&#148; to carve out a geographical space unique to legal blindness -- a territory between sightedness and blindness where residents are pressed to migrate back and forth across its borders from situation to situation. The research developed a combination of social constructionism, materialism, postmodernism, and existential phenomenology, while aiming to meet the goals of emancipatory disability research. Participants told their stories in their own words, they chose what was important for us to know about them, and they maintained control over their stories throughout the research and write-up processes. The study was interested in how society treats blind people, and was also keen to know what meaning blind people made of such treatment. Its design strayed from orthodox disability studies research in that it wanted to learn and record the embodied experience of legal blindness as well as blindness identity formation. However, to examine physical aspects of blindness did not imply approval of ocularcentric medical model practices; both the American and British social models have at their foundations critical analyses of medicine&#146;s control over the lives of disabled people. While this study utilised social constructionism as a primary method of analysis, it simultaneously challenged the binary of essentialism/social constructionism because impairment, disablement, and disability are complex and do not all fit into either stance. The experience of impairment is integral to understanding the lived experience of blindness. Further, the study rejected the blindness/sightedness binary which positions blindness as &#145;lack&#146; (Michalko, 1999), and instead, examined borderland blindness as a medically and legally constructed social category that is neither better nor worse than &#145;normal&#146; sight and vision, but is merely neutral difference. The research was conducted from an &#145;insider&#146; position because I wanted to learn how other legally blind people experience life in the borderland; and, in the tradition of disability studies and disability activism, I consider this work a political act -- &#147;a commitment to openly partisan inquiry&#148; (Barnes and Mercer, 2004). I was curious to explore the strengths, weaknesses, and complexities of conducting research as an &#147;insider&#148; &#150; as a member of the population of research interest. Another feature of this study was the application of Rogerian techniques of establishing an environment in which genuineness, trust, and unconditional positive regard would flourish; this model provided a natural marriage to emancipatory life story and insider research. The research findings conclude that there is no conflict between British and American social models of disability; and further argue that the two models enhance each other in that together they provide a more holistic examination of the everyday lived experience of disabled people. Use of both models strengthened inherent weaknesses that arise when each model stands alone. Furthermore, the findings suggest that more studies about blindness concentrate on &#147;legal&#148; or borderland blindness because this population has experiences that are vastly different from both totally blind and sighted people. These differences have significant ramifications for education, rehabilitation and other human service policy and provision.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">750305 Ability and disability</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158179</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation into electricity pool price trends and forecasting for understanding the operation of the Australian national electricity market (NEM)</field><field name="creator">Sansom, Damien</field><field name="description">This thesis reports findings from a number of modern machine learning techniques applied to electricity market price forecasting. The techniques evaluated were Support Vector Machines, Boosting, Bayesian networks, neural networks and a weekly average method. All techniques were evaluated on seven day into the future forecasting of the Regional Reference (pool) Prices (RRP) for the New South Wales (NSW) region of the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM). Due to highly volatile and non-repetitive nature of the NSW RRP, all complex machine learning methods provided inferior accuracy forecasts compared to a weekly average method. The weekly average method was computationally less expensive and more transparent to the user than any of the machine learning techniques. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) was chosen for its novel application to electricity price forecasting because it is considered to be the next generation to neural networks. The structured SVM training algorithm proved more consistent and reliable than the neural network algorithm. Bayesian networks offer the adaptability of a neural network with the advantage of providing a price forecast with confidence intervals for each half-hour determined from the actual data. The SVM and Bayesian techniques were found to provide acceptable forecasts for NSW demand. An investigation of international electricity markets found that each market was unique with different market structures, regulations, network topologies and ownership regimes. Price forecasting techniques and results cannot be universally applied without careful consideration of local conditions. For instance, price data for the Spanish and Californian electricity markets were investigated and found to have significantly lower price volatility than the NSW region of the NEM. An extensive examination of the NSW RRP showed that the price exhibited no consistent long-term trend. A stationary data set could not be extracted from the price data. Thus, making forecasting unsuited to techniques using large historical data sets. The strongest pattern found for NSW prices was the weekly cycle, so a weekly average method was developed to utilise this weekly cycle. Over 25 weeks of NSW RRP from February to July 2002, the seven day into the future price forecast mean absolute error (MAE) for the SVM technique was 27.8%. The weekly average method was more accurate with an MAE of 20.6% and with a simple linear price adjustment for demand, the error was reduced to 18.1%. The price spikes and uneven distribution of prices were unsuitable for the Boosting or Bayesian network techniques.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">290901 Electrical Engineering</field><field name="subject">660301 Electricity transmission</field><field name="subject">660304 Energy systems analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158223</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physiology of the PNSB Genus Rhodobacter: Volatile Fatty Acid Metabolism and Global Metabolic Regulation</field><field name="creator">Miss Jessica Welch</field><field name="description" /><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159346</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of affect, fairness, and social identification in vertical and lateral exchange relationships</field><field name="creator">Tse, Ho-Man Herman</field><field name="description">Considerable research attention has been devoted to understanding the implications of leader-member exchange (LMX) theory over the last thirty years (see Graen &amp; Uhl-Bien, 1995, for a review). A review of research has suggested that LMX substantially influences employees' work attitudes and behaviours (e.g., see Gerstner &amp; Day, 1997; Janssen &amp; Van Yperen, 2004). Nonetheless, there is an important omission in LMX research; namely, how does LMX quality influence people outside of the dyadic relationships (Sias &amp; Jablin, 1995)? Sparrowe and Liden (1997), Liden and Sparrowe (in press) and Oh, Chung and Labianca (2004) suggest that interpersonal exchange relationships between leaders, subordinates, and coworkers are interconnected to constitute a larger social system that operates in teams and organisations. Similarly, based on a systems perspective, Graen and Uhl-Bien (1995) call for more research to understand how LMX dyadic relationships influence employees' work attitudes, behaviours and perceptions in larger collectives of workgroups. This is because LMX quality is not only influenced by, but may also influence other exchange relationships within the larger system. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that the characteristics of a dyadic relationship between a leader and a subordinate will also have implications for team member exchange (TMX), defined by Seers (1989) as the relationship quality between an individual and her or his team members (see also Sherony &amp; Green, 2002; Sias, 1996; Sias &amp; Jablin, 1995). In this thesis, therefore, my aim is to advance the research on interpersonal exchange relationships by addressing research questions that explore how vertical exchange relationships between supervisors and subordinates influence lateral exchange relationships among team members in organisations. Specifically, I have integrated social exchange theory (SET), social identity theory (SIT), emotional contagion theory (ECT), and climate research to develop and to test a multilevel model. At the individual level, I theorised that LMX quality influences individual team members' perceptions of TMX quality. I also hypothesised that social identification and affect act as cognitive and affective mechanisms that mediate the relationship between LMX quality and TMX quality. At the group level, I hypothesised that LMX differentiation fairness moderates the relationship between LMX quality and social identification, while affective climate moderates the relationship between individual team members' positive affect and TMX quality. In order to test the validity of my model, I adopted the post-positivist research position resting on a realist ontology (what is the nature of reality), an objective epistemology (the relationship between the knowledge and the inquirer), where both qualitative and quantitative methods were used to investigate the hypothesised relationships in three studies. Study 1 was an exploratory study intended to identify the nature of TMX and the role of emotions within the team member exchange relationships. Personal in-depth interviews and surveys were used to collect qualitative and quantitative data in this study. The sample for this study was 25 employees working in five different teams in a private health service provider and a medium-sized construction material company in Australia. The qualitative results revealed that a variety of exchanges occur within the team member relationships, including relationship-oriented and task-oriented exchanges. Team members also reported that they experienced both positive and negative emotions in response to their TMX relationships. The quantitative results further indicated that positive emotions, rather than negative emotions, were associated with effective TMX relationships. These results support the findings of past research on TMX and emotions in teams, suggesting TMX relationship was an important outcome variable. Based on these results, only positive affect was included in the model to be examined in the remainder of the studies. Study 2 used a quantitative cross-sectional design to examine the relationships between LMX quality, social identification, positive affect, and TMX quality at the individual level of the multilevel model. The sample for this study was 262 employees of an Australian bank and a national restaurant chain. A web-survey was developed and used to collect data from employees and structural equation modelling (SEM) was utilised to analyse the data. Results showed that LMX quality was positively related to social identification and TMX quality. Further, social identification was found to mediate the relationship between LMX quality and TMX quality, while positive affect mediated the relationship between social identification and TMX quality. These results are consistent with SET, SIT and ECT and support the individual-level relationships between the variables in the model. Study 3 was designed to test the group-level moderating effects of LMX differentiation fairness and affective climate on individual-level relationships between the variables. This study built on the results of Study 2 to evaluate the validity of the overall model. Manager-reported and self-reported questionnaires were used to collected data from 2 15 manager-employee matched dyads working in 36 teams for an Australian bank. Managers provided ratings on LMX quality for each of their subordinates within a team, while employees provided ratings on LMX differentiation fairness, affective climate, social identification, positive affect, and TMX quality. Hierarchical liner modelling (HLM) was used to analyse the multilevel data. Results confirmed that the individual-level relationship between individual team members' positive affect and TMX quality was moderated by group-level affective climate. Overall, findings from this research provide mostly supportive evidence for the hypothesised relationships in the model. The major findings demonstrate that employees enjoying high-quality LMX relationships tend to develop high-quality TMX relationships with their team members because they strongly identify with their teams, and that this identification induces positive emotions, which in turn enhances TMX quality. In addition, individual team members experiencing positive affect were found to be more likely to form high-quality TMX relationships with others when the affective climate in their teams is strong. To the best of my knowledge, this research is among the first to explore interpersonal exchange relationships in a larger social system in organisations by developing and testing a multilevel model. I have outlined the theoretical contributions of this research to SET, SIT, ECT, and climate research. In practical terms, this research increases our understanding of how managers use high-quality relationships with subordinates as a means of maximising individual and team effectiveness by demonstrating concern for subordinates' emotional well-being in the workplace.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">L</field><field name="subject">350200 Business and Management</field><field name="subject">720403 Management</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158266</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Phylogeny, morphology and physiology of the secondary vascular system in fishes</field><field name="creator">Skov, Peter Vilhelm</field><field name="description">Vascular casts of three chondrichthian, one dipnoan, one chondrostean and 14 teleostean species were examined by light and scanning electron microscopy in order to give a qualitative and quantitative analysis of interarterial anastomoses (iaas) that indicate the presence (or absence) of a secondary vascular system (SVS). Anastomoses were found to originate from a variety of different primary blood vessels, many of which have not been previously identified as giving rise to secondary vessels. Segmental arteries derived from the dorsal aorta and supplying body musculature were major sites of origin of the SVS, although there was considerable variation in where, in the hierarchy of arterial branching, the anastomoses occurred. The degree of investment in a SVS was species specific, with more active species having a higher degree of secondary vascularisation. This difference was quantified using an absolute count of iaas between Anguilla reinhardtii and Trachinotus baillonii. A range of general features of the SVS is also described. No evidence of iaas was found on the coeliac, mesenteric or renal circulation in any species. Evidence of interarterial anastomoses were lacking in the dipnoan (Sarcopterygii) and chondrichthyan species examined, suggesting that a SVS is restricted to actinopterygian fishes. The presence and distribution of a secondary vascular system does not appear to be exclusively linked to phylogenetic position, but rather to the physiological adaptation of the species. Histological sections of primary segmental arteries and associated interarterial anastomoses and secondary vessels from the long-finned eel, Anguilla reinhardtii, were examined by light and transmission electron microscopy. Secondary vessels were found to originate from the primary vasculature as depressions through the tunica intima and media, from where they ran perpendicularly to the adventitial layer, before coiling extensively. From here the anastomoses travelled a relatively linear path in the outer margin of the adventitia to re-anastomose with a secondary vessel running in parallel with the primary counterpart. Secondary vessels had a structure quite similar to that of primary vessels; they were lined by endothelial cells on a continuous basement membrane, surrounded by single layer of smooth muscle cells surrounding the vessel. Smooth muscle cells were also found in the vicinity of interarterial anastomoses in the adventitia, but these were more longitudinally orientated. The presence of smooth muscle cells on all aspects of the secondary circulation suggests that this vascular system is regulated in a similar manner as the primary vascular system. Because interarterial anastomoses are structurally integrated with the primary vessel from which they originate, it was anticipated that flow through secondary vessels would to some extent be affected by an increase in primary vascular tone. Immunohistochemical studies showed that primary segmental arteries displayed moderate immunoreactivity to antibodies against 5-hydroxytryptamine and substance P, while interarterial anastomoses and secondary vessels showed dense immunoreactivity. Secondary vessels were followed to the surface of the animal through consecutive sections, where they eventually give rise to capillary beds overlying the scales. Secondary capillary beds were found to supply chloride cells in the skin, suggesting that this vascular system may be involved in cutaneous ionic exchange. Branchial vascular casts from two species of Tetraodontiformes showed that the vessels previously reported as nutrient vessels are with certainty part of the secondary vascular system. In the three-barred porcupine fish, Dicotylichthys punctulatus, interarterial anastomoses originated at high densities from efferent filamental and the efferent branchial arteries, from where they formed progressively larger secondary vessels. Small branches of this vascular system entered the filament body, where it gave rise to numerous side-vessels along the way. Large secondary vessels running in parallel with the efferent branchial arteries were found to constitute an additional arterio-arterial pathway, in that they exited the branchial basket in company with the afferent mandibular artery, the carotid artery and the efferent branchial arteries, from where they gave rise to vascular beds immediately after exit. The secondary vessels in this species were not found to supply the filament musculature; rather this vascular system was supplied by a single vessel derived from the efferent branchial artery, running in parallel with the afferent branchial artery. Secondary vessels were not found on any branchial component in the banded toadfish, Marylina pleurosticta, but in all other aspects the branchial vascular anatomy was similar to that of D. punctulatus. It is proposed that four independent vascular pathways may be present in the teleostean gill. The blood volume and flow rates of the primary (PVS) and secondary vascular system (SVS) were examined in the catadromous euryhaline teleost Lates calcarifer in order to determine whether any of these parameters were subject to change in individuals acclimated to seawater, compared to a group acclimated to freshwater. There was no significant difference in any measured parameter for the two groups. The volumes of the SVS were 0.67 &#132;b 0.13 and 0.76 &#132;b 0.13 mL 100g-1 body mass for FW and SW acclimated animals respectively. This constituted approximately one-third of the total blood volume in both groups. Turnover times for the SVS ranged from 21.0 to 25.2 minutes, demonstrating in accordance with previous publications, that this system is considerably more dynamic than previously assumed.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270604 Comparative Physiology</field><field name="subject">780105 Biological sciences</field><field name="subject">secondary vessels</field><field name="subject">anatomy</field><field name="subject">control</field><field name="subject">physiology</field><field name="subject">immunohistochemistry</field><field name="subject">histology</field><field name="subject">blood vessels</field><field name="subject">primary</field><field name="subject">secondary</field><field name="subject">volume</field><field name="subject">flow</field><field name="subject">chondrichthyes</field><field name="subject">dipnoi</field><field name="subject">actinopterygii</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158001</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gene expression in the human brain: adaptive changes associated with tobacco and alcohol exposure</field><field name="creator">Flatscher-Bader, Traute</field><field name="description">Alcohol and tobacco are drugs of abuse which are legal to sell and consume in most western societies. Addiction to these two substances has major social and health implications worldwide. The brain structure known to mediate addictive behaviour is the dopaminergic mesocorticolimbic system. Dopaminegic neurons arise from the ventral tegmental area, project to the nucleus accumbens and interact with the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex. Chronic alcoholism elicits marked damage in the prefrontal cortex with significant loss of neurons and glia. The key components of addiction, tolerance and dependence, are thought to be the result of semipermanent adaptive changes in gene expression. Gene expression profiling of the mesocorticolimbic system from human alcoholics and alcohol-dependent animals has revealed highly region-specific alterations. How these molecular changes result in the development of alcohol dependence in humans is not fully understood. Complicating factors in human alcoholism include a high comorbidity with smoking, socioeconomic factors and the prevalence of underlying psychological pathologies. Gene expression profiling of the prefrontal cortex of six alcoholics and six controls resulted in the identification of functional gene groups sensitive to alcoholism. Mitochondrial function was found down regulated while mRNA levels of genes involved in stress response and cell protection were elevated. These results correlate with the pathology of the prefrontal cortex in chronic alcoholism. Some of the control cases used for gene expression profiling were later identified as chronic smokers, while all of the alcoholics were heavy smokers. To date the heavy co-morbidity of alcoholism with smoking has not been taken into account. Thus the expression of selected genes were investigated by realtime PCR in an extended case set of non-smoking alcoholics, smoking alcoholics, smoking non-alcoholics and non-smoking, non-alcoholics. This study revealed that alcoholism itself had a significant impact on the expression of midkine, the high affinity glial glutamate transporter, member 1 and the tissue inhibitor of the metalloproteinase 3. Heavy smoking itself led to a small but significant elevation of MDK mRNA levels as well as an increase in variation of excitatory amino acid transporter 1 and metalloproteinase inhibitor, member 3 expression. Apolipoprotein D however was induced by chronic smoking but not by alcohol dependence. These results highlight the need of careful case selection in future studies on gene expression in the human alcoholic brain. Peptide antibodies were produced to midkine and a polyclonal antibody against the excitatory amino acid transporter 1 was obtained from a collaborating laboratory. Western blots utilizing these antibodies revealed a marked increase in midkine and excitatory amino acid transporter 1 protein in alcoholics compared to non-smoking and non-drinking controls. In coronal sections of human prefrontal cortex of alcoholics and non-smoking non-drinking controls, immunofluorescence of midkine was obtained from nuclei throughout the layers of the cortex and from the cell bodies of a distinct set of astrocytes in cortical layer II. Double staining with glial fibrillary acidic protein revealed that a portion of midkine-positive nuclei were localised in glial cells. There was no difference in immunostaining of alcohol and control sections with midkine. In summary these results indicate that midkine protein is induced in the prefrontal cortex of the chronic alcoholic. However, this increase in protein may not be strong enough to be visualised by immunohistochemistry. Midkine induction may be reflective of reparative processes in the prefrontal cortex of the chronic alcoholic. Excitatory amino acid transporter 1 staining in non-alcoholic, non-smoking control cases were obtained as a confluent band in cortical layer II and sparsely in deeper cortical layers. Excitatory amino acid transporter 1 immunoreactivity overlapped partially with glial fibrillary acidic protein labelling. In chronic alcoholics, excitatory amino acid transporter 1 staining in the area between the cortical layer II and VI was significantly increased. At withdrawal, glutamate levels may reach toxic levels in the cortex. The increase in cells expressing excitatory amino acid transporter 1 throughout the cortical layers may indicate a protective measure of this brain region in the chronic alcoholic. Additionally, layer specific expression of midkine and excitatory amino acid transporter 1 in the prefrontal cortex of the healthy individual may implicate a specialised role of these astrocytes.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270201 Gene Expression</field><field name="subject">780105 Biological sciences</field><field name="subject">gene expression</field><field name="subject">brain chemistry</field><field name="subject">alcohol</field><field name="subject">tobacco</field><field name="subject">drug dependency</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158114</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Emperor and the Roman Elite from Commodus to Maximinus (A.D. 180-238)</field><field name="creator">Davenport, Caillan James Roderick</field><field name="description">Rome had twelve masters between the years A.D. 180-238, eleven of whom were murdered or killed in battle. The age of the Antonines came to an end with the death of Commodus and four years of divisive civil war. The eventual victor, Septimius Severus, established a new dynasty, but it was short-lived, coming to an ignominious end in a camp on the Rhine. Thus began the era of the soldier emperors. This thesis will argue that the rapid turnover of emperors in these fifty-eight years precipitated a crisis among the Roman elite. Senators and equestrians competed with each other, and with less exalted members of society, such as freedmen, to become members of the emperor&#146;s inner circle. Dio Cassius, a senator who began his Roman History during the reign of Septimius Severus, serves as an effective contemporary witness to the upheavals taking place at court and within society at large. Contrary to the views of scholars such as Crook and Syme, who place great emphasis on the continuity of policy provided by the emperor&#146;s amici, this thesis will demonstrate that there was significant discontinuity at the imperial court. Imperial advisers were not a fixed group retained from reign to reign &#150; instead, each new emperor chose to install his own supporters in key positions in order to put his own stamp on the administration of the empire. This has given rise to a tendency to label some rulers as &#145;anti-senatorial&#146; and others as &#145;pro-senatorial&#146;. Even those emperors who executed large numbers of senators, such as Commodus and Septimius Severus, had amici from within the senate whom they trusted and relied upon. The favour bestowed on such senators who formed part of the emperors&#146; exclusive cabal was a source of continual tension among the Roman elite. The amici formed a heterogeneous group, whose only common link was that they had earned the favour of the emperor of the day.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">430110 History - Classical Greek and Roman</field><field name="subject">780199 Other</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158140</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Outside Orders : Religious Faith and Practice of the Laity in Twelfth and Thirteenth-Century France Based on Chansons de Geste of the Charlemagne Cycle</field><field name="creator">Smith, Kay Lynette</field><field name="description">The centuries under discussion in this thesis, the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, were a time of great change in practice of the rituals of the Christian church in Europe as well as in the development of their underlying theology. And the society that this thesis will investigate, the French speaking people of north western Europe, was the theatre in which much of that debate and change took place. The opinions and arguments of the erudite from that time and place are well known. Studies of their interactions illustrate the existence of many schools and individuals whose deliberations were written down, and which supply ample material to modern scholars who research the theological development of the time. However, what is not so abundantly documented is the impact that religion had on the lay and sometimes illiterate Christians of the day. If, in fact, they did debate their religious beliefs and practices, their debates were not written down for posterity to read. Their opinions can only be accessed obliquely. This thesis takes the form of small social history, history from the lower echelons of society rather than the higher, that plumbs the experiences of ordinary people whose opinions were not important enough to occupy the scholars and administrators of the day. In this case a branch of their literature in the vernacular will be used as source material. I propose drawing out a picture of what the people of the time believed, and how they expressed that belief in action, through a close reading of the popular medieval genre of the chanson de geste. The subject has been broached before, by Carl Josef Merk in 1914, Adolphe Jacques Dickman in 1926, Marianna Gildea in 1943 and J-L. Roland B&#233;langer in 1975. This study will differ from previous studies in its concentration on only one cycle of poems and the depth of examination of those poems. Where Merk, Gildea and Dickman used many poems, almost the entire available corpus, and B&#233;langer used a mixture of the poems of the Loherain Cycle and other earlier chansons, this study will be confined to the poems of the Charlemagne Cycle. The poems of one cycle grew out of a common store of subject matter, in this case stories surrounding the great eighth and ninth century king, Charlemagne. By the time of the production and recording of chansons, Charlemagne had acquired legendary status and been credited with conquests and journeys that he never made in his lifetime. He represented an ideal of kingship and his actions were the actions of the ideal Christian conqueror, a monarch who, with his people, was loved by God and guided and assisted by God in all he undertook. For the most part the stories about him involved the conquest and conversion of non-Christian people. Consequently, although the poems are not overtly concerned with religious teaching or religious practice, their subject matter is imbued with religious language and significance. It is the religious significance of the language and subject matter of these poems and the similarity of the hierarchical structure of the society described to the conjectured celestial structure that makes these poems suitable as subject matter for this study. Eleven poems have been chosen for study, nine concerned with conquest of non- Christian people and two with the existence of traitors among the followers of the king. These two poems add the dimension of loyalty to one&#146;s monarch and preservation of the status quo to that of warfare against non-Christians. The findings are set out in two sections, one concerned with rituals that mark the milestones in the protagonists&#146; lives and the other with more spontaneous expressions of faith. Conclusions are drawn from each section and then melded to give an overall picture of the faith of the laity of the time. Where parallels or contrasts with the practice accepted and prescribed by the ecclesiastical establishment are detected, these are examined in the relevant chapters.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">780199 Other</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158226</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Entanglement, geometry and quantum computation</field><field name="creator">Dowling, Mark</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses a number of problems within the emerging field of quantum information science. Quantum information science can be said to encompass the more-established disciplines of quantum computation and quantum information, as well as rather more recent attempts to apply concepts, tools and techniques from these disciplines to gain greater understanding of quantum systems in general. The role of entanglement &#151; non-classical correlation &#151; has been of particular interest to date. Part I contributes to this later goal. In particular, we establish a connection between the energy of a many-body quantum system and the idea of an entanglement witness from the theory of mixed-state entanglement. This connection allows mathematical results about entanglement witnesses to be translated into physical results about many-body quantum systems, specifically energy and temperature thresholds for entanglement. For the case of two qubits we are able to establish fairly detailed results about the behaviour of entanglement with temperature. We also study entanglement in systems of indistinguishable particles, where even the question of which quantum states should be regarded as entangled has been the subject of much controversy. We aim to clarify this issue by applying Wiseman and Vaccaro&#146;s notion of entanglement of particles to a number of wellunderstood model systems. We discuss the advantages of the entanglement of particles approach compared with other methods in common use. Finally, we study the operational meaning of superselection rules in quantum physics, in particular the connection to the existence or not of an appropriate reference frame. We propose an experiment that aims to exhibit a coherent superposition of an atom and a molecule, apparently in violation of the commonly-accepted particle-number superselection rule. This result sheds light on the entanglement of particles approach to entanglement of indistinguishable particles. Part II returns to a fundamental question at the heart of quantum computation and quantum information, namely: how many quantum gates are required to perform a particular quantum computation? In other words, how efficiently can a quantum computer solve a particular computational problem? We establish a connection between this question and the field of Riemannian geometry. Intuitively, optimal quantum circuits correspond to &#147;free-falling&#148; along the shortest path between two points in a curved space. This opens up the possibility of using Riemannian geometry to study quantum computation, a possibility that was previously unknown. We provide explicit calculations of all the basic geometric quantities associated with the space, and give some preliminary results of applying geometric ideas to quantum computing. Finally, we explore more generally the connection between optimal control and quantum circuit complexity, of which the Riemannian metric described above can be viewed as a special case.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">240301 Atomic and Molecular Physics</field><field name="subject">780102 Physical sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158661</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Models of fault-tolerant quantum computation</field><field name="creator">Dawson, Christopher Malcolm</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with certain theoretical problems that arise naturally in the context of fault-tolerant quantum computation. Fault-tolerance can be defined as the art of building reliable devices from unreliable components, and is of particular importance for quantum computers that aim to precisely control the dynamics of extremely sensitive quantum systems. A model of quantum computation is a specification of the basic building blocks by which a quantum computation is implemented. The best known model is the quantum circuit model, where computations are implemented by means of unitary quantum gates that are applied to two-level quantum systems known as qubits. In a physical implementation of a quantum circuit, the gates and qubits will inevitably be affected by noise. Fault-tolerant quantum circuits are designed to be resilient against the effects of this noise, provided that it is not too strong. Fault-tolerance in the quantum circuit model is well developed thanks to the theory of quantum error-correcting codes. These codes allow for the correction of small numbers of errors introduced by a variety of noise processes. In a fault-tolerant quantum circuit, qubits are replaced with encoded qubits, and quantum gates with encoded gates that are immediately followed by special quantum circuits for error correction. Provided the rate at which errors occur is below a constant threshold value, the accumulation of errors can be checked so that the correct output of the computation correctly determined. The threshold acts as both a measure of how good the design of a quantum circuit is, and also as a target for experimenters aiming to implement quantum circuits. Much current research in quantum computation is aimed at designing quantum circuits that increase the noise threshold, hopefully to the point where it becomes within the reach of experimenters. A fault-tolerant encoded quantum gate must limit the propagation of errors so that the code&#146;s corrective capabilities are not overwhelmed. It is not so easy to design encoded gates that satisfy this property, and to date only a finite handful of such gates are known. In a faulttolerant quantum circuit, all quantum gates must be decomposed or compiled in terms of those that may be implemented fault-tolerantly. In the first part of this thesis, we present two results that may be applied to this problem of gate compilation. The first is a generic method based on the Solovay-Kitaev theorem that may be applied to all quantum gates, but is most effective for those that act on single qubits. We present the Solovay-Kitaev theorem in its simples known form as an algorithm, together with novel constructions that can be used to implement it. Following this we give a two specialized methods for two-qubit gate decomposition, based on the Cartan decomposition of the Lie group SU(4). The cluster-state model of computation is an alternative to the quantum circuit model, and makes use of quantum measurements and highly entangled cluster-states to implement a quantum computation. The fault-tolerant techniques developed for quantum circuits are not immediately applicable in this model, so in order for it to be a realistic candidate for performing computations we prove that such techniques are possible. In the second part of the thesis we prove that constant fault-tolerance thresholds may be achieved in the cluster-state model, and in particular in an adaption to an optical implementation. Following this we design a complete error correction scheme for optical cluster-state computation, and numerically determine the threshold of this model in the face of the dominant noise models likely to affect such an implementation.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">249999 Physical Sciences not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158120</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Palynology, sequence stratigraphy, and palaeoenvironments of Middle to Upper Jurassic strata, Bayu-Undan Field, Timor Sea region</field><field name="creator">Mantle, Daniel</field><field name="description">Detailed palynological analysis of 230 core and sidewall core samples from the uppermost Plover, Elang, and lower Frigate formations, Bayu-Undan Field, Timor Sea, reveals the presence of diverse and moderately well preserved palynomorph assemblages (predominantly dinoflagellate cysts, together with acritarchs, spores, and pollen grains) that facilitate biostratigraphic, sequence stratigraphic, and palaeoenvironmental interpretations. The palynomorph assemblages, detailed systematically herein, comprise 96 spore and pollen species, 84 dinoflagellate species, and 15 acritarch species. Of these, the following 14 dinoflagellate cyst species are newly instituted: Ampulladinium aiax, Batiacasphaera macbethiae, Broomea fusticulum, Cauca bayuiana, Egmontodinium elongatum, Ellipsoidictyum fenestellum, Evansia? lacryma, Leberidocysta? strigosus, Leptodinium? ancoralium, Meiourogonyaulax baculata, Nannoceratopsis reticulata, Paragonyaulacysta? feneseptata, P. helbyi, and Yalkalpodinium playfordii. A further five species are not formally named due to a lack of adequately preserved specimens. One genus, Broomea COOKSON&amp;EISENACK, is formally emended. The palynostratigraphic sequence has previously been assessed as latest Bathonian to early Oxfordian in age, based mainly on correlations with European dinoflagellate assemblages dated by ammonite faunas. Ten subzones (TB1-5 and VT1-5) are informally erected, collectively encompassing the Ternia balmei and Voodooia tabulata dinoflagellate cyst Interval Zones. The subzones are defined variously on first and last appearance datums, first and last common occurrences, and species acmes. The acme events are coincident with marine flooding surfaces and enable precise correlation across the Bayu-Undan Field. The Elang Formation &#150; the prime focus of this study &#150; is divided into three third order sequences, each comprising a lowstand, transgressive, and highstand systems tract. These tracts and their delimiting stratal horizons or flooding surfaces possess distinctive palynological or palynodebris assemblages. Qualitative and quantitative variations of these assemblages correlate very closely with gamma-ray log profiles and can be consistently placed within a sequence stratigraphic framework across the Bayu- Undan Field. Palynofacies analyses provide additional means to distinguish among the systems tracts; viz., microphytoplankton diversity increases through transgressive systems tracts to a peak diversity at the maximum flooding surface; atypically brown wood frequencies may also peak at maximum flooding surfaces; and black debris frequencies increase higher in the highstand systems tracts. Palaeoenvironmental interpretations based primarily on palynological assemblages (especially microphytoplankton groupings and palynodebris distribution) provide a means to identify depositional settings in non-cored intervals. For instance, the occurrences of Ternia balmei, the Meiourogonyaulax group, the Ctenidodinium group, and the Rigaudella group represent an approximate gradient from very nearshore to offshore environments or possibly an increase in salinities from euryhaline to stenohaline conditions.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">260113 Palynology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158275</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Handwriting of eight year old children with and without autistic spectrum disorder</field><field name="creator">Cartmill, Linda Joan</field><field name="description">Anecdotally it was found that Queensland occupational therapists reported a surprisingly high referral rate for handwriting problems amongst school aged children with Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD). A subsequent review of the literature revealed a number of anecdotal reports of disordered handwriting in this population but limited research in the area. This thesis presents a descriptive and exploratory study of the nature of handwriting in eight year old children with and without ASD. Issues of handwriting development and motor learning are canvassed followed by an examination of concepts of motor control. Next follows a review of current handwriting models. The Systems Model of Handwriting was proposed as a response to the evidence for both dynamic and motor programme aspects of handwriting. Using this model as an organizing structure, the literature on ASD and handwriting was then examined which led to the framing of three research questions: 1. Is the handwriting speed of children with ASD significantly different from that of children without ASD? 2. Is the handwriting legibility of children with ASD significantly different from that of children without ASD? 3. At what stage/s of the Sequential Handwriting Process, is the handwriting of children with ASD different from that of children without ASD? Twenty-eight eight year old children with ASD and a matched control group of twentyeight comparison children were recruited from state primary schools in Brisbane and surrounding areas. These fifty-six children were assessed on thirteen handwriting process variables and two handwriting outcome variables in order to answer the research questions. Data produced were analyzed primarily with t-tests for between group differences and by examination of correlations between process and outcome variables. Small but measurable differences were found in both speed and legibility between the two groups, with the handwriting of the children with ASD being both less legible (t=- 2.47, df=54, p=0.02) and slower (t=-2.47, df=54, p=0.02). Accuracy of letter formation was also found to be significantly worse for the children with ASD compared to children in the control group (t=3.53, df=54, p=0.001). Further, the two groups were found to differ in some aspects of the Sequential Handwriting Process. Specifically, the children with ASD showed significant correlations between legibility and Perceiving, Conceptualizing and Planning stages, while the comparison children showed significant correlations between legibility and Interpreting, Conceptualizing, Planning and Activating stages. Only one process variable (consistency of letter formation) showed a moderate correlation with handwriting speed &#150; all other variables were of only slight to fair strength. Finally, the implications of the research findings are discussed, limitations described and directions for future research canvassed. As a result of the present study, a revised Systems Model of Handwriting is proposed. Several recommendations for occupational therapy intervention in handwriting practices in the classroom are made, notably: clear and focussed initial tuition of letter formation and secondly, the development of automaticity of the handwriting skill.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158068</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bivalves and the Bucephalidae: A parasitic system on the Great Barrier Reef</field><field name="creator">Bott, Nathan James</field><field name="description">This study set out to examine, for the first time, both the molluscan intermediate and the teleost definitive hosts of a major assemblage of trematode parasites present on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). The parasite taxon was the Bucephalidae which occur in piscivorous fishes as sexually reproducing adults and in bivalves as asexually reproducing stages. The goal was to characterise the overall richness of the system and to explore patterns of host-specificity. Because of the size of this fauna it was not possible to incorporate all the taxa found in this study. This thesis reports the results of a survey of bivalves from this region, taxonomic studies on several elements of the fauna of fishes, and efforts to link life-cycles between bivalves and fishes. I surveyed 2256 bivalve individuals (47 species, 17 families) from South-east Queensland, Heron Island (southern GBR) and Lizard Island (northern GBR). Infections of trematode species from three families, Bucephalidae, Gorgoderidae and Monorchiidae, were found. Overall prevalence of infection was 2.3%. The Bucephalidae (11 species) was the most commonly found family. A single gorgoderid infection was found from a venerid, Lioconcha castrensis. This is the first report of a gorgoderid from a marine bivalve and phylogenetic analysis suggests that the species belongs to the Gorgoderinae. Monorchiids (5 species) were found from Tellinidae and Lucinidae. All infections are new host/parasite records. I deduce that this study produced lifecycle information, but no actual identifications, for 10% of the species of trematodes that infect bivalves of Queensland marine waters. Prosorhynchoides apogonis n. sp. is described from the intestine of the apogonid Cheilodipterus macrodon from the southern GBR. This is the first bucephalid to be described from the teleost family Apogonidae. Prosorhynchoides lamprelli n. sp. is described from the intestine of the carangid Caranx papuensis from off Lizard Island, GBR. This is the first bucephalid to be described from Caranx papuensis. A new trematode genus, Grammatorcynicola n. g. (Dolichoenterinae), and two new species, G. brayi n. sp. and G. nolani n. sp., are described from the intestines of the scombrids, Grammatorcynus bicarinatus and Gr. bilineatus respectively. Grammatorcynicola n. g. differs from other dolichoenterine genera in having a simple sucker-like rhynchus, the ovary anterior to the testes and by not having a particularly thick cirrus-sac wall. Six new species of bucephalid trematodes from the prosorhynchine bucephalid genera Prosorhynchus Odhner, 1905 and Neidhartia Nagaty, 1937 are reported from the epinepheline serranid genera Cephalopholis, Cromileptes, Epinephelus and Variola from the GBR. Two species of Prosorhynchus and one Neidhartia are reported from Epinephelus spp., P. jexi n. sp. from E. quoyanus, P. lafii n. sp. from E. fuscoguttatus, and N. epinepheli n. sp. from E. maculatus. The other species are P. robertsthomsoni n. sp. from several species of Cephalopholis, P. conorjonesi n. sp. from Cromileptes altivelis, and P. milleri n. sp. from Variola louti. I examined three species of Plectropomus (Serranidae: Epinephelinae), Pl. laevis, Pl. leopardus and Pl. maculatus from off Heron Island and Lizard Island on the GBR. Nine bucephalid species from the Prosorhynchinae were found, three species of Neidhartia and six species of Prosorhynchus. The three species of Neidhartia, N. haywardi n. sp., N. plectropomi n. sp. and N. tyleri n. sp., are readily distinguishable by morphology. Two of the six species of Prosorhynchus (P. lesteri n. sp. and P. wrightae n. sp.) are easily distinguished from their other congeners by morphology but the other four species (P. adlardi n. sp., P. heronensis n. sp., P. munozae n. sp. and P. plectropomi n. sp.) are highly similar in morphology and were only distinguished convincingly by comparing their ITS2 rDNA sequences. Both P. adlardi n. sp. and P. wrightae n. sp. have also been found once in V. louti at Lizard Island. This is also the first study to identify life-cycle matches of the Bucephalidae using molecular techniques. I found two perfect life-cycle matches (identical sequences). The bivalve host of Prosorhynchoides lamprelli is a tellinid, Exotica clathrata; Rhipidocotyle sp. from the sphyraenid Sphyraena jello also has E. clathrata as its first intermediate host. Bayesian Inference Analysis shows that all seven species from bivalves that were sequenced belong to the Bucephalinae. Perhaps the most striking finding of the study was that one bivalve species, E. clathrata, was shown to harbour four separate species. Matching of ITS2 rDNA sequences between life-cycle stages is highly effective in circumstances of great richness such as the Great Barrier Reef. Based on my data collected, the total bucephalid species in the system is estimated to be 84.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300508 Parasitology</field><field name="subject">780105 Biological sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158287</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanised Intercropping and Double Cropping in Southern Queensland</field><field name="creator">Peter Michael Masasso</field><field name="description">The potential for relay intercropping and double cropping was assessed in field trials over three consecutive years at Gatton, Queensland. The rationale was to use controlled traffic technology to facilitate relay and double cropping and thus research a cropping system that could exploit late winter crop rainfall. In Field Trial I, grain sorghum and sunflower, broadacre crops already grown within the Southern and Darling Downs regions of Queensland and New South Wales were intercropped into wheat; sunflower was intercropped with wheat in Field Trial II. Sole summer plantings were made at the same time as intercrops were planted. The wheat crop was cut and stubble removed to facilitate this. Various planting dates (three for Field Trial I; four for Field Trial II) for the relayed summer crops were used to determine if an optimum planting time existed. Plant height, tiller number, light interception, grain yield, soil moisture and economic return were used as parameters to compare the intercrop with sole plantings in Field Trial I. Grain yield, soil moisture, rainfall infiltration and economic return were measured in Field Trial II. Research also involved the modification and testing of a tractor to carry out the sowing of the intercrop. In Field Trial I, light interception was shown to vary at different stages of the wheat crop and the use of these stages to determine optimum planting dates of the relay crop is suggested. In both trials, no differences were recorded in the grain yield between intercropped and sole cropped wheat treatments suggesting the trafficking of the plot did not affect the wheat. As neither sorghum or sunflower established as intercrops, competition was not a factor in affecting wheat yields. Moisture readings in both trials showed little change below a depth of 100 cm; however some treatment differences were present at shallower depths. In Field ii Trial I, sole summer sorghum, especially the first planting date, showed reduced water capture/ higher soil evaporation due to wheat removal initially and later transpiration loss due to crop growth and increased weed pressure. Sole wheat treatments showed increased moisture storage after harvest due to lack of water use by the crop and increased infiltration/reduced runoff due to stubble retention. Improved soil moisture recharge after rainfall events was apparent in double cropped treatments suggesting not only improved water utilisation but also improved capture and storage is possible within this system. Sorghum, commonly used throughout south eastern Queensland as a summer crop option, proved unsuitable for relay intercropping in Field Trial I for Planting Dates 1 and 2. Minimum soil temperatures for these plantings were marginal as they were close to the 15o Celsius level recommended for sorghum. However, even though establishment was poor for the intercropped plantings, it was higher for sole sorghum plantings. Wheat allelopathic effects may be involved. To avoid the temperature limitations of sorghum, sunflower was selected as an alternative intercrop in the later planting dates of Field Trial I and all dates for Field Trial II. Reasons for the poor establishment and yield of sunflowers in the earlier intercrop planting dates compared to sole plantings remain unknown but also may be related to allelopathic effects from intercropped wheat. Low soil temperature was not a factor affecting establishment Yields for planting dates were recorded in the intercropped sunflower treatments for Field Trial II and the optimal planting time for sunflowers in a wheat/sunflower relay intercrop was identified as when physiological maturity of the wheat had occurred. This may relate to the wheat crop stage. In Field Trial II, no significant differences in soil moisture were recorded between treatments from overall water use for the trial period. There were differences in water use between intercropped and sole cropped treatments for iii some rainfall events. Three rainfall events were chosen for closer study in each of the field trials conducted. Each event varied in the length and time as well as the duration and intensity of the rain that fell for the period. For the first rainfall period the moisture content of the first planting date of the sole summer treatment and to a lesser extent the second planting date of the same treatment increased, most likely due to wheat removal. In the third rainfall period the double cropped sunflower treatment with stubble tended to store less moisture and this may be due to the active crop growth at this time. It was evident in both field trials of the need for an effective weed control program in the intercrop plots. Weeds were controlled in wheel tracks by glyphosate sprays. Cultural methods may help but a herbicide suitable for both components of the intercrop would be very useful. A tractor was successfully modified to a 3 metre wheelspace and a clearance of 70 cm. This proved sufficient for planting the relay intercrop in Field Trial II without negatively affecting the yield of the standing crop. The row spacing of 18 cm for wheat in a 3 metre fixed bed and wheeltrack configuration assisted with guidance and interplanting of the relay crop. The relay crop was sown as single alternating rows.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences</field><field name="subject">relay intercropping, controlled traffic, wheat, sunflower, sorghum, LER, ATER, CPR, tramlining, reaised beds</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159371</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Respect for the world: Universal ethics and the morality of terraforming</field><field name="creator">York, Paul Francis</field><field name="description">This dissertation aims to develop an ethical system that can properly frame such questions as the morality of large-scale efforts to transform inanimate parts of nature, for example, proposals to terraform Mars. Such an ethics diverges from traditional approaches to ethics because it expands the class of entities regarded as morally considerable to include inanimate entities. I approach the task by building on the environmental ethical theory of Paul W. Taylor, as developed in his 1986 book Respect for Nature: A Theory of Environmental Ethics. I discuss various criticisms of Taylor and propose two extensions to his theory: an expansion of the scope of moral considerability to include all concrete material objects and the introduction of the concept of variable moral significance (the notion that all entities have inherent worth but some have more than others). Using Taylor&#146;s modified and extended theory as a foundation, I develop something I call universal ethics. This is an ethical framework whose key elements are a fundamental ethical attitude of respect for the world and a principle of minimal harm. Universal ethics regards all concrete material entities, whether living or not, and whether natural or artefactual, as inherently valuable, and therefore as entitled to the respect of moral agents. I offer a defence of this ethical framework and discuss a number of practical applications, including criticism of proposals for the terraforming of Mars. I conclude that terraforming Mars or any other celestial body at this point in our history would be morally wrong. I also suggest that universal ethics provides an ethical foundation for efforts to protect Antarctica, and that it has implications for our relations to other inanimate parts of our world, including artefacts.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">780199 Other</field><field name="subject">440103 Ethical Theory</field><field name="subject">environmental philosophy</field><field name="subject">environmental ethics</field><field name="subject">environment</field><field name="subject">inherent worth</field><field name="subject">complexity</field><field name="subject">integrity</field><field name="subject">information</field><field name="subject">moral considerability</field><field name="subject">moral significance</field><field name="subject">moral standing</field><field name="subject">principle of minimal harm</field><field name="subject">imperative to knowledge</field><field name="subject">Mars</field><field name="subject">Antarctica</field><field name="subject">inanimate nature</field><field name="subject">artefacts</field><field name="subject">vandalism</field><field name="subject">extraterrestrial</field><field name="subject">Paul W Taylor</field><field name="subject">anthropocentrism</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158029</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Simultaneous Lift, Moment and Thrust Measurements on a Scramjet in Hypervelocity Flow</field><field name="creator">Robinson, Matthew</field><field name="description">This study investigates the stress wave force balance technique for the measurement of forces on a fuelled hypersonic flight vehicle in an impulse-type test facility. A three component force balance for the measurement of lift, thrust and pitching moment on a supersonic combustion ramjet engine was designed, built, calibrated and tested. The force balance was designed using finite element analysis and consisted of four stress bars instrumented for the measurement of strain. Relative errors of less than 2% were obtained for the recovered simulated calibration loads, while errors of less than 3% were obtained for lift and thrust components for simulated fuel-on and fuel-off force loading distributions. Tests in a calibration rig showed that the balance was capable of recovering the magnitude of point loads to within 3% and their lines of action to within 1% of the chord of the model. Additional errors result when testing in a wind tunnel. The uncertainties for the experiments with fuel injection are estimated at 9%, 7% and 9% for the coefficients of lift, thrust and pitching moment. The scramjet vehicle was 0.566m long and weighed approximately 6kg. It consisted of an inlet, combustion chamber and thrust surface. Fuel could be injected through a series of injectors located on the scramjet inlet. The scramjet model was set at zero angle of attack. Experiments were performed in the T4 Free Piston Shock Tunnel at a total enthalpy of 3.3MJ/kg, a nozzle supply pressure of 32MPa and a Mach number of 6.6, with equivalence ratios up to 1.4. Fuel-off force coefficients were measured to within 2% of theoretical values based on predictions using CFD and hypersonic theory. The fuel-off centre-of-pressure was measured to within 4% of the predicted value. The force coefficients varied linearly with equivalence ratio. Good comparison of the measured lift and thrust forces with theoretical values was obtained with increasing flow rates of fuel. The lift-to-drag ratio increased from 3.0 at the fuel-off condition to 17.2 at an equivalence ratio of 1.0. Poor agreement between the measured pitching moment and theoretical values was obtained due to difficulties in predicting the pressure distribution with heat addition on the latter parts of the thrust surface. A shift in the centre-of-pressure of approximately 10% of model chord was measured as the equivalence ratio varied from 0.0 to 1.0. For the design tested, the thrust produced was not enough to overcome drag on the vehicle, even at the highest equivalence ratio tested. Tests at higher stagnation enthalpies (up to 4.9MJ/kg) showed the lift and pitching moment coefficients remained constant with an equivalence ratio of 0.8 but the thrust coefficient decreased exponentially with increasing stagnation enthalpies. Good agreement of experimental values of lift and thrust force with predicted values was obtained for equivalence ratios of 0.0 and 0.8. Choking occurred at stagnation enthalpies of less than 3.0MJ/kg and a nozzle supply pressure of 32MPa with fuel injection at an equivalence ratio of approximately 0.8, resulting in a drag force of approximately 2.5 times the fuel-off drag force. Tests at a nozzle supply enthalpy of 3.3MJ/kg and nozzle supply pressures of 32, 26 and 16MPa were performed at equivalence ratios of 0.0 and 0.8. The fuel-off lift coefficient remained constant but the thrust coefficient increased. This is attributed to a reduction in skin friction associated with longer lengths of laminar boundary layers as the Reynolds number was decreased. The measured fuel-off lift and thrust coefficients agreed with the predicted values to within the known test flow and force prediction uncertainties. Combustion did not occur at a nozzle supply pressure of 16MPa. This work has demonstrated that overall scramjet vehicle performance measurements (such as lift-to-drag ratio and shifts in centre-of-pressure) can be made in a free piston shock tunnel.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">290299 Aerospace Engineering not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">690302 Space transport</field><field name="subject">shock tunnel</field><field name="subject">force measurement</field><field name="subject">scramjet</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158040</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Existence and Time : ethical and metaphysical questions concerning immortality and longevity</field><field name="creator">O'Brien, Carol Ann</field><field name="description">This dissertation is arranged in three parts which address issues concerning death and immortality. These issues all revolve around the temporal limit imposed by death. I have endeavoured to pose some questions which have relevance to a society clutching onto traditional notions of an afterlife despite its headlong thrust into a technologically advanced future where ethical confusions abound. In the first chapter I examine the metaphysics of the soul because postulating an afterlife is the conventional response to death anxiety. I have noticed that many people cling to hope of immortality without having any understanding of the metaphysical architecture of this hope. Consequently, from a philosophical perspective, I contrast arguments on the soul by Plato, Aristotle, Aquinas and Descartes. The second chapter emerges from a fascination with Epicurus's theory of living and, derivatively, of dying. It involves a comparison with (1) Aristotle's distinction between energeia (actuality) and kinesis (movement), and (2) the sybaritic hedonism of the Cyrenaics. Although the theme of this chapter is pleasure, it will be seen that pleasure lies embedded in the living project and is an important component in the drive for survival. In the third chapter I reflect on the meaning of life in conjunction with length of time lived. Here I compare the meaninglessness experienced by Leo Tolstoy (because his life is too short) and the meaninglessness experienced by the fictional character Elena Makropulos (because her life is too long). The Makropulos "case", both a play by Karel Capek and an opera by Leos Janacek, was introduced into the philosophical world by Bernard Williams.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">440103 Ethical Theory</field><field name="subject">Death</field><field name="subject">Immortality</field><field name="subject">longevity</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157928</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Complexity approach to national IT policy making: The case of Malaysia's Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC)</field><field name="creator">Abdul Wahab, Amirudin</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT This dissertation examines the design and implementation of Malaysia's national Information Technology (IT) policy with a focus on the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) project. Qualitative research methods, including in-depth interviews, document analysis and literature analysis, were used to build an understanding of the development of the MSC. The analysis adopts a holistic approach that draws upon the multidisciplinary perspectives of complex adaptive systems in order to understand how social, economic, political and institutional forces interact in a changing environment. This research contributes a policy framework called Goal-Policy-Implementation-Outcome (GPIO), which is used to understand, describe and assess the MSC policy design and methods. It is one of the first public studies of the MSC and one of very few complex systems analyses of a socio-economic system in a developing country. It has been argued that many countries around the world are competing rapidly to produce 'visionary' reports and policy statements on the future of their nations and societies in the 'Information Age'. This is due to the belief that IT can play critical role in stimulating the socio-economic growth of the countries. In Malaysia, the government embarked on an ambitious program to establish the MSC as an attempt to achieve Vision 2020, a national vision and Malaysia's statement of national goals that articulates the country's objective for developed-nation status, while moving towards the creation of an information-rich society by the year 2020. Despite the importance of national IT policies and the major commitment of resources to implement them, there are few critical studies of the positive and negative impacts of 'post-industrial' or 'information society' policy, particularly in the developing countries like Malaysia. This study seeks in part to fill this gap by providing a critical assessment of a Malaysian national IT policy. This research argues that IT policy for national development must be viewed holistically, taking into consideration innovations needed in the social, economic, political and institutional spheres, rather than taking limited view of IT as an economic growth engine. This is a paradigm shift that represents a movement from the traditional worldview (TWV), that was based on the Cartesian/Newtonian paradigm into new ways of thinking and action that is labelled here as the emerging worldview (EMV). The EMV is grounded in complexity theory, an interdisciplinary endeavour that draws upon ideas from a number of fields and seeks to understand and model systems with many interacting parts. This approach can help policy makers and analysts to understand, assess and develop a more balanced and comprehensive policy for the evolution of new technology such as IT and to tackle the complexity of socio-economic change of a dynamic real world setting. The data collection method is from in-depth, open-ended interviews and document analysis. This qualitative exploratory approach was chosen to understand and capture the points of view of other people without specifically limiting the lines of inquiry through questionnaires etc. This research was influenced by multiple theoretical frameworks, because taking one framework alone in analysing the complex issues involved in ICT would not provide a comprehensive understanding of the interplay of the socio-technical and techno-economic paradigms. This resulted in the contribution of a policy framework called Goal-Policy-Implementation-Outcome (GPIO), which is used to understand, describe and assess the MSC policy design and method. This research found that the MSC policy plan and process were not working as intended to achieve the goals of Vision 2020. The strategy of clustering businesses in one physical location to establish synergy did not work as anticipated because: (1) Cyberjaya was not yet fully ready with all the necessary people, infrastructure and community since many basic amenities have yet to be competed; (2) The distance of Cyberjaya to key cities were perceived to be too far; (3) Operational costs in Cyberjaya were perceived as high; (4) The Cyberjaya ecosystem lacks attractive incentives; and (5) Most of the current and potential MSC firms, customers and suppliers were already located outside Cyberjaya with existing networks of people and facilities in other locations. (6) The current environment of the MSC was also found not to be conducive to facilitating a self-organizing system due to the lack of a wide consultative and participatory process. Consequently, drastic changes to the organizational structure and behaviour are needed before success can happen. It was found that the key challenges and barriers to the transformation process in and through the MSC lie in the nature of the existing mindset, the operational practice, culture and power structural arrangements within and among the policy, people and institutions of the MSC. Discussion on the MSC tends to be centred on the technological and commercial without recognizing that technological change relies on concomitant social and political shifts. By succumbing to technology driven views and 'information society' rhetoric, policy makers are allowing real economic and social choices to be smothered. This dissertation argues that instead of presenting technology as something which is external to the society, with a dynamics of its own, and to which society must learn to adapt, effective debate about new technology must acknowledge the related political choices, power relationships and value judgments about the shape and direction of the society using the technology. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop policies to ensure that the economic benefits and social engineering associated with Malaysia&#146;s knowledge economy are managed through participatory and partnership methods at all levels of the country. This research has shown that complex systems analysis can lay the groundwork for a new approach that more accurately represents societal choices and outcomes than past approaches. Few researchers have undertaken complex systems analyses of social systems, with still fewer examining the context of a national public IT policy in a developing country like Malaysia. Further, there are very few thorough public studies done of the MSC itself, with most studies on the MSC either being done in confidence and/or being conducted by foreign consultants appointed by the government or by the Multimedia Development Corporation (MDC). As such, public accessibility to critical studies on the MSC or public documents on them is rarely available. This research, if not the first, is one of the first attempts made to provide a thorough constructive critical study on the MSC policy project since its official launch in 1996. It is also, if not the first, one of the first attempts made to apply the emerging paradigm or the new science of complexity in a real world national policy case study, specifically the MSC policy project. Moreover, there is a huge lacking of research done on behalf of 'marginalized communities'. This research is not carried out on behalf of private enterprise or national governments but rather it is done on behalf of its citizens.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">360203 Research, Science and Technology Policy</field><field name="subject">729901 Technological and organisational innovation</field><field name="subject">Multimedia Super Corridor</field><field name="subject">MSC</field><field name="subject">Malaysia</field><field name="subject">Complexity</field><field name="subject">IT Policy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157967</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Xylophagous Insects: developments in feeding assays</field><field name="creator">Peters, Brenton Charles</field><field name="description">Xylophagous borers and termites that damage "timber-in-service" cause millions of dollars loss annually throughout mainland Australia. I developed field-based feeding assays with practical relevance to preventative action and remedial treatment of infestations of xylophagous insects in the built environment. Essential to this work is facilitating a high termite risk by maintaining an environment conducive to sustained foraging by termites. Feeding assays conducted in low termite risk areas are unduly prolonged, with inherently erratic termite feeding responses. I successfully developed feeding assays with a high termite risk. To establish whether a physical barrier, retrofitted as a sleeve, could prevent termites from damaging wooden poles, eighty poles were established within Beerburrum State Forest, south-east Queensland, Australia. Poles within sets were interconnected with buried timber to facilitate a high risk to Coptotermes acinaciformis (Froggatt). Mesh sleeves to a depth of 1.5m did not prevent termite damage to the poles. Hoop pine Araucaria cunninghamii Ait. ex D.Don dowels ("dip-sticks") were useful termite monitoring devices on the poles. The depth of foraging by termites has implications for the effectiveness of retrofitted physical and chemical barriers in general. Timber quantity and quality has a pivotal influence on the aggregation of large numbers of feeding termites necessary for baiting work and for producing efficacy data of relevance to the protection of timber-in-service from termites. Seasonal variation in termite foraging was examined. Both C. acinaciformis and Coptotermes lacteus (Froggatt) were more active feeding in summer than in autumn. In general, mass loss followed mean ambient temperature. Suppression of C. acinaciformis feeding responses relative to C. lacteus during summer, particularly during January, is thought to be due to excessive temperatures in the containers attached to infested trees. Termite foraging behaviour and responses to both varying masses of softwood timbers and varying exposure times were investigated. The rate of mass loss was independent of the number of test specimens and appeared linear. Colonies regulate the number of foragers directly according to the mass of susceptible timber available. This phenomenon was exploited throughout the remainder of the thesis. Of particular significance was the considerable intra- and inter-specific variation in susceptibility of softwoods to C. acinaciformis and Mastotermes darwiniensis Froggatt. The sapwoods tested were susceptible, but the heartwoods were generally resistant to damage by termites. These data confirm that termites are discriminating feeders, and some more so than others. A novel methodology, developed to maintain an environment conducive to sustained foraging by termites during field-testing, is presented. Consistency in timber acceptance and susceptibility to termites is considered to be important in determining the frequency of inspection and the success of bait systems. I evaluate the termiticidal activity of the bait toxicants hexaflumuron and chlorfluazuron for the management of the subterranean termite C. acinaciformis in the field. The Sentricon&#61650; Colony Elimination System with Baitube&#61650;-devices containing 0.1% and 1% mass/mass (m/m) hexaflumuron bait toxicant in dry wood flour (Recruit&#61650;) was successful in eliminating field colonies of C. acinaciformis. Similarly, the Exterra&#61668; Termite Interception and Baiting System with cellulose-acetate powder containing either 0.05% m/m or 0.25% m/m chlorfluazuron (Requiem&#61668;) eliminated C. acinaciformis. Indicators (including "dip-sticks") used to monitor colony health were reliable. By using C. acinaciformis, which builds mounds (epigeous nests) in northern Australia, I was able to avoid the use of multiple mark-release schemes to verify the effects of the bait toxicant on the termite colonies. Problems with multiple mark-release schemes, used elsewhere in the world, are discussed. I continued the focus on bait quality and placement by evaluating termite responses to two aspects of treated stakes, their attractiveness and their susceptibility. Three experiments were undertaken near Townsville and at Beerburrum, with Coptotermes and Schedorhinotermes. Whilst there were no significant differences in the rate of location and foraging, with respect to treatments, differences in foraging, with respect to C. acinaciformis and Schedorhinotermes seclusus (Hill) were significant. Coptotermes acinaciformis displayed greater foraging site tenacity than S. seclusus at Beerburrum. Increased consumption of bait, due to the addition of a phagostimulant, needs to be observed in the field before an increase in the efficacy of baits in a termite management program can be claimed. In Australia, softwood timbers are extensively used in building construction and are generally highly susceptible to damage by termites. I focussed on field feeding assays to test efficacy of borate-treated softwoods against termites and to define "adequate" protection thresholds. Laboratory and field data reported in the literature were confusing with regard to what constitutes "adequate" protection thresholds. The confusion was compounded by differences in termite species, timber species used and test methodology. Laboratory data indicated a borate loading of 0.5% m/m boric acid equivalent (BAE) would cause &gt; 90% termite mortality and restrict mass loss in test specimens to 5%. Field data generally suggested that borate loadings in excess of 0.5% m/m BAE were required. The main contribution of the work to increasing our understanding of management options for termites in the built environment was in resolving the confusion between laboratory and field data for borate wood-preservatives. These apparently conflicting results were explained by the presence or absence of untreated feeder material in the test environment. In the absence of untreated feeder material, retention of 0.5% BAE provides adequate protection from Coptotermes sp., whereas in the presence of untreated feeder material, increased retentions are required. Furthermore, the retentions required increase with increased amounts of susceptible material. Some termites, Nasutitermes sp. and M. darwiniensis, for example, are borate-tolerant and borate wood-preservatives are not a viable management option. The lack of uniform standards for termite-test methodology and assessment criteria for efficacy across the world is recognized as a difficulty with research into the performance of wood preservatives with termites. The many variables in laboratory and field assays make "prescriptive" standards difficult to recommend. The use of "performance" standards to define efficacy criteria ("adequate" protection) is discussed. Whilst the majority of the work involves subterranean termites ("termites"), I examine the question of how to define a hardwood timber species as "not susceptible" to lyctine beetle damage. Aspects of the biology, behaviour and management of Lyctus brunneus (Stephens) are reviewed and a novel field sampling and testing protocol to establish lyctine susceptibility of timber species is presented. A sound understanding of the biology and behaviour of xylophagous insects in the field is essential to ensure that management options implemented in the built environment have a strong ecological basis. The success of this study in achieving stated aims, the need for further work and the implications for test methodologies in the field with practical relevance to infestations of xylophagous insects in the built environment are discussed.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300603 Pests, Health and Diseases</field><field name="subject">620304 Harvesting and transport of forest products</field><field name="subject">Xylophagous insects</field><field name="subject">borers</field><field name="subject">Lyctus</field><field name="subject">termites</field><field name="subject">Coptotermes</field><field name="subject">Mastotermes</field><field name="subject">Schedorhinotermes</field><field name="subject">field-based feeding assays</field><field name="subject">preventative action</field><field name="subject">remedial treatment</field><field name="subject">bait toxicant</field><field name="subject">attraction</field><field name="subject">susceptibility</field><field name="subject">borate wood-preservatives</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157981</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Expression of hnRNPs A/B in cancer cells and their roles in carcinogenesis</field><field name="creator">He, Yaowu</field><field name="description">The identification of specific and reproducible biomarkers is critical for the early diagnosis of cancer, which has a profound effect the survival rate of patients. Comprehensive laboratory and clinical evidence needs to be collected to confirm the accuracy of the biomarkers prior to their clinical use. Heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) A2 and B1 have been suggested as biomarkers for cancer since 1988 when hnRNP A2/B1 overexpression was first linked with the occurrence of lung cancer. Later studies established a correlation between the expression levels of these hnRNPs and other cancers, such as breast, pancreatic, and lymphatic tumours. In this study, the expression of hnRNPs A1, A2, A3, and B1 has been investigated in various cancer cell lines. hnRNPs A1 and A3, in addition to A2 and B1, were found to be overexpressed in some cancer types. However, the overexpression of none of the hnRNP A/B proteins was universal, and their upregulation may be limited to a few cell types, suggesting they may be effective biomarkers for a subset of cancers. The upregulation of hnRNP A/B proteins in tumours and cancer cell lines led to the hypothesis that they are involved in the uncontrolled cell growth in cancer. According to our Western blot analysis, expression of the hnRNP proteins, A1, A2, and B1, is dependent on the cell cycle whereas no significant change was detected for hnRNP A3, implying that the former three are needed during certain cell cycle stages. The results, together with the transcription factor analysis of the promoter regions of the HNRPA1, HNRPA2, and HNRPA3 genes, suggest that hnRNPs A1, A2, and A3 may have distinct regulatory machineries and cellular functions although they have high amino acid sequence identity. However, their mRNA levels were unchanged across the cell cycle, suggesting the cell-cycle-dependent expression of hnRNPs A1, A2, and B1 is modulated at the translational level. Previous studies showed higher expression of hnRNPs A1 and A2 in rapidly proliferating cells than in quiescent cells, suggesting a role of these proteins in cell proliferation. Though interruption of hnRNP A1 expression did not result in significant change in the viability of murine CB3 cells, simultaneous suppression of hnRNPs A1 and A2 caused apoptosis in a few cell lines. Consistent with this, suppression of hnRNP A1 or A3 expression in our study in Colo16 squamous cells using RNA interference did not affect cell proliferation, but simultaneous suppression of both caused slow cell proliferation. By contrast, reduction of the hnRNP A2 level alone slowed the proliferation of Colo16 cells. These results suggest that although hnRNPs A1, A2, and A3 share some roles in cell proliferation, each of them may have distinct tasks. This conclusion is supported by the data from the comparative analysis of the downstream targets of hnRNPs A1, A2, and A3, which has shown that these three proteins share a limited number of common downstream proteins. The observed impact on cell proliferation of suppressing hnRNP A2 subfamily proteins is in accord with our finding that the downstream targets of hnRNP A2 are overrepresented by genes involved in proliferation regulation, as shown in microarray and real-time PCR analysis. These include cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors, p21 and p27, and their regulatory proteins, such as Skp2 and Rpn10. Skp2 controls the ubiquitination of p21 and p27, and Rpn10 links them to the 26S proteasome, the complex that degrades these two CDK inhibitors. hnRNP A2 also regulates the transcription of securin and separin, which are essential for sister chromatid separation during late anaphase. In addition, hnRNP A2 can also influence cell proliferation through cell growth factors, including fibroblast, vascular endothelial, transforming, and insulin growth factors. Our gene array and real-time PCR analysis have shown that hnRNP A2 regulates the expression of these factors, their receptors, or associated proteins such as IGFBP7 and TGFBR2. The data presented in this thesis link the overexpression of hnRNP A/B proteins, in particular the A2/B1 subfamily, in cancer with their regulatory roles in cell division and cell proliferation. Our findings provide mechanistic evidence that these proteins may be a driving force for the uncontrolled cell growth in cancer, suggesting that some of hnRNP A/B proteins may be potential therapeutic targets for cancer. However, further studies are needed to obtain a global view of the roles of these proteins in cancer.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270201 Gene Expression</field><field name="subject">780105 Biological sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158357</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The limits of liberal justice: Normative constraints on multicultural policies and indigenous policies in Australia</field><field name="creator">Antal, Ildiko Barbara</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the question of the extent to which theories of citizenship, especially as developed in political liberalism, help to formulate an understanding of cultural diversity in relation to political stability and justice.

It has been used by humans to treat and prevent enteric pathogens and to promote wound healing and intestinal repair. Moreover, bovine colostrum has been promoted and used by athletes as a supplement to enhance immune function and improve exercise performance. This is despite limited data in support of its value to athletes and the relative absence of strong data that identify mechanisms that could improve exercise performance and immune function. The aim of the three studies that comprise this thesis was therefore to investigate the influence of a bovine colostrum protein concentrate (CPC) on immune variables, hormone concentrations, autonomic activity and exercise performance in highly-trained endurance cyclists. Study one involved monitoring exercise performance and immune variables during an eight week bovine CPC supplementation period, which included five consecutive days of high-intensity training (HIT). Twenty-nine highly-trained male road cyclists completed an initial 40-km time trial (TT40) and were then randomly assigned to either a supplement (n=14, 10 g bovine CPC per day) or placebo group (n=15, 10 g whey protein concentrate per day). Following five weeks of supplementation, the cyclists completed a second TT40 before undertaking five consecutive days of high-intensity training (HIT) that included another TT40. A final TT40 was completed one week following the HIT. Venous blood and saliva samples were collected immediately before and after each TT40, and upper respiratory illness symptoms were recorded over the experimental period. Supplementation with bovine CPC elicited improvements in TT40 performance at the end of the HIT period, when compared to the placebo group, (1.9&#177;2.2%; mean&#177;90% confidence limits) and maintained ventilatory threshold following the HIT (4.6&#177;4.6%). When compared to the placebo group, bovine CPC supplementation significantly increased pre-exercise serum soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor 1 during the HIT period (p&lt;0.039).

When compared to the placebo group, bovine CPC supplementation significantly increased pre-exercise serum soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor 1 during the HIT period (p&lt;0.039). Supplementation also suppressed the post-exercise decrease in cytotoxic/suppressor T cells during the HIT period (bovine CPC=- 1.0&#177;2.7%, placebo=-9.2&#177;2.8%; mean&#177;SE, p=0.017) and during the following week (bovine CPC=1.4&#177;2.9%, placebo=-8.2&#177;2.8%, p=0.004). In addition, bovine CPC supplementation prevented a post-exercise decrease in serum IgG2 concentration at the end of the HIT period (bovine CPC=4.8&#177;6.8%, p=0.88; placebo=-9.7&#177;6.9%, p=0.013) and there was a trend towards reduced incidence of upper respiratory illness symptoms in the bovine CPC group (p=0.055). Study one demonstrated that low dose bovine CPC supplementation elicited improvements in TT40 performance during a HIT period and maintained ventilatory threshold following five consecutive days of HIT. Supplementation was also found to modulate immune variables during normal training and following an acute period of intense exercise, which may have contributed to the trend toward reduced upper respiratory illness in the bovine CPC group. The maintenance of performance, prevention of post-exercise suppression of IgG2 and cytotoxic/suppressor T cells and increase in anti-inflammatory serum soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor 1 suggest that bovine CPC supplementation is beneficial to cyclists during a period of high-intensity training. The aim of Study two was to investigate the hormonal, immune and autonomic responses of competitive cyclists over a five-day stage race following eight weeks of bovine CPC supplementation. Ten highly-trained male road cyclists were randomly assigned to a placebo (n=6, 10 g whey protein concentrate/day) or bovine CPC group (n=4, 10 g bovine CPC/day). Cyclists provided a baseline saliva sample before commencing supplementation that culminated in a five day competitive cycle race. The cyclists provided daily saliva samples and heart rate variability (HRV) was measured on each day of the race. A Profile of Mood States questionnaire was completed on days one, three and five of the race and cyclists recorded upper respiratory illness symptoms throughout the experimental period. While there was no influence of bovine CPC on salivary IgA, supplementation maintained testosterone concentrations over the competition period (p&lt;0.05) and prevented a decrease in parasympathetic activity (p&lt;0.05). There was also a trend towards improved mood state (p=0.06) in the bovine CPC group. These data indicate that bovine CPC supplementation may prevent disturbances in autonomic function and the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis associated with consecutive days of cycle racing The aim of study three was to assess whether bovine CPC would directly stimulate cytokine production of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), with and without lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and phytohemagglutinin (PHA) stimulation. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was added to cell cultures as a potent enhancer of monocyte and macrophage cytokine release and a model of exercise stress. Phytohemagglutinin was added to PBMC to stimulate T cell proliferation. Blood was sampled from four healthy, male endurance cyclists who had abstained from exercise for 48 hours. PBMC were separated and cultured with bovine CPC concentrations of 0 (control), 1.25, 2.5 and 5% with and without LPS (3&#181;g&#183;mL-1) and PHA (2.5&#181;g&#183;mL-1). Cell supernatants were collected at 6 and 24 hours of culture for the determination of tumour necrosis factor (TNF), interferon (IFN)-y, interleukin (IL)-10, IL-6, IL-4 and IL-2 concentrations. Following six hours of PBMC incubation at 37&#176;C with 5% CO2, IFN-y, IL-10 and IL-2 secretion were increased with increasing concentrations of bovine CPC (p&lt;0.05). In a dose dependent manner, IFN-y and IL-2 remained elevated following 24 hours of incubation (p&lt;0.05). Data from this final study showed that bovine CPC modulates in vitro cytokine production of human PBMC. In conclusion, the present data suggest that bovine CPC supplementation is beneficial to highlytrained cyclists during periods of high-intensity training and competition. Bovine CPC promotes the release of cell mediated cytokines from PBMC and has the potential therefore to influence a number of physiological systems. Supplementation was associated with enhanced recovery over consecutive days of high-intensity training and competition, as evidenced by maintained exercise performance, ventilatory threshold and testosterone concentrations. Bovine CPC modulated immune function, particularly at the end of a HIT period, and there was a trend for reduced incidence of upper respiratory symptoms following bovine CPC supplementation in Study one. The data collectively suggest that bovine CPC supplementation may influence a combination of physiological pathways including the autonomic nervous system and the hypothalamic-pituitary axis.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321401 Exercise Physiology</field><field name="subject">750203 Organised sports</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158236</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electromagnetic analysis and design of high frequency coils for magnetic resonance</field><field name="creator">Xu, Bin</field><field name="description">As the signal to noise ratio (SNR) in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) improves with increasing static magnetic field strength, there is a strong incentive to develop technology to acquire images at higher fields. While magnet technology has made it possible to generate static magnetic fields of 10 T and more, limitations of the radio frequency (RF) hardware prevent the acquisition of high quality images over full regions of interest in clinical applications. Electromagnetic analysis and the design of high frequency RF coils for magnetic resonance are presented in this thesis to attempt to mitigate the limitations of the RF hardware. Analytical and numerical methods are used in this work to analyze the field and frequency behaviors/limits for various RF volume coils in MRI. As the coils&#146; size approach wavelength of operation dimensions, the performance of conventional lumped element design and traditional excitation strategies for these coils, encounter several problems. Field and frequency limits for the traditional RF volume coils are studied to obtain a better understanding of high frequency RF coil designs. Numerical modeling of the excised, fixed human head at the extreme field strength of 11 T is made, which helps to understand the underlying mechanisms for the severe distortions in the MR images in 11T MRI and confirms experimental observations. Results show that the rotating transverse magnetic field (B1) exhibits good homogeneity in air, but strong in-homogeneity with biological loads at 11T. The simulated signal intensity (SI) distribution within the human head confirms that distortions in the experimental images are mainly caused by the field/tissue interactions.. To rapidly simulate RF field behaviour in the human head for MRI applications, Dyadic Green&#146;s function (DGF)/Method of Moments (DGF/MOM) - based solutions of the electromagnetic field (EMFs) inside a head-sized, stratified sphere are presented. Operating profiles are studied with various RF head coils loaded with various head models/phantoms. The RF field behaviour and tissue/field interactions are also obtained by case studies at different frequencies for different coils. New methodologies and innovations on high frequency RF coil design are next investigated. An inverse method with pre-emphasized B1 field is proposed herein, and the method of pre-emphasizing the target field with the consideration of the dielectric materials proved to be encouraging in preliminary designs. The results demonstrate that inverse-method designed coils with pre-emphases of target fields can help in decreasing the notorious bright regions caused by wavelength effects in the human head images at 4T. An 8-element phased array head coil operating at 4T is designed based on a combined idea from reciprocity theorem and inverse method. Using this new method, either circularly or linearly polarized head coils can be designed. The simulation results reported herein demonstrate the feasibility and flexibility of the design concept, which shows that improved B1 field homogeneity is achievable. Another new method in ameliorating image distortion at 11T (470 MHz) MR brain imaging applications uses a shielded 4-element transcieve phased array coil and involves performing 2 separate scans of the same slice with each scan using different excitations during transmission. That is, parallel transmission phase cycling. By optimizing the amplitudes and phases for each set of the scan, signal distortion that is antipodal from one another can be obtained and by combining both images together, image distortion can be alleviated several fold. The simulation results reported herein demonstrate the feasibility of the concept where transmission phase cycling of parallel imaging elements with different excitation pulse reconstruction is theoretically achievable. The strategy of improving the transmitting B1 field homogeneity through active control of source profiles is studied. This method tailors the RF amplitudes and phases applied individually to the rungs of a resonator with the use of an optimization scheme. Numerical simulations are used in an attempt to find optimal source profiles for high frequency RF coils. The simulation results demonstrate the strength of the optimal source profiles for different targets in high field RF coil or phased array designs.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">291500 Biomedical Engineering</field><field name="subject">671402 Medical instrumentation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158139</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Response of Helicoverpa armigera to agricultural environments diversified through companion planting.</field><field name="creator">Renee Herde</field><field name="description">This study investigated the potential of companion planting as a strategy to aid in the management of Helicoverpa armigera in tomato and capsicum cropping systems. The investigaitons showed that a companion planting type system is unlikely to confer any benefits to the management of H. armigera in these crops. The project has contributed to the understanding of H. armigera host selection and how the pest responds to a diversified environment. Companion planting and vegetational diversity are strategies for reducing pest incidence on crops. Many theories have been devised to explain how introducing more than one plant species to a cropping space may reduce the incidence of a pest. Five ecological theories formed the basis of experiments in this study: The resource concentration hypothesis - Herbivores are more likely to find and remain on hosts that are growing in dense or nearly pure stands (Root, 1973). Associational resistance/Plant apparency - Crop plants grown as monocultures are more apparent to herbivorous insects than plants in diverse natural systems (Tahvanainen and Root, 1972). Trap cropping &#8211; the use of plants within a cropping area to attract oviposition away from the main crop (Banks and Ekbom, 1999). The ability of H. armigera to learn in regard to host seleciton (Cunningham et al., 1998a). The natural enemies hypothesis - generalist and specialist natural enemies are expected to be more abundant in diverse rather than simple systems (Root, 1973) A tall variety of sorghum (the forage variety Chopper) was tested for its ability to disrupt host location. Sorghum was planted around plots of tomatoes to act as a screen to disrupt visual cues for host location by Helicoverpa spp. No difference was found in egg numbers on tomatoes with or without sorghum companions. However, significantly higher numbers of Helicoverpa spp. larvae were found in the sorghum at flowering than in the tomatoes. This suggested the sorghum was acting as a trap crop, diverting oviposition away from the tomato crop. However, due to a short period of flowering and therefore peak attractiveness to H. armigera, sorghum was not considered to be a suitable companion plant for inclusion in commercial tomato production systems. A host preference study was conducted to determine the preferences of H. armigera for crop plants and possible companions in the hope of finding a suitable trap crop species. Tomatoes were shown to be a highly preferred plant making it difficult to find a compatible trap crop species that would be more attractive than the main crop. However, capsicums were less prefered and therefore more suitable for this type of experimentation. Marigolds were also found to be a highly preferred plant and formed the basis for further investigations into trap cropping systems. Field experiments were conducted in successive years in two geographical locations to assess the suitability of marigolds as a trap crop for capsicums in a field situation. However, in both years H. armigera incidence was extremely and unusually low leading to inconclusive results. A glasshouse experiment was performed to assess if the ratio of capsicum plants to marigolds plants had an effect on which species H. armigera would choose for oviposition. It was found that as more capsicum plants were introduced, moths became less likely to oviposit on the supposedly more preferred marigold plant. The diminishing attractiveness of a more preferred host in the presence of other hosts is a new observation of H. armigera behaviour. This result suggests that marigolds would be unlikely to be a successful trap crop in a field situation. The ability of H. armigera to learn in regard to host selection and the influence of this on host selection in the field was investigated. No evidence of learning was found. This was the first study investigating the effect of learning in a field situation; previously the behaviour had only been investigated in a laboratory situation (Cunningham, et al. 1998a). The ability of the Australian assassin bug, Pristhesancus plagipennis (Walker) (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) to predate H. armigera larvae on capsicum plants was investigated. This predator has been sucessfully been used for H. armigera management in cotton (Grundy, 2000b), but had not been investigated in horticultural crops. Significant reductions in larvae were achieved in treatments where assassin bugs were introduced. This predator warrants further investigation for inclusion in commercial integrated pest managment programs for capsicums. Pest repellent plants were also considered. Previous to this study, very little research work had been conducted on repellent plants for H. armigera. The herbs investigated were catnip (Nepta cataria), tansy (Tanacetum vulgare), basil (Ocium basilicum) and coriander (Coriander sativum). An olfactometer system was designed and built to test H. armigera moths&#8217; responses to odours from the herbs. Glasshouse experiments were also conducted. No repellent activity was recorded with any of the herbs tested. The results of this study support the theory that Helicoverpa spp. employ a strategy of passive host selection as suggested by Firempong (1986). This means that all available plants in an area may be oviposited on with successful ovipostion and larval development leading to the future utilisation of a species as a host plant. The implication of this finding is that in-field trap cropping is unlikely to be a successful strategy for reducing H. armigera oviposition in tomato or capsicum production systems in Australia. In cotton crops in Australia, trap cropping is used as part of an area wide management strategy and aims to reduce the total Helicoverpa spp. population of a region. Such a strategy may also be successful in horticultural crops but only with the full participation of the growers of all crops that are attractive to H. armigera in a horticultural growing region. Due to the diverse nature of horticultural production this may be a difficult task.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences</field><field name="subject">Helicoverpa armigera, companion planting, trap cropping, learning, marigold, host selection, repellent plants, Pristhesancus plagipennis</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:183732</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New Insights into Diffusion-Controlled Bimolecular Termination using &#8216;Controlled/Living&#8217; Radical Polymerisation</field><field name="creator">Geoffrey Johnston-hall</field><field name="description">Free-radical polymerisation (FRP) has been one of the most important techniques for producing materials used in a very wide variety of applications and has enhanced the lives of millions of people around the world. However, for many years a number of fundamental questions regarding the key kinetic processes involved in FRP have remained unresolved. In particular, an accurate description of the mechanism for diffusion-controlled bimolecular termination has proven elusive. As a result, conventional modelling tools for FRP have often proven unreliable. The aim of this thesis, therefore, was to accurately study the evolution of the bimolecular termination rate coefficient during free radical polymerisation using a new and more accurate methodology based on &#8216;controlled/living&#8217; reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerisation. This was undertaken in order to develop a more precise understanding of bimolecular termination and thereby develop a more reliable modeling approach capable of predicting the rates of reaction and evolution of molecular weight distributions for a wide range of experimental conditions and a wide range of functional monomers. The RAFT-CLD-T (RAFT Chain-Length-Dependent Termination) Method was used to determine accurate values for the conversion and chain-length-dependent termination rate coefficient, kti,i(x), as a function of various parameters. These parameters included the chain size, i, polymer concentration (or conversion, x), chain length size distribution and chain architecture/structure. The accuracy of the RAFT-CLD-T Method was crucial to this work, therefore, an important part of this thesis was devoted to evaluating the reliability of this technique. Below 5 % conversion and above 80 % conversion the method was found to be unreliable due to the effects of chain-length-dependent propagation, high PDI&#8217;s and short-long termination. However, between 5 % and 80 % conversion it was found that the method is extremely robust and a series of easy-to-use experimental guidelines were determined for accurately applying the RAFT-CLD-T Method. The effects of chain size, chain size distribution, solution polymer concentration, and matrix architecture were examined for the RAFT-mediated polymerisations of methyl methacrylate (MMA), styrene (STY) and methyl acrylate (MA). It was found that four distinct scaling regimes of termination are observed: (1) a &#8216;short&#8217; chain dilute solution regime, (2) a &#8216;long&#8217; chain dilute solution regime, (3) a semi-dilute solution regime and (4) a concentrated solution regime. In dilute polymer solutions, chain-length-dependent power law exponents, &#61537;&#8217;s, determined during the polymerisation of MMA, STY and MA (where kti,i(x) &#61621; i-&#61537;) indicated that termination follows two major scaling regimes with exponents of approximately ~0.5 to 0.6 for &#8216;short&#8217; chains and and ~0.12 to 0.16 for &#8216;long&#8217; chains. Importantly, these exponents are in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions for translational and segmental diffusion-controlled termination, respectively. At increasing polymer concentrations, kti,i(x) falls rapidly coinciding with the onset of the gel effect. By comparing results from the RAFT-mediated polymerisations of MMA, STY, MA, and vinyl acetate (VAc) with theoretical models, we found that the onset of the gel effect coincided closely with the theoretical onset of chain overlap. Considerable uncertainty has plagued the evaluation of this phenomenon, but using a difunctional RAFT agent we showed this uncertainty arises from the influence of broad MWD&#8217;s on chain overlap and short-long termination. Finally, critical tests of this theory involving the bimolecular termination of linear radicals in solutions of star polymer confirmed that the gel effect coincided with chain overlap. Beyond the gel effect termination slows enormously, passing through the &#8216;semi-dilute solution&#8217; regime and into the &#8216;concentrated solution&#8217;. In semi-dilute solution, theoretical predictions based on scaling theory (i.e. the &#8216;blob&#8217; model) were in excellent agreement with results for the polymerisation of PSTY in linear and star polymer solutions, indicating that the solvent quality diminished both with increasing chain length and through the addition of a star polymer matrix. In concentrated solutions, the chain-length-dependent power law exponent increased linearly with conversion. For example, for MMA the chain length dependence of kt in the gel regime scaled as &#61537;gel = 1.8x + 0.056, suggesting that reptation alone does not describe termination in the concentrated solution. Values of &#61537;gel for PSTY, MA, and VAc were in similar agreement, indicating that a mechanism intermediate between unentangled and entangled semi-dilute scaling laws applies in the concentrated solution regime. Interestingly, &#61537;gel values for these monomers were found to decrease with increasing chain flexibility in the order &#61537;gel(MMA)&gt; &#61537;gel(STY)&gt; &#61537;gel(VAc)&gt; &#61537;gel(MA), suggesting matrix mobility is rate determining in concentrated solutions. Similarly, &#61537;gel values were also larger in star polymer solutions, coinciding with decreasing matrix mobility. Thus, although it has been commonly believed that polymer chains diffuse via reptation above the gel effect, these results show that this only occurs for solutions containing rigid and/or highly immobile macromolecules and in very high concentrations. To describe these behaviours, a semi-empirical &#8216;composite kt model&#8217; was also developed to describe kti,i(x) as a function of i and x up to high conversions. We showed that the model is very simple to implement and accurate for modelling a wide range of functional monomers and experimental conditions. In particular, we showed the method was accurate for modelling RAFT-mediated polymerisations of a very wide range of monomers (MA, MMA, and PSTY) and was even accurate for modelling conventional FRP&#8217;s. Thus, the model provides a simple, flexible and accurate method for predicting the rate of reaction and evolution of molecular weight distributions across a range of experimental conditions based on accurate kti,i(x) values.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Radical Reactions</field><field name="subject">Kinetics</field><field name="subject">Diffusion</field><field name="subject">Bimolecular Termination</field><field name="subject">Reversible Addition-Fragmentation Chain Transfer</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:183739</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Communist Party and trade union work in Queensland in the third period: 1928-1935</field><field name="creator">Penrose, Beris Gene</field><field name="description" /><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1606 Political Science</field><field name="subject">Communist Party of Australia -- History</field><field name="subject">Labor unions and communism -- Queensland -- History.</field><field name="subject">Depressions -- 1929 -- Queensland</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185197</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental factors affecting teaching and learning in North Queensland, 1875-1905</field><field name="creator">De Jabrun, Mary</field><field name="description" /><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">13 Education</field><field name="subject">330102 History and Philosophy of Education</field><field name="subject">Public schools -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Education -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Queensland -- Social conditions -- 1788-1900</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:186226</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring host response to bacterial infection</field><field name="creator">Yi Xin Ye</field><field name="description">Much of our current mechanistic understanding of the innate immune response in animals has grown out of empirical work in insect models, especially the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. The mainstream understanding of the fly immune response to bacteria has been that it exists in two parts; a cellular and a humoral response. Drosophila also harbor substantial genetic variation for antibacterial defense and investment in immunity is thought to involve a costly trade-off with life history traits, including development, life-span and reproduction. My first study (chapter 2) aimed to understand the way in which insects invest in fighting bacterial infection. We selected for survival following systemic infection with the opportunistic pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in wild-caught D. melanogaster over 10 generations. We then examined genome wide changes in expression in the selected flies relative to unselected controls, both of which had been infected with the pathogen to specifically identify the genetic basis of the evolved immune response. In response to selection, population level survivorship to infection increased from 15% to 70%. The evolved capacity for defense was costly as evidenced by reduced longevity and larval viability and a rapid loss of the trait once selection pressure was removed. Counter to expectation, we observed more rapid developmental rates in the selected flies. Selection associated changes in expression of genes with dual involvement in developmental and immune pathways suggest pleiotropy as a possible mechanism for the positive correlation. We also found that both the Toll and Imd pathways work synergistically to limit infectivity and that cellular immunity plays a more critical role in overcoming P. aeruginosa infection than previously reported. Females usually produce a more robust immune response and are often less susceptible to infection. This female bias has been documented in humans, mice and some birds and reptiles. The most common explanation is that males increase their mating success at the cost of immune investment whilst females invest in immunity to maximize life-time egg production. In insects, however, there is growing evidence of male-biased immune performance. Using fly survival data from my first study, I found that males exhibited higher post-infection survival than females. In my second study (chapter 3), I related these differences in survival rate to changes in gene transcription. Firstly, we examined the expression of a set of immunity genes in both sexes in the presence and absence of infection. We found that male-biased survival may be partially attributable to a higher baseline expression of immune genes in males. Contrary to previous published work, we found that immune gene expression was readily induced in flies upon exposure to P. aeruginosa and that the two sexes responded in a similar manner. Lastly, we found that selection altered the expression of genes in males alone and only in the presence of infection. Together our findings suggest a superior immune response in male Drosophila. Wolbachia pipientis is an obligate intracellular bacterium capable of spreading itself through populations by manipulating the reproduction of its hosts. The Wolbachia strain wMelPop, which reduces longevity in D. melanogaster, has been introduced into the Dengue virus mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti, as a strategy to reduce disease transmission. The infecting Wolbachia halve the lifespan of the mosquito and induce numerous behavioral and physiological abnormalities including heightened locomotor activity and an age dependent reduction in blood feeding success. In my third study (chapter 4), we aimed to understand the mechanism underpinning these changes and hence chose to explore how Wolbachia may be interacting with the insect&#8217;s nervous and muscle tissue. Because wMelPop over-replicates in Drosophila, first we measured the bacterial density in A. aegypti. We found that there was a relationship between some of the feeding associated defects in the mosquito and the density of Wolbachia in the nervous and muscle tissue. Next, we carried out a series whole genome profiling experiments based on the head and muscle tissues to identify mosquito pathways affected by the microbe. Key findings that may relate to the phenotypes of interest include increased expression of genes relating to muscle contraction and synthesis of the neurotransmitter dopamine. Other novel findings that may not relate directly to the phenotypes of interest include evidence of a strong local tissue based immune response and widespread changes in expression of mosquito methylation and acetylation associated genes. We then used then amplification of inter-methylated sites (AIMS test) to obtain DNA fingerprints representative of the methylome of A. aegypti infected and uninfected with wMelPop. The presence of wMelPop caused hypermethylation in loci where they were not methylated in uninfected mosquitoes.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Drosophila, Aedes, Pseudomonas, Wolbachia, innate immunity, host-pathogen interaction, evolution, selection, gene expression</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:211643</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Left Ventricular Diastolic (Dys)Function in Sepsis</field><field name="creator">David Sturgess</field><field name="description">BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a clinical syndrome characterised by the systemic response to infection. It is a common problem in modern intensive care units and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Though the underlying cause of death is often multifactorial, refractory hypotension and cardiovascular collapse are frequently observed in the terminal phases of the condition. The aetiology of these cardiovascular abnormalities is complex but appears to be mediated by a circulating factor(s). The impact of sepsis upon left ventricular systolic function has been studied extensively. This may be because it is more readily assessed than diastolic function. Despite being increasingly appreciated as a contributor to morbidity and mortality in other clinical settings, there are scant data regarding the evaluation of left ventricular diastolic function in sepsis. Review of the haemodynamic monitoring literature reveals that many conventional measures of left ventricular filling, intravascular volume status and fluid responsiveness are influenced by ventricular diastolic (dys)function, such that interpretation can be challenging in critical care settings. In addition, many available techniques, such as pulmonary artery catheterisation, are invasive and potentially associated with risk to the patient. More robust and less invasive measures of left ventricular diastolic function and filling that can be applied within the intensive care unit (ICU) must be developed. The use of cardiac biomarkers, such as B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), might represent a novel approach to evaluating left ventricular diastolic function and filling. BNP is released by the myocardium in response to wall stretch/tension. It has demonstrated value in the emergency department diagnosis of heart failure but interpretation of plasma BNP concentrations in critical care remains problematic. At least in part, this appears to relate to the significant number of potential confounders in patients with critical illness. Associations between BNP concentration and diastolic function have not previously been evaluated in severe sepsis and septic shock. The overall aim of this thesis is to investigate the usefulness of plasma BNP concentration in the evaluation of left ventricular diastolic function (including ventricular filling) in severe sepsis and septic shock. DIASTOLIC (DYS)FUNCTION IN SEPSIS: Review of the literature reveals that sepsis is associated with a spectrum of diastolic dysfunction. Characterisation of diastolic function in sepsis is challenging. In this regard, tissue Doppler imaging (TDI), offers promise. TDI is an echocardiographic technique that measures myocardial velocities, which are low frequency, high-amplitude signals filtered from conventional Doppler imaging. TDI has gained acceptance amongst cardiologists in the evaluation of diastolic function, particularly as a measure of ventricular relaxation and ventricular filling pressure; however, there are scant data regarding its use in critical care. We analysed echocardiographs from a large heterogeneous cohort of consecutive ICU patients (n=94) who had TDI as part of their clinically requested echocardiography. As well as supporting the feasibility of TDI in critically ill and mechanically ventilated patients, we demonstrated a wide range of TDI variables and a high prevalence of diastolic dysfunction using this modality. RODENT MODELS OF SEPSIS: We also sought to adapt, refine and evaluate rodent models of sepsis. Such models would allow control for a multitude of potential confounders commonly encountered in clinical sepsis. Two commonly employed rodent models of sepsis include caecal ligation and perforation (CLP) and endotoxin infusion. Comparison between CLP, sham and control groups demonstrated no difference in TDI or BNP. The observed changes in echocardiographic diastolic variables did not reflect those expected in sepsis and may be best explained by increases in heart rate rather than diastolic dysfunction per se. Endotoxaemia was associated with changes consistent with impaired myocardial relaxation (TDI) and reversible myocardial injury (histopathology), as expected in sepsis. BNP did not change significantly from baseline. This might be explained by the potential influence of fluid management upon BNP secretion. CLINICAL RESEARCH: The prediction of fluid responsiveness potentially prevents ineffective, excessive or deleterious intravenous fluid administration. Prospective evaluation of plasma BNP concentration in patients with septic shock found that it was not a predictor of a fluid responsive state. Furthermore, elevated BNP did not rule out a favourable response and therefore does not contraindicate a fluid challenge. Both impaired diastolic dysfunction, especially E/e&#8217;, and elevated BNP, have been associated with excess mortality in a range of cardiovascular diseases. These have not previously been compared in septic shock. In a cohort of patients with septic shock, E/e&#8217; was a stronger predictor of mortality than cardiac biomarkers, including BNP. Fluid balance was an independent predictor of BNP in septic shock. OVERALL CONCLUSION: BNP appears not to be clinically useful in the evaluation of ventricular filling or diastolic function in sepsis. The association with fluid balance is a new finding and should be evaluated in a wider range of critically ill patients. In contrast to BNP, TDI appears to be a promising bedside tool in the evaluation of diastolic function and should be further evaluated in critical care.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Critical care</field><field name="subject">Sepsis</field><field name="subject">Biological Markers</field><field name="subject">B-type Natriuretic Peptide</field><field name="subject">Haemodynamics</field><field name="subject">Diastole</field><field name="subject">Echocardiography</field><field name="subject">Tissue Doppler</field><field name="subject">elasticity imaging techniques</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:211787</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Computer Aided Analysis of Dynamic Contrast Enhanced MRI of Breast Cancer</field><field name="creator">Yaniv Gal</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a novel set of image analysis tools developed for the purpose of assisting radiologists with the task of detecting and characterizing breast lesions in image data acquired using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI is increasingly being used in the clinical setting as an adjunct to x-ray mammography (which is, itself, the basis of breast cancer screening programs worldwide) and ultrasound. Of these imaging modalities, MRI has the highest sensitivity to invasive cancer and to multifocal disease. MRI is the most reliable method for assessing tumour size and extent compared to the gold standard histopathology. It also shows great promise for the improved screening of younger women (with denser, more radio opaque breasts) and, potentially, for women at high risk. Breast MRI presently has two major shortcomings. First, although its sensitivity is high its specificity is relatively poor; i.e. the method detects many false positives. Second, the method involves acquiring several high-resolution image volumes before, during and after the injection of a contrast agent. The large volume of data makes the task of interpretation by the radiologist both complex and time-consuming. These shortcomings have motivated the research and development of the computer-aided detection systems designed to improve the efficiency and accuracy of interpretation by the radiologist. Whilst such systems have helped to improve the sensitivity/specificity of interpretation, it is the premise of this thesis that further gains are possible through automated image analysis. However, the automated analysis of breast MRI presents several technical challenges. This thesis investigates several of these, noise filtering, parametric modelling of contrast enhancement, segmentation of suspicious tissue and quantitative characterisation and classification of suspicious lesions. In relation to noise filtering, a new denoising algorithm for dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE-MRI) data is presented, called the Dynamic Non-Local Means (DNLM). The DCE-MR image data is inherently contaminated by Rician noise and, additionally, the limited acquisition time per volume and the use of fat-suppression diminishes the signal-to-noise ratio. The DNLM algorithm, specifically designed for the DCE-MRI, is able to attenuate this noise by exploiting the redundancy of the information between the different temporal volumes, while taking into account the contrast enhancement of the tissue. Empirical results show that the algorithm more effectively attenuates noise in the DCE-MRI data than any of the previously proposed algorithms. In relation to parametric modelling of contrast enhancement, a new empiric model of contrast enhancement has been developed that is parsimonious in form. The proposed model serves as the basis for the segmentation and feature extraction algorithms presented in the thesis. In contrast to pharmacokinetic models, the proposed model does not rely on measured parameters or constants relating to the type or density of the tissue. It also does not assume a particular relationship between the observed changes in signal intensity and the concentration of the contrast agent. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed model fits real data better than either the Tofts or Brix models and equally as well as the more complicated Hayton model. In relation to the automatic segmentation of suspicious lesions, a novel method is presented, based on seeded region growing and merging, using criteria based on both the original image MR values and the fitted parameters of the proposed model of contrast enhancement. Empirical results demonstrate the efficacy of the method, both as a tool to assist the clinician with the task of locating suspicious tissue and for extracting quantitative features. Finally, in relation to the quantitative characterisation and classification of suspicious lesions, a novel classifier (i.e. a set of features together with a classification method) is presented. Features were extracted from noise-filtered and segmented-image volumes and were based both on well-known features and several new ones (principally, on the proposed model of contrast enhancement). Empirical results, based on routine clinical breast MRI data, show that the resulting classifier performs better than other such classifiers reported in the literature. Therefore, this thesis demonstrates that improvements in both sensitivity and specificity are possible through automated image analysis.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Magnetic Resonance Imaging</field><field name="subject">Dynamic Contrast Enhanced</field><field name="subject">MRI</field><field name="subject">DCE-MRI</field><field name="subject">breast cancer</field><field name="subject">denoising</field><field name="subject">Segmentation</field><field name="subject">lesion classification</field><field name="subject">medical image analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:212826</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cancer-Related Fatigue and its Management in Adults Undergoing Radiotherapy Treatment</field><field name="creator">Amanda Purcell</field><field name="description">People diagnosed with cancer or undergoing cancer treatment experience a wide range of symptoms.

Cancer-related fatigue is distressing and can persist beyond the treatment phase or the disease itself. Current understanding of cancer-related fatigue and its management is limited. Further developing our knowledge of cancer-related fatigue may lead to innovative means of improving the identification, prediction and management of this troublesome symptom. To this end, this thesis aims to: I) identify factors reported to have a relationship with cancer-related fatigue; II) examine the course of cancer-related fatigue during and after radiotherapy; III) determine a method of detecting clinically meaningful change in fatigue; IV) examine whether correlates of fatigue are consistent across all fatigue dimensions or whether each dimension has its own unique pattern of correlates; and, V) develop and trial a group-based educational intervention to target cancer-related fatigue. To address Aim I in this thesis, relevant literature was reviewed to identify factors which potentially influence cancer-related fatigue. Factors identified include underlying medical factors (biomedical mechanisms, disease-related factors, treatment-related factors and comorbid conditions); physical or behavioural factors (poor nutrition, decreased activity, sleep disturbance, pain); psychological factors (anxiety and depression); and sociodemographic factors (social support, employment and education). The range of inter-related factors identified makes cancer-related fatigue a challenging condition to manage. The factors associated with cancer-related fatigue were synthesized into the Fatigue Framework to provide a clinically useful format for health professionals working with people with cancer. The Fatigue Framework was used to guide the remainder of the research into cancer-related fatigue presented in this thesis. This research consists of two main studies; a prospective longitudinal cohort study (to address Aims II, III, IV) and a randomised controlled trial (to address Aim V). The first study in this research examined the factors and effects associated with cancer-related fatigue in a radiotherapy population (n=210). Patients undergoing radiotherapy were recruited for a single-centre prospective longitudinal cohort study. Participants were assessed using a battery of assessments at three time points, at the start of radiotherapy, the end of radiotherapy and six weeks after radiotherapy completion. The results of this study were used to address Aim II, to identify the pattern of fatigue over the course of radiotherapy. The level of fatigue reported was shown to significantly increase from start to the end of radiotherapy and then significantly decrease from the end of radiotherapy to six weeks post-treatment for each subscale of the MFI. The results of this study were also used to address Aim III, to determine a method of detecting clinically meaningful change in fatigue. Whilst there are many tools used to assess cancer-related fatigue, the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI) was the assessment chosen for use in this research study and throughout this thesis. The MFI is one of the few fatigue assessments that takes the various clinical dimensions of fatigue into account and has established reliability and validity. However, unlike other fatigue assessments, there were no published minimal clinically important difference (MCID) criteria for its use in cancer populations. MCID criteria determine the smallest change in scores that can be regarded as important, allowing clinicians and researchers to interpret the meaning of changes in patients&#8217; fatigue scores. Determination of the MCID was based on the relationship of MFI scores to four clinically relevant constructs: (1) treatment impact on fatigue, (2) health-related quality of life, (3) performance status and (4) occupational productivity. These constructs were used as external or anchor-based measures to determine a MCID for each sub-scale of the MFI. Multiple MCID criteria were identified through the first study, each from a different perspective based on the anchor-based construct used. However, a two-point reference for each MFI sub-scale was suggested as a generic MCID as it was most consistent across the anchors examined. The MCID criteria validated in this study allow better interpretation of changes in MFI sub-scale scores and allow effect size calculations for determining sample size in future studies. The MFI allows assessment of multiple dimensions of fatigue (general fatigue, physical fatigue, reduced activity, reduced motivation and mental fatigue). Minimal previous research had considered the differential effect of symptom correlates on individual dimensions of fatigue. The data of the prospective cohort study were further utilised to address Aim IV, to determine whether correlates of fatigue were consistent across all dimensions or whether each fatigue dimension had its own unique pattern of correlates. Results indicated that each dimension of fatigue was associated with a different pattern of correlates supporting the concept of multiple dimensions of fatigue. This enhanced understanding of fatigue could be used to guide the development of individually tailored interventions to target specific correlates of fatigue in affected domains, or group interventions to address all relevant fatigue correlates. Because fatigue is associated with multiple symptom correlates, it requires multi-focused symptom management. Education is a commonly recommended fatigue management strategy which can be used to target multiple symptoms simultaneously. There is a lack of information about the content and format used in education programs and the effectiveness of education in managing fatigue. The second study in this thesis addressed Aim V, to develop and trial a group-based educational intervention to target cancer-related fatigue. The study examined a group-based educational intervention (CAN-FIT) targeting cancer-related fatigue in radiotherapy patients. A pilot study of the intervention&#8217;s feasibility and acceptability indicated the intervention was acceptable to participants and its operation was feasible. Small modifications to program components were made based on participant feedback. A randomised controlled trial was then conducted to examine effectiveness of the CAN-FIT program and to ascertain the most effective timing for such an educational intervention. The study employed a factorial design and recruited 110 participants. Assessments were conducted at three time points, the start of radiotherapy, the end of radiotherapy and six weeks after the completion of radiotherapy. Results of the randomised controlled trial of CAN-FIT did not show a significant effect of the program on cancer-related fatigue levels, however the pre-radiotherapy education sessions were associated with significant increases in physical activity participation. Furthermore, the study demonstrated the delivery of education prior to radiotherapy was more effective than delivery after radiotherapy. This thesis successfully addresses its stated aims and provides a greater understanding of the concept of cancer-related fatigue. The results more clearly describe the course and correlates of fatigue and their relationship with the dimensions of fatigue. The MCID criteria for the MFI can be used in future research to evaluate outcomes and determine sample size in power calculations. The intervention trialled can be used in clinical practice to provide a low-resource intervention to improve activity levels without any subsequent change in fatigue in radiotherapy patients. Together these studies build upon current knowledge and provide directions for future research to address this difficult symptom.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cancer</field><field name="subject">fatigue</field><field name="subject">occupational therapy</field><field name="subject">multidimensional</field><field name="subject">Minimal clinically important difference</field><field name="subject">Group-based intervention</field><field name="subject">patient education</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:212836</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Conservation genetics of the koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) in Queensland and Northeast New South Wales</field><field name="creator">Kristen Lee</field><field name="description">The koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) is an iconic Australian marsupial that is the sole extant representative of the Family Phascolarctidae and forms part of the mammalian fauna in four Australian States and one Territory. There has been a significant decline in the range and distribution of the koala since European settlement, with habitat loss and its associated threats, including vehicle strikes, dog attacks and disease, continuing to reduce population numbers. Koalas provide the tourism industry and the Australian economy with revenue up to $1 billion per annum with 80 zoos and wildlife parks around the country displaying koalas. Koalas were introduced to a number of islands in southern Australia the early 20th century, in an attempt to &#8216;save&#8217; them from near extinction due to habitat loss, hunting and disease. While populations on Queensland islands remain stable and require no management intervention, introduced populations on southern Australian islands show extremely low levels of genetic diversity yet have grown substantially and require constant monitoring and management to overcome overabundance and starvation associated with defoliation of food trees. The only known extant, naturally occurring, island population of koalas is on North Stradbroke Island in Southeast Queensland&#8217;s Moreton Bay. Infection with bacteria of the Family Chlamydiacae is at high prevalence in most koala populations but the resulting diseases are generally of low prevalence in koalas in Southeast Queensland and New South Wales. The role of the koala retrovirus (KoRV) in relation to infectious diseases is not fully understood, but it has been identified from all northern koala populations and the majority of southern koala populations though, like chlamydial infection, it is not usually associated with high disease prevalence. The major histocompatability complex (MHC) is a gene family in mammals that is vital for its role in disease resistance and so may play a role in disease susceptibility in koalas. This study provided detailed information about the genetic diversity and population structuring of the mainland koala population in Southeast Queensland, which is amongst the most threatened of koala populations because of anthropogenic disturbance. Microsatellite genotyping of 512 samples and mitochondrial DNA sequencing of a subset of 77 samples collected from sick, injured and dead koalas showed that in Southeast Queensland koalas had high microsatellite diversity (12.8 alleles/locus, He = 0.81) and at least 16 mitochondrial haplotypes. Population genetic analysis revealed six genetically differentiated clusters consistent with the existence of biogeographic and anthropogenic barriers like rivers and highways. The Koala Coast, an area in Southeast Queensland that provides habitat for one of the most significant natural koala populations in Australia was found to be genetically distinct from adjacent areas; the rapid decline of this population means it meets the criteria for classification as &#8220;Endangered Wildlife&#8221; under Queensland&#8217;s Nature Conservation Act 1992. Climatic patterns of warming and cooling that produced the disappearance and reappearance of rainforests is likely to have affected long term koala distribution in coastal eastern Australia &#8211; expansion into drier forests when they were available and restriction to refugia during times of rainforest dominance. The koala population in Northeast New South Wales, which has conventionally been classified as a different subspecies to the koalas in Southeast Queensland, has colonised an extensive part of the area since the destruction of the &#8220;Big Scrub&#8221; rainforest. This forest occupied about 75,000 ha before European settlement and would almost certainly have represented a natural barrier to the movement of koalas as it was unsuitable habitat due to its lack of suitable food trees. Population structuring analysis identified two major genetic clusters in the region, the northernmost of which was less differentiated from koalas sampled on the Gold Coast in Southeast Queensland than the southernmost cluster. The southern cluster, largely found around the city of Lismore, had significantly lower diversity than the northern cluster, consistent with a southward radiating colonisation pathway. Ninety-six percent (96%) of koalas in Northeast New South Wales shared the same mitochondrial DNA haplotype, which was the most common haplotype in Southeast Queensland. There was, therefore, little evidence to support the subspecies delineation of coastal koalas in Southeast Queensland and Northeast New South Wales. From a comparison between wild, mainland populations and two captive koala colonies in Southeast Queensland, genetic diversity in 106 captive koalas was found to be similar to the local wild populations (Dreamworld 9.2 alleles/locus, He = 0.75, Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary 10.2 alleles/locus, He = 0.80). Microsatellite alleles in captive koalas were, in general, representative of the local wild populations and of similar frequencies, but the captive koalas possessed mitochondrial DNA haplotypes that were not found in the local wild koalas. Some of the original founders of the captive populations were not from Southeast Queensland so these different mitochondrial haplotypes are likely remnants of the koala genotypes at the original founders&#8217; locations. The preservation of habitat and reduction of consequential threats to the koala&#8217;s long term survival in the wild are the most fundamental aspects of koala conservation in this region. However, the successful preservation of high genetic diversity at neutral loci in the captive colonies studied indicates that ex situ measures incorporating a captive breeding program could potentially be used as reservoirs for important genetic material should such an approach become necessary in the context of the drastic and accelerating decline towards local extinction of key Southeast Queensland koala populations. Urgent action would be essential to obtain a representative sample of current genetic diversity (both genomic and mitochondrial), given the drastic rate of decline. Island populations of organisms are expected to show reduced genetic diversity compared to their mainland counterparts because of factors such as founder effects and the increased susceptibility of small populations to the effects of genetic drift. A comparison of genetic diversity was made between the naturally occurring North Stradbroke Island koala population in Southeast Queensland and the introduced populations on St Bees, Brampton, Newry and Rabbit Islands in central Queensland with the mainland populations. As expected, the island populations had lower genetic diversity than mainland populations, however, the introduced St Bees Island population had higher mean number of alleles and expected heterozygosity (5.7 alleles/locus, He = 0.67) than the naturally occurring population on North Stradbroke Island (3.7 alleles/locus, He = 0.55). Anecdotal evidence suggests that the koala populations on Brampton, Newry and Rabbit Islands off the central Queensland coast were established by the unauthorised transfer of koalas from St Bees Island. Mitochondrial DNA haplotype analysis supports this claim however, the most likely explanations for the presence of at least four microsatellite alleles in the Brampton, Newry and Rabbit Island populations that were not found in St Bees Island koalas are that either there were additional introductions from elsewhere or that koalas were already present on these islands prior to the transfers from St Bees Island. A study on the prevalence of chlamydial and retroviral infection in captive and wild koalas showed that 100% of koalas in this study had retroviral and chlamydial infection in at least one tested swab site. None of the captive animals showed clinical signs of disease despite the high prevalence of infection. Signs of disease were evident in some wild koalas, which, in some cases, was the reason for their admission to Moggill Koala Hospital for treatment. In an attempt to understand the immunological mechanisms underlying the apparent disease resistance of koalas which usually limits latent infection progressing to clinical disease states, the MHC genes of koalas were investigated. Low variation at MHC loci is thought to increase susceptibility to infectious diseases because fewer foreign antigens are recognised. The first class II sequences identified from koalas are presented here and showed variation. Variation was also detected at exon 3 of class I, with evidence for at least three class I loci. The koala is a unique Australian marsupial that makes a nationally significant contribution to the Australian economy annually. The results of this study have important conservation and management implications for koala populations in Southeast Queensland and Northeast New South Wales - particularly declining populations in Southeast Queensland - as well as being informative on other aspects of the species&#8217; biology and for mammalian conservation genetics, generally.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Koala</field><field name="subject">Genetic</field><field name="subject">Island</field><field name="subject">Captive</field><field name="subject">Chlamydiacae</field><field name="subject">Mhc</field><field name="subject">Habitat Fragmentation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:213092</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Performance characteristics of ammonium nitrate/fuel explosives</field><field name="creator">Hagan, T.

There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Communist Party and trade union work in Queensland in the third period: 1928-1935</field><field name="creator">Penrose, Beris Gene</field><field name="description" /><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1606 Political Science</field><field name="subject">Communist Party of Australia -- History</field><field name="subject">Labor unions and communism -- Queensland -- History.</field><field name="subject">Depressions -- 1929 -- Queensland</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185197</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vision screening of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island children in far north Queensland</field><field name="creator">Tourky, Afaf</field><field name="description" /><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1113 Ophthalmology and Optometry</field><field name="subject">111701 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health</field><field name="subject">Children, Aboriginal Australian</field><field name="subject">Torres Strait Islander children</field><field name="subject">Vision -- Testing</field><field name="subject">Vision disorders in children -- Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:186233</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental factors affecting teaching and learning in North Queensland, 1875-1905</field><field name="creator">De Jabrun, Mary</field><field name="description" /><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">13 Education</field><field name="subject">330102 History and Philosophy of Education</field><field name="subject">Public schools -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Education -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Queensland -- Social conditions -- 1788-1900</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:186226</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dr Alfred Jefferis Turner, 1861-1947 : his contribution to medicine in Queensland</field><field name="creator">Thearle, M.

Nonlinear behaviour: the component parts do not act in linear ways, that is the superposition of the actions of the parts is not the output of the system. 2. Emergent behaviour: the output of the system may be inexpressible in terms of the rules or equations of the component parts. 3. Self-organisation: order appears from the chaotic interactions of individuals and the rules they obey. 4. Layers of description: in which a rule may apply at some higher levels of description but not at lower layers. 5. Adaptation: in which the environment becomes encoded in the rules governing the structure and/or behaviour of the parts (in this case strictly agents) that undergo selection in which those that are by some measure better become more numerous than those that are not as &#8220;fit&#8221;. A single cell is a complex system: we cannot explain all of its behaviour as simply the sum of its parts. Similarly, DNA structures, social networks, cancers, the brain, and living beings are intricate complex systems. This thesis tackles all of these topics from a complex systems approach. I have skirted some of the philosophical issues of complex systems and mainly focussed on appropriate tools to analyse these systems, addressing important questions such as: &#8226; What is the best way to extract information from DNA? &#8226; How can we model and analyse mutations in DNA?  &#8226; Can we determine the likely spread of both viruses and ideas in social networks? &#8226; How can we model the growth of cancer? &#8226; How can we model and analyse interactions between genes in such living systems as the fruit fly, cancers, and humans? &#8226; Can complex systems techniques give us some insight into the human brain?</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">complex systems; cancer; signal processing; metabolomics, gene regulatory networks, nonlinear dynamics, EEG, mutation</field><field name="subject">Signal processing</field><field name="subject">System analysis.</field><field name="subject">DNA--Analysis.</field><field name="subject">Mutation (Biology)</field><field name="subject">Genetic regulation.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/40682</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ultraviolet disinfection kinetics for potable water production.</field><field name="creator">Amos, Steve A.</field><field name="description">Irradiation with ultraviolet (UV) light is used for the disinfection of bacterial contaminants in the production of potable water, and in the treatment of selected wastewaters. However, efficacy of UV disinfection is limited by the combined effect of suspended solids concentration and UV absorbance. Limited published UV disinfection data are available that account for the combined effects of UV dose, suspended solids concentration and UV absorbance. This present lack of a rigorous quantitative understanding of the kinetics of UV disinfection limits process optimisation and wider application of UV treatment. The development and validation of an adequate model to describe UV disinfection kinetics presented in this thesis can therefore be justified by an increased confidence of reliability of design for UV disinfection. Using the published data of Nguyen (1999), four established model forms were assessed to account for the combined effect of suspended solids and/or soluble UV absorbing compounds, and UV dose on the efficacy of disinfection. The four model forms were: a log-linear form, Davey Linear-Arrhenius (DL-A), Square-Root (or Ratkowsky- Belehradek) and a general nth order Polynomial (nOP) form that was limited to a third order. Criteria for assessment of an adequate predictive model were established including: accuracy of predicted against observed values, percent variance accounted for (%V), and; appraisal of residuals. The DL-A model was shown to best fit the data for UV disinfection of Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922); followed by the nOP, log-linear and Square-Root forms. However, the DL-A form must be used in conjunction with a first-order chemical reaction equation, and was shown to predict poorly at high experimental values of UV dose (&gt; 40,000 &#956;Ws cm-2). The DL-A model was not amenable to extrapolation beyond the observed UV dose range. To overcome the shortcomings of the Davey Linear-Arrhenius model synthesis of two new, non-linear model forms was undertaken. The two models were a modified exponentially damped polynomial (EDPm) and a form based on the Weibull probability distribution. The EDPm model has three terms: a rate coefficient (k), a damping coefficient (&#955;), and; a breakpoint dose ([dose]B). The rate coefficient governs the initial rate of disinfection prior to the onset of tailing, whilst the breakpoint is the UV dose that indicates the onset of tailing. The damping coefficient controls curvature in the survivor curve. The Weibull model has just two terms: a dimensionless scale parameter (&#946;0), and; a shape parameter (&#946;1). The scale parameter represents the level of disinfection in the tail of the survivor curve (as log10 N/N0), whilst the shape parameter governs the degree of curvature of the survivor data. Each model was assessed against the independent and published UV disinfection data of Nelson (2000) for treatment of faecal coliforms in a range of waste stabilisation pond effluents. Both models were found to be well suited to account for tailing in these UV disinfection data. Overall, the EDPm model gave a better fit to the data than the Weibull model form. To rigorously validate the suitability of the new EDPm and Weibull models a series of experimental trials were designed and carried out in a small-scale pilot UV disinfection unit. These trials included data determined specifically at low values of UV dose (&lt;10,000 &#956;Ws cm-2) to fill the gap in the experimental data of Nguyen (1999). The experimental trials were carried out using a commercially available, UV disinfection unit (LC5TM from Ultraviolet Technology of Australasia Pty Ltd). Purified water contaminated with Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) with a range of feed water flow rates (1 to 4 L min-1) was used. E. coli was selected because it is found in sewage, or water contaminated with faecal material, and is used as an indicator for the presence of enteric pathogens. E. coli should not be present in potable water. The hydrodynamics of water flow within the disinfection unit were established using digital video photography of dye trace studies with Methylene Blue. Nominal UV dose (2,700 to 44,200 &#956;Ws cm-2) was controlled by manipulating the flow rate of feed water through the UV disinfection unit (i.e. residence time), or by varying the exposed length of the control volume of the disinfection unit. The transmittance of the feed water (at 254 nm) was adjusted by the addition of either a soluble UV absorbing agent (International RoastTM instant coffee powder; 0.001 to 0.07 g L-1), or by addition of suspended matter as diatomaceous earth (Celite 503TM; 0.1 to 0.7 g L-1, with a median particle size of 23 &#956;m). The absorbing agent (instant coffee), when in a comparable concentration, was found to produce a greater reduction in water transmission than the suspended material (Celite 503TM). It therefore contributed to a greater reduction in the initial rate of disinfection. Neither agent was found to produce a systematic reduction in the observed efficacy of disinfection however. Experimental results highlight that in the absence of soluble absorbing agents, or suspended solids, the initial rate of disinfection is higher when fewer viable bacteria are initially present. Both the new EDPm and Weibull forms gave a good fit to the experimental data. The EDPm better fitted the data on the basis of residual sum-of-squares (0.03 to 2.13 for EDPm cf. 0.16 to 4.37 for the Weibull form). These models are both of a form suitable for practical use in modelling UV disinfection data. Results of this research highlight the impact of water quality, as influenced by the combined effect of UV dose, suspended solids concentration and UV absorbance, on small-scale UV disinfection for potable water production. Importantly, results show that the concentration of soluble UV absorbing agents and suspended solids are not in themselves sufficient criteria on which to base assessment of efficacy of UV disinfection</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ultraviolet; Disinfection kinetics; Predictive model</field><field name="subject">Drinking water Analysis</field><field name="subject">Drinking water Contamination</field><field name="subject">Water Purification Disinfection</field><field name="subject">Ultraviolet radiation Adverse effects.</field><field name="subject">Chemical kinetics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/50044</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling cardiac activation from cell to body surface</field><field name="creator">Buist, Martin L.</field><field name="description">In this thesis, the forward problem of electrocardiography is investigated from a cellular level through to potentials on the surface of the torso. This integrated modelling framework is based on three spatial scales. At the smallest spatial resolution, several cardiac cellular models are implemented that are used to represent the underlying cellular electrophysiology. A bidomain framework is used to couple multiple individual cells together and this provides a mathematical model of the myocardial tissue. The cardiac geometry is described using finite elements with high order cubic Hermite basis function interpolation. An anatomically based description of the fibrous laminar cardiac microstructure is then defined relative to the geometric mesh. Within the local element space of the cardiac finite elements, a fine collocation mesh is created on which the bidomain equations are solved. Each collocation point represents a continuum cell and contains a cellular model to describe the local active processes. This bidomain implementation works in multiple coordinate systems and over deforming domains, in addition to having the ability to spatially vary any parameter throughout the myocardium. On the largest spatial scale the passive torso regions surrounding the myocardium are modelled using a generalised Laplace equation to describe the potential field and current flows. The torso regions are discretised using either finite elements or boundary elements depending on the electrical properties of each region. The cardiac region is coupled to the surrounding torso through several methods. A traditional dipole source approach is implemented that creates equivalent cardiac sources through the summation of cellular dipoles. These dipoles are then placed within a homogeneous cardiac region and the resulting potential field is calculated throughout the torso. Two new coupling techniques are developed that provide a more direct path from cellular activation to body surface potentials. One approach assembles all of the equations from the passive torso regions and the equations from the extracellular bidomain region into a single matrix system. Coupling conditions based on the continuity of potential and current flow across the myocardial surfaces are used to couple the regions and therefore solving the matrix system yields a solution that is continuous across all of the solution points within the torso. The second approach breaks the large system into smaller subproblems and the continuity conditions are iii iv imposed through an iterative approach. Across each of the myocardial surfaces, a fixed point iteration is set up with the goal of converging towards zero potential and current flow differences between adjacent regions. All of the numerical methods used within the integrated modelling framework are rigorously tested individually before extensive tests are performed on the coupling techniques. Large scale simulations are run to test the dipole source approach against the new coupling techniques. Several sets of simulations are run to investigate the effects of using different ionic current models, using different bidomain model simplifications, and the role that the torso inhomogeneities play in generating body surface potentials. The main question to be answered by this study is whether or not the traditional approach of combining a monodomain heart with an equivalent cardiac source in a two step approach is adequate when generating body surface potentials. Comparisons between the fully coupled framework developed here and several dipole based approaches demonstrate that the resulting sets of signals have different magnitudes and different waveform shapes on both the torso and epicardial surface, clearly illustrating the inadequacy of the equivalent cardiac source models. It has been found that altering the modelling assumptions on each spatial scale produces noticeable effects. At the smallest scale, the use of different cell models leads to significantly different body surface potential traces. At the next scale the monodomain approach is unable to accurately reproduce the results from a full bidomain framework, and at the largest level the inclusion of different torso inhomogeneities has a large effect on the magnitude of the torso and epicardial potentials. Adding a pair of lungs to the torso model changes the epicardial potentials by an average of 16% which is consistent with the experimental range of between 8 and 20%. This provides evidence that only a complex, coupled, biophysically based model will be able to properly reproduce clinical ECGs.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291500 Biomedical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2133</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multiple Objective Linear Programming in Radiotherapy Treatment Planning</field><field name="creator">Shao, Lizhen</field><field name="description">The aim of intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is to kill tumor cells while at the same time protecting the surrounding tissue and organs from the damaging effect of radiation. To achieve these goals computerized inverse planning systems are used. Given the number of beams and beam directions, beam intensity profiles that yield the best dose distribution under consideration of clinical and physical constraints are calculated. This is called beam intensity optimization problem. In this thesis, we first review existing mathematical models and computation methods for the beam intensity optimization problem. Next, we formulate the beam intensity optimization problem as a multiobjective linear programme (MOLP) with three objectives. For clinical cases this optimization problem involves thousands of variables and tens of thousands of constraints and existing methods such as multiobjective simplex methods can not handle it. The rest of the thesis is dedicated to developing methods to solve this large MOLP efficiently and to the application in the beam intensity optimization problem. Benson (1998c) argues that solving an MOLP in objective space needs less computation time than solving it in decision space if the number of objectives of the MOLP is much smaller than the number of variables. Moreover, the constraint matrix of the problem relies on the calculation of dose deposited in tissue. Since this calculation is always imprecise solving the MOLP exactly is not necessary in practice. This motivates us to develop algorithms for solving an MOLP in objective space approximately. We summarize Benson&#8217;s outer approximation algorithm for solving MOLPs in objective space and propose some small changes to improve computational performance. Then in order to approximate the true nondominated set we propose a modification of Benson&#8217;s algorithm which is called an approximation version of Benson&#8217;s algorithm. Our approximation algorithm computes an inner and an outer approximation of the nondominated set. We prove that the inner approximation provides a set of &#949;-nondominated points. The geometric duality theory of Heyde and L&#168;ohne (2006) defines a dual to an MOLP and it assures us to be able to find the nondominated set of the primal MOLP by solving its dual MOLP. Based on this we develop a dual variant of Benson&#8217;s outer approximation algorithm to solve the dual MOLP in objective space. We prove that solving the dual provides a weight set decomposition. We compare the primal algorithm and the dual algorithm on small illustrative and on radiotherapy examples. Furthermore, we propose an algorithm to solve the dual MOLP approximately but within specified tolerance. This approximate solution set can be used to calculate an approximation of the nondominated set of the primal MOLP.We show that this set is an &#949;-nondominated set of the original primal MOLP and provide numerical evidence that this approach can be faster than solving the primal MOLP approximately. Considering that the set of nondominated points is infinite, it is not very useful from the planners&#8217; point of view. We address the problem of finding well distributed nondominated points for an MOLP.We propose a method which combines the global shooting and normal boundary intersection methods. By doing so, we overcome the limitation of normal boundary intersection method that parts of the nondominated set may be missed. Discrepancy analysis of the nondominated points from a geometry point of view shows that this method produces evenly distributed nondominated  points. Moreover, the coverage error and the uniformity level can be measured. Finally, we apply the algorithms developed to the beam intensity optimization problem of 3D clinical cases with voxel size of 5mm and 3mm. A technique of reducing the resolution in normal tissue has been used to reduce the computation time. The results clearly illustrate the advantages of our methods.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2478</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An unblinking gaze: on the philosophy of the Marquis de Sade</field><field name="creator">Roche, Geoffrey T.</field><field name="description">Throughout the 20th Century, a number of philosophers, writers, artists and film makers have implied that there is some profound significance to the work of Donatien Alphonse Fran&#231;ois, the Marquis de Sade (1740-1814).

Firstly, I will consider the various philosophical interpretations of Sade&#8217;s work. This part of the study will serve as a guide into the Sadeian labyrinth, and will establish some of the more central interpretive themes, in particular the claim that Sade&#8217;s thought anticipates that of the Nazis, or that he brings early Modern thought to its logical conclusion. Secondly, I will inquire into Sade&#8217;s writings themselves. Of particular interest are Sade&#8217;s thoughts concerning the nature of sexuality, psychology, and the human condition in general, his critique of conventional morality, and his description of the nature of power.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::440000 Philosophy and Religion::440100 Philosophy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5305</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The sea cucumber Australostichopus mollis: Juvenile feeding ecology and habitat</field><field name="creator">Slater, Matthew James</field><field name="description">The aspidochirote sea cucumber Australostichopus mollis is a commercially valuable species of research interest as a candidate for aquaculture or polyculture. Understanding juvenile habitat and feeding biology is essential to furthering aquaculture efforts and expanding knowledge of the ecology of the species. Surveying within the Mahurangi Harbour, New Zealand, revealed highly patchy distribution of juvenile A. mollis at one site within an area of high adult density. High juvenile density correlated with sediment qualities favouring epibenthic detritivorous deposit-feeding. Juvenile A. mollis showed no distinct spatial separation from adults and no association with dense macroalgae or preference for shallower depths than adults, as may be expected from studies on other sea cucumber species. Wild caught juveniles displaced to non-juvenile habitats with novel surface sediments showed rapid growth. The results indicate that the highly patchy distribution of juveniles in the harbour is not due to differences in the food quality of sediments but rather other localised effects. Juvenile A. mollis show an ability to exploit a variety of benthic sediment food sources, with growth rates comparable to other cultured species. Juvenile A. mollis exhibited positive selectivity for organic particles both in situ and in the laboratory. Juveniles exhibited an ability to distinguish between different sediment TOM levels, an ability which became limited once TOM exceeded 3%. The results reiterate the specific nutrient recycling role of deposit-feeding sea cucumbers and may help explain the patchy distribution of juvenile sea cucumbers in heterogeneous habitats. In addition the research indicates that diet homogeneity and stability will be important in development of A. mollis artificial diets while a broad range of artificial diet grain sizes will be consumed. Juvenile A. mollis fed a high rate of mussel waste diet over three months exhibited significantly higher specific growth rate (SGR) than those fed natural sediment or algal diets. The results indicate the suitability of mussel waste as a juvenile diet and show that rapid growth can be expected among juvenile sea cucumbers cultured beneath mussel farms provided sea cucumber stocking rates are managed appropriately. Bioavailability of potential artificial diet ingredients was also systematically tested for juvenile A. mollis. Apparent digestibility was moderate for common carbohydrate sources and excellent for a range of artificial protein sources including low-cost protein sources. However, growth on artificial diets was poor and diet performance may need to be improved using fermentation steps or similar before they become viable. Rapid growth and flexible feeding preferences show A. mollis to be well suited to future aquaculture and polyculture.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5833</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The mechanics of rocking structures subjected to ground motion</field><field name="creator">Ma, Quincy Tsun Ming</field><field name="description">This thesis describes an investigation into the dynamic response of structures that are permitted to rock or uplift when subjected to ground excitations. Previous studies have demonstrated that rocking motion can mitigate undesirable seismic actions on structures, and this has been further confirmed through extensive numerical time integration analyses in the present study. Despite the intuitive nature of rocking motion, it has been shown that the underlying process is in fact highly complex, sensitive to initial conditions, consequently history dependent and by no means well understood. The present work aims to contribute to the current understanding of the fundamental mechanics of rocking systems. With the aid of experimental data, the dynamic response of free rocking rigid blocks, controlled rocking systems and simple rocking structures was closely examined. It was found that Housner&#8217;s simple rocking model remains the most theoretically consistent and is the simplest model to implement. The result is also generally satisfactory for modelling rigid rocking blocks, apart from the model's inability to correctly predict energy dissipation at impacts. The migration of the rotation centre during rocking was identified as central to understand the dynamic characteristics of a controlled rocking system (an elastically restrained rocking system). A novel approach was proposed to describe the rotation centre&#8217;s migration behaviour. Then by considering the energy content of the system, the pseudo-static force-displacement behaviour of a controlled rocking wall was able to be accurately predicted. This was then successfully extended to predict the timehistory response of controlled rocking systems. Finally, new formulations were developed for predicting the time-history response of three idealised rocking structural systems from first principles. These were validated against published shake table tests results. Two of the highlights arising from these formulations were 1) a set of simplified, closed form formulae which precisely predicted the nonlinear static force-displacement relationship of a rigid rocking structure on flexible ground, and 2) the governing differential equations for a flexible structure rocking on rigid ground. This latter outcome provided users with a valuable quantitative tool for assessing the benefit of implementing a rocking isolation solution.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5861</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contemporary heart failure management</field><field name="creator">Wasywich, Cara Anne</field><field name="description">The research presented within this thesis aims to add to the current knowledge regarding contemporary heart failure (HF) management. Chapter 2 describes a study collating twenty years of HF admissions and mortality data from New Zealand (1988-2008). This study describes changes in HF epidemiology to provide context for further research focusing on indivudual patient aspects of HF management in the current era. Chapter 3 comprises a literature review examining the roles of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP, BNP-32 and NT-proBNP) and echocardiography in contemporary HF management. BNP and echocardiography have important diagnostic and prognostic utility in HF management and provide non-invasive assessment of left ventricular filling pressure. This review provides background for the following two chapters. Chapter 4 describes a study that evaluates the relationship between BNP-32 and echocardiographic measures of diastolic function (E/Ea) in patients admitted to hospital with acute decompensated HF. Chapter 5 describes a study that evaluates the relationship between NT-proBNP and E/Ea in HF patients during NT-proBNP guided treatment titration. These chapters add to current knowledge regarding the utility of E/Ea in patients with HF. Chapters 6 and 7 focus on co-morbidity associated with HF. It has been uncertain from previously published data whether the presence of atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with HF is associated with an adverse prognosis. Chapter 6 comprises a literature-based meta-analysis of the prognostic effect of AF in HF compared to those with sinus rhythm. This study combines the results of 20 studies (32,946 patients, 10,819 deaths) and confirms that AF is associated with an adverse prognosis in HF. Chapter 7 describes a study that evaluates trans-myocardial metabolism of aldosterone, angiotensin II, BNP-32, and a marker of collagen synthesis in patients with ischaemic heart disease or severe aortic stenosis who have normal left ventricular ejection fraction. This study confirms myocardial release of aldosterone despite normal circulating aldosterone levels, strengthening the rationale for evaluation of aldosterone receptor antagonists in clinical situations not characterised by increased circulating aldosterone. This research has added to current understanding of HF and HF therapy, particularly focused on measures that may help to improve individual patient outcomes.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5973</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling and analysis of hydrogen-based wind energy transmission and storage systems : HyLink system at Totara Valley : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Technology in Energy Management at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Sudol, Peter</field><field name="description">Distributed generation has the potential to reduce the supply-demand gap emerging in New Zealand&#8217;s electricity market. Thereby it can improve the overall network efficiency, harness renewable energy resources and reduce the need for upgrading of existing distribution lines. A typical New Zealand rural community consisting of three adjacent farms at Totara Valley near Woodville represents a demonstration site on distributed generation for Massey University and Industrial Research Limited. Local renewable energy resources are being used for the purpose of sustainable development. Alternative micro-scale technologies are being combined to achieve a valuable network support. This paper is an in-depth report on the implementation process of the HyLink system; a system which utilises hydrogen as an energy carrier to balance and transport the fluctuating wind power. The report documents its development from the laboratory stage to commissioning at Totara Valley, which was carried out under direction of Industrial Research Limited. The PEM electrolyser&#8217;s performance at different stack temperatures was investigated. It was found that hydrogen production increases at the same voltage with a higher stack temperature. This is due to the improved kinetics of the electrochemical reactions and decreased thermodynamic energy requirement for water electrolysis. The electrolyser efficiency measurement at the half of its maximal power input (247 W) resulted in 65.3%. Thereby the stack temperature attained less than half of the allowed limit of 80&#176;C. The capture of the excess heat by insulation can improve the electrolyser&#8217;s efficiency. Pressure tests were performed on the 2 km long pipeline at Totara Valley using hydrogen and natural gas in order to test their permeability. The results were compared with previous studies at Massey University and with data obtained from the industry. The hydrogen permeability was measured to be 5.5 * 10[to the power of]-16 mol m m[to the power of]-2 s[to the power of]-1 Pa[to the power of]-1 for a 2 km MDPE pipe. This is about half the result obtained from previous studies on hydrogen permeability through MDPE at Massey University which was undertaken at room temperature. The reason for this discrepancy is likely to be the lower ambient temperature during the measurement at Totara Valley, which can be supported with the Arrhenius equation. It was furthermore measured that the power loss due to hydrogen diffusion through the pipeline walls during the fuel cell operation is about 1.5 W at the current system operation mode. A techno-economic analysis of the system was undertaken applying the micro-power optimisation software HOMER as a simulation tool. Two operation modes of the system were investigated, the load following and the peak demand compensating. The simulation results reveal that the durability and the cost of the electrochemical energy conversion devices; electrolyser and fuel cell, are the main hurdles which need to be overcome on the path in introducing hydrogen based energy systems like HyLink. Finally, economic optimisation modelling of the small-scale system by best component alignment was performed. It was found that the electrolyser capacity down-rating of 80% in relation to the wind turbine capacity, leads to a minimal system levelised cost. In addition to this, the impact of various wind turbine/electrolyser subsystems and pipeline storage capacities on the fuel cell capacity factor and on the system levelised cost in the load following operation mode was analysed. The outcomes can be useful for further HyLink related energy system planning.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hydrogen</field><field name="subject">energy carrier</field><field name="subject">fluctuating wind power</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290900 Electrical and Electronic Engineering::290901 Electrical engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/786</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding guest retention : an examination of New Zealand accommodation establishments : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Management, Massey University</field><field name="creator">Barnett, Shirley Jean</field><field name="description">Abstract  The importance of customer retention has become a major theme in the literature since the 1990s when empirical studies showed that retaining 5% of customers could lead to an increase in profits ranging from 25% to 85%.  However, customer retention does not appear to have moved from the theoretical into the practical world.  Specifically, there were few empirical studies which focused on customer retention and none were identified in the New Zealand accommodation sector.  The travel and tourism industry contributes approximately 9% to New Zealand&#8217;s GDP, and 10% of all spending by travellers and tourists is in the accommodation sector.  Impacts, such as seasonality, characterise the accommodation sector and many establishments have occupancy rates which can fluctuate from 90% to 30% in the off-season.  With average annual occupancy rates for New Zealand hotels and motels hovering around 55%, retention is a strategy that owners and managers could implement in order to increase occupancy and profits.  In this study the research question was based on a review of the literature and the a priori knowledge and experience of the researcher.  To ensure the research question framing this study was answered in the most exhaustive and comprehensive manner a seven step research process based on work by Bourgeois (1979) was followed.  Data was gathered using both deductive and inductive methods in order to nullify the two main research problems raised by Bourgeois (1979).  First, that theories are cast at a high level which is removed from reality and second that empirical studies often result in just a description of the data.  In the deductive phase of this study a survey was mailed to New Zealand accommodation establishments that provided accommodation and meals, and had a liquor licence.  The main focus of this survey was to learn what owners and managers understood about guest retention and to answer the first research objective.  It was discovered that New Zealand accommodation managers: actively work to retain their guests; know the value of guest retention; understand the links between guest satisfaction, loyalty and retention; understand the specific reasons behind guest defections; understand the importance service recovery; and understand how loyalty schemes lead to guest retention.  The second phase was a case study involving three accommodation establishments.  These findings added depth to the study and allowed for new knowledge to be extrapolated from the findings.  It was discovered that in two establishments the focus was guest satisfaction and building relationships with customers.  Whilst the resort hotel did have a strategy to encourage lapsed business to return this wasn&#8217;t measured or monitored.  Thus the second research objective was answered.  In the penultimate chapter an amended profit chain has been proposed which included &#8216;Building Customer Relationships&#8217; as the link between satisfaction and profitability.  This is based on the finding that the case establishments saw retention as a proxy for satisfaction and, therefore, focused on satisfying guests and building personal relationships as methods of guest retention. The research question framing this study can be answered by saying that the strategies used by owners and managers in New Zealand accommodation establishments to manage guest retention tend to be related to guest satisfaction and building personal relationships.  However, this is not because they do not understand guest retention but see it as part of the bigger picture involving the building of relationships with guests.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">guest retention</field><field name="subject">hotel management</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">customer loyalty</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350500 Tourism</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/791</field></doc><doc><field name="title">General biology and reproductive fitness of Tasmanian lacewing, Micromus tasmaniae Walker : a thesis presented in partial fulfllment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Plant Protection at the Institute of Natural Resources, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Yadav, Anand</field><field name="description">Tasmanian lacewing, Micromus tasmaniae Walker, is an important predator of a number of economically important pests such as aphids. This study was conducted to investigate some aspects of general biology and factors affecting the reproductive fitness of this species Emergence of M. tasmaniae peaked 3 h before light off and there was no significant difference in emergence patterns between males and females. Males became sexually mature earlier than females. Mating success significantly increased from the first to the eleventh hour after lights on. Predation, development and oviposition of M. tasmaniae were affected when reared under different photoperiods [i.e. 24:0, 16:8, 12:12, 0:24 h (light:dark)]. Results indicate that no individuals entered diapause at either an immature or adult stage. M. tasmaniae larvae could feed in both the photophase and scotophase and late instar larvae consumed significantly more aphids than early instar larvae. M. tasmaniae reared at 16:8 h developed faster and had lower mortality, heavier adult body weight and higher reproductive output in terms of fecundity and fertility rate. Therefore, mass-rearing programmes are recommended to be carried out at 16:8 h to obtain the higher quality of individuals and faster increase of populations. The larger-the better theory predicts that the reproductive fitness is positively linearly associated with body size or weight. However, the body weight of female M. tasmaniae had no effect on the reproductive fitness in terms of fecundity, fertility, fertility rate, oviposition period and longevity. The male body weight may contribute to the population growth of M. tasmaniae as the average females that mated with average or heavy males had significantly higher fecundity, fertility and fertility rate and longer reproductive period. These results suggest that development of any control method that should selectively mass-produce heavy and average individuals in the laboratory would help increasing M. tasmaniae quality and populations. M. tasmaniae is a polygamous species. Results indicate that female remating either with the same or different males was crucial for maximizing their reproductive success. Males could inseminate up to eight females and father about one thousand offspring during their life span.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tasmanian lacewing</field><field name="subject">Micromus tasmaniae</field><field name="subject">pest predators</field><field name="subject">plant protection</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300300 Horticulture::300303 Plant protection (pests, diseases and weeds)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1029</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Un i form "consisting of one" : a written component presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Design at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Clement, Julie</field><field name="description">Uni form is an exploration into the act of getting dressed.

It is a disease of significant interest within New Zealand due to its association with bovine abortion. The economic impact of bovine abortion justifies the development of a bovine vaccine against N. caninum. Aim: To develop and optimise diagnostic procedures for the detection of Neospora from a variety of blood and tissue samples and to isolate a New Zealand strain of Neospora caninum. Methods: A local strain of Toxoplasma gondii and an imported Neospora caninum strain, Nc-Liverpool, were used to optimise tachyzoite growing conditions in bovine endothelial (BE) cells and Vero host cell cultures. A serum study using 112 tissue culture flasks was performed to determine whether foetal bovine serum or horse serum supplemented media provided the optimal growing conditions for Nc-Liverpool tachyzoites. Nc-Liverpool tachyzoites were also used to determine the optimal growth period between passage, and harvest for cryopreservation and cryopreservation conditions. Percoll gradients were also tested using Nc-Liverpool tachyzoites. A known Neospora positive canine sample and murine tissues infected with Toxoplasma, were used during the development of the immunohistochemical diagnostic technique. Antibody concentrations and incubation temperatures were tested to reduce cross-reactivity and increase specific stain intensity. Immunohistochemistry was performed on sections of all tissue samples used for N. caninum isolation and experimentally infected murine tissue. Several PCR techniques were developed, the final PCR used being a combination of the different techniques, which produced a 250kb band. PCR-3 used the NF6/GA1 primer combination for Neospora detection and TF6/GA1 for Toxoplasma detection, additional Mg2+ and an annealing temperature of 55&#176;C were required. Whole tissue was processed via DNA elution whereas cell culture and Percoll purified tachyzoites were used following crude lysis techniques. All bovine and canine tissues used for parasite isolation as well as all experimentally infected mouse tissues were tested for N. caninum using PCR. An immunoblot technique was developed for the detection of N. caninum antibodies in murine blood samples. Lysed Nc-Liverpool tachyzoites were used as antigen with varied results. The primary and secondary antibodies were commercially available and used at concentrations of 1:1,000 and 1:25,000 respectively. BALB/c and CF1 mice were experimentally infected with Toxoplasma gondii and Nc-Liverpool. Forty female BALB/c and 40 female CF1 mice were used in 2 studies to determine the optimal Nc-Liverpool inoculation dose and immunosuppression requirements. Mice were immunosuppressed with 2.5mg of methylprednisolone acetate (MPA) and Nc-Liverpool inoculation ranged from 1.3x106 to 5x103 tachyzoites. Upon death, the brain and blood was harvested from the mouse carcases. Attempts were made to isolate a New Zealand strain of N. caninum from bovine and canine central nervous system (CNS) tissue, and to maintain the parasites in cell culture and by small animal passage, in order to attenuate the parasite strain for use as a live large animal vaccine. Twenty one bovine tissue samples were used for N. caninum isolation attempts, 18 of which were positive for Neospora antibodies using a commercial IFAT. Isolation tissues were purified using a 30% Percoll gradient and inoculated onto 8 cell culture flasks and into 8 immunosuppressed mice (BALB/c and CF1). Results: Nc-Liverpool tachyzoites were found to be viable when grown at 37&#176;C in antibiotic-MEM supplemented with either FBS or ES and grew optimally in FBS despite Neospora antibodies being detected using an IFAT. Passaging cultures at approx. 4 day intervals resulted in the greatest parasite growth. However, cryopreserved parasites should be harvested 2 days post inoculation (PI) for optimal viability. Viable parasites could be isolated using a 30% Percoll gradient and centrifuged at 2,700 x g (3,400 rpm) in a bucket centrifuge for 10 minutes. Tissue cysts could be detected using immunohistochemistry but some degree of cross reaction remained despite optimisation. Cysts were not found in tissues used for isolation attempts or in mouse brains following inoculation with Nc-Liverpool, however cysts were commonly found in mice experimentally infected with T. gondii tachyzoites. PCR-3 was successfully used to detect N. caninum and T. gondii infected tissue and tachyzoites from tissue culture. PCR-3 could detect N. caninum DNA in the brain tissue of 9/24 mice experimentally infected with Nc-Liverpool, even though most mice were culled within 1 week. Although production of N. caninum antigen was only moderately successful, N. caninum antibody detection in mouse blood using one specific antigen batch was reliable and specific. The immunoblot could only detect N. caninum antibody approximately 14 days PI, but was sensitive enough to detect 100% of mice experimentally infected with Nc-Liverpool tachyzoites. PCR-3 strongly correlated with the immunoblot results from 14 days PI. BALB/c mice were found to be far more sensitive to Nc-Liverpool than CF1 mice and developed severe disease at concentrations of approximately 1x106 Nc-Liverpool tachyzoites. Neither BALB/c nor CF1 mice developed peritoneal exudate, irrespective of the parasite inoculation concentration. Despite Neospora DNA being present in the brains of experimentally infected mice, re-isolation and continuous parasite passage from the brains could not be achieved. No mice experimentally infected with either Nc-Liverpool or isolation attempts were found to have brain cysts when tested using immunohistochemistry. Only 1 mouse inoculated with bovine isolation material was found to have a Neospora positive PCR. Through the detection of DNA, antigens and antibodies, parasites were determined to have been present in 10 of the 18 IFAT positive bovine isolation samples, indicating that 55% of calves born to seropositive dams were infected with N. caninum. However, despite numerous attempts to isolate Neospora parasites from naturally infected canine and bovine tissue and culturing using the optimised Nc-Liverpool technique, maintenance of a live culture of a New Zealand strain of N. caninum could not be established. Conclusions: Findings from this study could be used to assist in the maintenance of Neospora caninum and Toxoplasma gondii parasite strains and for detection or diagnosis of these parasites in host tissues.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Neospora caninum</field><field name="subject">pathogenic protozoa</field><field name="subject">Toxoplasma gondii</field><field name="subject">cattle parasites</field><field name="subject">cattle diseases</field><field name="subject">veterinary parasitology</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300500 Veterinary Medicine::300508 Parasitology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1089</field></doc><doc><field name="title">K&#257;ore te aroha-- : te hua o te w&#257;nanga : a thesis presented for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in M&#257;ori Studies at Massey University, Palmerston North, Aotearoa, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Black, Taiarahia</field><field name="description">Te Ora &#274; noho an&#257; n&#333; i te koko ko &#332;hiwa, kia whakarongo rua, Aku taringa ki te Tai o tuar&#257; e o Kanawa, E &#257;ki ana mai ki uta r o &#332;hakana.

Change in colour perception with changing light conditions induce errors that may escape a user's awareness. Colour constancy algorithms are based on inferring light properties (usually the white point) to correct colour. Other attempts using more data for colour correction   such as (ICC based) colour management   characterise a capturing device under given conditions through an input device pro le. This pro le can be applied to correct for deviating colour perception. But this pro le is only valid for the speci c conditions at the time of the characterisation, but fails with changes in light. This research presents a solution to the problem of long time observations with changes in the scene's illumination for common natural (overcast or clear, blue sky) and arti cial sources (incandescent or  uorescent lamps). Colour measurements for colour based reasoning need to be represented in a robustly de ned way. One such suitable and well de ned description is given by the CIE LAB colour space, a device-independent, visually linearised colour description. Colour transformations using ICC pro le are also based on CIE colour descriptions. Therefore, also the corrective colour processing has been based on ICC based colour management. To verify the viability of CIE LAB based corrective colour processing colour constancy algorithms (White Patch Retinex and Grey World Assumption) have been modi ed to operate on L a b  colour tuples. Results were compared visually and numerically (using colour indexing) against those using the same algorithms operating on RGB colour tuples. We can take advantage of the fact that we are dealing with image streams over time, adding another dimension usable for analysis. A solution to the problem of slowly changing light conditions in scenes with a static camera perspective is presented. It takes advantage of the small (frame-to-frame) changes in appearance of colour within the scene over time. Reoccurring objects or (background) areas of the scene are tracked to gather data points for an analysis. As a result, a suitable colour space distortion model has been devised through a  rst order Taylor approximation (a ne transformation). By performing a multidimensional linear regression analysis on the tracked data points, parameterisations for the a ne transformations were derived. Finally, the device pro le is updated by amalgamating the corrections from the model into the ICC pro le for a single, comprehensive transformation. Following applications of the ICC based colour pro les are very fast and can be used in real-time with the camera's capturing frame rate (for current normal web cameras and low spec desktop computers). As light conditions usually change on a much slower time scale than the capturing rate of a camera, the computationally expensive pro le adaptation generally showed to be usable for many frames. The goal was to set out and  nd a solution for consistent colour capturing using digital cameras, which is capable of coping with changing light conditions. Theoretical backgrounds and strategies for such a system have been devised and implemented successfully.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer colour image processing</field><field name="subject">Colour perception</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280200 Artificial Intelligence and Signal and Image Processing::280208 Computer vision</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1683</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Leaf Rubisco turnover variation in a perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) population : analysis of quantitative trait loci, implications for productivity, and potential for manipulation : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Plant Science, Massey University, Institute of Natural Resources, College of Sciences, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Khaembah, Edith Nanjala</field><field name="description">The Grasslands II perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) mapping population comprising F1 progeny with the two parents (one plant each from the cultivars Samson and Impact) (Crush et al., 2007) was used to detect putative quantitative trait loci (QTL) for leaf Rubisco turnover and herbage yield traits. Rubisco turnover was described by three mathematical parameters: d (maximum Rubisco content), g (time of d) and f (a measure of curve width). All three parameters exhibited continuous variation among the F1 progeny. Sixteen QTL were detected, seven for Rubisco turnover and nine for herbage yield traits. Support interval overlap on linkage group (LG) 1 and close location on LG2 for plant dry weight (DW) QTL in this study and in a previous analysis (Sartie, 2007) of the same mapping population suggests DW QTL stability across environments. Some QTL identified by Sartie (2007) were not re-confirmed in this study, but new QTL were identified. This suggests genotype x environment interaction generated by variable expression of genes in different environments. Clusters of QTL with overlapping support intervals were found on LG2 and LG5. The cluster on LG2 included QTL for herbage yield traits leaf lamina length (LL), tiller number (TN), productivity index (PI) and DW. The cluster on LG5 included QTL for DW, PI, TN, and d. These two regions offer potential for plant breeding applications. Apart from the QTL for d on LG5, there was no co-location of Rubisco turnover and herbage yield QTL. However, principal component analysis indicated plants with lower d tended to have higher DW; thus Rubisco turnover effects on plant productivity may relate to energy cost of Rubisco synthesis rather than photosynthetic capacity. DW was generally unrelated to f and g; therefore, hypothesised nitrogen use inefficiencies arising from premature Rubisco degradation, or retention of Rubisco at leaf senescence, were not confirmed. LG5 and LG7 on which QTL for d were located have conserved syntenic regions with rice chromosomes 8 and 9 where QTL for Rubisco content at different stages during heading were mapped by Ishimaru et al (2001a).</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lolium perenne L.</field><field name="subject">Rubisco turnover</field><field name="subject">Plant productivity</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany::270402 Plant physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1690</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Accessibility of rural credit among small farmers in the Philippines : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Applied Science in Rural Development, Institute of Natural Resources, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Poliquit, Lolita Y.</field><field name="description">Credit plays an important role in agricultural development and it is believed that expansion of credit programmes will have beneficial effects on agricultural production and incomes of small farmers. It is also a key to poverty alleviation, livelihood diversification, and increasing the business skills of small farmers. In the Philippines, small-scale and subsistence agriculture source their loans mostly from informal lenders, thus access to formal credit remains low. There is a need to examine further small farmers&#8217; access to credit and investigate their preferences and perceptions regarding credit in order that their access can be improved and their needs through credit can be more effectively met. Determining the problems and the credit needs of small farmers are important considerations in designing appropriate credit systems for them. Accessibility of rural credit in the Philippines was examined, with the primary objective of exploring the use of and access to rural credit by small farmers. This research attempts to explore and understand the perceptions of small farmers toward rural credit, and to collect information in proposing an appropriate credit system for them. Two types of respondents were interviewed for the research; 45 individual farmers, and four key informants in New Corella, Davao del Norte. The research focused on how the farmers perceived the rural credit facilities, their preferences, their reasons for borrowing, and their problems in accessing credit. Qualitative data analysis was done for the information gathered. Access to credit by farmers was limited to the available credit services in the research area, thus farmers&#8217; choices and preferences were not well served which led to borrowing from informal lenders. Credit restrictions such as commodity specific credit programmes, credit that requires collateral, and lengthy and complicated procedures restricted the farmers from accessing formal credit. It is recommended that accessibility to credit by small farmers could be improved by providing innovative financing schemes that address problems of farmers who lack collateral, and minimise long processing of documents and other requirements. In this way, farmers may be encouraged to better utilise formal credit and decrease their reliance on informal lenders, thus avoiding higher interest rates and thereby increasing their farm productivity and household incomes.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Agricultural development</field><field name="subject">Credit access</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics::340200 Applied Economics::340201 Agricultural economics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1687</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intrinsic disorder and coiled coil formation in prostate apoptosis response factor-4 (Par-4) : submitted in fulfilment of the requirements of the degree of Doctor of Philosphy, Institute of Fundamental Sciences, Massey University, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Schwalbe, Martin</field><field name="description">Prostate apoptosis response factor-4 (Par-4) is a ubiquitously expressed pro-apoptotic and tumour suppressive protein. Par-4 contains a highly conserved coiled coil (CC) region at the Cterminus, particularly the distal 40 residues fulfil the criteria for a leucine zipper (LZ). This Cterminal domain serves as the primary recognition domain for a large number of binding partners. Par-4 is tightly regulated by the aforementioned binding partners and also by posttranslational modifications. Biophysical data presented here describe Par-4 as primarily an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP). Bioinformatic analysis of the highly conserved Par-4 reveals low sequence complexity and enrichment in polar and charged amino acids. High proteolytic susceptibility and increased hydrodynamic radii are consistent with largely extended structures in solution. Spectroscopic measurements using circular dichroism (CD) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) also reveal characteristic features of intrinsic disorder. Under physiological conditions, data show that Par-4 self-associates via the C-terminal domain possibly through coiled coil formation. Analysis of various constructs comprising the Par-4 LZ domain by NMR, CD, light scattering and other techniques reveals an environment-dependent conformational equilibrium between primarily disordered monomers and predominantly coiled coil dimers. Whereas the disordered monomers are easily observed by NMR, the coiled coil fraction is not amenable to NMR studies possibly due to intermediate exchange processes. Mutational approaches that stabilise the coiled coil fraction result in NMR spectra of lower quality compared to the wild-type form. The high degree of sequence conservation suggest that coiled coil formation and intrinsic disorder are essential for Par-4 to function as an effective regulator of apoptosis.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Binding proteins</field><field name="subject">Protein NMR</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1688</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of uterine environment upon embryonic, fetal, neonatal and post-natal development and glucose metabolism in sheep : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Veterinary Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Sharma, Rajesh</field><field name="description">Studies of humans and domestic animals have shown that there is a linkage between the neonatal and post-natal health of an individual and its uterine environment during gestation. However, very little information exists for sheep and there have been no studies that have directly examined the stage of gestation at which such effects could be introduced to the conceptus. In the present study, pure-breed embryos were transferred within and reciprocally between large (Suffolk: S) and small (Cheviot: C) breeds of sheep to establish different uterine environments; SinS (large control), SinC (restricted environment), CinS (luxurious environment) and CinC (small control) and their effects upon embryonic, fetal, neonatal and post-natal development and glucose metabolism of lambs were examined. By Day 19 of gestation, conceptuses (embryo and trophoblast) developing in a restricted uterine environment (SinC) were smaller (P&lt;0.05) than in control (SinS). The head length of SinC fetuses was smaller (P&lt;0.05) than in SinS fetuses on Day 55 of gestation and SinC lambs were lighter and smaller (P&lt;0.05) than SinS lambs at birth. During subsequent post-natal life, there was no difference (P&gt;0.05) in the growth rate of SinC and SinS lambs. The liveweight and body dimensions of SinC lambs were lower (P&lt;0.05) than SinS lambs until 9 weeks and 12 weeks of age, respectively. Day 19 peri-implantation embryos and trophoblasts that developed in a luxurious environment were bigger than in control (CinC). However, CinS fetal size did not differ (P&gt;0.05) from CinC fetuses by Day 55 of gestation. There was no difference (P&gt;0.05) in the birthweight and body dimensions of lambs born from these two groups. Dimension of the placentas of SinC and SinS or CinS and CinC did not differ (P&lt;0.05) during gestation or at lambing. Concentrations of ovine placental lactogen (oPL), progesterone, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), glucose and free fatty acid (FFA) differed between uterine environments. During glucose challenge tests, there were no differences in the concentrations of glucose and insulin, between SinC and SinS female lambs, however, glucose concentrations declined more rapidly (P&lt;0.05) in CinS than CinC female lambs at one year of age. It was concluded that restricted uterine environment affects embryonic, fetal and neonatal development of lambs, and that these effects perpetuates until at least one year of age; but there was no effect upon glucose metabolism. Conversely, a luxurious uterine environment enhances the early development of embryos but had no effects upon subsequent fetal, neonatal and post-natal development; however glucose metabolism of post-natal female lambs was improved. It appears that these effects of uterine environment were mediated through the trophoblast during the early embryonic period and via the placenta during subsequent gestation. oPL, progesterone, IGF-1, glucose and FFA were implicated in feto-maternal dialogue. These results suggest that uterine environment significantly influences the biology of young sheep with possible economic consequences.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sheep embryos</field><field name="subject">Fetus development</field><field name="subject">Lamb biology</field><field name="subject">Lamb physiology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300400 Animal Production::300406 Animal growth and development</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1689</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ng&#257; ara whaiora : he whakaaro noa = A study of M&#257;ori health care use : an evaluation of the Andersen model : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Psychology at Massey University, Turitea Campus, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Hirini, Paul Ryan</field><field name="description">Using interview data the present study applied a leading health care use explanatory model (the Anderson model) to a sample of 502 community-dwelling New Zealand M&#257;ori adults. To date the Andersen model has been applied extensively in overseas (principally U.S.) research, yet not specifically to an indigenous population such as the New Zealand M&#257;ori. The Andersen model proposes that health service use is a function of three components: predisposing, enabling and need characteristics. Using hierarchical multiple regression analyses three overarching research goals concerning the model were investigated: (1) To test the efficacy of the Andersen model in the prediction of M&#257;ori health care utilisation; (2) to extend the model by considering the role of life events as a predictor of M&#257;ori health service utilisation; and (3) to extend the model by considering the role of psychological distress as a predictor of M&#257;ori health service utilisation. As a further extension on previous work, the present study also sought to: (4) Extend the model by considering the role of traumatic experience in the prediction of M&#257;ori health service utilisation. The Andersen model was found to explain between 8.5% and 26% of variability in the sample's use of six types of health care, finding need characteristics to be the major determinants of health care use. Life events was not a significant contributor to explaining use, and psychological distress was effective only in predicting mental health service use. Findings suggest that using aggregate measures of traumatic experience is not a particularly helpful strategy for predicting subsequent health care use by M&#257;ori. On reflection of findings and implications the present study concludes with discussion concerning: (1) A need to advance conceptualisations of what constitutes health services for M&#257;ori; (2) suggestions for future examination of trauma and M&#257;ori health care use; (3) the role of culture in influencing health beliefs and behaviour; and (4) potential barriers to health care access by M&#257;ori.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Medical care</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Health and hygiene</field><field name="subject">Mental health</field><field name="subject">Health psychology</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Health services uptake</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380107 Health, clinical and counselling psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1691</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pathways and policy : approaches to community resource access, health and wellbeing in two New Zealand cities : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Public Health at Centre for Social and Health Outcomes Research and Evaluation, Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Field, Adrian</field><field name="description">This research examines access to community resources - services, facilities and amenities that are potentially health promoting - in two New Zealand territorial authorities, and the policy and planning frameworks of each regarding community resources. International research evidence indicates that community resource access is potentially beneficial to health and wellbeing, through creating supportive environments for health, and providing venues to facilitate social connections. Review of the urban design and planning literature indicates that community resource access is strongly influenced by the dominant urban design and planning models. Geographic information systems were used to develop a Census meshblock-based indicator of community resource accessibility (the Community Resource Accessibility Index). Quantitative analysis examined associations of resource access with socio-economic and demographic population patterns. Qualitative analysis, using key informant interviews and document analysis, explored policies on community resource access, and the role of health and wellbeing as a policy goal for each territorial authority. Quantitative analysis revealed the socio-economically wealthier city had higher overall levels of community resource access, but within each city, more deprived areas had higher levels of access. The location of community resources within poorer areas reduces the mobility costs of people within these areas to access such resources, and makes more available the general health benefits of community resources. Qualitative analysis indicated community resources are important components of urban strategies. Historic patterns of community resource development, aggregated city wealth and local policies were important determinants of the level of community resource access. In New Zealand, as will be the case internationally to varying degrees, there is considerable scope for territorial authorities to enhance local health and wellbeing, through direct delivery of community resources, and through collaboration with external agencies to develop community resources that are outside the direct responsibilities of territorial authorities. When these findings are considered in the context of the passage of local government legislation in late 2002, there is growing potential for territorial authorities to use a variety of levers to enhance community resource access, and by implication, health and wellbeing. Health promoters have opportunities to engage with local government and contribute to urban development strategies, for the purposes of enhancing population health and reducing health inequalities.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Public health</field><field name="subject">City planning</field><field name="subject">Community life</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Waitakere</field><field name="subject">North Shore City</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321214 Health and community services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1692</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Professional supervision in a community of practice : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Educational Psychology, Massey University, Albany Campus, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Annan, Jean</field><field name="description">Previous research of supervision in educational psychology has regularly reported low rates of participation and dissatisfaction with the adequacy of supervisory arrangements. Most studies to date have been conducted on the assumption that supervision is a formalised, often one-to-one relationship. However, this view of supervision is incongruent with the ecological theories of human development that currently guide educational psychologists' work. The present study sought to develop understanding of the nature and contexts of supervision for a group of educational psychologists through examination of the actions they took to meet the goals of supervision. A situational analysis research method was used to examine the supervisory actions, in relation to the theories underlying current field practice, of 38 educational psychologists. This collaborative method of inquiry reflected the procedures of the psychologists' professional practice and enabled the understanding of supervision to be constructed using the participants' own sense-making processes. Results of the study indicated that the psychologists pursued the goals of supervision through the multiple interactions that took place within the regular activity of their community of practice. Supervision included a combination of formal, informal and situated interactions. It was concerned with connectedness to the professional community and comprised a range of integrated activities. The psychologists demonstrated that their supervision-in-action was guided by the same ecological principles that guided their professional practice. When supervision was conceptualised as a practice that included formal, informal and situated interactions intended to meet the goals of supervision, the participants reported high levels of satisfaction with current supervisory arrangements and participation in the practice. This thesis proposes an extended view of supervision that depicts supervision as activity situated within the interaction of a community of practice. It suggests that ecologically valid evaluations of supervision activity and the development of applicable systems of supervision must consider a wide range of supervision activities and contexts of practice.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Educational psychologists</field><field name="subject">Educational Psychology</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330101 Educational psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1693</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Static electric dipole polarizabilities of atoms and molecules : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Chemistry at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Lim, Ivan S</field><field name="description">The static dipole polarizabilities and ionization potentials of the first and second main group elements, including the charged ions, are obtained from all-electron relativistic coupled-cluster theory using a scalar relativistic Douglas-Kroll Hamiltonian. Spin-orbit coupling effects are investigated using a fully relativistic four-component Dirac-Coulomb-Hartree-Fock scheme followed by a second-order many-body perturbation treatment to account for electron correlation. Periodic trends in the dipole polarizabilities and the ionization potentials are discussed. In each case, a detailed discussion on electron correlation and relativistic effects are given. A relationship for relativistic and electron correlation effects between the dipole polarizability and the ionization potential is established. Particular attention is paid to the evaluation of a near basis set limit quality of the dipole polarizabilities. This is accomplished by the evaluation of all-electron basis sets used, followed by an extensive study on the convergence behavior of the dipole polarizabilities with respect to a finite basis set expansion. The present all-electron dipole polarizabilities are believed to be very precise, especially for charged ions where the availability of experimental values are limited. Scalar relativistic small-core pseudopotentials are fitted and their performance is tested in terms of static dipole polarizabilities and ionization potentials. It is demonstrated that the small core definition of the pseudopotential (nine-valence electron for the main group 1 and ten-valence electron for the main group 2 elements) enables us to safely omit core-valence correlation without scarifying accuracy. Following atomic dipole polarizabilities, applications are made to molecules starting with alkali dimers and their singly charged ions. The scalar relativistic pseudopotentials of this study are used to calculate equilibrium bond lengths, dissociation energies, vibrational frequencies and the dipole polarizabilities of these dimers. The change in the molecular dipole polarizabilities from the corresponding atomic dipole polarizabilities are discussed in terms of molecular bonding models. Simple ammonia complexes of the alkali-metals and their singly charged ions are studied. The equilibrium geometries, dissociation energies, harmonic vibrational frequencies as well as the dipole polarizabilities of these complexes are given.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Polarization (Electricity)</field><field name="subject">Dipole moments</field><field name="subject">Atoms</field><field name="subject">Molecules</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences::250100 Physical Chemistry (Incl.

Method: 250 consecutive cases of M&#257;ori who attempted suicide who were admitted to one of the three Auckland public hospitals were compared to 250 random, M&#257;ori community-based controls (found through door knocking). Participants were compared on a variety of measures including the General Health Questionnaire-28 (GHQ-28), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), CAGE Alcohol Screening Test; Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI-suicidality), Beck's Scale of Suicide Intent (SIS); and cultural identity validated questionnaires. Results: Response rates were high for both cases (85.6%) and controls (81.2%). The multivariate analysis revealed that poor general health status was the key risk factor associated with attempted suicide among M&#257;ori. Once the health indicator is taken out of the analysis, cultural identity, marijuana utilisation and interpersonal abuse are the next major risk factors in attempted suicide among M&#257;ori. Conclusion: Suffering from poor general health can increase attempted suicide among M&#257;ori. Having a notional identity and not being connected to M&#257;oritanga (those things M&#257;ori; M&#257;ori culture) is associated with the risk of suicidal behaviour.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Suicidal behaviour</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::379900 Other Studies In Human Society::379902 Indigenous studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1695</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From coal pit to leather pit : life stories of Robert Semple : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of a PhD in History at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Hickey, Carina</field><field name="description">In the Dictionary of New Zealand Biography Len Richardson described Robert Semple as one of the most colourful leaders of the New Zealand labour movement in the first half of the twentieth century. Semple was a national figure in his time and, although historians had outlined some aspects of his public career, there has been no full-length biography written on him. In New Zealand history his characterisation is dominated by two public personas. Firstly, he is remembered as the radical organiser for the New Zealand Federation of Labour (colloquially known as the Red Feds), during 1910-1913. Semple&#8217;s second image is as the flamboyant Minister of Public Works in the first New Zealand Labour government from 1935-49.   This thesis is not organised in a chronological structure as may be expected of a biography but is centred on a series of themes which have appeared most prominently and which reflect the patterns most prevalent in Semple&#8217;s life. The themes were based on activities which were of perceived value to Semple. Thus, the thematic selection was a complex interaction between an author&#8217;s role shaping and forming Semple&#8217;s life and perceived real patterns visible in the sources. Chapter one explores Semple as an Australian New Zealander whose relationship with his homeland was a complex one, continually affected by issues such as time, place and political expediency. Chapter two considers Semple in the identity which was arguably the most radical in New Zealand historiography &#8211; the Socialist. Several facets of Semple&#8217;s socialism will be examined including militant socialism, from which his radical persona was formed, state socialism and practical socialism. To improve the lives of working people was Semple&#8217;s aim in life, so the third thematic chapter examines Semple&#8217;s role as a union organiser &#8211; this was a vehicle through which he pursued this aim. It was from this image that Semple&#8217;s public career was founded and then sustained. In the fourth chapter Semple, the Labour politician will be examined. Here his ultimate aim was to improve conditions for all New Zealanders and the several arenas in which Semple pursued this end included party activities, municipal politics and ministerial office. In these two chapters changes in Semple&#8217;s political perspectives can be seen as labour concerns became subservient to national concerns when he became part of the Labour government. Chapter five examines Semple as an anti-militarist which was the image where the greatest change in political perspective was evidenced. Semple, the anti-conscriptionist of one world war, drew the marble for the first conscription ballot in the next. These themes are not the only ones in Semple&#8217;s life but appear most consistently during his lifetime.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Robert Semple</field><field name="subject">New Zealand labour movement</field><field name="subject">Politicians</field><field name="subject">Socialists</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::430000 History and Archaeology::430100 Historical Studies::430101 History: New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1696</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tongan metaphors of social work practice : Hang&#275; ha p&#257; kuo fa'u&#180; : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Social Work at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Mafile&#699;o, Tracie Ailong</field><field name="description">This study explores Tongan social work practice and examines how social and community work is constructed from a Tongan worldview. Tongan social workers in Aotearoa New Zealand participated in individual interviews and focus group meetings which explored the Tongan values, knowledge, skills and processes foundational to their practice. The participants' narratives contribute to an understanding of Tongan conceptions of wellbeing, personal and social change and to an identification of key components of a Tongan theoretical framework for social and community work practice. This exploratory study contributes to the growing literature articulating indigenous and non-western frameworks for social and community work practice. Seeking to draw on a Tongan interpretive framework, the thesis employs metaphors, in particular two fishing practices (pola and uku), to draw the findings together. Pola, a community fishing practice, illustrates a Tongan social welfare system comprised of core values, namely: fetokoni'aki (mutual helpfulness), tauhi v&#257; (looking after relationships), faka'apa'apa (respect) and 'ofa (love). Maintaining this Tongan system in the diaspora is central to the purpose of Tongan social and community work and the values themselves are a basis for practice. Other key concepts are shown to define a Tongan practice framework and these are identified as: fakafekau'aki (connecting), a'u tonu (going in person), lotu (spirituality/prayer/religion), fakat&#333;kilalo (humility), fie'aonga (wanting to be useful), matak&#257;inga (behaving like family) and 'osikiavelenga (doing utmost). The uku metaphor draws parallels to specialised practices of fishing or diving under the reef, around pupu'a puhi (blowholes). Similarly, Tongan social and community work involves specific processes which draw on a constellation of skills and values. Fakatoukatea (skills in opposite directions) is important for bridging Tongan and p&#257;langi contexts, for working across various fields of practice and for adopting family-like roles as a social worker. Lea fakatonga (Tongan language), hua (humour)and feongo'i'aki (intuitive use of feelings) are important aspects of a Tongan social work approach. Tongan social and community work is located primarily within k&#257;inga (extended family) and community. This location of social work reconstructs conventional conceptions of professionalism and relationships become a key force for change within a Tongan framework. A balance between a directive and empowerment approach needs to be achieved and an advocacy emphasis is required given the position of Tongans in the diaspora. This thesis demonstrates that a framework for social and community work derived from a Tongan worldview: provides new discourses and thinking within the critical postmodern tradition; is negotiated alongside other discourses thus creating spaces of possibility; is characterised by layers of ethnic specific, indigenous and humanity level differences and commonalities; emphasises the moral-artistic nature of social and community work; and challenges social work to be more diverse in terms of practice competencies, supervision, cross-cultural practice, education and community development. The thesis argues that if social and community work is to be transformative, it must itself be transformed and its very foundations reshaped by Tongan and other indigenous, non-western voices.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tongan community</field><field name="subject">Social work practice</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370200 Social Work</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1697</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The transformation on an icon in the new economy : a theoretical and empirical exploration of the New Zealand reforms : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Sociology at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Baird, Samuel William</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the impact of neo-liberal reforms, initiated in response to the exigencies of a new technologically-driven global economy, on a conservative interventionist state. It is a sociological work, which encompasses history, politics, economics, organisations, social action and societal change. Between 1984 and 1990, the Fourth Labour Government embarked upon the reform of the structure and operation of the New Zealand economy. That reform ranks amongst the most radical and far-reaching in twentieth century New Zealand. Not only were the scope and magnitude of the changes significant but they were also implemented with a rapidity that took most of the country by surprise. Consequently, New Zealanders were exposed to a new and flexible economy, where market forces provided a major contrast with the ideals of equity and consensus that had shaped social conditions since the 1950s. This new environment had significant implications for the career expectations and working environment of many people, and for the delivery and content of public services. This thesis adds to the existing body of knowledge on the New Zealand reforms by capturing and investigating the perspectives of key actors who were involved, in a number of ways, with the transformation of the economy. It explores the theoretical and empirical basis of the reform programme, the restructuring process, the nature and scale of an intense commercialisation strategy, the attitudes of a new generation of workers and the reactions of New Zealanders when their ontological security came under threat. Key aspects of the reforms are framed and analysed through the transformation of the New Zealand Post Office from an icon of the interventionist state, a major employer and key service provider - to a commercial enterprise which sought to be a competitive, flexible, profit-driven organisation typical of the new economy. The experiences of politicians and senior managers who were responsible for this transformation through to individuals who depended on the organisation for services and jobs, are represented in the thesis as indicative of the actions and responses of New Zealanders, generally, regarding much broader social and organisational changes brought about by the reforms.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Economic reform</field><field name="subject">Privatisation</field><field name="subject">Post Office</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370100 Sociology::370107 Social change</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1698</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Attachment to God as a source of struggle and strength : exploring the association between Christians' relationship with God and their emotional wellbeing</field><field name="creator">Calvert, Sarah Jenay</field><field name="description">Research has highlighted the significant implications of spirituality for mental health and therapy. However, a key facet of spirituality yet to receive adequate research attention is people&#8217;s experience of their relationship with God. One useful theoretical framework recently applied to this relationship is attachment theory. Research suggests that many people experience their relationship with God as an attachment bond, and that styles of attachment to God (ATG) may have implications for mental health similar to human attachment. However, few studies have directly investigated the relationship between ATG and mental health, and limitations of these studies make it difficult to draw conclusions. The present study provides a more rigorous exploration of this relationship through the use of a cross-lagged research design, advanced statistical modelling, and investigation of potential moderators (gender and negative events). A convenience sample of 531 Christian adults was surveyed at two time points approximately four months apart. ATG was measured on two dimensions: ATG-avoidance (avoidance of intimacy with/dependence on God) and ATG-anxiety (preoccupations and fears regarding God&#8217;s rejection). Higher levels of baseline ATG-anxiety predicted poorer emotional wellbeing at Time 2, after controlling for baseline emotional wellbeing. This effect was stronger amongst participants experiencing a high level of negative events. Findings also indicate a potential mechanism for this effect. Specifically, ATG-anxiety was associated with a tendency to appraise negative events as indicating God&#8217;s abandonment/punishment. These appraisals mediated the relationship between ATG-anxiety and emotional wellbeing. In contrast, low levels of ATG-anxiety buffered the effects of negative events. The effects of ATG-anxiety were significant only amongst males, contrary to hypotheses. ATG-avoidance did not show hypothesised effects on emotional wellbeing in either gender. Possible limitations of the ATG-avoidance measure were noted, and may have influenced findings. Suggestions were made as to how future studies might address this potential measurement issue and other limitations of the study. Findings indicate that ATG theory may have useful therapeutic applications, as proposed by previous researchers. Specifically, the ATG framework may be useful for conceptualising clients&#8217; relationship with God and its effects on mental health, although establishing this will ultimately require testing in clinical samples.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Attachment to God</field><field name="subject">Emotional wellbeing</field><field name="subject">Christians</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380107 Health, clinical and counselling psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1699</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Strategy-making processes of small and medium enterprises in New Zealand : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Strategic Management at Massey University (Albany), New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Verreynne, Martie-Louise</field><field name="description">The concept of strategy-making in small and medium enterprises (SMEs) has been the source of much debate. Received wisdom suggests that strategy-making does not take place in SMEs. or is at best limited, often only for the purpose of attaining finance. Moreover, there is mixed evidence regarding the relationship between strategy-making in SMEs and firm performance. This thesis empirically addresses these hotly contested issues by asking: What are the strategy-making processes of SMEs in New Zealand and how are these related to firm performance? In order to answer this question the thesis uses the general literature on strategy-making processes and builds a framework tailored for SMEs drawing from the literature on strategic planning by SME scholars. Propositions derived from the framework are then empirically tested in a cross-industry sample of 477 SMEs in New Zealand. Several important conclusions are drawn in this study. First, through confirmatory factor analysis, four modes of strategy-making process emerge as relevant to SMEs, namely the simplistic, adaptive, participative, and intrapreneurial modes. Second, these modes are related to firm performance. Causal modelling indicates that adaptive and participative strategy-making contribute to firm performance, while simplistic strategy-making results from firm performance. The intrapreneurial mode shows little relation with firm performance, unless it is used in combination with a differentiation strategy. Third, firms with capabilities in several modes of strategy-making outperform firms that are only good at one or no modes of strategy-making. Fourth, the relationships between firm performance and the modes of strategy-making employed are influenced by a variety of context factors such as the firm's structure and competitive environment as well as the business strategics used. Fifth, and most fundamentally, the study demonstrates that SMEs do make strategy.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Business performance</field><field name="subject">Small business</field><field name="subject">Strategic planning</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1700</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cognitive strategy application during everyday task performance in men with HIV-1 dementia</field><field name="creator">Ranka, Judy L.</field><field name="description">Doctor of Health Sciences</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">HIV associated dementia</field><field name="subject">ecological assessment</field><field name="subject">everyday tasks</field><field name="subject">occupational therapy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/6617</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Use of pectinases to improve the nutritive value of lupins for poultry</field><field name="creator">Ali, Ahmed</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Australia produces 87% of the world&#146;s lupins (Lupinus angustifolius) which have the potential to be an excellent source of protein and energy in animal diets. However, feed manufacturers and poultry producers cannot use more than about 5% lupins in broiler and 7% in layer diets. The main reason is because 34% of the lupin grain comprises complex cell-wall polysaccharides that are indigestible. The main component of cell walls in lupins is pectin (33%). Poultry cannot digest pectin because they don't secrete the appropriate enzymes so their ability to use lupins is limited. Undigested pectins increase the viscosity of digesta in the bird's digestive tract, which in turn reduces the digestibility of dry matter and efficiency of feed utilisation. Pectins also increase water-holding capacity, a characteristic directly related to water intake and wet droppings. In this thesis, I tested the general hypothesis that breakdown of cell walls and pectins will improve the nutritive value of lupins for broilers and layers and reduce wet droppings. This hypothesis was tested in six experiments by treating lupins with specific exogenous enzymes (pectinases) or mechanical-heat treatment (expansion) plus pectinase. In the first experiment, attempts to break down the cell walls and pectins using four doses of pectinase, specifically polygalacturonase (PG), succeeded in improving the nutritive value of whole and dehulled lupins for egg layers. The lowest dose, 0.6g/kg diet, was the most effective dose for reducing water intake, wet droppings, the viscosity of the digesta and the number of soiled eggs. ...  Equivalent figures for layers were 14, 15, 5 and 8%, indicating that the pectinases were slightly more effective in layers than broilers. For diets containing 20% dehulled lupins, pectinases were also very effective at breaking down both pectin and cell walls to release nutrients and, concomitantly, reducing water intake and wet droppings, but the magnitude of the responses was slightly less than with the 10% dehulled lupin diets. For diets containing 30% dehulled lupins, although the pectinases again were effective at breaking down pectin and cell walls and reducing viscosity, they did not reduce water intake or wet droppings. This might be due to the large amounts of nonmethylated pectic polysaccharides, which make up two thirds of the cell walls, by increasing water-holding capacity particularly when dehulled lupins are included in the diet at high levels (up to 30%). These polysaccharides might be broken down by appropriate enzymes. This hypothesis is worth testing in the future. Overall, the results of my study supported the general hypothesis. These in vivo results are conclusive and consistent. They show that an optimum combination of PME and PG is capable of including dehulled lupins up to 20% in broiler and layer diets without any nutritional or hygienic problems. The strategies I developed have proven very useful for breaking down the cell walls and pectins, improving the nutritive value of lupins for broilers and layers, and reducing wet droppings. By using the optimum combination of two pectinases, it should be possible to make substantial improvements in the nutritive value of lupins for broilers and layers, most importantly by reducing excessive water intake and wet droppings associated with feeding dehulled lupins. Without pectinases, the amount of dehulled lupins used in poultry diets is fairly small (7%), but if pectinases are used, this upper limit can be lifted to 20%.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lupines -- Nutrition -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Lupines -- Seeds -- Australia -- Testing</field><field name="subject">Polygalacturonase</field><field name="subject">Poultry -- Feeding and feeds -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Lupins</field><field name="subject">Pectin</field><field name="subject">Poultry</field><field name="subject">Enzyme</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0094</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The characterization and temporal distribution of cosmological gravitational wave treatments</field><field name="creator">Howell, Eric John</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] As gravitational wave detectors approach sensitivities that will allow observations to become routine, astrophysics lies on the cusp of an exciting new era. Potential sources will include transients such as merging neutron stars and black holes, supernova explosions or the engines that power gamma-ray bursts. This thesis will be devoted to the astrophysical gravitational wave background signal produced by cosmological populations of such transient signals. Particular attention will be devoted to the observation-time dependence imposed on the individual sources that accumulate to produce a gravitational wave background signal. The ultimate aim is to determine what information is encoded in the temporal evolution of such a signal. To lay the foundations for further investigation, the stochastic gravitational wave background signal from neutron star birth throughout the Universe has been calculated. In view of the uncertainties in both the single-source emissions and source rate histories, several models of each are employed. The results show that that the resulting signals are only weakly dependent on the source-rate evolution model and that prominent features in the single-source spectra can be related to the background spectra. In comparison with previous studies, the use of relativistic single-source gravitational wave waveforms rather than Newtonian models and a more slowly evolving source-rate density results in a 1 { 2 order of magnitude reduction in signal. ... A comparison with the more commonly used brightness distribution of events shows that when applying both methods to a data stream containing a background of Gaussian distributed false alarms, the brightness distribution yielded lower standard errors, but was biased by the false alarms. In comparison, a fitting procedure based on the time evolution of events was less prone to errors resulting from false alarms, but as fewer events contributed to the data, had a lower resolution. In further support of the time dependent signature of transient events, an alternative technique is fiapplied to the same source population. In this case, the local rate density is probed by measuring the statistical compatibility of the filtered data against synthetic time dependent data. Although this method is not as compact as the fitting procedure, the rate estimates are compatible. To further investigate how the observation time dependence of transient populations can be used to constrain global parameters, the method is applied to Swift long gamma-ray burst data. By considering a distribution in peak &#176;ux rather than a gravitational wave amplitude, gamma-ray bursts can be considered as a surrogate for resolved gravitational wave transients. For this application a peak &#176;ux{observation time relation is described that takes the form of a power law that is invariant to the luminosity distribution of the sources. Additionally, the method is enhanced by invoking time reversal invariance and the temporal cosmological principle. Results are presented to show that the peak &#176;ux{observation time relation is in good agreement with recent estimates of source parameters. Additionally, to show that the intrinsic time dependence allows the method to be used as a predictive tool, projections are made to determine the upper limits in peak &#176;ux of future gamma-ray burst detections for Swift.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gravitational waves -- Measurement -- Instruments</field><field name="subject">Gamma ray bursts</field><field name="subject">Simultaneity (Physics)</field><field name="subject">Relativity (Physics) -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Relativistic astrophysics</field><field name="subject">Gravitational waves</field><field name="subject">Gamma ray bursts</field><field name="subject">Cosmology</field><field name="subject">General relativity</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0095</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Informing best practice in mental health : using feedback to improve clinical outcomes</field><field name="creator">Newnham, Elizabeth A.</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Physical healthcare uses a suite of tools for measuring response to treatment. However, reliable systems of regular patient monitoring are rare in mental healthcare. Mental health services often measure a treatment response from pre- to post- therapy, yet measurement between those occasions is less common. This omission is problematic since arguably there is a need for an alarm system in psychotherapy (Andrews &amp; Page, 2005). A substantial minority of patients do not experience reliable change following treatment, and a small proportion deteriorates (Hansen, Lambert, &amp; Forman, 2002; Newnham, Harwood, &amp; Page, 2007). Without monitoring, it is not always possible to know which patients are progressing poorly. Since the publication of Howard and colleagues' (1996) proposal that patient progress be monitored routinely during therapy and the results fed back to clinicians to direct treatment, this monitoring regime has garnered attention in the United States and Europe (Lambert, 2007; Lutz, et al., 2006). Findings in outpatient psychotherapy have demonstrated that providing real-time feedback on patient progress to clinicians and patients significantly improves clinical outcomes for those patients demonstrating a negative response to treatment (Harmon et al., 2007; Lambert et al., 2001; Lambert et al., 2002). What is not yet apparent is how these processes would generalize to inpatient and day patient (i.e. patients attending hospital for a whole day of treatment) psychiatric care. Inpatients often present with greater severity and are treated in an intensive setting. ...  Deviations from this expected pattern would highlight possible differences between inpatient and outpatient care. To develop an appropriate system for monitoring patient progress, it was important to first define clinically significant recovery in inpatient psychiatric care, and provide criteria for clinicians to judge outcome in routine practice (Newnham, Harwood, &amp; Page, 2007). Second, a quick and easy-to-administer system of progress monitoring and real-time feedback was developed to enhance treatment decision making (Newnham, Hooke, &amp; Page, 2009). Third, the system was evaluated to determine clinical effectiveness. Using the World Health Organization&#146;s Wellbeing Index, a program for monitoring patient progress and providing feedback to clinicians and patients was established at Western Australia's largest private psychiatric service. The sample consisted of 1308 consecutive inpatients and day patients whose primary diagnoses were predominantly depressive (67.7%) and anxiety (25.9%) disorders. Feedback to patients and clinicians was effective in reducing depressive symptoms (F (1,649) = 6.29, p&lt;.05) for those patients at risk of poor outcome, but not effective in improving wellbeing (F (1,569) = 1.14, p&gt;.05). The findings support the use of progress monitoring and feedback in psychiatric care to improve symptom outcomes, but raise questions about changes in wellbeing during psychotherapy. The effectiveness study was conducted as a historical cohort trial, consistent with quality improvement efforts, and replication with a randomized controlled design is warranted. Feedback of progress information appears to be an important process within psychotherapy, and further investigation of the means by which clinicians and patients use that information is necessary.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mental health services -- Evaluation</field><field name="subject">Outcome assessment (Medical care) -- Evaluation</field><field name="subject">Depression, Mental -- Treatment -- Evaluation</field><field name="subject">Hospital patients -- Psychology</field><field name="subject">Patient monitoring</field><field name="subject">Clinical psychology</field><field name="subject">Outcome assessment</field><field name="subject">Progress monitoring</field><field name="subject">Feedback</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0096</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating TNF inhibition of IGF-1 signalling via JNK in cell culture models of skeletal muscle atrophy</field><field name="creator">Gebski, Bijanka L.</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The pro-inflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor (TNF) has a critical role in skeletal muscle atrophy. The catabolic effect of TNF is partially due to abrogation of the anabolic insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) signalling pathway. However, the precise signalling events that lead to the loss of myofibrillar protein following activation of TNF receptor are unknown. The over arching aim of the study is to determine the mechanisms of by which TNF induces atrophy in differentiated muscles cells. To achieve this aim a series of experiments were performed to: 1) investigate the molecular events that lead to TNF mediated myofibre atrophy, 2) determine to what extent c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) signalling plays a part in TNF induced myotube atrophy, and in TNF-mediated inhibition of IGF-1 induced hypertrophy, and 3) use inhibitors of JNK to block the catabolic effects of TNF. 1) To investigate the molecular events that lead to TNF mediated myofibre atrophy, the experiments were conducted using C2C12 mouse myotube cultures and primary myotube cultures derived from FVB mice, and transgenic mice which over-express Class 2 IGF-1 Ea in skeletal muscles (IGF:C2). The treatment of mature C2C12 and FVB primary myotubes (respectively at 7 and 4 days after fusion medium) with 10 ng/mL of TNF for 3 days resulted in statistically significant myotube atrophy (decreased mean width). The observed TNF-mediated atrophy has not previously been demonstrated in tissue cultured myotubes. In contrast, addition of IGF-1 (20 ng/ml) to 7 day C2C12 myotubes for 3 days resulted in significant hypertrophy. ... The most suitable inhibitor was TAT-TIJIP and was thus used in subsequent studies. Inhibition of JNK activity by TAT-TIJIP was confirmed indirectly by detecting nuclear translocation of c- Jun, which is a downstream target of phosphorylated JNK. Immunohistochemical analyses showed nuclear localisation and phosphorylation of c-Jun in TNF treated myotubes. Nuclear localisation and phosphorylation of c-Jun was not observed in cultures pre-treated with TAT-TIJIP before TNF treatment, nor in the untreated control myotubes. 3) The use of JNK inhibitors to block the catabolic effects of TNF was tested using C2C12 and primary myotube cultures. Pre-treatment of C2C12 and primary FVB myotubes with the JNK inhibitor TAT-TIJIP, 30 min before TNF administration (for 3 days) prevented myotube atrophy. The mean width of myotubes pre-treated with TATTIJIP prior to TNF treatment closely resembled that of the control myotubes. Administration of TNF in combination with TAT-TIJIP for 3 days to C2C12 myotubes prevented myotube atrophy and unexpectedly resulted in hypertrophy when compared to the mean widths of untreated and TAT-TIJIP treated myotubes. This trend was also demonstrated in the FVB primary cultures. These combined results strongly support the role of JNK in TNF-mediated atrophy. Preliminary studies were carried out in vivo using the mdx mouse model of muscular dystrophy, TAT-TIJIP was administered via intraperitoneal injection to the mice for 3 days at a dose of 10 mg/ml, however the results form this study are inconclusive. These novel observations are of considerable interest to the field of muscle wasting because they demonstrate for the first time TNF-mediated myotube atrophy, the role of JNK in situations of TNF induced muscle atrophy, and explore the use of JNK inhibitors to prevent muscle atrophy.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">JNK mitogen-activated protein kinases -- Antogonists</field><field name="subject">Insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins</field><field name="subject">Tumor necrosis factor -- Therapeutic use</field><field name="subject">Duchenne muscular dystrophy -- Molecular aspects</field><field name="subject">TNF</field><field name="subject">JNK</field><field name="subject">IGF-1</field><field name="subject">Muscle</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0097</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Numerical methods for the solution of the HJB equations arising in European and American option pricing with proportional transaction costs</field><field name="creator">Li, Wen</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the investigation of numerical methods for the solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations arising in European and American option pricing with proportional transaction costs. We first consider the problem of computing reservation purchase and write prices of a European option in the model proposed by Davis, Panas and Zariphopoulou [19]. It has been shown [19] that computing the reservation purchase and write prices of a European option involves solving three different fully nonlinear HJB equations. In this thesis, we propose a penalty approach combined with a finite difference scheme to solve the HJB equations. We first approximate each of the HJB equations by a quasi-linear second order partial differential equation containing two linear penalty terms with penalty parameters. We then develop a numerical scheme based on the finite differencing in both space and time for solving the penalized equation. We prove that there exists a unique viscosity solution to the penalized equation and the viscosity solution to the penalized equation converges to that of the original HJB equation as the penalty parameters tend to infinity. We also prove that the solution of the finite difference scheme converges to the viscosity solution of the penalized equation. Numerical results are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. We extend the penalty approach combined with a finite difference scheme to the HJB equations in the American option pricing model proposed by Davis and Zarphopoulou [20]. Numerical experiments are presented to illustrate the theoretical findings.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hamilton-Jacobi equations</field><field name="subject">Options (Finance) -- Prices -- United States -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Options (Finance) -- Prices -- Europe -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Differential equations, Partial -- Numerical solutions</field><field name="subject">Finite differences</field><field name="subject">Viscosity solutions</field><field name="subject">Transaction costs -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Option pricing</field><field name="subject">Transaction costs</field><field name="subject">Penalty approach</field><field name="subject">Finite difference scheme</field><field name="subject">Viscosity solution</field><field name="subject">Partial differential equation</field><field name="subject">Optimal control</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0098</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The people of Roman Britain : a study of Romano-British burials</field><field name="creator">Lynch, Pamela</field><field name="description">This thesis utilises the evidence from mortuary archaeology to explore the identity of the inhabitants of Britain during the period of Roman rule. It assimilates burial evidence from diverse sources both published and unpublished and integrates it with other material and literary evidence to investigate the people of the province and examine aspects of their lives. By assessing the extent and reliability of the mortuary evidence and by combining this evidence from major cemeteries, smaller burial sites and individual or isolated burials it has been possible to determine aspects of their lives from a different perspective than that previously employed. The thesis has been divided into five parts. Part 1 (chapters 1 to 3) serves as an introduction. Part 2 (chapters 4 and 5) considers the evidence available while Part 3 (chapters 6 to 8) focuses on specific groups within the population. Part 4 (chapter 9) looks at instances of death and burial that differ from the norm and Part 5 (chapters 10-12) presents a picture of the daily life of these people. The study concludes with a summing up of the evidence and a look at the future of mortuary studies of Roman Britain. The introductory chapters set out the objectives of the dissertation, look at the work that has already been done in this area and evaluates the need for a synthesis of the available evidence. The scope of the project, both temporally and geographically is outlined in chapter 2. The third chapter takes a look at the contemporary written evidence available, in the form of literary and epigraphic contributions, and assesses its reliability as an indicator of the appearance and lives of the Romano-Britons. This survey looks not only at the Roman view of the natives of the province but extends beyond the Roman period to examine the literary evidence that is available from the subsequent centuries. Chapters 4 and 5 take an in-depth look at the evidence available on the people of Roman Britain. The extent of the burial evidence is reviewed in chapter 4 while chapter 5 deals specifically and in depth with how this evidence can be utilised. The skeletal evidence is assessed for its extent and reliability. Factors affecting the survival of the remains is appraised and the effects of the biases created by such differential survival considered. Grave-goods and the organisation of the cemeteries are brought into the evaluation and the strengths and weaknesses of all of the evidence evaluated. The following chapters (6 to 11) focus on discrete aspects of the population. Chapters 6 to 8 look at the representation of specific groups within the community - the young, the elderly and those who arrived from other parts of the empire. With the aim of providing an indication of the diversity of both the composition of the population, the communities they represent and the associated burial rites, chapter 9 examines some of the more distinctive burials from Britain during this period. An area of intense interest, decapitation burials provides the focal point of this chapter. What may appear to be more mundane aspects of the lives of these people occupy chapters 10 to 12. What kept them busy, their occupations and their pastimes is viewed from the perspective of the burial evidence in chapters 10 and 11, while chapter 12 examines the mortuary evidence, in the form of funerary art and the remains of clothing, hair and accessories for their appearance.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Burial -- Great Britain -- History</field><field name="subject">Romans -- Great Britain -- Antiquities</field><field name="subject">Human remains (Archaeology) -- Great Britain</field><field name="subject">Great Britain -- Antiquities, Roman</field><field name="subject">Great Britain -- History -- Roman period, 55 B.C.-449 A.D.</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0101</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Outer membrane protein immunity to Pasteurella pneumotropica and the interaction of allergy</field><field name="creator">See, Sarah Bihui</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Infectious and allergic diseases of the respiratory tract are major contributors to global mortality, morbidity and economic burden. Bacterial infections such as pneumonia and otitis media are important diseases, especially in children, while allergic diseases such as asthma and allergic rhinitis afflict up to 30% of the world's population. A confounding aspect of respiratory disease is the evidence of a complex relationship between respiratory allergy and respiratory infection, with infection suggested to both promote and prevent the pathogenesis of allergic disease. Additionally, allergy is a risk factor for bacterial infection such as otitis media, pneumonia and sinusitis, while respiratory infection can exacerbate allergic symptoms. Given the burden of bacterial respiratory disease and respiratory allergy, the development of preventative treatments for these diseases is needed and will benefit from clearer knowledge of the underlying immune mechanisms. This thesis aimed to to extend current knowledge by using Pasteurella pneumotropica, a similar bacteria to the human pathogen nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi), to study respiratory infection and protective anti-outer membrane protein (OMP) immunity as well as the interaction of respiratory infection and allergic inflammation. Homologues of the important NTHi vaccine candidates P4, P6, P26 and D15 were found to be encoded by P. pneumotropica and a high level of amino acid sequence identity was noted between the different P. pneumotropica strains, as well as between other Pasteurellaceae members.  ... In contrast, anti-P6his serum antibodies transferred to na&#239;ve mice did not confer protection. These results suggested that T-cell&#150;mediated mechanisms were involved in P6his-mediated protection, and showed that the P. pneumotropcia model was useful for elucidating protective mechansims. The interaction of P. pneumotropica infection and papain-induced allergy was studied to investigate immune mechanisms underlying respiratory infection and allergy. Mice with ongoing allergic inflammation were intranasally challenged with bacteria and exhibited reduced pulmonary bacterial numbers, prolonged eosinophilia in the lungs and the induction of Th2 cytokines in the BALF, compared to nonallergic, infected mice. This suggested a protective role for allergic inflammation in this model. The effect of papaininduced inflammation on mice colonised by P. pneumotropica was also examined and allergic inflammation appeared to worsen infection in colonised mice. This suggested that allergic inflammation may also have a role in promoting infection in this model. In conclusion, this thesis explored mechanisms involved in vaccine-mediated immunity and the interaction of respiratory infection and allergy using a P. pneumotropica infection in its natural host. It was shown that intranasally administered recombinant P6 and P4 protected mice from lung infection, which justifies the inclusion of these OMPs as NTHi vaccine candidates. Additionally, it was demonstrated that the interaction of allergy and respiratory infection modulated immune responses. Overall, these results emphasize that a clearer understanding of the complex mechanisms underlying these interactions is required, and may be aided by the development of suitable animal models.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Allergy</field><field name="subject">Immunology</field><field name="subject">Membrane proteins</field><field name="subject">Mucous membrane -- Immunology</field><field name="subject">Mucous membrane -- Diseases -- Immunological aspects</field><field name="subject">Mucosal immunity</field><field name="subject">Immunology</field><field name="subject">Allergy</field><field name="subject">Outer membrane protein</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0103</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Applied physiology and game analysis of elite women's water polo</field><field name="creator">Tan, Frankie Hun Yau</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Broadly, research literature on the physiological aspects of water polo game play is limited, but particularly so in the women's game. Moreover, significant changes to game rules in recent years are likely to have had an impact on the game demands. Therefore, this research project sought to investigate the physiological characteristics of contemporary elite female water polo players and the demands of match play. Overall, the five studies comprising this thesis aimed to improve the practical knowledge of coaches and sport scientists concerning the training and monitoring of players. Study one (Chapter 3) compared two water polo-specific field tests of aerobic and/or match fitness (MSST, multistage shuttle swim test; and WIST, water polo intermittent shuttle test) with a traditional incremental swimming test to exhaustion (IST, 5 x 200 m). Prior to this study, the physiological responses to the MSST and WIST were not well understood. Additionally, the degree of association between these two tests was unknown. Therefore, 14 Australian National Women's Water Polo Squad players performed the MSST and WIST, and 13 players from a National Water Polo League club performed the MSST, WIST and IST, on separate occasions. Peak heart rate, blood lactate and ratings of perceived exertion were obtained for all tests. Expired air was collected post test for the National League players. The results showed that the National Squad players performed significantly better in the MSST (636 &#177; 114 vs. 437 &#177; 118 m, p &lt; 0.001) and WIST (270 &#177; 117 vs. 115 &#177; 57 m, p &lt; 0.001) than the National League players. ... Absolute decrement yielded TE of 0.55 s (-0.42-0.81), CV of 26.0% (19.3-41.0) and ICC of -0.002 (-0.44-0.44). Relative (%) decrement yielded TE of 1.6% (1.2-2.3), CV of 27.2% (20.1-42.9) and ICC of -0.02 (-0.46-0.42). Results indicate that total time was a reliable measure, whilst decrement was not. Similar to land-based RSA tests, total time should be the criterion measure of performance in the RST. The RST can form part of a specific battery of field tests for water polo, and can also be used as a conditioning tool. The final study (Chapter 7) was a nutritional-intervention study. Based on the time-motion data from study three, a 59-min match simulation test (MST) was designed to mimic the activity profiles and physical demands of water polo match play. Using a randomized cross-over double-blind design, 12 Australian National Women's Water Polo Squad players ingested 0.3 g&#183;kg-1 of NaHCO3 or placebo, 90 min before performing the MST, which included 56 x 10-m maximal-sprint swims as the performance measure. Although pre-exercise ingestion of NaHCO3 was effective in enhancing extracellular pH and bicarbonate levels, the percentage difference in mean sprint times between trials showed no substantial effects of NaHCO3 (0.4; &#177;0.9%, effect size = 0.09; &#177;0.23, p = 0.51). The results suggest that elite water polo players should not expect enhancement in intermittent-sprint performance from NaHCO3 supplementation. These findings are contrary to previous NaHCO3 studies on simulated team-sport performance, but this investigation is unique in that it examined highly-trained athletes performing sport-specific tasks. In conclusion, the findings of this thesis add to the existing literature on the applied physiology of women's water polo. It is hoped that the knowledge gained from these findings will lead to more appropriate conditioning, testing and selection outcomes.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Anthropometry</field><field name="subject">Physiology</field><field name="subject">Water polo -- Ability testing</field><field name="subject">Water polo -- Physiological aspects</field><field name="subject">Water polo players -- Physiology</field><field name="subject">Women athletes -- Physiology</field><field name="subject">Team sport</field><field name="subject">Intermittent exercise</field><field name="subject">Female athletes</field><field name="subject">Time-motion</field><field name="subject">Repeated high-intensity activity</field><field name="subject">Field tests</field><field name="subject">Performance</field><field name="subject">Reliability</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding the mechanisms of oxidation of pyritic shale in mining waste and the influence of shale properties on acid mine drainage in the Pilbara Basin</field><field name="creator">Song, Meining</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The influence of environmental conditions and properties of pyritic shale in the mining waste from Mt. Whaleback in Western Australia, in particular the inclusions and encapsulation of pyrite on the oxidation of pyritic shale and its subsequent acid mine drainage, was studied by employing an isothermal batch reactor system and QEMSCAN technique. The experimental technique was validated by comparing the experimental results obtained in this study with the literature data. It was found that the presence of water significantly accelerates the rate of shale oxidation. Weathering of the shale samples was found to influence the O2 consumption rate. It was also found that shale properties have a major effect on the oxidation rate and thereby affect the acid generation. Static test methods (Sobek and Lawrence) were employed to test the Neutralisation Potential (NP) of more than 100 actual and composite samples including pyritic shale samples, rock samples, mineral samples, various pyrite-mineral, pyrite-shale, and pseudo-shale blends. The influence of sample properties (bulk elemental composition, and mineralogy), test technique (Sobek and Lawrence) and associated variables (acid strength and volume) on the acid neutralisation potential of the samples was studied. It was found that the Sobek method produced consistently higher NP results under comparable acid conditions to those obtained with the Lawrence method. The theoretical NP values of individual minerals were calculated based on the mineral composition combined with the acid neutralising equations and ideal chemical formula. ... To experimentally model the major mineral phases, 11 minerals were used to produce pyrite-mineral blends and pseudo-shales, whose compositions mimic those of the actual shales studied. Mineral blends were employed to evaluate and contrast their individual acid generation or neutralisation behaviour with binary and higher order interactions. Blends of pyrite with some selected shales were also employed in this study. It was found that interactions can occur between the multiple mineral components which can enhance the rate of acid generation beyond that of the individual behaviour. It was found that the products from the pre-oxidation of shales, the properties and morphology of a sample such as the surface area, encapsulation, the mineralogy and pH all play a significant role in the acid generation and neutralisation rates. However, the absolute rate of acid generation appears to be most sensitive to the components such as Fe3+, which contribute to its reaction mechanisms. This investigation has provided a scientific insight into the acid generation and neutralisation behaviour of pyritic shale in relation to its mineralogy. It was found that the relative instantaneous rates of acid generation and consumption for individual minerals can be significantly different to that of their total potentials for acid generation and neutralisation. The significantly different behaviour of the actual and pseudo shales suggests that at low pH, there may be other mechanisms underlying the net capacity and rates of shales to generate or consume acid than bulk mineralogy. These findings have significant implications to the mining industry operating in reactive grounds.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Acid mine drainage -- Western Australia -- Pilbara</field><field name="subject">Pyrites -- Oxidation</field><field name="subject">Mine drainage</field><field name="subject">Pyrite oxidation</field><field name="subject">Acid mine drainage</field><field name="subject">Acid base accounting</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0107</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Maternal, umbilical cord and neonatal inflammatory and haematological markers in histologic chorioamnionitis</field><field name="creator">Howman, Rebecca A.</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Fetal inflammatory response syndrome (FIRS) has only recently been recognised as an important cause of spontaneous preterm delivery (PTD). In addition, it has been associated with a number of other short-term and long-term adverse neonatal outcomes, including early onset neonatal sepsis, necrotising enterocolitis, periventricular leucomalacia, cerebral palsy, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia, although the causal mechanisms are unclear. The hallmark of FIRS is histologic chorioamnionitis (HCA). Mothers with HCA are often asymptomatic and it remains unclear whether elevated maternal inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT), are predictive of preterm birth. Furthermore neonatal inflammatory markers such as CRP, PCT, white cell count (WCC) and absolute neutrophil count (ANC), are commonly used in clinical practice to diagnose infection in the neonatal period. Although both intrauterine inflammation and FIRS may have effects on inflammatory markers for up to 10 days following delivery, the extent to which intrauterine infection and FIRS confound these diagnostic surrogates of neonatal infection is unknown. This work addressed the hypothesis that HCA is associated with inflammatory changes that may be detected in the: (a) maternal circulation at the time of delivery, (b) umbilical cord blood at delivery and (c) post-natal circulation within the first 48 hours of life. The primary aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the presence of HCA and maternal inflammatory markers (serum CRP and PCT on the day of delivery) as well as neonatal inflammatory markers (haematological parameters, CRP and PCT up to 48 hours following delivery). ... Cord platelet counts were likely affected by platelet activation. For both intra-rater and inter-rater reproducibility, the corrected WCC, ANC and NRBC were shown to be reliable with an ICC of &gt;0.90 for all comparisons. However, I:T ratio was poorly reproducible. HCA appears to be a minor inflammatory insult for the mother. In the majority of cases it is asymptomatic and results in minor increases in PCT and CRP levels on the day of delivery. Conversely HCA results in significant inflammatory changes in the newborn that can be seen in the cord blood. Sensitive markers of inflammation in the cord blood are significantly higher in affected infants (CRP and PCT), while less sensitive markers, such as WCC and ANC are not significantly different. This study has shown that fetal inflammation has sustained effects on CRP and haematological parameters in early neonatal life; CRP, WCC and ANC are significantly higher in newborns exposed to HCA, peaking 24 hours following delivery. These effects may confound the interpretation of common diagnostic tests for early onset neonatal sepsis. Conclusion: HCA results in mild elevations in CRP and PCT in the cord blood. Over the subsequent 24 hours CRP, WCC and ANC increase significantly in these neonates. Intrauterine exposure to HCA may influence surrogate diagnostic markers for early onset sepsis in newborn infants. Future research to investigate novel diagnostic markers, such as CD64 and soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREM-1), or enhanced microbiological molecular diagnosis, will help distinguish true invasive infection from HCA-driven inflammation in the newborn infant.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Neonatal hematology</field><field name="subject">Maternal-fetal exchange</field><field name="subject">Pregnancy -- Complications -- Immunological aspects</field><field name="subject">Neonatal infections -- Immunological aspects</field><field name="subject">Fetus -- Immunology</field><field name="subject">Newborn infants -- Immunology</field><field name="subject">Inflammation</field><field name="subject">Histologic chorioamnionitis</field><field name="subject">Inflammatory markers</field><field name="subject">Neonatal</field><field name="subject">Maternal</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0117</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical processes along the southern continental shelf and slope of Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Mohd Akhir, Mohd Fadzil</field><field name="description">The circulation along the south coast of Western Australia was examined using field data and numerical modelling. Physical processes in this region, particularly along the continental shelf and slope regions, were poorly understood due to a paucity of field measurements. Data were collected during a research cruise on RV Southern Surveyor (04/2006) during April 2006 consisting of 18 CTD transects from Twilight Cove (126oE) to Cape Leeuwin (115oE) and was augmented by shipborne ADCP data. The field data set provided a detailed understanding of three major current systems: Leeuwin Current (LC), Leeuwin Undercurrent (LU) and Flinders Current (FC). The LC along the south coast exhibits different characteristics when compared to that along the west coast. The LC flows into the colder and lower salinity subantarctic environment of the south coast. This is evident in a strong geopotential gradient off the south-west corner of Australia (Cape Leeuwin) resulting in rapid acceleration of the LC as it reaches a maximum velocity in this region. Numerical modelling studies, using the Regional Ocean Modelling System (ROMS) indicated that wind stress is an important component of the dynamics in this region. This was identified when comparing summer and winter conditions when the winds act in opposite directions, from north-westerly to southeasterly respectively. Along the shelf break and slope, the Flinders Current (FC) interacts with LC. As the dominant current, the FC serves both as a surface and as an undercurrent, transporting sub Antarctic mode water (SAMW). This interconnection the FC and LU can be seen clearly from the salinity, temperature and velocities within the depth range 200-700m postulating a connection between subsurface waters off Tasmania (origin of the Flinders Current) and the tropical Indian Ocean through the Flinders and Leeuwin Undercurrents.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Continental shelf -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Ocean currents -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Ocean currents -- Indian Ocean</field><field name="subject">Leeuwin Current</field><field name="subject">Leeuwin Current</field><field name="subject">Coastal currents</field><field name="subject">Current circulation</field><field name="subject">Continental shelf</field><field name="subject">Leeuwin current</field><field name="subject">Flinders current</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0118</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In vitro toxicity assessment of silver and zinc oxide nanoparticles</field><field name="creator">Johnson, Clint Edwin</field><field name="description">Nanotoxicology is a nascent field of study concerned with the potential for nanotechnology to adversely impact human health or result in ecological damage. Nanomaterials can display unique physicochemical properties not present in the parent bulk material and it is these properties that may be a potential source of toxicity. There are a growing number of examples of nanomaterials functioning differently in biosystems compared to the parent bulk material. With the rapid growth of nanotechnology and increasing exposure of people to novel nanomaterials there is an urgent need to evaluate the toxicity of nanomaterials. In this study the toxicities of silver and zinc oxide nanoparticles were assessed. The effects of size and surface coating on the cytotoxicity and immunogenicity of silver nanoparticles were investigated, with cytotoxicity found to be inversely proportional to nanoparticle size. The subcutaneous penetration of zinc oxide nanoparticles was assessed to determine whether this material can be safely used as a UV filter in sunscreens and cosmetics. No dermal penetration was detected using a porcine in vitro model. Zinc oxide nanoparticles were also used as a model material to investigate nano-specific toxicity by comparing cytotoxicity and changes to gene expression with bulk scale zinc oxide. In both cases cytotoxicity and changes to gene expression were greater for zinc oxide nanoparticles. Methods and techniques to test the toxicity of nanomaterials in vitro and the implication for in vivo toxicity are only beginning to be elucidated. The methods and techniques used in this study, particularly nanomaterial stabilization in biofluids and toxicity testing using blood cell cultures, may assist the establishment of standard in vitro testing protocols for nanomaterials.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nanoparticles -- Toxicology</field><field name="subject">Nanostructured materials -- Toxicology</field><field name="subject">Nanotechnology -- Health aspects</field><field name="subject">Silver</field><field name="subject">Toxicology</field><field name="subject">Zinc oxide</field><field name="subject">Nanotoxicology</field><field name="subject">Zinc oxide</field><field name="subject">Silver</field><field name="subject">Nanoparticles</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0119</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'What's wrong with being sexy?'

The rationale was to use controlled traffic technology to facilitate relay and double cropping and thus research a cropping system that could exploit late winter crop rainfall. In Field Trial I, grain sorghum and sunflower, broadacre crops already grown within the Southern and Darling Downs regions of Queensland and New South Wales were intercropped into wheat; sunflower was intercropped with wheat in Field Trial II. Sole summer plantings were made at the same time as intercrops were planted. The wheat crop was cut and stubble removed to facilitate this. Various planting dates (three for Field Trial I; four for Field Trial II) for the relayed summer crops were used to determine if an optimum planting time existed. Plant height, tiller number, light interception, grain yield, soil moisture and economic return were used as parameters to compare the intercrop with sole plantings in Field Trial I. Grain yield, soil moisture, rainfall infiltration and economic return were measured in Field Trial II. Research also involved the modification and testing of a tractor to carry out the sowing of the intercrop. In Field Trial I, light interception was shown to vary at different stages of the wheat crop and the use of these stages to determine optimum planting dates of the relay crop is suggested. In both trials, no differences were recorded in the grain yield between intercropped and sole cropped wheat treatments suggesting the trafficking of the plot did not affect the wheat. As neither sorghum or sunflower established as intercrops, competition was not a factor in affecting wheat yields. Moisture readings in both trials showed little change below a depth of 100 cm; however some treatment differences were present at shallower depths. In Field ii Trial I, sole summer sorghum, especially the first planting date, showed reduced water capture/ higher soil evaporation due to wheat removal initially and later transpiration loss due to crop growth and increased weed pressure. Sole wheat treatments showed increased moisture storage after harvest due to lack of water use by the crop and increased infiltration/reduced runoff due to stubble retention. Improved soil moisture recharge after rainfall events was apparent in double cropped treatments suggesting not only improved water utilisation but also improved capture and storage is possible within this system. Sorghum, commonly used throughout south eastern Queensland as a summer crop option, proved unsuitable for relay intercropping in Field Trial I for Planting Dates 1 and 2. Minimum soil temperatures for these plantings were marginal as they were close to the 15o Celsius level recommended for sorghum. However, even though establishment was poor for the intercropped plantings, it was higher for sole sorghum plantings. Wheat allelopathic effects may be involved. To avoid the temperature limitations of sorghum, sunflower was selected as an alternative intercrop in the later planting dates of Field Trial I and all dates for Field Trial II. Reasons for the poor establishment and yield of sunflowers in the earlier intercrop planting dates compared to sole plantings remain unknown but also may be related to allelopathic effects from intercropped wheat. Low soil temperature was not a factor affecting establishment Yields for planting dates were recorded in the intercropped sunflower treatments for Field Trial II and the optimal planting time for sunflowers in a wheat/sunflower relay intercrop was identified as when physiological maturity of the wheat had occurred. This may relate to the wheat crop stage. In Field Trial II, no significant differences in soil moisture were recorded between treatments from overall water use for the trial period. There were differences in water use between intercropped and sole cropped treatments for iii some rainfall events. Three rainfall events were chosen for closer study in each of the field trials conducted. Each event varied in the length and time as well as the duration and intensity of the rain that fell for the period. For the first rainfall period the moisture content of the first planting date of the sole summer treatment and to a lesser extent the second planting date of the same treatment increased, most likely due to wheat removal. In the third rainfall period the double cropped sunflower treatment with stubble tended to store less moisture and this may be due to the active crop growth at this time. It was evident in both field trials of the need for an effective weed control program in the intercrop plots. Weeds were controlled in wheel tracks by glyphosate sprays. Cultural methods may help but a herbicide suitable for both components of the intercrop would be very useful. A tractor was successfully modified to a 3 metre wheelspace and a clearance of 70 cm. This proved sufficient for planting the relay intercrop in Field Trial II without negatively affecting the yield of the standing crop. The row spacing of 18 cm for wheat in a 3 metre fixed bed and wheeltrack configuration assisted with guidance and interplanting of the relay crop. The relay crop was sown as single alternating rows.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences</field><field name="subject">relay intercropping, controlled traffic, wheat, sunflower, sorghum, LER, ATER, CPR, tramlining, reaised beds</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159371</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Viable Software: the Intelligent Control Paradigm for Adaptable and Adaptive Architecture</field><field name="creator">Herring, Charles Edward</field><field name="description">The Intelligent Control Paradigm for software architecture is the result of this work. The Viable Software Approach is developed as an instance of the paradigm. The approach uses the Viable System Model as the basis for software system architecture. The result is a model-based architecture and approach for developing software systems by piecemeal adaptation with the goal that they become adaptive systems at runtime. Software built in this manner is called Viable Software. Viable Software represents a unifying class of self-controlling software that is an &#147;intelligent&#148; control system. Cybernetics, Control Theory, and Complexity Theory are the background for this work, and aspects relevant to this work are presented. These results are related to software architecture and software engineering. Rationale for the selection of the Viable System Model as a basis for software systems is given. The Viable System Model is described. The model is restated as an Alexanderian &#147;pattern language&#148; to make it more accessible to software engineering. A Viable Software Approach is proposed and expressed in the form of a Product Line Architecture that arranges the Viable System Model, the Viable Software Architecture, a Viable Component Framework, and a Component Transfer Protocol into a system for generative programming. An important result is the formalisation of the pattern of the Viable System into the interface specifications of the Viable Component. Three case studies illustrate the approach. The first is an analysis and extension of the Groove collaboration system. This study shows how the approach is used to map an existing system into the Viable Software Architecture and add fuzzy-adaptive user interface controllers. The second study presents the design and detailed software construction of an adaptive camera controller as part of a smart environment. The final study shows how a Business-to-Business e-Commerce system can be evolved and an expert system-based controller developed to implement business contracts.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">L</field><field name="subject">280302 Software Engineering</field><field name="subject">700199 Computer software and services not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">Software Architecture</field><field name="subject">Viable System Model</field><field name="subject">Intelligent Control</field><field name="subject">Adaptive Control</field><field name="subject">Adaptable Software</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157886</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Changing Complex Documents</field><field name="creator">Carter, Simon Matthew James</field><field name="description">Change management is a discipline fundamental to the task of building ever more complex computing systems. Properly managed change provides a means whereby alterations to existing components of a complex artefact and their relationships can be evaluated, managed and evolved. This thesis takes as its example Official RAAF Publications, some of which need to be revised as a result of changes to the system they describe. The thesis develops a model of change propagation providing a set of operations to examine and record the changes to a set of publications. Additional operations enable coping with reversing decisions and handling the unexpected arrival of externally generated amendments. The model is extended to cover a finer granularity of entities (at the page level) to determine whether this greater level of detail would ease some tasks. A further extension provides the notion of relationships between the publications of concern, focusing on a dependency relationship between two publications. This enables exploration of the possibility of improving the process by reducing the risk of missing publications needing revision and providing a means by which some tasks can be partly automated thus speeding up the process. The models presented were developed in Sum, a variant of the Z specification language, to gain greater insight into the essential details of the operations and data structures involved. By ignoring implementation details the essential logical steps of each model can be emphasised and their differences and similarities contrasted. This thesis demonstrates that fine-grained change management is feasible. The thesis develops processes that automatically track the status of changes as they are propagated through a set of documents. The greater knowledge of work done on individual pages allows only the page(s) of concern to be affected. The work also enables recommendations to be made as to the applicability of each model and, by comparing the models, provides insight into the amount of work and resources required for tackling change at different levels of granularity.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">L</field><field name="subject">280302 Software Engineering</field><field name="subject">700199 Computer software and services not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">change management</field><field name="subject">change propagation</field><field name="subject">fine-grained change management</field><field name="subject">formal methods</field><field name="subject">Sum specification language</field><field name="subject">Z specification language</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157953</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Simultaneous Lift, Moment and Thrust Measurements on a Scramjet in Hypervelocity Flow</field><field name="creator">Robinson, Matthew</field><field name="description">This study investigates the stress wave force balance technique for the measurement of forces on a fuelled hypersonic flight vehicle in an impulse-type test facility. A three component force balance for the measurement of lift, thrust and pitching moment on a supersonic combustion ramjet engine was designed, built, calibrated and tested. The force balance was designed using finite element analysis and consisted of four stress bars instrumented for the measurement of strain. Relative errors of less than 2% were obtained for the recovered simulated calibration loads, while errors of less than 3% were obtained for lift and thrust components for simulated fuel-on and fuel-off force loading distributions. Tests in a calibration rig showed that the balance was capable of recovering the magnitude of point loads to within 3% and their lines of action to within 1% of the chord of the model. Additional errors result when testing in a wind tunnel. The uncertainties for the experiments with fuel injection are estimated at 9%, 7% and 9% for the coefficients of lift, thrust and pitching moment. The scramjet vehicle was 0.566m long and weighed approximately 6kg. It consisted of an inlet, combustion chamber and thrust surface. Fuel could be injected through a series of injectors located on the scramjet inlet. The scramjet model was set at zero angle of attack. Experiments were performed in the T4 Free Piston Shock Tunnel at a total enthalpy of 3.3MJ/kg, a nozzle supply pressure of 32MPa and a Mach number of 6.6, with equivalence ratios up to 1.4. Fuel-off force coefficients were measured to within 2% of theoretical values based on predictions using CFD and hypersonic theory. The fuel-off centre-of-pressure was measured to within 4% of the predicted value. The force coefficients varied linearly with equivalence ratio. Good comparison of the measured lift and thrust forces with theoretical values was obtained with increasing flow rates of fuel. The lift-to-drag ratio increased from 3.0 at the fuel-off condition to 17.2 at an equivalence ratio of 1.0. Poor agreement between the measured pitching moment and theoretical values was obtained due to difficulties in predicting the pressure distribution with heat addition on the latter parts of the thrust surface. A shift in the centre-of-pressure of approximately 10% of model chord was measured as the equivalence ratio varied from 0.0 to 1.0. For the design tested, the thrust produced was not enough to overcome drag on the vehicle, even at the highest equivalence ratio tested. Tests at higher stagnation enthalpies (up to 4.9MJ/kg) showed the lift and pitching moment coefficients remained constant with an equivalence ratio of 0.8 but the thrust coefficient decreased exponentially with increasing stagnation enthalpies. Good agreement of experimental values of lift and thrust force with predicted values was obtained for equivalence ratios of 0.0 and 0.8. Choking occurred at stagnation enthalpies of less than 3.0MJ/kg and a nozzle supply pressure of 32MPa with fuel injection at an equivalence ratio of approximately 0.8, resulting in a drag force of approximately 2.5 times the fuel-off drag force. Tests at a nozzle supply enthalpy of 3.3MJ/kg and nozzle supply pressures of 32, 26 and 16MPa were performed at equivalence ratios of 0.0 and 0.8. The fuel-off lift coefficient remained constant but the thrust coefficient increased. This is attributed to a reduction in skin friction associated with longer lengths of laminar boundary layers as the Reynolds number was decreased. The measured fuel-off lift and thrust coefficients agreed with the predicted values to within the known test flow and force prediction uncertainties. Combustion did not occur at a nozzle supply pressure of 16MPa. This work has demonstrated that overall scramjet vehicle performance measurements (such as lift-to-drag ratio and shifts in centre-of-pressure) can be made in a free piston shock tunnel.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">290299 Aerospace Engineering not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">690302 Space transport</field><field name="subject">shock tunnel</field><field name="subject">force measurement</field><field name="subject">scramjet</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158040</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Practical approaches to improve the value of the Falkland Islands' sheep and wool industry</field><field name="creator">Miller, Sean Michael</field><field name="description">Studies were conducted to determine basic aspects of intake and digestion of native pastures by young sheep in the Falkland Islands, and to evaluate practical methods to improve the productivity of these animals. The studies were conducted in support of Industry and Government initiatives to reinvigorate Falklands&#146; agriculture. The current industry is based on broad diameter wools harvested from sheep grazing poor quality native pastures, and sheep suffer low growth rates, poor productivity and high mortality, and farmers rely on small flocks to produce a single commodity for their total income. The dramatic collapse of wool markets in the 1980&#146;s crippled the Falklands&#146; wool industry and farmers have relied heavily on subsidies for more than 12 years. The studies in this thesis were initiated to support the efforts to reinvigorate Falklands&#146; agriculture, and they examined basic aspects of the nutrition provided to sheep by native pastures and evaluated practical methods to improve the survival of sheep, their subsequent rate of growth and productive value to the economy. Five studies examined specific hypotheses posed at the outset of the research programme and they were broadly supported by the data presented in the thesis: &#183; A wether trial was used to benchmark the productivity of wool sheep in the Islands, and the trial demonstrated that substantial genetic variation exists within the national flock that may be exploited in the future to improve the productivity of the wool industry, &#183; Microhistological techniques were used in conjunction with n-alkane marker technology to investigate the diets consumed by sheep grazing native pastures. The diet studies concluded that the low quality of native pasture in the Falklands during autumn, winter and spring restricts growth and productivity of young sheep, &#183; Studies with weaner sheep treated with controlled release anthelmintics established that infection with gastrointestinal nematodes exacerbates poor nutrition of young sheep consuming native pastures, &#183; A short-term metabolism study demonstrated that native pasture hay fortified with molasses and urea, or winter forage crops may be used as supplements to enhance sheep productivity, and &#183; Forage crops were grown and evaluated under Falklands&#146; conditions, and when lambs were fed the resulting highly productive and nutritious forages, the study demonstrated that lamb growth can be increased significantly, and lamb carcasses offer local farmers the potential to diversify farm income by using existing Falklands&#146;-bred lambs to develop an export meat industry The data presented in this thesis demonstrate that the potential to improve the productive and financial position of Falklands&#146; farmers is substantial. If both the local Industry and Government maintain their joint commitment to industry-restructure, pastoral development and enterprise diversification, the Falklands&#146; agricultural economy stands to benefit considerably by adopting low risk solutions to address widespread problems.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">630102 Sheep-wool</field><field name="subject">native pasture</field><field name="subject">alkanes</field><field name="subject">wool quality</field><field name="subject">sheep diets</field><field name="subject">gastrointestinal parasitism</field><field name="subject">urea-molasses treatment</field><field name="subject">brassicas</field><field name="subject">carcass quality</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157933</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inconsistencies in the rights of review of the merits of Commonwealth administrative decisions</field><field name="creator">Thackeray, Vincent Gregory</field><field name="description">Government intervention in the financial and social affairs of citizens has increased dramatically in the last fifty years. As a result, government administrative decisions continually affect the everyday lives of people. Many of these decisions are discretionary. Modern administrative law has grown to meet the need for governments, rather than the courts, to supervise the exercise of administrative power so that injustice resulting from misuse of power can be avoided. The merits review system is an integral part of this administrative law. The effectiveness of the merits review system is dependent upon how Parliament makes provision for merits review in the legislative process. The object of this thesis is to analyse and evaluate the effectiveness of the scope of the Commonwealth administrative law merits review system. An evaluation of the availability of rights of review of the merits of Commonwealth administrative decisions will determine the extent to which Commonwealth law provides for merits review of administrative decisions. This thesis makes such an evaluation by undertaking an empirical study of the merits review provisions in Commonwealth legislation. The empirical study analyses 1,070 Commonwealth statutes and establishes that there are 340 statutes that confer power to make a reviewable decision or decisions. However, only 30 percent of these statutes provide for merits review of all reviewable decisions, while 44 percent provide for merits review of some decisions and 26 percent do not provide for merits review of any decisions. Consequently, the empirical study identifies inconsistencies in the provision of merits review of Commonwealth administrative decisions. The Australian parliamentary executive system of government has permitted a breakdown in the legislative drafting process that has allowed these inconsistencies to develop. Moreover, the executive arm of the Commonwealth government has diminished its accountability to Parliament for some of the administrative decisions made by it. A person affected by an unreviewable administrative decision may be treated unjustly as a result.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">350200 Business and Management</field><field name="subject">720400 Management and Productivity Issues</field><field name="subject">Inconsistencies</field><field name="subject">rights</field><field name="subject">merits</field><field name="subject">review</field><field name="subject">Commonwealth</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">administrative</field><field name="subject">decisions</field><field name="subject">Kerr</field><field name="subject">Executive</field><field name="subject">unaccountable</field><field name="subject">Parliament</field><field name="subject">injustice</field><field name="subject">empirical</field><field name="subject">study</field><field name="subject">statutes</field><field name="subject">legislation. breakdown</field><field name="subject">legislative</field><field name="subject">drafting</field><field name="subject">process</field><field name="subject">Parliamentary</field><field name="subject">Counsel</field><field name="subject">Administrative</field><field name="subject">Review</field><field name="subject">Tribunal</field><field name="subject">Council</field><field name="subject">Attorney-General</field><field name="subject">appeal</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157885</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thor's Hammer Deflected: A history of the protection of power systems from lightning, with special reference to Queensland, 1950 to 1995</field><field name="creator">Mercer, Douglas Roy</field><field name="description">Electric power systems are a recent feature of community infrastructure, little more than a century having elapsed since the first public electricity supply was offered. The speed with which they have spread across the world, and the extent to which electricity has displaced other energy sources in commercial, industrial and domestic applications, has been quite remarkable. The widespread availability of a reliable supply of electricity has become one of the dominant factors in the lifestyle of the citizens of developed countries, and one of the differences between developed and developing countries. Yet not many histories of this remarkable industry have been written, and most of those have confined their attention to political and administrative matters, although technical issues have virtually dictated the pace of development of the industry. In the 1920s, when power systems began to spread beyond city centres, lightning became a major adverse factor in their capital costs, operating costs and reliability, and inadequate reliability reduced the rate of acceptance of electricity supply by the public, especially in rural areas. Although lightning has long inspired fear and wonder, its fundamental nature - the fact that it is an electrical discharge - was not known until less than three centuries ago, and the first measurements of lightning currents and voltages were not made until the middle 1920s, when instruments for measuring the electrical properties of lightning first became available. Intensive research programmes were undertaken in America, Britain, and some European countries from about 1925 onwards, but no research on the effects of lightning on power systems was undertaken in Australia until after 1950. This delay of almost three decades forced Australian power system engineers to base some very important aspects of power system design entirely upon data from other countries, which was of doubtful applicability in Australian conditions. During this period, the uncertainty over basic design data resulted in some power systems being over-insulated, with consequent waste of capital expenditure, while others were under-insulated, and had to be modified later to achieve adequate reliability. It is believed that this long delay in commencing lightning research in Australia was caused by a number of factors, including community attitudes to higher education and research (other than primary industry research), and the belief of many managers in the electricity supply industry that only the major manufacturers of electrical plant, located mainly in the United Kingdom and the United States of America, could successfully conduct power system research. In 1948 the Senate of the University of Queensland decided to replace the Chair of Engineering with four Chairs in separate branches of engineering. The founding Professor of Electrical Engineering, S.A. Prentice, was appointed in 1950 and soon decided to adopt lightning and its effects on power systems as the principal research thrust of the new Department. By the late 1950s, the University of Queensland had become the recognised centre of Australian research in lightning and high voltage insulation. With financial support from the electricity industry, the University completed a new high voltage laboratory in 1960, and soon began to be recognised overseas as a significant contributor to the world-wide search for knowledge in those areas. During the next fifteen years, the cooperative research programme of the University and the electricity industry developed fully, and valuable research was pursued in a number of areas, including the impulse strength and arc-quenching properties of Australian hardwoods used in poles and crossarms, the prediction of lightning outage rates of transmission lines, the causes of high lightning-failure rates in distribution systems, the performance of insulation under pollution conditions, and the validity of high voltage test procedures. The work frequently involved people from the electricity supply industry as well as people from the university, and attracted attention in overseas countries as well as in Australia. In 1974 Prentice reached retiring age, but the principal members of the staff he had recruited continued to produce research of high quality, and of considerable practical benefit to the electricity industry. By 1995, Prentice's principal staff members had reached or were approaching retirement, and the nature of lightning research had changed somewhat, with the principal interest turning to the details of the lightning stroke itself, and to protection of buildings and electronic equipment rather than power systems.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">430111 History - Other</field><field name="subject">780107 Studies in human society</field><field name="subject">lightning</field><field name="subject">electric power systems</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157883</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Limitations to plant root growth in highly saline and alkaline bauxite residue</field><field name="creator">Kopittke, Peter Martin</field><field name="description">Revegetation of bauxite residue is hampered by a lack of understanding of the limitations imposed on plant growth in highly saline and alkaline growth mediums. In this study, several of these growth limiting factors were investigated. The toxicity of the hydroxyl ion (OH-) was examined using a solution culture system developed to allow studies at high pH without nutritional limitations. Also using this solution culture system, the effect of the high Na and Mg concentrations of bauxite residue on the Ca nutrition of plants was investigated. As the toxicity of Al at high pH is not known, a study was conducted to examine the rhizotoxicity of aluminate (Al(OH)4-) and polycationic Al at high pH. The ability of plant roots to reduce rhizosphere pH in bauxite residue was also considered. A novel gypsum application method was assessed for its efficiency at improving the Ca status of bauxite residue. Manual adjustment, ion exchange resins and automated titration were examined for their suitability for nutrient solution pH control in alkaline conditions. For short-term studies, it was found that a solution without supply of Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn, and aerated with CO2 depleted air, greatly reduced nutrient precipitation at high pH, thus eliminating nutritional differences between treatments. Manual pH adjustment and the use of ion exchange resins as pH buffers were unsuitable methods of pH control. In contrast, pH control by automated titration had little effect on solution composition while maintaining constant pH. The solution culture system was used to examine OH- toxicity in mungbeans (Vigna radiata (L.) Wilczek cv. Emerald), with root length reduced at a bulk solution pH of 8.5 and greater. The effect of Ca activity ratio (CAR) and pH on Ca uptake by mungbeans and Rhodes grass (Chloris gayana cv. Pioneer) in Na dominated solution cultures and in soil was investigated. Changes in pH in the alkaline range were shown to have no effect on the critical CAR of 0.024 (corresponding to 90 % relative root length) for mungbeans grown in solution culture. Results from soil grown mungbeans confirmed those from solution culture, with a critical CAR of 0.025. A critical CAR of 0.034 was also established for soil grown Rhodes grass. However, using dilute nutrient solutions dominated by Mg at pH 9.0, root growth was found to be more limited than had been observed for Na solutions, with growth reduced beneath a critical CAR of 0.050. Using a CAR equation modified with plasma membrane binding constants (to incorporate the differing antagonistic effects of Mg and Na), new critical CAR values were calculated for Na (0.56) and Mg (0.44) dominated solutions. This modified CAR equation permits the calculation of CAR irrespective of the dominant salt present. Solubilities of various gypsum sources and size fractions in seawater were studied to investigate the effectiveness of gypsum addition to the residue sand pipeline, rather than as a direct field application. The dissolution rate constant varied with gypsum source (analytical grade (AR) &gt; phosphogypsum (PG) &gt; mined gypsum (MG)) due to reactivity and surface area differences, generally reaching saturation within 15 s (AR) to 30 min (MG &gt; 2.0). The ability of bauxite residue to remove Ca from solution (due to cation exchange and precipitation) was also examined; the quantity of the total solution Ca adsorbed was found to be small (5 %). These low rates of solution Ca adsorption, comparatively rapid dissolution rates, and long pumping times (20 min), preclude the application of gypsum to the residue sand/seawater slurry as a method for residue amelioration. Dilute, alkaline (pH 9.5) nutrient solutions were used to investigate the effects of aluminate (Al(OH)4-) on mungbean root growth. Although root growth in Al(OH)4- solutions was slightly limited, the symptoms associated with this growth reduction were observed to be similar to those caused by the Al13 polycation at concentrations lower than that which can be detected. Also, when roots displaying these symptoms were transferred to fresh Al(OH)4- solutions, no root tip lesions were observed, and root hair growth on the lateral roots improved. Thus, Al(OH)4- is considered to be non-toxic, with the observed reduction in root growth in solutions containing Al(OH)4- due to the gradual formation of toxic Al13 in the bulk nutrient solution resulting from the acidification of the alkaline nutrient solution by the plant roots. The effect of Mn deficiency in Rhodes grass and of legume inoculation in lucerne (Medicago sativa L. cv. Hunter River), on the rhizosphere pH of plants grown in highly alkaline bauxite residue was investigated. In response to Mn deficiency in residue sand, Rhodes grass was observed to increase acidification of its rhizosphere (being up to 1.22 pH units lower than the bulk soil). Due to its ability to fix atmospheric N2 rather than relying on soil N (NO3-) reserves, inoculated lucerne (1.75 pH unit decrease) was also found to acidify its rhizosphere to a greater extent than non-inoculated lucerne (1.16 pH unit decrease).</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300804 Environmental Impact Assessment</field><field name="subject">770806 Remnant vegetation and protected conservation areas</field><field name="subject">Aluminate toxicity</field><field name="subject">alkalinity</field><field name="subject">salinity</field><field name="subject">rhizosphere pH</field><field name="subject">gypsum dissolution</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157976</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Phylogeny, morphology and physiology of the secondary vascular system in fishes</field><field name="creator">Skov, Peter Vilhelm</field><field name="description">Vascular casts of three chondrichthian, one dipnoan, one chondrostean and 14 teleostean species were examined by light and scanning electron microscopy in order to give a qualitative and quantitative analysis of interarterial anastomoses (iaas) that indicate the presence (or absence) of a secondary vascular system (SVS). Anastomoses were found to originate from a variety of different primary blood vessels, many of which have not been previously identified as giving rise to secondary vessels. Segmental arteries derived from the dorsal aorta and supplying body musculature were major sites of origin of the SVS, although there was considerable variation in where, in the hierarchy of arterial branching, the anastomoses occurred. The degree of investment in a SVS was species specific, with more active species having a higher degree of secondary vascularisation. This difference was quantified using an absolute count of iaas between Anguilla reinhardtii and Trachinotus baillonii. A range of general features of the SVS is also described. No evidence of iaas was found on the coeliac, mesenteric or renal circulation in any species. Evidence of interarterial anastomoses were lacking in the dipnoan (Sarcopterygii) and chondrichthyan species examined, suggesting that a SVS is restricted to actinopterygian fishes. The presence and distribution of a secondary vascular system does not appear to be exclusively linked to phylogenetic position, but rather to the physiological adaptation of the species. Histological sections of primary segmental arteries and associated interarterial anastomoses and secondary vessels from the long-finned eel, Anguilla reinhardtii, were examined by light and transmission electron microscopy. Secondary vessels were found to originate from the primary vasculature as depressions through the tunica intima and media, from where they ran perpendicularly to the adventitial layer, before coiling extensively. From here the anastomoses travelled a relatively linear path in the outer margin of the adventitia to re-anastomose with a secondary vessel running in parallel with the primary counterpart. Secondary vessels had a structure quite similar to that of primary vessels; they were lined by endothelial cells on a continuous basement membrane, surrounded by single layer of smooth muscle cells surrounding the vessel. Smooth muscle cells were also found in the vicinity of interarterial anastomoses in the adventitia, but these were more longitudinally orientated. The presence of smooth muscle cells on all aspects of the secondary circulation suggests that this vascular system is regulated in a similar manner as the primary vascular system. Because interarterial anastomoses are structurally integrated with the primary vessel from which they originate, it was anticipated that flow through secondary vessels would to some extent be affected by an increase in primary vascular tone. Immunohistochemical studies showed that primary segmental arteries displayed moderate immunoreactivity to antibodies against 5-hydroxytryptamine and substance P, while interarterial anastomoses and secondary vessels showed dense immunoreactivity. Secondary vessels were followed to the surface of the animal through consecutive sections, where they eventually give rise to capillary beds overlying the scales. Secondary capillary beds were found to supply chloride cells in the skin, suggesting that this vascular system may be involved in cutaneous ionic exchange. Branchial vascular casts from two species of Tetraodontiformes showed that the vessels previously reported as nutrient vessels are with certainty part of the secondary vascular system. In the three-barred porcupine fish, Dicotylichthys punctulatus, interarterial anastomoses originated at high densities from efferent filamental and the efferent branchial arteries, from where they formed progressively larger secondary vessels. Small branches of this vascular system entered the filament body, where it gave rise to numerous side-vessels along the way. Large secondary vessels running in parallel with the efferent branchial arteries were found to constitute an additional arterio-arterial pathway, in that they exited the branchial basket in company with the afferent mandibular artery, the carotid artery and the efferent branchial arteries, from where they gave rise to vascular beds immediately after exit. The secondary vessels in this species were not found to supply the filament musculature; rather this vascular system was supplied by a single vessel derived from the efferent branchial artery, running in parallel with the afferent branchial artery. Secondary vessels were not found on any branchial component in the banded toadfish, Marylina pleurosticta, but in all other aspects the branchial vascular anatomy was similar to that of D. punctulatus. It is proposed that four independent vascular pathways may be present in the teleostean gill. The blood volume and flow rates of the primary (PVS) and secondary vascular system (SVS) were examined in the catadromous euryhaline teleost Lates calcarifer in order to determine whether any of these parameters were subject to change in individuals acclimated to seawater, compared to a group acclimated to freshwater. There was no significant difference in any measured parameter for the two groups. The volumes of the SVS were 0.67 &#132;b 0.13 and 0.76 &#132;b 0.13 mL 100g-1 body mass for FW and SW acclimated animals respectively. This constituted approximately one-third of the total blood volume in both groups. Turnover times for the SVS ranged from 21.0 to 25.2 minutes, demonstrating in accordance with previous publications, that this system is considerably more dynamic than previously assumed.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270604 Comparative Physiology</field><field name="subject">780105 Biological sciences</field><field name="subject">secondary vessels</field><field name="subject">anatomy</field><field name="subject">control</field><field name="subject">physiology</field><field name="subject">immunohistochemistry</field><field name="subject">histology</field><field name="subject">blood vessels</field><field name="subject">primary</field><field name="subject">secondary</field><field name="subject">volume</field><field name="subject">flow</field><field name="subject">chondrichthyes</field><field name="subject">dipnoi</field><field name="subject">actinopterygii</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158001</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modeling unplanned landscape change: A Colombian case study</field><field name="creator">Etter, Andres</field><field name="description">The broad aim of this study is, to contribute to a broader and more comprehensive understanding of the patterns, processes and drivers of unplanned land cover change in the tropics, using Colombia as a study case. Land cover change is an important global issue because of the expanding ecological footprint of a rapidly increasing human population and per capita level of resource consumption. This has a major impact on natural ecosystems and their function at the local (hundreds of square kilometers) and global scales. The understanding of extent and rate of land cover change is an important issue confronting biodiversity conservation, land use planning, protected area management, and global climate change analysis. Tropical deforestation is the major source of global land cover change, with the highest absolute rates occurring in South America, especially in the Brazilian Amazon, where government planning is an important driver of deforestation. However, unplanned deforestation for cropping and ranching is also occurring in Colombia. This is of international concern because Colombia&#146;s diverse ecosystems support high levels of species richness and endemism. Improving the understanding of the spatial and temporal patterns and drivers ofland cover change (both deforestation and regeneration) is an important step in developing planning and conservation strategies to address this problem. I applied a spatial and temporal statistical modelling approach to predict changes in land cover in Colombia at the local (100 km2), regional (104 km2) and national (106 km2) levels, with a timeframe spanning from decades to centuries. As dependant variable data, binary forest/non-forest data are used. Explanatory variables comprise biophysical and socioeconomic data sourced from a broad range of information sources, including remotely sensed data from aerial photographs and satellite images, secondary sources of biophysical and socioeconomic data, and historical data. At the local-level, I addressed the deforestation process over the last 60 years using six case studies of 100 km2 of humid lowland forests, by applying logistic regression and spatial analysis. At the regional-level, I studied the deforestation in the Caquet&#225; colonization front of the Colombian Amazon region from 1988-2004 by applying a forest-cover zoning method and logistic regression models to predict deforestation and forest regeneration from biophysical and socio-economic explanatory variables. At the national level, I quantified and analysed patterns and drivers of land cover change over the past 500 years for key periods of Colombian history, and identified the extent and duration of impacts on broad ecosystem types. At the national and regional-levels, I also modelled current landscape transformation patterns and predicted areas at a high risk of future deforestation using a joint logistic regression and regression tree approach. I discovered that the rate of deforestation across several lowland regions of Colombia follows a simple sigmoid pattern composed of four phases of transformation: an initial phase of gradual forest loss; an intermediate phase of rapid loss; a second intermediate phase where the rate of decline slows; and a final phase where the forest loss stabilises and is balanced by forest regeneration creating a dynamic equilibrium. At the end of this final phase, the landscape is in a highly transformed state with forest cover stabilizing at 2 to 10% of the original extent and an average forest patch size of 15.4 (&#177; 9.2) ha. As a general rule, the transformed landscape will have two forest components: a stable component of remnant mature tropical forests, and a dynamic component of secondary forests of different ages that is repeatedly cleared. A second important discovery was that unplanned deforestation in the Colombian Amazon moves as a colonisation wave, extending from population centres. The rate of movement was 0.84 km.yr-1 between 1989 and 2002. The regional average annual deforestation rate was 2.6%, but varied locally between &#150;1.8% (regeneration) and 5.3%. The parallel deforestation and regeneration processes operating within the colonization front showed consistent patterns and rates directly related to the proportion of forest in the neighbourhood, with the highest rates of deforestation occurring in the areas with intermediate (40-60%) forest cover, following an overall quadratic function, and therefore confirming the sigmoid pattern across an entire colonization front. Landscapes with intermediate forest cover also have the highest density of edge habitat, with the deforestation process mimicking the spread of disease. At the national-level, the study reveals two important outcomes. First, there are significant regional differences in the spatial and temporal patterns and drivers of land cover change. The importance of such regional differences in factors explainingland cover change is highlighted by the greatest discrimination ability shown by a regional-level classification tree model. The coefficients and significance of variables in a regional logistic regression model confirmed these differences. Overall, factors related to accessibility (distance to roads and towns) had the strongest influence on the probability of deforestation. The second national-level outcome highlights the need for a longer-term historical perspective spanning centuries to understand present-day landscapes and their level of human impact. The historical analysis reveals that the main drivers of landscape change varied in the early colonial period, with cattle grazing becoming increasingly important, and finally the high impact of economic globalization in the 1990s. The historic land cover maps show the transformed areas increasing from approximately 15 million ha in 1500 to 42 million ha in 2000. Also, during this period, the transformed areas changed from predominantly cropping land uses in 1500 to predominantly (&lt; 75%) grazing in 2000. The research outcomes collectively provide an understanding of the spatial dynamics of unplannedland cover change in tropical forest landscapes, by showing how deforestation and regeneration processes vary along a transformation gradient, and linking the amount of remnant forests is related to the rate of change. The work has implications for policy and management. For example, the method of calculating the movement speed of a colonization front provides a spatially explicit prediction of threat that can be used in conservation planning. The improved understanding of the deforestation and regeneration dynamics over an entire colonization fronts permits more accurate calculation of carbon budgeting for climate change applications. I recommend that future work test of the generalities presented here in both, countries with unplanned deforestation and countries with planned land clearing, to evaluate the effects government controlled planning has on the end result of human transformed landscapes in tropical and subtropical forest regions.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270704 Landscape Ecology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158178</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On the Edge of Their Seats: The Novel Manuscript 'Frantic', and the critical essay 'Suspense in Fiction: Its Operation and Techniques'</field><field name="creator">Howell, Katherine Leslie</field><field name="description">The thesis consists of the critical essay and the creative project. The critical essay is an investigation into the nature of narrative suspense, its operation, and the techniques by which an author can develop it. Narrative suspense requires that readers care for characters and feel uncertain about events. An author can use a number of story-telling techniques to make the most of this emotion and uncertainty. Readers may embark on a variety of activities including imagining outcomes and piecing together clues, and these too can be utilised by the author to build suspense. Following the examination of the subject, I explore the development of the drafts of Frantic with particular emphasis on how my research into suspense changed my approach to characterisation, structure, and the process of writing. The creative project is the manuscript Frantic, a crime thriller set in present-day Sydney. When Paramedic Sophie Phillips&#146; husband Chris is shot and their baby kidnapped, Detective Ella Marconi struggles to solve the case. Evidence suggests the act may be revenge by a bereaved father for Sophie&#146;s failure to save a mother and her newborn, and equally that senior constable Chris may have been involved in the police corruption that increasingly appears rife.

Phased arrays are very useful as receiver coils and have been used over the last 15 years or so to improve receiver coil coverage and to speed up image acquisition. These arrays have almost invariably been constructed and used at mid- to highfrequency (&amp;lt128 MHz), thus there is clearly an opportunity to increase the operating frequency of the phased array and also use these systems in transceive mode. Using phased array coils in transceive mode has the advantage of gaining better spatial specificity of excited regions. Also as the operating wavelength in high field strength is shortened by the dielectric properties of the patient and approaches the size of conventional transmitter coils, there are distinct advantages in using the smaller coils in the phased array system for transmission. In addition, with the ability to independently control the magnitudes and phases of the transmission power on each element of a transceiver phased array system, RF focussing or shimming can be performed during RF transmission. The research work presented in this thesis is therefore, primarily focussed on designing and analysing high frequency phased array coils for MRI applications with transceive and RF focussing capability and investigating the possibility of using focussing transceive phased array coils to ameliorate image distortions that appear in high field MR images. The second major area of work concerns evaluation of the performance of partial parallel imaging when used at high field strength and the compatibility with transceive phased array systems. Common to both areas are investigation into other approaches for the design of high field RF coils, exploring the possibility of new mutual decoupling techniques and the consideration of other numerical computational methods that can assist in designing future high frequency phased array coils and help evaluate the complex field-tissue interactions at high field strength.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">291500 Biomedical Engineering</field><field name="subject">671402 Medical instrumentation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158146</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electromagnetic analysis and design of high frequency coils for magnetic resonance</field><field name="creator">Xu, Bin</field><field name="description">As the signal to noise ratio (SNR) in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) improves with increasing static magnetic field strength, there is a strong incentive to develop technology to acquire images at higher fields. While magnet technology has made it possible to generate static magnetic fields of 10 T and more, limitations of the radio frequency (RF) hardware prevent the acquisition of high quality images over full regions of interest in clinical applications. Electromagnetic analysis and the design of high frequency RF coils for magnetic resonance are presented in this thesis to attempt to mitigate the limitations of the RF hardware. Analytical and numerical methods are used in this work to analyze the field and frequency behaviors/limits for various RF volume coils in MRI. As the coils&#146; size approach wavelength of operation dimensions, the performance of conventional lumped element design and traditional excitation strategies for these coils, encounter several problems. Field and frequency limits for the traditional RF volume coils are studied to obtain a better understanding of high frequency RF coil designs. Numerical modeling of the excised, fixed human head at the extreme field strength of 11 T is made, which helps to understand the underlying mechanisms for the severe distortions in the MR images in 11T MRI and confirms experimental observations. Results show that the rotating transverse magnetic field (B1) exhibits good homogeneity in air, but strong in-homogeneity with biological loads at 11T. The simulated signal intensity (SI) distribution within the human head confirms that distortions in the experimental images are mainly caused by the field/tissue interactions.. To rapidly simulate RF field behaviour in the human head for MRI applications, Dyadic Green&#146;s function (DGF)/Method of Moments (DGF/MOM) - based solutions of the electromagnetic field (EMFs) inside a head-sized, stratified sphere are presented. Operating profiles are studied with various RF head coils loaded with various head models/phantoms. The RF field behaviour and tissue/field interactions are also obtained by case studies at different frequencies for different coils. New methodologies and innovations on high frequency RF coil design are next investigated. An inverse method with pre-emphasized B1 field is proposed herein, and the method of pre-emphasizing the target field with the consideration of the dielectric materials proved to be encouraging in preliminary designs. The results demonstrate that inverse-method designed coils with pre-emphases of target fields can help in decreasing the notorious bright regions caused by wavelength effects in the human head images at 4T. An 8-element phased array head coil operating at 4T is designed based on a combined idea from reciprocity theorem and inverse method. Using this new method, either circularly or linearly polarized head coils can be designed. The simulation results reported herein demonstrate the feasibility and flexibility of the design concept, which shows that improved B1 field homogeneity is achievable. Another new method in ameliorating image distortion at 11T (470 MHz) MR brain imaging applications uses a shielded 4-element transcieve phased array coil and involves performing 2 separate scans of the same slice with each scan using different excitations during transmission. That is, parallel transmission phase cycling. By optimizing the amplitudes and phases for each set of the scan, signal distortion that is antipodal from one another can be obtained and by combining both images together, image distortion can be alleviated several fold. The simulation results reported herein demonstrate the feasibility of the concept where transmission phase cycling of parallel imaging elements with different excitation pulse reconstruction is theoretically achievable. The strategy of improving the transmitting B1 field homogeneity through active control of source profiles is studied. This method tailors the RF amplitudes and phases applied individually to the rungs of a resonator with the use of an optimization scheme. Numerical simulations are used in an attempt to find optimal source profiles for high frequency RF coils. The simulation results demonstrate the strength of the optimal source profiles for different targets in high field RF coil or phased array designs.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">291500 Biomedical Engineering</field><field name="subject">671402 Medical instrumentation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158139</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Polyhydroxyalkanoate copolymer production from synthetic carbonaceous wastewater using glycogen accumulating organisms</field><field name="creator">Dai, Yu</field><field name="description">Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are polyesters produced and stored intracellularly as reserve materials for carbon and energy by a wide range of prokaryotic microorganisms under imbalanced nutritional conditions. PHA production by pure culture has been extensively studied, enabling high production yields and a variety of polymer characteristics. Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate (3HB)-co-3-hydroxyvalerate (3HV) (PHBV) has been commercially available under the trade name Biopol. However, the high production costs of these biopolymers are a major barrier for their widespread acceptance as substitute for traditional non-biodegradable polymers. The main costs are associated with maintaining the sterile conditions required by pure cultures, the use of expensive feed materials (eg. sugars) and also the polymer extraction process. Producing PHAs using mixed cultures (such as activated sludge) can drastically simplify the production process and significantly reduce the feed costs due to the use of cheap substrates. It also has the additional benefits in reusing waste materials. To date, substantial efforts have been put into improving PHA productivity in mixed cultures, with the characteristics of these bio-polyesters largely unexplored. The main product is typically PHB, which has several inherent deficiencies in properties. These include brittleness due to its high crystallinity, and thermal instability near its melting point of 175-180&amp;degC. To overcome the drawbacks of PHB, non-3HB monomer units are incorporated in the bio-polymerisation process, but this generally requires the addition of specific and often complex precursor substrates. Glycogen accumulating organisms (GAOs) are emerging as an attractive alternative to other heterotrophic PHA producers due to their special metabolism. GAOs were initially identified as competitors to the polyphosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs) in alternating anaerobic/aerobic wastewater treatment systems. Under anaerobic conditions, GAOs generate energy and reducing power from glycogen hydrolysis, which are used for taking up carbon sources (eg. acetate or propionate) and their synthesis into PHAs as intracellular storage products. Under aerobic conditions, the stored PHAs is partly oxidised for energy generation with the remainder used for biomass growth and glycogen replenishment. The anaerobic hydrolysis of glycogen yields both acetyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA which can be condensed to form 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA and 3-hydroxyvaleryl-CoA, the precursors of 3HB and 3HV. Therefore GAOs are capable of producing multiple 3- hydroxyalkanoate (3HA) monomers even when only a single carbon source (eg., acetate) is supplied. The potential of producing copolymers without addition of particular monomer-relevant carbon sources provides GAOs an advantage over other mixed culture heterotrophs in terms of polymer quality. So far, two main bacterial species have been identified to display the GAO phenotype, namely, Candidatus Competibacter phosphatis (henceforth referred to as Competibacter) and Defluviicoccus vanus-related GAOs belonging to the Alphaproteobacteria phylum (henceforth referred to as DvGAOs). This thesis focuses on the PHA production by GAOs. The capability of GAOs to produce heterogeneous PHAs from a single carbon source is investigated by characterising the PHA products and optimising the polymer productivity. Moreover, DvGAOs are comprehensively studied for their ability to yield novel four-monomer copolymers of 3HB, 3HV, 3-hydroxy-2-methylvalerate (3HMV) and 3-hydroxy-3- methylbutyrate (3HMB) with controllable composition and favourable physical properties. The main contributions from this thesis are summarised below. The polymers consisting of 3HB, 3HV and minor amounts of 3HMV and 3HMB, produced by Competibacter-dominated GAOs using acetate as a sole carbon source, were identified to be true copolymers based on a detailed characterisation using &amp;sup1H and &#185;&amp;sup3C Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The monomer sequence distribution analysis using a known polymer characterisation model suggests that these polyesters are mixtures of random copolymers and thus likely possess desirable properties for practical use, which was confirmed experimentally. This demonstrates that GAOs have a true potential for producing high-quality polymers from a simple and cheap carbon source. The PHAs produced by GAOs under anaerobic and aerobic conditions were characterized using size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The acetate-derived copolymers possessed characteristics similar to those of commercially available PHBV products. The anaerobically produced PHA contained a relatively constant proportion of non-3HB monomers (30&#177;5 C-mol%), irrespective of the amount of acetate assimilated. In contrast, under aerobic conditions, GAOs only produced 3HB monomers from acetate causing a gradually decreasing 3HV fraction. The 3HV fraction thus obtained ranged from 7 to 35 C-mol%, depending on the amount of acetate supplied under aerobic conditions. The PHAs produced under solely anaerobic conditions featured lower melting points and crystallinity, higher molecular weights, and narrower molecular weight distributions compared to the aerobically produced polymers. However, the anaerobic production yield was limited at 28% of dry cell weight (DCW) due to the shortage of glycogen, while aerobic production obtained a maximum polymer content of 41% based on DCW. To increase the PHA yield from anaerobic production, a novel three-stage strategy was developed. It was demonstrated to be an effective approach to optimise both the quantity and quality of the copolymers produced by GAOs. Using the Competibacterdominated GAO culture, up to 48 wt% poly(3HB-co-3HV-co-3HMV) based on DCW was achieved from acetate as the sole carbon source, close to the highest copolymer yield reported to date produced by mixed cultures but using specific precursor substrates. The optimisation method comprised of an aerobic famine, an aerobic feast, and an anaerobic feast period. The glycogen storage was enhanced through the initial two aerobic periods and hence increased the energy and reducing power available for the final anaerobic polymer synthesis step. The terpolymers/copolymers thus produced displayed high molecular weights (380-460 kg/mol) with a narrow distribution range. A feeding strategy based on pH-stat was demonstrated to achieve the automatic control of feed addition. Using a highly enriched DvGAO mixed culture (95&#177;3%) copolymers of 3HB, 3HV, 3HMV and 3HMB with controllable monomer fractions were obtained from acetate and propionate substrates. Through manipulating the ratio of acetate and propionate in the medium, the 3HB and 3HMV monomer portions could be varied extensively (10 to 66 mol% 3HB and 2 to 41 mol% 3HMV). The microstructure study revealed that the PHAs produced were likely random copolymers or mixtures of random copolymers. These PHA products were demonstrated to possess favourable properties. The weight-average molecular weights were in the range 390-560 kg/mol, while the DSC traces showed melting temperatures in the range of 70 to 161 &amp;degC, glass transition temperatures between -8 and 0 &amp;degC, and melting enthalpies (&#916;Hm) between 9.1 and 31.5 J/g. The incorporation of considerable amounts of 3HMV and 3HMB constituents greatly lowered the crystallinity, potentially providing the ductile and tough materials required for many practical applications. The anaerobic metabolism of DvGAOs with acetate and propionate was found to be well described by the metabolic models previously proposed for GAOs and verified with experimental data obtained with other types of GAO cultures. The results suggested DvGAOs likely use metabolic pathways similar to those used by other GAOs for anaerobic acetate and propionate uptake. However, when both acetate and propionate were present simultaneously, DvGAOs took up these two carbon sources sequentially, with propionate uptake preceding acetate uptake. As a result, mixtures of 3HV&amp;3HMV-rich copolymers and 3HB&amp;3HV-rich copolymers were formed. Through model-based analysis, it was hypothesised that DvGAOs prefer propionate in order to maximise their production of PHAs with the same glycogen consumption, which would enhance their growth potential in the following aerobic period. This feature may explain the more efficient PHA production by DvGAOs with propionate as the carbon substrate compared to acetate. Despite very low acetate consumption when propionate was available in excess, the presence of acetate considerably stimulated the uptake of propionate in comparison to the case where only propionate was present. This was likely due to the difference of the intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) level in the two cases. A lower intracellular ATP level detected in the simultaneous presence of acetate and propionate might stimulate the glycolysis process resulting in a higher propionate uptake rate. This thesis shows that GAOs have indeed a good potential as cost-effective PHA producers. They are able to efficiently generate true copolymers of up to four 3HA monomers with desirable properties from simple carbon sources. Through manipulating the feed composition, comonomer fractions can vary in a wide range resulting in a variety of polymer properties. The contribution from this work could be very useful for the current drive to cost-effectively produce good quality PHAs to replace conventional petrol-derived polymers.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">279900 Other Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">779999 Other</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158279</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards the development of a talent identification and development program for coaches</field><field name="creator">O'Keeffe, Erin Elizabeth</field><field name="description">Coach retention is a significant problem for sport at all levels. Coach turnover, especially of talented and experienced coaches, creates a multitude of operational complexities for many sport organisations. The importance of having quality coaches available to assist the development of high performing athletes has been identified by both sports administrators and elite athletes. However, the data indicate that in Australia, coach accreditation rates are decreasing by more than 9% each year (ASC, 2004). Although programs focusing on coach education and pathways have been developed, minimal research has addressed the elements involved in identifying and retaining talented coaches. The first step in developing a coach talent identification and development program is the formulation of a definition of coaching talent. Although definitions of 'talent' exist in the business and sport performance arenas, these are not directly applicable to the sport coaching context. This study used a multi-method approach through the combination of interviews and questionnaires to develop a comprehensive definition of a talented coach. Two research questions were addressed: What are the attributes of a talented coach (and do perceptions of these differ between different stakeholders)? What are the factors that identify a talented coach (and do perceptions of these differ between different stakeholders)? Information gathered from interviews with experienced personnel in sport (seven coaches and administrators and two senior athletes) was transcribed and coded using open, axial and reflective coding. Themes identified in the analysis were incorporated with the literature to inform construction of the Talent in Coaching Questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of 100 items investigating three separate but related areas: Demographic Intbrmation (10 items); Attributes of a Talented Coach (77 items); and Identification of a Talented Coach (13 items). Within the Attributes of a Talented Coach section, items were allocated six different categories: Background (10 items); Knowledge (1 3 items); Athlete-Coach Interaction (1 1 items); Operational Practices (12 items); Motivation (7 items); and Attributes (24 items). TWO areas were addressed in the Talent Identification section: the populations in which a talented coach could be found (6 items) and the best possible selection methods to identify a talented coach (7 items). Items were answered using a 5-point Likert scale where 1 = strongly disagree and 5 = strongly agree. The Talent in Coaching Questionnaire was piloted with nine experienced sport personnel and 21 high performing athletics coaches to obtain feedback on face validity, ease of understanding and readability prior to delivery to 300 coaches and administrators across Queensland. The sample incorporated beginner, experienced, retired and lapsed coaches fiom individual and team sports at club, state and national levels. Administrators were defined as involved in the coordination of coaching and support services at club, state or national level. Subjects were sourced fiom 38 different sports through their respective State Sporting Organisations. Within the time fiame allowed, 162 questionnaires were received (54% response rate), which included responses fiom 32 different sports. The sample comprised 27.7% female and 72.3% male subjects, 66.7% of whom were over the age of 40. Using SPSS, the data were analyzed through descriptive statistics, reliability and factor analysis, ANOVA, and Chi square. Items and categories were ranked according to the mean score fiom all participants. The top five attributes of a talented coach were considered to be an individual who; is aware of the individual differences among athletes (mean = 4.74), has an enjoyment of coaching (mean = 4.71), is always looking for improvement in his / her coaching (mean = 4-70), is willing to learn (mean = 4-69), and has knowledge of the fundamental skills required for the sport (mean = 4.65). Attributes considered less important in a talented coach were; one who is motivated by money (mean = 1-70), introverted (mean = 2.38), makes the athlete the first priority in life (mean = 2.42), has received awards for coaching (mean = 2.92) and coached as a head coach (mean = 2.40), State coach (mean = 2.96), or National coach (mean = 2.83). Results suggest that a talented coach may be found among those individuals already coaching or retiring athletes and may be effectively identified through observation at training and competition, possibly through the use of a talent scout. Significant differences were found when item scores were compared by age, gender, experience, and qualifications (National Coaching Accreditation Scheme). Female coaches considered nurturing and teaching attributes more important than did males, additionally career stage may affect consideration of the most important attributes. Practical implications and directions for future research are also discussed.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321401 Exercise Physiology</field><field name="subject">750203 Organised sports</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158233</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Post-transcriptional regulation of BRCA1: Investigation of the roles of RNA-binding proteins and cis-acting elements in the 3&#146;untranslated region</field><field name="creator">Saunus, Jodi Marie</field><field name="description">BRCA1 is a breast cancer susceptibility gene that is down-regulated in the majority of cases of sporadic breast cancer. Accordingly, there is considerable interest in the mechanisms that regulate normal expression of BRCA1, with a view to elucidating how this could be disrupted in breast cancer. In tumours with reduced BRCA1 protein expression, there can be a concomitant reduction in mRNA level to variable degrees, or no change in mRNA level, suggesting that disruption of multiple different regulatory processes may contribute to BRCA1 down-regulation. Despite this, efforts to date have chiefly focussed on transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of the gene, whilst post-transcriptional processes that regulate the dynamics of the BRCA1 transcript, such as decay, localisation and translation efficiency, are poorly understood. Post-transcriptional regulatory pathways are critical for sustaining normal cellular physiology, as evidenced by many examples where disruption of these processes results in disease, including cancer. Regulation of gene expression at this level is often mediated by RNA-binding proteins that recognise specific cis-acting sequence motifs in the untranslated regions (UTRs) of certain messenger RNAs, and recruit, or shield them from macromolecular complexes involved in RNA metabolism, such as the translation apparatus, exosome, and subcellular transport particles. This thesis is centred on investigating post-transcriptional regulation of BRCA1. Others have shown that expression of the transcript and protein is regulated throughout the mammalian cell division cycle. Results presented in this thesis suggest that changes in mRNA stability may contribute to cell cycle-dependent expression of BRCA1, and therefore that post-transcriptional regulation of BRCA1 is a biologically-relevant phenomenon. To begin to address the molecular mechanisms involved in regulation of BRCA1 mRNA decay, and possibly other post-transcriptional regulatory processes, the 3&#146;UTR of BRCA1, which had not been previously characterised, was analysed for functional regulatory motifs using a combination of bioinformatics, reporter assays and RNA-proteinbinding analysis. An evolutionarily-conserved 3&#146;UTR subsequence was identified which contains sequence elements capable of regulating reporter activity, and forming complexes with multiple proteins from human epithelial cell lines. Some of these elements have been previously characterised in the context of other genes, including a Hu-antigen R (HuR)-binding motif, adenosine-uridine (AU)- rich sequences and a differentiation control element (DICE). Experiments were also conducted to determine the identities of the RNA-binding proteins detected using an RNA probe containing the 3&#146;UTR elements. A preliminary screen of a small group of RNA-binding proteins with previously-characterised roles in 3&#146;UTR-mediated post-transcriptional gene regulation identified HuR as a negative regulator of BRCA1 protein expression. Interestingly, HuR is over-expressed in breast cancer. Evidence presented in this thesis suggests that the mechanism of HuR-mediated down-regulation of BRCA1 involves direct binding of HuR to the BRCA1 3&#146;UTR, and no changes to mRNA stability or abundance. Finally, proteomics-based analysis of protein extracts enriched with BRCA1 3&#146;UTR RNA-binding proteins yielded several interesting candidates with previously-reported RNA-binding and/or post-transcriptional regulatory activities, including Far upstream element-binding protein 1 (FBP1), Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPD) and Heat-shock protein 27 (HSP27). This thesis addresses a clear deficiency in the literature concerning regulation of BRCA1, and contributes to our general understanding of the molecular mechanisms controlling gene expression in mammalian cells. Additionally, the finding that RNA-binding proteins that are over-expressed in breast cancer can negatively regulate BRCA1 expression constitutes important groundwork for identifying potential novel breast cancer therapeutics in the future.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270299 Genetics not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158183</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Expression of hnRNPs A/B in cancer cells and their roles in carcinogenesis</field><field name="creator">He, Yaowu</field><field name="description">The identification of specific and reproducible biomarkers is critical for the early diagnosis of cancer, which has a profound effect the survival rate of patients. Comprehensive laboratory and clinical evidence needs to be collected to confirm the accuracy of the biomarkers prior to their clinical use. Heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) A2 and B1 have been suggested as biomarkers for cancer since 1988 when hnRNP A2/B1 overexpression was first linked with the occurrence of lung cancer. Later studies established a correlation between the expression levels of these hnRNPs and other cancers, such as breast, pancreatic, and lymphatic tumours. In this study, the expression of hnRNPs A1, A2, A3, and B1 has been investigated in various cancer cell lines. hnRNPs A1 and A3, in addition to A2 and B1, were found to be overexpressed in some cancer types. However, the overexpression of none of the hnRNP A/B proteins was universal, and their upregulation may be limited to a few cell types, suggesting they may be effective biomarkers for a subset of cancers. The upregulation of hnRNP A/B proteins in tumours and cancer cell lines led to the hypothesis that they are involved in the uncontrolled cell growth in cancer. According to our Western blot analysis, expression of the hnRNP proteins, A1, A2, and B1, is dependent on the cell cycle whereas no significant change was detected for hnRNP A3, implying that the former three are needed during certain cell cycle stages. The results, together with the transcription factor analysis of the promoter regions of the HNRPA1, HNRPA2, and HNRPA3 genes, suggest that hnRNPs A1, A2, and A3 may have distinct regulatory machineries and cellular functions although they have high amino acid sequence identity. However, their mRNA levels were unchanged across the cell cycle, suggesting the cell-cycle-dependent expression of hnRNPs A1, A2, and B1 is modulated at the translational level. Previous studies showed higher expression of hnRNPs A1 and A2 in rapidly proliferating cells than in quiescent cells, suggesting a role of these proteins in cell proliferation. Though interruption of hnRNP A1 expression did not result in significant change in the viability of murine CB3 cells, simultaneous suppression of hnRNPs A1 and A2 caused apoptosis in a few cell lines. Consistent with this, suppression of hnRNP A1 or A3 expression in our study in Colo16 squamous cells using RNA interference did not affect cell proliferation, but simultaneous suppression of both caused slow cell proliferation. By contrast, reduction of the hnRNP A2 level alone slowed the proliferation of Colo16 cells. These results suggest that although hnRNPs A1, A2, and A3 share some roles in cell proliferation, each of them may have distinct tasks. This conclusion is supported by the data from the comparative analysis of the downstream targets of hnRNPs A1, A2, and A3, which has shown that these three proteins share a limited number of common downstream proteins. The observed impact on cell proliferation of suppressing hnRNP A2 subfamily proteins is in accord with our finding that the downstream targets of hnRNP A2 are overrepresented by genes involved in proliferation regulation, as shown in microarray and real-time PCR analysis. These include cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors, p21 and p27, and their regulatory proteins, such as Skp2 and Rpn10. Skp2 controls the ubiquitination of p21 and p27, and Rpn10 links them to the 26S proteasome, the complex that degrades these two CDK inhibitors. hnRNP A2 also regulates the transcription of securin and separin, which are essential for sister chromatid separation during late anaphase. In addition, hnRNP A2 can also influence cell proliferation through cell growth factors, including fibroblast, vascular endothelial, transforming, and insulin growth factors. Our gene array and real-time PCR analysis have shown that hnRNP A2 regulates the expression of these factors, their receptors, or associated proteins such as IGFBP7 and TGFBR2. The data presented in this thesis link the overexpression of hnRNP A/B proteins, in particular the A2/B1 subfamily, in cancer with their regulatory roles in cell division and cell proliferation. Our findings provide mechanistic evidence that these proteins may be a driving force for the uncontrolled cell growth in cancer, suggesting that some of hnRNP A/B proteins may be potential therapeutic targets for cancer. However, further studies are needed to obtain a global view of the roles of these proteins in cancer.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270201 Gene Expression</field><field name="subject">780105 Biological sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158357</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gene expression in the human brain: adaptive changes associated with tobacco and alcohol exposure</field><field name="creator">Flatscher-Bader, Traute</field><field name="description">Alcohol and tobacco are drugs of abuse which are legal to sell and consume in most western societies. Addiction to these two substances has major social and health implications worldwide. The brain structure known to mediate addictive behaviour is the dopaminergic mesocorticolimbic system. Dopaminegic neurons arise from the ventral tegmental area, project to the nucleus accumbens and interact with the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex. Chronic alcoholism elicits marked damage in the prefrontal cortex with significant loss of neurons and glia. The key components of addiction, tolerance and dependence, are thought to be the result of semipermanent adaptive changes in gene expression. Gene expression profiling of the mesocorticolimbic system from human alcoholics and alcohol-dependent animals has revealed highly region-specific alterations. How these molecular changes result in the development of alcohol dependence in humans is not fully understood. Complicating factors in human alcoholism include a high comorbidity with smoking, socioeconomic factors and the prevalence of underlying psychological pathologies. Gene expression profiling of the prefrontal cortex of six alcoholics and six controls resulted in the identification of functional gene groups sensitive to alcoholism. Mitochondrial function was found down regulated while mRNA levels of genes involved in stress response and cell protection were elevated. These results correlate with the pathology of the prefrontal cortex in chronic alcoholism. Some of the control cases used for gene expression profiling were later identified as chronic smokers, while all of the alcoholics were heavy smokers. To date the heavy co-morbidity of alcoholism with smoking has not been taken into account. Thus the expression of selected genes were investigated by realtime PCR in an extended case set of non-smoking alcoholics, smoking alcoholics, smoking non-alcoholics and non-smoking, non-alcoholics. This study revealed that alcoholism itself had a significant impact on the expression of midkine, the high affinity glial glutamate transporter, member 1 and the tissue inhibitor of the metalloproteinase 3. Heavy smoking itself led to a small but significant elevation of MDK mRNA levels as well as an increase in variation of excitatory amino acid transporter 1 and metalloproteinase inhibitor, member 3 expression. Apolipoprotein D however was induced by chronic smoking but not by alcohol dependence. These results highlight the need of careful case selection in future studies on gene expression in the human alcoholic brain. Peptide antibodies were produced to midkine and a polyclonal antibody against the excitatory amino acid transporter 1 was obtained from a collaborating laboratory. Western blots utilizing these antibodies revealed a marked increase in midkine and excitatory amino acid transporter 1 protein in alcoholics compared to non-smoking and non-drinking controls. In coronal sections of human prefrontal cortex of alcoholics and non-smoking non-drinking controls, immunofluorescence of midkine was obtained from nuclei throughout the layers of the cortex and from the cell bodies of a distinct set of astrocytes in cortical layer II. Double staining with glial fibrillary acidic protein revealed that a portion of midkine-positive nuclei were localised in glial cells. There was no difference in immunostaining of alcohol and control sections with midkine. In summary these results indicate that midkine protein is induced in the prefrontal cortex of the chronic alcoholic. However, this increase in protein may not be strong enough to be visualised by immunohistochemistry. Midkine induction may be reflective of reparative processes in the prefrontal cortex of the chronic alcoholic. Excitatory amino acid transporter 1 staining in non-alcoholic, non-smoking control cases were obtained as a confluent band in cortical layer II and sparsely in deeper cortical layers. Excitatory amino acid transporter 1 immunoreactivity overlapped partially with glial fibrillary acidic protein labelling. In chronic alcoholics, excitatory amino acid transporter 1 staining in the area between the cortical layer II and VI was significantly increased. At withdrawal, glutamate levels may reach toxic levels in the cortex. The increase in cells expressing excitatory amino acid transporter 1 throughout the cortical layers may indicate a protective measure of this brain region in the chronic alcoholic. Additionally, layer specific expression of midkine and excitatory amino acid transporter 1 in the prefrontal cortex of the healthy individual may implicate a specialised role of these astrocytes.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270201 Gene Expression</field><field name="subject">780105 Biological sciences</field><field name="subject">gene expression</field><field name="subject">brain chemistry</field><field name="subject">alcohol</field><field name="subject">tobacco</field><field name="subject">drug dependency</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158114</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sensitivity of bovine morulae and blastocysts to heat shock in vitro</field><field name="creator">Naik, Veena</field><field name="description">Bovine pre-implantation embryos are sensitive to high temperatures. The hyperthermia resulting from maternal heat stress leads to an increased loss of early stage embryos. The effects of hyperthermia appear to be more pronounced in the zygote than blastocyst stages. There is also evidence to suggest that B. indicus embryos show better resistance to heat shock as compared to B. taurus embryos. The mechanism of thermotolerance in B. indicus embryos is unknown and it is also unclear if the thermotolerance of these embryos is a result of maternal or paternal contributions. There is also evidence to suggest that male embryos survive heat shock better than female embryos. This research therefore aimed 1. To examine the effect of heat shock on day-7 bovine embryos 2. To study the influence of maternal and paternal genotype on the embryo's ability to survive up to 48 hours post heat shock treatment 3. To study the expression of HSP70 in heat-shocked and non-heat shocked embryos and compare B. indicus and B. taurus embryos. 4. To compare the effects of heat shock on rapidly developing (day-6 morulae) and slowly developing (day-7 morulae) embryos to heat shock treatments 5. To determine the effect of heat shock on the sex ratio of the surviving embryos The work described in this thesis used an in vitro protocol for heat shock studies on embryos, based on observed in vivo rectal temperature fluctuations in heat stressed cows. The first study examined the effects of heat shock on embryos at the morula or blastocyst stage on day 7 of in vitro culture. The embryos were produced in vitro from oocytes collected from ovaries of either pure breed B. indicus or B. taurus and fertilised by frozen semen straws of either B. indicus or B. taurus bulls. Day-7 morulae or blastocysts were used for the study. The embryos were subjected to heat shock (HS) (41.5&amp;degC) or non-heat shock (NHS) (39&amp;degC) temperatures. Embryo survival and development 48 hours (48 h) post treatment were recorded. The data were analysed using binary logistic regression using logit link function to determine the Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence limits for individual factors. The variables used as factors in the analysis were replicate, heat shock, maternal genotype (B. indicus vs B. taurus), paternal genotype (B. indicus vs B. taurus) and stage at which heat shock was applied (morula or blastocyst). The outcome variables used for analysis were the number of viable embryos from the total treated and the proportion reaching expanded or hatched blastocyst stage, and the proportion of male embryos. Heat shock significantly reduced the probability of embryo survival by more than half (OR = 0.47; P &#8804; 0.001) and reduced the probability of the embryo's progression to the expanded or hatched blastocyst stage by almost half (OR = 0.58; P = 0.005) as compared to NHS embryos. The probability of survival of embryos with B. indicus paternal genotype (confounded by the use of a single sire) was double (OR = 2.00; P = 0.002) that of embryos with B. taurus paternal genotype. The heat shock x paternal B. indicus genotype interaction was found to be non-significant. Maternal B. indicus genotype showed no influence on thermotolerance. Nevertheless, the probability of progression to expanded blastocysts for embryos with maternal B. indicus genotypes was double (OR = 2.05; P = 0.030) that of embryos with maternal B. taurus genotype. Comparison of day-7 morulae with day-7 blastocysts showed that the probability of day-7 blastocysts surviving until 48 h after treatment was almost two and half times greater (OR = 2.39; P &#8804; 0.001). The probability of survival of a blastocyst with paternal B. indicus genotype was almost twice (OR = 1.95; P = 0.041) when compared to a blastocyst with B. taurus paternal genotype. The interaction term of heat shock &#215; blastocyst stage was found to be significant (OR = 2.70; P = 0.038) indicating that blastocyst stage embryos were resistant to heat shock. The study showed a trend towards survival of more male embryos (61% males vs 39% females) under heat shock conditions (OR = 1.64; P = 0.070) indicating that male embryos may be resistant to heat shock. The second study was designed to detect the induced form of HSP70 in heat shocked and non-heat shocked day-7 bovine embryos and to compare the patterns between B. indicus embryos and B. taurus embryos. Comparison of confocal images showed that staining for HSP70 was present in most embryos whether heat shocked or not and found to be concentrated in the nuclei and cytoplasm. Heat shock appears to have increased HSP70 staining intensity in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, suggesting increased expression of HSP70 after heat shock. The same general staining patterns were seen in heat shocked and non-heat shocked embryos of B. indicus and B. taurus embryos. In the third experiment, embryos were examined for the effects of heat shock on day-7 or on day-6 of their in vitro culture. The data were analysed to study the effects of heat shock, stage at heat shock (day-7 blastocysts vs day-7 morulae) and day of heat shock (day-7 vs day-6) on embryo survival and progression to expanded or hatched blastocysts 48 h post treatment. We found that heat shock reduced the probability of survival by more than half (OR = 0.40; P = 0.004). Probability of survival of day-7 embryos (confounded by rapidly developing blastocysts and slow developing morulae) was less than half (OR = 0.36; P = 0.008), that of day-6 embryos. The data were then analysed to study the effects of heat shock on day-7 blastocysts and day-7 morulae for embryo survival post treatment. Heat shock negatively affected embryo survival (OR = 0.35; P = 0.007). The probability of day-7 blastocysts surviving HS and NHS was more than two and a half times greater (OR = 2.71; P = 0.008) than that of day-7 morulae. No interaction of heat shock and blastocyst stage was noticed. Subsequently the effects of heat shock and the effects of the day of heat shock on morula stage embryos were examined. Overall, heat shock reduced the probability of survival (OR = 0.35; P = 0.009) and the probability of embryo development to the expanded or hatched blastocysts (OR = 0.35; P &#8804; 0.001), 48 h post treatment. The probability of day-6 morulae surviving HS and NHS was almost three times higher (OR = 2.81; P = 0.007) than that of day-7 morulae. The interaction of stage of development with heat shock was not significant. We concluded that an embryo that was capable of developing to the blastocyst stage by day-7 or morula stage by day-6 had better survival and higher probability of progressing to expanded or hatched stage when compared to an embryo that had slow development (day-7 morulae). The study showed a significantly different effect of heat shock on the survival of male and female embryos (63% males vs 36% females, OR = 1.79; P = 0.014). In our final study, embryos were produced from three different bulls each of B. indicus or B. taurus genotype. Heat shock effects consistently and negatively affected survival of embryos (OR = 0.29; P &#8804; 0.001) and their ability to progress to the expanded or hatched blastocysts (OR = 0.42; P &#8804; 0.001). Embryos with paternal B. indicus genotype showed no advantage of survival over embryos with paternal B. taurus genotype embryos. When the day-7 blastocysts were compared with the day-7 morulae, the probability of day-7 blastocysts surviving HS or NHS was more than double (OR = 2.23; P = 0.009) that of day-7 morulae. In this study the effect of survival of the interaction term of heat shock treatment with the blastocyst stage was significant and negative (OR = 0.49; P = 0.040). However the interaction term of blastocyst stage x HS for an embryo&#146;s ability to progress to expanded or hatched blastocyst stage was positive (OR = 2.00; P = 0.052), indicating that the embryos that did survive heat shock were capable of continuing their developmental progress. Although more male embryos (55% male vs 45% female) survived heat shock, the effect for this study was non-significant. In summary, the studies described in this thesis successfully tested a new in vitro heat shock protocol based on in vivo temperature changes experienced by heat stressed cows. Heat shock was consistent in negatively affecting embryo survival. Heat shock also negatively affected the embryo's progression to the expanded or hatched blastocyst stage by 48 h post treatment. We observed variable cytoplasmic and nuclear staining for HSP70 in day-7 blastocysts of both B. indicus and B. taurus. This distribution did not change dramatically after heat shock, but staining appeared to be more intense in heat shocked embryos, suggesting that there was increased expression of HSP70 after heat shock. No difference in this pattern was observed between B. indicus and B. taurus embryos. The speed of development of an embryo until being subjected to either heat shock or non heat shock temperatures affected the probability of survival and further development. However, the interaction term of day-7 blastocyst stage and heat shock was inconsistent, meaning that the rate of development appeared to specifically protect against heat shock in some studies while in the other studies, the apparent protective effect extended to control as well as heat shocked embryos. Our study found no significant influence of B. indicus paternal genotype on embryo survival. Our study showed evidence of B. indicus maternal genotype influence on the embryo's ability to progress to expanded blastocysts but not on embryo survival. The study found a clear trend towards an increased proportion of male embryos surviving heat shock conditions. In some studies this was significant, and in others it was not, but the trend was always in the same direction. This suggests that male embryos are more resistant to the effects of heat shock in vitro.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300402 Animal Reproduction</field><field name="subject">630103 Beef cattle</field><field name="subject">Sensitivity</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158248</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling thickness in a stratiform deposit using joint simulation techniques</field><field name="creator">Eggins, Ronald George</field><field name="description">The estimated economic value of a stratiform mineral deposit is often very sensitive to the modelling of thickness in a conformable sequence of beds. A coregionalisation model of thickness expresses the assumed underlying spatial relationships of bedding thickness on a regional scale. Joint simulation of thickness directly models the cross-correlation of bedding thickness in such a model. Many of the current techniques of joint simulation are limited in the number of variables that can be simulated due to the multiplicative increase in processing times, based on the number of variables and number of samples simulated. To minimise processing times some methods make use of simplifying assumptions on the coregionalisation model. For example the Markov model, in which the dependence of one variable on the other is limited to the collocated data, would be unlikely to apply to the thickness of conformable bedding in a stratiform deposit. Transforming the thickness variables to remove correlation, simulating, and then back transforming to original data space offered a possible solution. The Minimum/Maximum Autocorrelation Factor (MAF) technique was chosen as one most likely to successfully decorrelate numbers of thickness variables, if the assumptions regarding a two-structure linear coregionalisation model were reasonably satisfied by the sampled data. The assumptions are that a simple intrinsic model of coregionalisation can represent both a lower correlation (&#145;noise&#146;) component and a higher correlation (&#145;signal&#146;) component of the modelled data. This implies that the final coregionalisation model (noise plus signal) is made up of linear combinations of a single basic structure at different spatial scales. In a number of previous applications, this had not proved to be a particularly restrictive requirement of the model. The decorrelated variables can be independently simulated, and back transformed twice; firstly using a MAF back-transformation to obtain correlated Gaussian variables, and finally to original data space. The McArthur River silver/lead/zinc stratiform deposit in the Northern Territory of Australia was chosen as the case study because it had many of the characteristics needed to test and evaluate the MAF technique in a typical stratiform deposit. The orebody model contained seventeen (17) mineralised units forming a conformable sequence which had varying thickness and degrees of mineralisation, and which had good continuity across the deposit. Cross-correlation between the thicknesses of the seventeen stratigraphic units was significant. The deposit was heavily folded in certain areas and true thickness of the bedding was calculated from drillhole log data, and used for the simulation studies. A simple unfolding algorithm was utilised to effectively flatten the deposit to allow the application of 2-D simulation techniques. Drillhole intersections often did not contain the full stratigraphic sequence of beds due to a series of normal faults criss-crossing the deposit. Therefore, incomplete data in the drillhole would need to be removed from the data set, or the number of beds in the joint simulation would need to be reduced, to utilise the MAF technique. A method was developed and validated for the generation of missing thicknesses at a sample point which removed the requirement to delete real incomplete sub-sets of the data when utilising MAF. Sequential Gaussian Simulation (SGS) was used to simulate the MAF decorrelated variables under the assumption that the multi-Gaussian assumptions held. Bedding surface simulations were generated by the addition of true thickness perpendicular to a basal reference surface. The 2-D joint simulations of thicknesses and surfaces were considered successful within a domain of the deposit where drillholes were approximately perpendicular to bedding after unfolding. The univariate, bivariate and spatial statistics of the original thickness data were reproduced accurately in the joint simulation model, including the crossvariograms of original thickness; especially compared to those obtained using independent simulation of thickness. It was concluded that the techniques could be successfully applied to other stratiform deposits if the recommended validation steps were carried out. No further difficulties should be encountered in applying the method to 2-D joint simulation of grades in a stratiform deposit. The full 3-D joint simulation of variables in any deposit using MAF would be assisted by the technique to generate missing variables at a point.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">260100 Geology</field><field name="subject">780104 Earth sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158312</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An exploration of the performer-composer dynamic</field><field name="creator">Morgan, Christy J.</field><field name="description">The purpose of this critical commentary is to explore the concept of the composerperformer relationship.

Adopting a phenomenological approach, the study gathered four life stories of three recruited participants and my own story as a legally blind person. These case studies revealed that people who are legally blind traverse a borderland between sighted and blind worlds, a position which carries with it experiences that are vastly different than both totally blind and sighted people. Located in disability studies, the thesis examined the experience of legal blindness in a unique way, cross-fertilising the best elements of an American cultural studies approach with a British social model of disability. The British social model, rooted in sociological materialist analysis, is often positioned by its proponents as at odds with the United States humanities-based cultural or minority model of disability. This thesis sought to discover if a bridge could be built between the two models to allow for several theoretical analyses with the higher goal of understanding both phenomenological and social aspects of borderland blindness. Another original aspect of this study is the use of the postmodern metaphor &#147;borderland&#148; to carve out a geographical space unique to legal blindness -- a territory between sightedness and blindness where residents are pressed to migrate back and forth across its borders from situation to situation. The research developed a combination of social constructionism, materialism, postmodernism, and existential phenomenology, while aiming to meet the goals of emancipatory disability research. Participants told their stories in their own words, they chose what was important for us to know about them, and they maintained control over their stories throughout the research and write-up processes. The study was interested in how society treats blind people, and was also keen to know what meaning blind people made of such treatment. Its design strayed from orthodox disability studies research in that it wanted to learn and record the embodied experience of legal blindness as well as blindness identity formation. However, to examine physical aspects of blindness did not imply approval of ocularcentric medical model practices; both the American and British social models have at their foundations critical analyses of medicine&#146;s control over the lives of disabled people. While this study utilised social constructionism as a primary method of analysis, it simultaneously challenged the binary of essentialism/social constructionism because impairment, disablement, and disability are complex and do not all fit into either stance. The experience of impairment is integral to understanding the lived experience of blindness. Further, the study rejected the blindness/sightedness binary which positions blindness as &#145;lack&#146; (Michalko, 1999), and instead, examined borderland blindness as a medically and legally constructed social category that is neither better nor worse than &#145;normal&#146; sight and vision, but is merely neutral difference. The research was conducted from an &#145;insider&#146; position because I wanted to learn how other legally blind people experience life in the borderland; and, in the tradition of disability studies and disability activism, I consider this work a political act -- &#147;a commitment to openly partisan inquiry&#148; (Barnes and Mercer, 2004). I was curious to explore the strengths, weaknesses, and complexities of conducting research as an &#147;insider&#148; &#150; as a member of the population of research interest. Another feature of this study was the application of Rogerian techniques of establishing an environment in which genuineness, trust, and unconditional positive regard would flourish; this model provided a natural marriage to emancipatory life story and insider research. The research findings conclude that there is no conflict between British and American social models of disability; and further argue that the two models enhance each other in that together they provide a more holistic examination of the everyday lived experience of disabled people. Use of both models strengthened inherent weaknesses that arise when each model stands alone. Furthermore, the findings suggest that more studies about blindness concentrate on &#147;legal&#148; or borderland blindness because this population has experiences that are vastly different from both totally blind and sighted people. These differences have significant ramifications for education, rehabilitation and other human service policy and provision.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">750305 Ability and disability</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158179</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Micro-Intonation and the viola: a study of just intonation, the pythagorean scale and equal temperament in relation to the performance of unaccompanied viola repertoire.</field><field name="creator">Garrett, Linda Catherine</field><field name="description">This discussion examines just intonation, the Pythagorean scale and equal temperament in relation to string playing and explores ways that intervals from these systems of temperament can be used to enhance the acoustic and expressive qualities of an unaccompanied performance on viola.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">410101 Music</field><field name="subject">750201 The performing arts (incl. music, theatre and dance)</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158386</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of the epidemiology and molecular biology of Koala retrovirus (KoRV)</field><field name="creator">Tarlinton, R. E.</field><field name="description">Gammaretroviruses are known to cause leukaemia, lymphoma and immunosuppression in many species and the original isolation of KoRV (koala retrovirus) (Hanger et al 2000) was made as part of a study into the cause of the high rate of leukaemia and lymphoma in koalas. The virus however displayed some unusual features. While classified as an endogenous (inherited) gammaretrovirus it was unusually active. While endogenous viruses are very common with up to 8% of the human genome consisting of retroviral material they are usually mutated and inactive (Gifford and Tristem 2002). KoRV possessed a full length replication competent genome, was actively transcribed and produced viral particles. KoRV was also very closely related to the exogenous (horizontally transmitted) retrovirus of Gibbons (Gibbon ape leukaemia virus or GaLV). Normally closely related viruses are found in closely related species. This unusual similarity between KoRV and GaLV raised the possibility of a recent host species jump (Hanger et al 2000). This thesis makes a case for the recent introduction of KoRV into the koala genome and ongoing endogenisation into the koala genome. KoRV is demonstrated definitively as an endogenous virus but present at a mixed prevalence within the Australian koala population. The thesis also further characterizes KoRV&#146;s activity and establishes an association between KoRV and disease in koalas. It is difficult to prove that a virus present in all animals in a population (as is the case for most endogenous viruses) is the cause of a particular disease syndrome. Here real time PCR was used to quantify the level of viraemia and proviral DNA load in the blood of individuals. A significant association between high viral load and leukaemia and lymphoma was demonstrated. This was further confirmed in a follow up study of a group of animals where those with a high viral RNA level were at a greater risk of dying from neoplasia. The real time PCR study also indicated that animals suffering from clinical chlamydiosis had higher viral RNA levels than their healthy counterparts though this was not significant. This disease association was further strengthened when KoRV free populations were identified and were shown to have lower incidences of these diseases. The real time PCR studies demonstrated a considerable variation in the proviral copy number in individual animals. With most endogenous retroviruses the proviral copy number is fixed within the species or population (Boeke and Stoye 1997). Southern blotting was used to confirm this variation in copy number and also demonstrated variation in the pattern of these proviral inserts between unrelated animals. The random insertion pattern of KoRV provirus loci was further confirmed using cytogenetics. Sequencing of the KoRV envelope gene revealed marked variation in sequence within individual animals. These sequences despite considerable mutation in some cases were all potentially functional and indicate positive selection pressure for active virus within the individual animals. Inverse PCR was used to identify the koala genomic sequence interrupted by the proviral loci. While koala genomic sequence was successfully amplified no potential oncogenes were found. This study did however demonstrate the presence of truncated KoRV sequences missing a large part of the gagpro- pol gene. Electron microscopy also demonstrated KoRV viral particles in the bone marrow of a leukaemic animal. KoRV had originally been classified as an endogenous virus based on the fact that it was present in all animals tested and in all tissues of individual animals. However the accepted definition of an endogenous virus is one that is present in the germ line DNA and is inherited over several generations (Boeke and Stoye 1997). Single cell PCR of koala sperm was used to demonstrate that KoRV is present in germ line DNA. This was confirmed using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) techniques. Southern blotting of blood obtained from a group of related captive animals showed the inheritance of proviral loci over several generations. To determine whether all koalas carried KoRV loci, samples from geographically diverse populations were obtained. As expected all animals in Queensland were positive for KoRV using PCR techniques. Unexpectedly animals from Kangaroo Island in South Australia were free of KoRV. Samples obtained from Victorian animals demonstrated a mixed KoRV status. The animals on Kangaroo Island have been isolated from other populations since the 1920&#146;s and this raises the possibility that KoRV has integrated into the mainland koala population during the last 100 years. This is unprecedented for an endogenous virus with the most recent estimate for integration in other species being the type C viruses of pigs 5000 years ago (Mang et al 2001). The mixed prevalence of KoRV and its high activity indicate that this virus is still undergoing the process of endogenisation and provides a unique opportunity to study this process in a wild animal population.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270303 Virology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158074</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transformative Power in Motherwork: A Study of Mothering in the 1950s and 1960s</field><field name="creator">Porter, Marie</field><field name="description">In this thesis I explore the experiences of a group of Australian women who became first-time mothers between 1950 and 1965. I interviewed twenty-four mothers, half of whom were selected as practising Roman Catholics. The other half was AnglicanfProtestant by co-incidence rather than selection. The data in this research have been collected via in-depth, unstructured interviews with the participants. The interviews were taped and transcribed verbatim, before the data were analysed. I present a grounded theory of transformative power in motherwork that has emerged from the analysis of interviews. The mothers talked about what they did in their active mothering years. I argue that despite being constrained by the gender bias in the patriarchal context, these mothers were agents who developed skills that enabled them to resist or creatively deal with the constraints they faced. Their emphasis was on their agency and the power to nurture their children into responsible adults. Their awareness of the importance of their motherwork acted as a motivator in this development. My thesis is that the relationship between each mother and each of her children is a transformative power relationship in which both mother and child are transformedthe child into an independent adult and the mother into a skilled self-motivated agent through her mothenvork. Any threat to this process resulted in the mother doing all she could to resist or counteract the constraintls she was encountering. Transformative power expressed in motherwork can be recognised analytically by several characteristics. It empowers both parties in the motherlchild duality. Complexity, diversity, fluidity, and responsiveness to the physical, intellectual, and emotional aspects of the relationship are all evident in transformative power relationships. Through their own transformation, the mothers saw the falsity of the master narratives of motherhood, prevalent in society in the 1950s and 1960s, which they had believed as inexperienced girls. From their stories about motherwork, I reveal a counter narrative that was portrayed not only in their telling of their stories: but in their discursivelreflexive practices as mothers.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">370104 Urban Sociology and Community Studies</field><field name="subject">440207 Religion and Society</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158105</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transitional Justice and South Africa: jus ad bellum, jus in bello and the promotion of national unity and reconciliation act (34) 1995</field><field name="creator">Castel, Heather Lorraine</field><field name="description">My thesis examines the evolution of the enabling legislation to the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act (34) 1995, through the historical, legal, philosophical and ideological issues that underpinned the Act. Transitional justice is an interregnum characteristic and comprises both accountability and the establishment of a moral society. Historically, the South African government's principal adversary, the African National Congress (ANC) advocated a just, multi-racial and equitable society through leaders such as Pixley ka Isaka Seme, Professor Z.K. Matthews and Chief Albert Luthuli. ANC leaders from 191 2-1 960 were mission educated and regarded segregation as the antithesis of their strong Christian principles and in opposition to Gospel values. They advocated the reformation of South African society through passive resistance and the attainment of the franchise. After the 1960 Sharpeville massacre and the entrenchment of "grand apartheid", the ANC adopted the armed struggle while the state committed numerous gross human rights violations to maintain apartheid. While exiled, the ANC established its just war claims with a meritorious cause, its jus ad bellum. By 1990 a settlement was negotiated between the principal adversaries. The interregnum was characterised by violence, commissions of inquiry and various requests for indemnification/amnesty. The ANC's just war claims were eroded with allegations of atrocities in its military camps that severely undermined its claims to the moral high-ground. Its poor conduct of the armed struggle, its jus in bello, was confirmed in various subsequent reports. The ANC's decisive election victory of April 1994 provided the Congress with an opportunity to structure transitional justice through the enabling legislation to the TRC on its own terms and prove through the self-incriminating evidence that emerged at the TRC hearings that apartheid was a crime against humanity and that the armed struggle was a just war with a meritorious jus ad bellum.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">430111 History - Other</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158109</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The limits of liberal justice: Normative constraints on multicultural policies and indigenous policies in Australia</field><field name="creator">Antal, Ildiko Barbara</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the question of the extent to which theories of citizenship, especially as developed in political liberalism, help to formulate an understanding of cultural diversity in relation to political stability and justice. Taking the recent debates over liberal and communitarian political philosophy as the object of inquiry, it explores the social and political character of multiculturalism and indigenous rights movements in Australia&#146;s political culture. The principal aim is to establish that political liberalism provides appropriate political and ethical norms for adjudicating multicultural and indigenous rights claims. Thus, the exposition is twofold: first the thesis explores the concepts of justice as fairness as expounded in Rawlsian political liberalism. Second it applies the Rawlsian perspective to analyse the implications of multiculturalism and indigenous politics for the Australian liberal state. Interpreted in the light of the problems of contemporary patterns of pluralism, Rawls&#146; theory demonstrates the necessity and desirability of applying justice as fairness to the &#145;special rights&#146; challenges confronting Western liberal states, including Australia.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">430101 History - Australian</field><field name="subject">780199 Other</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158112</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Handwriting of eight year old children with and without autistic spectrum disorder</field><field name="creator">Cartmill, Linda Joan</field><field name="description">Anecdotally it was found that Queensland occupational therapists reported a surprisingly high referral rate for handwriting problems amongst school aged children with Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD). A subsequent review of the literature revealed a number of anecdotal reports of disordered handwriting in this population but limited research in the area. This thesis presents a descriptive and exploratory study of the nature of handwriting in eight year old children with and without ASD. Issues of handwriting development and motor learning are canvassed followed by an examination of concepts of motor control. Next follows a review of current handwriting models. The Systems Model of Handwriting was proposed as a response to the evidence for both dynamic and motor programme aspects of handwriting. Using this model as an organizing structure, the literature on ASD and handwriting was then examined which led to the framing of three research questions: 1. Is the handwriting speed of children with ASD significantly different from that of children without ASD? 2. Is the handwriting legibility of children with ASD significantly different from that of children without ASD? 3. At what stage/s of the Sequential Handwriting Process, is the handwriting of children with ASD different from that of children without ASD? Twenty-eight eight year old children with ASD and a matched control group of twentyeight comparison children were recruited from state primary schools in Brisbane and surrounding areas. These fifty-six children were assessed on thirteen handwriting process variables and two handwriting outcome variables in order to answer the research questions. Data produced were analyzed primarily with t-tests for between group differences and by examination of correlations between process and outcome variables. Small but measurable differences were found in both speed and legibility between the two groups, with the handwriting of the children with ASD being both less legible (t=- 2.47, df=54, p=0.02) and slower (t=-2.47, df=54, p=0.02). Accuracy of letter formation was also found to be significantly worse for the children with ASD compared to children in the control group (t=3.53, df=54, p=0.001). Further, the two groups were found to differ in some aspects of the Sequential Handwriting Process. Specifically, the children with ASD showed significant correlations between legibility and Perceiving, Conceptualizing and Planning stages, while the comparison children showed significant correlations between legibility and Interpreting, Conceptualizing, Planning and Activating stages. Only one process variable (consistency of letter formation) showed a moderate correlation with handwriting speed &#150; all other variables were of only slight to fair strength. Finally, the implications of the research findings are discussed, limitations described and directions for future research canvassed. As a result of the present study, a revised Systems Model of Handwriting is proposed. Several recommendations for occupational therapy intervention in handwriting practices in the classroom are made, notably: clear and focussed initial tuition of letter formation and secondly, the development of automaticity of the handwriting skill.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158068</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental systems analysis as an aid to policy development, application and auditing</field><field name="creator">Hill, Richard J.</field><field name="description">Environmental management in modern industry entails much more than simply measuring the level of contaminants at the discharge point of a chimney stack or pipeline and operating within defined licence limits. It involves: 1) Understanding the environmental risks associated with the industrial operation; 2) Quantifying the environmental assets at risk; 3) Evaluating the environmental challenge from the industry (determining the likely effect of particular emission levels on different environments); 4) Monitoring the condition of environmental assets in response to this challenge; 5) Devising appropriate remedial action where necessary. This study aimed to provide a rigorous and effective framework for decision making concerning vegetated landscapes surrounding industrial premises, particularly those associated with emissions of pollutants to air. Three Alcoa of Australia managed facilities in Victoria were used to develop and test the procedures, namely a coastal site at Point Henry, Geelong, a hinterland forest and heath site at Anglesea and a coastal heath site at Portland. The three facilities were involved in the aluminium smelting industry and the major atmospheric emissions were gaseous and particulate fluorides and sulfur dioxide. Analyses of vegetation distribution and condition were undertaken in order to establish whether the industrial activities at the three sites could be identified as the causes of changes in vegetation. A geographic information system (GIS) was implemented at each facility, to contain cadastral information as well as records of the physical environment and plant and animal species occurrences and condition, where appropriate. The GIS was used to create a surface of vegetation condition over the area of interest at the time of assessment and then over time to evaluate vegetation change and relationship to meteorological and production data. Baseline vegetation condition was established for each facility using large-scale high quality aerial photography and multi-spectral imagery. The photography for each site contained large amounts of latent information on vegetation distribution and condition. When properly rectified and geo-referenced, the images became accessible and open to manipulation within the GIS. At each of the three sites investigated, image classes were selected that provided appropriate detail for the vegetation type. In effect the image became a surrogate of the vegetation frozen in time and space. The ability to extract information on past vegetation condition was shown to be a very valuable asset providing the opportunity to generate new contemporaneous data to augment poor or lost historical data. The process was illustrated by developing vegetation change maps and trend information using past and current photography and limited historical field data. A verified emission model was applied to two of the facilities (Anglesea and Portland) to predict emission effects over the vegetated areas. These were used to evaluate current vegetation condition and change in terms of industrial challenge and other change agencies known or suspected. In each case, further developments of the model were required in order to achieve acceptable predictions of known atmospheric and air pollutant conditions. The investigations at Anglesea demonstrated the importance of fine-scale topographic description and meteorological modelling in order to reconcile modelled and observed environmental conditions in hilly coastal terrain. At Portland, the study revealed the importance of marine aerosols in the distribution and deposition of fluoride in the vicinity of the source. Within the broad framework of vegetation type and general condition at Anglesea and Portland, differences at the micro-scale of individual plants and clumps of plants were examined using multi-spectral imagery. Here differences in image characteristics that related to increased pigmentation and loss of chlorophyll in leaves and increased amounts of dead tissue on plants were evaluated. The change agents for the detected differences within sets and between sets of imagery were analysed and again shown to be mainly non-industrial. Only at Portland did atmospheric emissions from the aluminium smelter play a role at some locations, and then only because the effect was being reinforced by other factors (lack of burning and drought). At Portland, population data for associated fauna and an orchid were examined in relation to the baseline vegetation condition, vegetation change and industrial impact. The distribution and welfare of these species were shown to be generally dependent on vegetation condition and other non-industrial factors. If the vegetation overall was maintained in a condition of vigorous growth and structural diversity, it could be expected that specific dependant flora and fauna would thrive within it. The exception was the orchid, which was shown to be sensitive to emissions and could only thrive in its natural habitat in the vicinity of the smelter if protected by screening vegetation or nurtured by an intensive set of cultural practices that were developed as a result of this study.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300804 Environmental Impact Assessment</field><field name="subject">300800 Environmental Sciences</field><field name="subject">300801 Environmental Management and Rehabilitation</field><field name="subject">Alcoa</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158761</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Practising self-determination: Participation in planning and local governance in discrete indigenous settlements</field><field name="creator">Moran, Mark F.</field><field name="description">The principle and policy of self-determination holds that Aboriginal people should have the right to pursue a lifestyle of their choosing and to have control over their interactions with the wider society. Self-determination policy has been in place at a federal level since the 1970&#146;s, yet after thirty years of implementation, there is considerable disarray and disagreement over its merits. This study investigated the transactions of decision-makers as they practised two of the main policy instruments of self-determination: participatory planning and self-governance. The research settings were Mapoon and Kowanyama, two discrete Indigenous settlements on the West Coast of Cape York Peninsula, in the state of Queensland, northern Australia. Three typologies for settlements, planning, and organisations were established, which gave the context for the study, as well as a basis from which to generalise findings. From the types of planning in practice, a participatory plan at Mapoon was singled out for further study since it specifically recreated the language of self-determination. The Mapoon Plan was found to be successful technically, but it fell short of its stated social development goals. Planning proved to be a highly politicised and idealised activity, brokered by external consultants. The complex interplay among knowledge, ideology and politics, as observed, could not be described in terms of two separate domains, but rather in terms of intercultural production across an interethnic field. The anthropological literature tended to treat Aboriginal polities as cultural isolates, situated within administrative vacuums. To progress the study, it became necessary to apply a functional and administrative rationality to what needed to be done in practice. Twenty case studies of decision-making forums were analysed in the main research setting of Kowanyama. Each involved the contemporary practice of self-determination, as local decision-makers engaged with the wider society. In the majority of cases, all six proposed factors were found to be necessary, but not sufficient, for success: (1) participation, (2) technical expertise, (3) negotiation, (4) institutional capacity, (5) focal driver, and (6) jurisdictional devolution. A typology of actors was established to define the different decision-makers involved. Of the 600 adults in Kowanyama, only 30 were found to be actively involved in decision-making. This was unexpectedly low given the quantity of government activity purporting to further Kowanyama&#146;s self-determination. Six determinants were found to influence the level of participation: efficacy in practice, jurisdictional devolution, representativeness, function, informality, language and motivation. In particular, form followed function, whereby the function of a decision-making forum decided the level of participation that was appropriate. Contrary to accounts in the anthropological literature, the study found a fledgling system of representation in Kowanyama, complete with informal &#145;extra-constitutional&#146; checks and balances. Factions were a powerful aspect of Kowanyama society, but they did not monopolise politics. The local polity was better conceptualised in terms of its political pluralism, encompassing a complex array of balancing and competing interests. Significantly, constituents were beginning to exert local political influence over their leaders. The analysis found that notions of &#145;community control,&#146; as promulgated in the community development literature, were not adequate to explain the intercultural production underway. The full spectrum of participation was relevant to the actors of governance, from political activism to ambivalent apathy. Community control was found in the absence of government interventions, imbedded within informal institutions and cultural norms. Yet, introduced political structures, including Councils, were no less a part of the local political arena. The notion of governance better encapsulated the array of decision-making activities and actors occurring across a broad range of institutional positions. The study documented multiple dilemmas and indeterminacies as actors practised self-determination in the interethnic field, especially the interplay between local and external ideologies and knowledge. All of the examples of political innovation in the contemporary history of governance in Kowanyama involved productive social contexts developing locally between leaders and trusted outsiders. The complexity of problems and their solutions were only revealed through practice, one step at a time. Successful initiatives in Kowanyama were to a degree inadvertent; it was not until the end that actors understood what they had done right or wrong. Significantly, political innovation occurred in practice, often without any active intervention by government. Ironically, one of the greatest obstacles limiting local capacity was the size of the task of administering the programs of self-determination. An accepted role for leaders and employees was radical action to manipulate the system and to create the institutional space to permit the subjects of self-determination to participate. The analysis suggested that the importance assigned to government policy, legislation, and structure has fallen out of balance with their actual practice. Rather than fixating on policy solutions to self-determination, policy-makers should be focusing more on creating an enabling framework for practice. The six success factors proven in the study give the basis for such a framework.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310101 Architecture</field><field name="subject">780107 Studies in human society</field><field name="subject">governance</field><field name="subject">participatory planning</field><field name="subject">indigenous settlements</field><field name="subject">community development</field><field name="subject">Mapoon</field><field name="subject">Kowanyama</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158053</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Political Economy of the Music Industry: Technological Change and the Political Control of Music</field><field name="creator">Cvetkovski, Trajce</field><field name="description">The task undertaken in this dissertation is to determine the extent of the challenge facing the major firms (majors) who currently control over 80% of global sound carrier and publishing revenue in the popular (pop) music industry. The aim of this thesis is to explain the disorganising effects currently being experienced. Specifically, the central question guiding this thesis asks: what will be the effect of new technologies on the future organisation of the music industry? I focus broadly on recent universally accessible digital technologies which have raised questions about the future of the industry&#146;s current organisational structure and processes both in terms of input (creation of music products in their commodified form) and output (access and consumption of music products). The industry&#146;s processes are highly integrated and its business model is complex because it centres around the sophisticated management and aggressive appropriation of intellectual property (namely copyright) for repeated exploitation for decades after its initial acquisition. The purpose of this research, therefore, is to examine not only the tangible aspects of the manner in which the industry&#146;s organises its products but also the intangible dimension. Significant recent changes experienced by the industry are identified. The literature is not conclusive in terms of explaining these developments. While existing research exists on recent developments, a comprehensive analysis of the organisation of the industry both in terms of input and output remains underdeveloped in the literature. In particular, in relation to product re-organisation and consumer behaviour, copyright development and corporate restructuring, the literature is not fully developed. Current research is focused on illegitimate technological attacks &#150; namely digital piracy. However these do not adequately or comprehensively explain current disorganisation in the industry. This dissertation remedies this deficiency by proposing four separate but interconnected factors are affecting the highly concentrated status quo. Together, the positive and negative impacts of emerging technologies have created a serious dilemma in terms of product commodification for the controllers of the industry. I argue interconnected illegitimate and legitimate technological challenges are at play suggesting re-organisation is occurring multidimensionally. The research undertaken is empirically grounded, and though primarily based on qualitative data (and subsequent quantitative data for statistical corroboration), the current work has implications for understanding the industry&#146;s methods. Together, these approaches form the basis of the dissertation&#146;s methodology. The research reported in this dissertation attempts to determine to what extent the use and consumption of these different technologies can be regarded as the primary catalyst for the challenge to corporate control of the music industry, and the manner in which it is structured. If the dominant few intend to identify and rationalise challenges in terms of their corporate model, then they must understand the dynamic nature of interacting technologies.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">popular music</field><field name="subject">copyright</field><field name="subject">internet</field><field name="subject">technology</field><field name="subject">creative industries</field><field name="subject">MP3</field><field name="subject">pop culture</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158010</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Implications of Adult Attachment Theory for Chronic Pain</field><field name="creator">Meredith, Pamela Joy</field><field name="description">This thesis presents empirical evidence supporting the relevance of adult attachment theory in understanding the chronic pain experience. The thesis arose from the recognition that, although pain-related psychosocial variables have been used to differentiate subgroups of individuals in chronic pain, little is known about the developmental origins or cognitive, behavioural, or affective correlates of these subgroups. Attachment theory offers a development framework, which is of potential value in guiding early pain intervention and prevention efforts, as well as tailoring interventions to suit specific patient needs. In order to investigate the value of applying adult attachment theory to the chronic pain field, five central research questions were identified: 1) Does insecure attachment contribute to a more negative experience of acute pain for those not diagnosed with a chronic pain condition? That is, does the association between insecure attachment and maladaptive pain-related variables precede the onset of chronic pain)? 2) How do the subgroups of adult attachment, identified in a chronic pain sample, compare to the clusters identified by pain-related psychosocial measures in the same sample? 3) Are the documented associations between attachment and psychosocial variables (i.e., cognitive appraisals, self-efficacy, coping, social support) evident in the context of chronic pain? 4) Do attachment variables moderate the associations between these psychosocial variables and painrelated variables?, and 5) What is the association between adult attachment variables and outcomes from chronic pain rehabilitation programs? To address the first question, an experimental study was designed to explore the perceptions, emotions and coping patterns of 58 pain-free individuals exposed to an acute (coldpressor) pain experience. Findings revealed that higher levels of anxiety over relationships were associated with lower pain thresholds, more stress, depression and anxiety, diminished perceptions of control over pain, and diminished ability to decrease pain. More secure attachment, on the other hand, was associated with greater perceptions of control over pain, and lower levels of depression and catastrophizing. In order to explore research questions 2-5, data from two clinical samples were collected on the first and last days of participation in one of two chronic pain rehabilitation programs (program length varied from two to three weeks). A total of 152 participants completed questionnaires before treatment, with 100 of these participants also completing questionnaires after treatment. Participants were aged between 18 and 82 years (M = 38.8, SD = 12.4), and had been in pain for an average of 3.7 years (SD = 6.9). Approximately 41% of participants were women, and 58% were men (gender for one participant was unknown). In order to address question two regarding the similarity between adult attachment subgroups and pain clusters based on a psychosocial pain measure (Multidimensional Pain Inventory, MPI), pre-treatment data were analyzed. The clustering approach using the MPI, known as Multiaxial Assessment of Pain (MAP), identifies three subgroups of individuals, labeled interpersonally distressed, dysfunctional, and adaptive copers. These clusters were compared with the four subgroups and two dimensions obtained with adult attachment measures. Results revealed that the interpersonally distressed MAP subgroup was associated with fearful attachment, while the dysfunctional MAP subgroup was linked with avoidant (low comfort) attachment. The comfort attachment dimension was associated with more adaptive MPI variables, while the anxious attachment dimension was linked with more maladaptive MPI variables. Consideration of research questions three to five prompted development of an integrative model, the Attachment-Diathesis Model of Chronic Pain (ADMCP), which provided a framework for exploring the psychosocial mechanisms linking attachment security with the outcome variables of perceived pain intensity, disability, and treatment outcomes. Based on predictions emerging from this model, a set of five studies explored pre-treatment associations between adult attachment variables, six psychosocial mechanisms (pain appraisal, depression, pain self-efficacy, anxiety, perceptions of social support, and coping), and outcome variables pre-treatment. One further paper was devoted to implications of adult attachment for treatment outcome. In general, findings from these studies revealed that variables representing attachment insecurity were significantly associated with more maladaptive coping, cognitive, affective and interpersonal characteristics, both before and after treatment, compared to variables reflecting secure attachment. Overall, both securely and insecurely attached individuals made progress in response to pain rehabilitation. Finally, a summary of the evidence of associations between attachment variables, psychosocial mechanisms, and treatment outcomes revealed by this research is presented, permitting discussion regarding the explanatory value of the ADMCP and clinical implications. Limitations to the present research, including family-wise error, the use of self-report measures, and the self-selecting nature of the sample, are discussed, and directions for further research are proposed. The evidence presented in this thesis advances our understanding of the developmental origins of chronic pain conditions, and provides a lens through which to view the heterogeneity of people with chronic pain. Overall, this project highlights the value of applying adult attachment principles to this field. It is anticipated that findings will assist in the development of a more differentiated range of treatment approaches for the individuals who experience chronic pain. In addition, the findings of this project may have important implications for prevention and early intervention of these conditions.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158257</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study on diffusion and flow of sub-critical hydrocarbons in activated carbon</field><field name="creator">BAE, Jun-Seok</field><field name="description">This thesis deals with diffusion and flow of sub-critical hydrocarbons in activated carbon by using a differential permeation method. The hydrocarbons are selected according to the effect on environmental concerns and their unique characteristics such as polarity and affinity towards activated carbon. Although it has been known that transport processes in activated carbon consist of Knudsen diffusion, gaseous viscous flow, adsorbed phase diffusion (so called, surface diffusion) and condensate flow, there have been no rigorous models to describe the transport processes in activated carbon with a full range of pressures. In particular among the four processes, the mechanism of adsorbed phase diffusion in activated carbon is still far from complete understanding. Also due to the dispersion interactions between adsorbing molecules and the solid surface, one would expect that Knudsen diffusion is influenced by the dispersive forces. From intensive experimental observations with a great care over a full range of pressures, conventional methods (for example, direct estimation from inert gas experiments) to determine adsorbed phase diffusion are found to be inadequate for strongly adsorbing vapors in activated carbon. By incorporating the effect of adsorbate-adsorbent interactions into Knudsen diffusivity, the general behavior of adsorbed phase diffusion in terms of pressure (or surface loading) can be obtained, showing a significant role in transport at low pressures. For non-polar hydrocarbons such as benzene, carbon tetrachloride and n-hexane, a mathematical model, which accounts for the effects of adsorbate-adsorbent interactions and pore size distribution, is formulated and validated, resulting in a good agreement with experimental data. Moreover, the adsorption and dynamic behaviors of alcohol molecules (which are polar compounds) are investigated with an aim to compare their behaviors against those of non-polar compounds.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">670700 Industrial Chemicals and Related Products</field><field name="subject">surface diffusion</field><field name="subject">hydrocarbons</field><field name="subject">activated carbon</field><field name="subject">transport phenomena</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157965</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Entanglement, geometry and quantum computation</field><field name="creator">Dowling, Mark</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses a number of problems within the emerging field of quantum information science. Quantum information science can be said to encompass the more-established disciplines of quantum computation and quantum information, as well as rather more recent attempts to apply concepts, tools and techniques from these disciplines to gain greater understanding of quantum systems in general. The role of entanglement &#151; non-classical correlation &#151; has been of particular interest to date. Part I contributes to this later goal. In particular, we establish a connection between the energy of a many-body quantum system and the idea of an entanglement witness from the theory of mixed-state entanglement. This connection allows mathematical results about entanglement witnesses to be translated into physical results about many-body quantum systems, specifically energy and temperature thresholds for entanglement. For the case of two qubits we are able to establish fairly detailed results about the behaviour of entanglement with temperature. We also study entanglement in systems of indistinguishable particles, where even the question of which quantum states should be regarded as entangled has been the subject of much controversy. We aim to clarify this issue by applying Wiseman and Vaccaro&#146;s notion of entanglement of particles to a number of wellunderstood model systems. We discuss the advantages of the entanglement of particles approach compared with other methods in common use. Finally, we study the operational meaning of superselection rules in quantum physics, in particular the connection to the existence or not of an appropriate reference frame. We propose an experiment that aims to exhibit a coherent superposition of an atom and a molecule, apparently in violation of the commonly-accepted particle-number superselection rule. This result sheds light on the entanglement of particles approach to entanglement of indistinguishable particles. Part II returns to a fundamental question at the heart of quantum computation and quantum information, namely: how many quantum gates are required to perform a particular quantum computation? In other words, how efficiently can a quantum computer solve a particular computational problem? We establish a connection between this question and the field of Riemannian geometry. Intuitively, optimal quantum circuits correspond to &#147;free-falling&#148; along the shortest path between two points in a curved space. This opens up the possibility of using Riemannian geometry to study quantum computation, a possibility that was previously unknown. We provide explicit calculations of all the basic geometric quantities associated with the space, and give some preliminary results of applying geometric ideas to quantum computing. Finally, we explore more generally the connection between optimal control and quantum circuit complexity, of which the Riemannian metric described above can be viewed as a special case.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">240301 Atomic and Molecular Physics</field><field name="subject">780102 Physical sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158661</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sensory processing and classroom emotional, behavioural and educational outcomes in children with autism spectrum disorder</field><field name="creator">Ashburner, Jill</field><field name="description">Many occupational therapists recommend adaptations to school tasks and classroom environments to accommodate the atypical sensory processing of students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), on the assumption that sensory processing impacts on classroom emotional, behavioural and educational outcomes. The purpose of this study was to explore the rationale underpinning this practice. Specifically, the first aim was to determine whether or not children with ASD differ significantly from typically developing children with regard to sensory processing. The second aim was to provide descriptive information about the nature and prevalence of atypical sensory processing in children with ASD. The third aim was to explore associations between the sensory processing patterns and classroom emotional, behavioural and educational outcomes in children with ASD and typically developing children. This study employed a matched case-control design. To control for differences in teaching styles, classroom environments and educational programs, two typically developing children were selected as controls from each of the classes of thirty students with ASD aged between 6 and 10 years. Twenty-eight children with ASD and fifty-one age- and gender-matched typically developing children were included in the final analysis. The children were all included in mainstream classrooms and were screened using the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test to ensure that their estimated IQ was within the average range. Sensory processing was measured using the Short Sensory Profile. Other independent variables that may have impacted on classroom emotional, behavioural and educational outcomes included symptoms of ASD, IQ and classroom environmental factors. Symptoms of ASD were measured using the Gilliam Asperger Disorder Scale and Gilliam Autism Rating Scale. The Kaufmann Brief Intelligence Test was used as an estimate of IQ, as well as for screening purposes. The investigator recorded observations of the sensory aspects of each classroom environment, including estimates of visual clutter, crowding and background noise. The dependent variables, which included classroom emotional regulation, behaviour regulation (e.g., compliance, attention and social behaviours) and educational outcomes, were measured using two teacher questionnaires: the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment Teacher Report Form and the Conners&#146; Teacher Report Form Revised &#150; Long Form. No significant differences were found between the two groups with respect to IQ or age in months, suggesting that the two groups were well matched. Observations of the classroom environments revealed high levels of background noise, visual clutter and unpredictable tactile input. The majority of the typically developing children achieved scores at or near ceiling level on both the measures of classroom emotional and behavioural outcomes and sensory processing. This suggested that most of these children processed sensory input in a typical way and were coping well with the emotional, behavioural and academic demands of school. No significant relationships were found between the measures of sensory processing and classroom emotional, behavioural and educational outcomes in the typically developing children. The teachers rated the children with ASD as demonstrating significantly more difficulties with attention, emotional and behaviour regulation and social skills and significantly poorer academic performance than the controls. The Short Sensory Profile scores suggested a high prevalence of atypical sensory processing in the children with ASD. There were highly significant group differences on all of the Short Sensory Profile scores (p &gt; .001), with the exception of the Short Sensory Profile score: Movement Sensitivity (p = .016). Multiple regression analysis suggested that the Short Sensory Profile scores: Under-responsive/Seeks Sensation and Auditory Filtering accounted for 47% of the variance in academic performance as measured by the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment Teacher Report Form. As estimated intelligence and autistic symptoms were not predictors in this multiple regression model, these specific sensory processing difficulties appeared to contribute significantly to academic underachievement. The Short Sensory Profile Score: Auditory Filtering was also associated with inattention as measured by the Conners&#146; Teacher Report Form. An association between Short Sensory Profile Score: Auditory Filtering and social problems as measured by the Conners&#146; Teacher Report Form approached significance (p = .019). Auditory filtering difficulties therefore appeared to be highly problematic for the children with ASD and likely to be exacerbated by high levels of background noise in classrooms. Multiple regression analysis suggested that the Short Sensory Profile scores for Tactile Sensitivity and Auditory Filtering accounted for 36% of the variance in the score for Conners&#146; Teacher Report Form score for inattention. The Short Sensory Profile score for Tactile Sensitivity accounted for 22% of the variance in a Conners&#146; Teacher Report Form measure of the combined symptoms of ADHD (including inattention and hyperactivity). The Short Sensory Profile score: Movement Sensitivity accounted for 22% in the Conners&#146; Teacher Report Form score for oppositional behaviours. An association between Short Sensory Profile Score: Tactile Sensitivity and oppositional behaviours as measured by the Conners&#146; Teacher Report Form approached significance (p = .015). As atypical sensory processing was found to be associated with difficulties in learning, attention and behaviour regulation at school, sensory processing may need to be considered in the planning of educational programs for students with ASD. The development of effective strategies to accommodate the atypical sensory processing of these students is a priority.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158222</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Selective transport of attached particles across the froth phase</field><field name="creator">Seaman, David Richard</field><field name="description">Over many years, researchers in the field of flotation have developed an in-depth understanding of processes occurring in the pulp phase of flotation machines. Until recently, however, the froth phase has received little attention. The froth phase serves to separate bubble-particle aggregates from suspended slurry in a flotation cell. The mechanism of recovery by entrainment, its relationship to water recovery and particle size dependency is well understood. Froth recovery, (the fraction of particles entering the concentrate launder that entered the froth phase attached to air bubbles), is not well understood. Up until now, there has been doubt over whether this property is dependent on particle size and hydrophobicity. Difficulties in measuring froth recovery had previously prevented researchers from gaining a deeper understanding of the transport of attached particles across the froth phase. A novel device was designed and tested to measure froth recovery by isolating bubble-particle aggregates in the pulp-phase of flotation machines through the determination of the bubble loading in the pulp phase (mass of particles attached per unit volume of air bubbles). This technique can be used with other measurements to investigate froth selectivity by directly comparing these captured particles to those found in the froth phase. Evidence was collected at Red Dog Mine, Alaska and Newmont Golden Grove Operations, Western Australia which showed that the froth phase selectively transported more hydrophobic and smaller sized particles across the froth than less hydrophobic and larger particles. Particles collected in the device were compared to those found in the concentrate stream on a size by mineral by liberation class. Froth recovery was also calculated on a size by mineral by liberation class for two valuable sulphide minerals in a continuous 3m&#179; flotation cell. These results show that the froth phase is responsible for the upgrading of attached particles across the froth phase as well as for the separation of bubble-particle aggregates from suspended slurry. The pulp phase is responsible for creating bubble-particle aggregates through the attachment of hdyrophobic mineral particles to air bubbles. Many complex factors affect the extent to which this occurs including the size and hdyrophobicity of the particles, the size and number of air bubbles produced by the flotation machine, the rate of collisions between particles and bubbles and the overall chemistry of the system. This measurement of bubble loading presents an opportunity to measure the impact of all these factors on the successful creation of bubble-particle aggregates. Based on a literature review suggesting that there was a high probability of particles being detached at the pulp-froth interface due to the aggregates change in momentum, a three phase description of a flotation cell was proposed. The three phases were: pulp, pulp-froth interface and upper froth zones. A second froth recovery measurement technique (changing froth depth) was used in combination with the bubble load technique to determine the recovery across each of the two froth zones. It was found that the pulp-froth interface appears to be responsible for the selectivity observed across the froth phase as a whole. These findings will enable more in-depth research into the sub-process of the froth phase as well as assisting flotation cell design through a better understanding of the roles of the pulp-froth interface and the upper froth region.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">290702 Mineral Processing</field><field name="subject">640300 First Stage Treatment of Ores and Minerals</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158293</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Parenting and family support in primary care setting</field><field name="creator">Turner, Karen Mary Thomas</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a program of research evaluating the implementation of a primary care intervention program for disruptive child behaviour, and the process of dissemination of the intervention to primary care staff. The specific aims were to: 1) evaluate the effectiveness and acceptability of a brief, preventive behavioural family intervention (BFI) administered by primary care staff in improving parenting skills and confidence and reducing targeted child behaviour problems; 2) assess the process of disseminating the intervention to primary care professionals by evaluating aids and obstacles for program implementation in the workplace; and 3) provide recommendations for future dissemination of psychological interventions. Childhood disruptive behaviour problems are becoming increasingly prevalent and are associated with significant personal and societal costs. Much is now known about the development of such problems, including individual, family and social risk and protective factors. There is considerable evidence that BFI programs are effective in reducing child behaviour problems and the family risk factors associated with the development and maintenance of these problems. Unfortunately, many evaluated programs have not been disseminated effectively, and have primarily been provided to clinical or high-risk populations in efficacy trials. Primary care settings have been increasingly identified as ideal settings for detection and early intervention for child mental health problems. However, there is limited research in the area of primary care BFI. While dissemination of psychological innovation to psychologists has historically been poor, with little impact on the professional practices of practitioners in the field, documentation of dissemination of these interventions to non-psychologists is rare. Although dissemination and diffusion theory have expanded, there is little controlled research evaluating the necessary or optimal conditions for the adoption and ongoing implementation of evidence-based programs. To address the problem of poor dissemination and limited access to evidence-based parenting programs in the community, a multilevel parenting and family support initiative, the Triple P-Positive Parenting Program, has been developed at the University of Queensland. One level of this system, Primary Care Triple P, encompasses a preventively oriented, early intervention program that aims to promote positive, caring relationships between parents and their children and to help parents develop effective management strategies for a variety of common behavioural and developmental issues. This primary care intervention was trialled and disseminated in the current research. Study 1 examined the effectiveness of Primary Care Triple P implemented by child health nurses with clients requesting help for child behaviour problems. A randomised group methodology was employed, comparing the intervention with a waitlist control condition. Assessments were completed at pre, post and 6-month follow-up. Data are presented for 26 families. In comparison to the waitlist condition, families receiving the intervention showed a significant reduction in targeted child behaviour problem/s according to monitoring and mother-report. Mothers receiving the intervention also reported significantly reduced dysfunctional parenting practices, greater satisfaction with their parenting role, and decreased anxiety and stress following the intervention in comparison to waitlist mothers. No group differences were found for observed parent-child interaction. However, rates of observed disruptive child behaviour and aversive parent behaviour were low from the outset. Consumer satisfaction with the program was high, and intervention gains were primarily maintained at 6-month follow-up. These results provide some of the first effectiveness outcomes from a randomised controlled trial of BFI in a primary care setting, and establish the effectiveness and acceptability of Primary Care Triple P conducted by child health nurses as part of usual practice. Study 2 examined the implementation of Primary Care Triple P following professional training in the program. Results of a survey of 1078 professionals are presented. A model of the personal, program, training and workplace factors influencing program implementation was tested. Structured equation modelling confirmed that practitioner self-efficacy mediated the relationship between program characteristics and program implementation. Prior professional experience and satisfaction with training did not predict self-efficacy or uptake. Workplace support was also directly associated with program implementation. These results advance our knowledge of the aids and obstacles faced by practitioners in implementing a new program in the workplace. This research provides important new knowledge in relation to improving early access to empirically-supported intervention services and has implications for the potential scope of service delivery in primary care settings. It also advances our understanding of the factors influencing a professional&#146;s ability to implement a new intervention program following training. This information may inform the development of future dissemination efforts, allowing them to address necessary program, personal and workplace supports, and optimise program implementation following training.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">380107 Health, Clinical and Counselling Psychology</field><field name="subject">730204 Child health</field><field name="subject">child behaviour problems</field><field name="subject">parenting</field><field name="subject">behavioural family intervention</field><field name="subject">primary care</field><field name="subject">dissemination</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158046</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An examination of how John Wesley's theological methodology functions in pastoral practice, illustrated by his doctrine of Christian perfection</field><field name="creator">McEwan, David Bernard</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the theological methodology of John Wesley as he used it in pastoral practice. The study is situated primarily in the area of the history of Christian thought and is located in the area of modern Enlightenment Studies. Wesley&#146;s role as a pastoral theologian is established and his theological methodology uncovered from the perspective of his holistic vision of the God-human relationship being centred in love. This lays the foundation for an examination of his theological sources and tools derived from his extensive writings. Their interaction is explored through an examination of the doctrine and practice of Christian perfection as Wesley offered pastoral guidance to the people called Methodists. There is extensive debate within Methodist circles (particularly in North America) regarding the conception and utility of Wesley&#146;s theological method. Albert C. Outler was the key scholar who identified the components of the Wesleyan quadrilateral (Scripture, reason, tradition and experience) and proposed it as a unique and fruitful conception, with invaluable application for the Methodist movement today. Outler&#146;s claims have been much debated and in many quarters rejected, though his basic understanding remains well-established within influential sections of the church. This thesis is an examination of Wesley&#146;s writings in the light of the current debate to see if a more productive model can be established that will have greater resonance in a postmodern setting. After an overview of the scholarly debate on Wesley&#146;s location and theological method in the eighteenth century, the major focus is Wesley&#146;s own extensive writings over the course of his ministry. This is examined in three periods: 1725-39, 1740-69 and 1770-91. The study seeks to discover for each period his conception of the God-human relationship and what this implies for his theological method. The sources and tools Wesley utilised are then identified, before attention is turned to an examination of Christian perfection as a doctrine and its application in pastoral practice. The study has found that the common assessment of Wesley as a pastoral theologian is correct and this has implications for his approach to theologising. Wesley viewed the core characteristic of God&#146;s nature as love and the God-human relationship is to be defined by the qualities of trust and passion, rather than an intellectual comprehension of propositional truths about God. In his theological method Scripture, reason, community ethos and Christian experience are utilised in an interconnected dynamic network, energised by the presence of the Holy Spirit. God is clearly the sole theological authority and the components of the system are the means he uses for communication. This analysis emphasises the fundamental nature of Christianity as a relationship of love, based on trust rather than an intellectual comprehension of doctrine; it is essentially a matter of the heart rather than the head. Accordingly, pastoral theology is much more important than academic, systematic theology for Christian experience and spiritual formation. Theological method must be shaped by this understanding, and so personal knowledge is always to be valued over intellectual propositions; Christian belief concerns the encounter with God as a Person rather than the mastery of a comprehensive system of doctrines. Critical to this process is the ethos of the community, which is the intimate blending of all the elements under the guidance of the Spirit. This makes Christian experience, rather than merely life experience, of vital importance. Because love and relationships are not reducible to mechanical systems that are merely intellectually comprehended, there is an element of mystery that remains. There is a difference in the way that the Spirit utilises the means when working with the doctrinal substance and the experiential circumstance of Christian perfection. The Modernist approach that is focused on dissection and analysis results in the loss of this holistic, dynamic system and its reduction to either pure subjectivism or rationalism. Wesley&#146;s theological method is much closer to the pre-Modern approach that has been prevalent for most of history and more in harmony with much of the present developments in postmodern thought.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158126</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Critical Sets in Latin Squares and Associated Structures</field><field name="creator">Bean, Richard Winston</field><field name="description">A critical set in a Latin square of order n is a set of entries in an n&#215;n array which can be embedded in precisely one Latin square of order n, with the property that if any entry of the critical set is deleted, the remaining set can be embedded in more than one Latin square of order n. The number of critical sets grows super-exponentially as the order of the Latin square increases. It is difficult to find patterns in Latin squares of small order (order 5 or less) which can be generalised in the process of creating new theorems. Thus, I have written many algorithms to find critical sets with various properties in Latin squares of order greater than 5, and to deal with other related structures. Some algorithms used in the body of the thesis are presented in Chapter 3; results which arise from the computational studies and observations of the patterns and subsequent results are presented in Chapters 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8. The cardinality of the largest critical set in any Latin square of order n is denoted by lcs(n). In 1978 Curran and van Rees proved that lcs(n)&lt;=n&#178;-n. In Chapter 4, it is shown that lcs(n)&lt;=n&#178;-3n+3. Chapter 5 provides new bounds on the maximum number of intercalates in Latin squares of orders m&#215;2^&#945; (m odd, &#945;&gt;=2) and m&#215;2^&#945;+1 (m odd, &#945;&gt;=2 and &#945;&#8800;3), and a new lower bound on lcs(4m). It also discusses critical sets in intercalate-rich Latin squares of orders 11 and 14. In Chapter 6 a construction is given which verifies the existence of a critical set of size n&#178;&#247; 4 + 1 when n is even and n&gt;=6. The construction is based on the discovery of a critical set of size 17 for a Latin square of order 8. In Chapter 7 the representation of Steiner trades of volume less than or equal to nine is examined. Computational results are used to identify those trades for which the associated partial Latin square can be decomposed into six disjoint Latin interchanges. Chapter 8 focusses on critical sets in Latin squares of order at most six and extensive computational routines are used to identify all the critical sets of different sizes in these Latin squares.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">280401 Analysis of Algorithms and Complexity</field><field name="subject">230101 Mathematical Logic, Set Theory, Lattices And Combinatorics</field><field name="subject">280405 Discrete Mathematics</field><field name="subject">780101 Mathematical sciences</field><field name="subject">Latin interchanges</field><field name="subject">intercalates</field><field name="subject">combinatorics</field><field name="subject">Steiner trades</field><field name="subject">Steiner triple systems</field><field name="subject">algorithms</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157877</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using group learning to promote deep learning, life skills and integration in veterinary science</field><field name="creator">Mills, Paul Christian</field><field name="description">A research-based model of Group Project Work was introduced to encourage deep learning in second-year students enrolled in the School of Veterinary Science (SVS) at The University of Queensland (UQ). The model was developed in response to the concern that students may avoid deep learning strategies in pre-clinical courses of the program particularly if there is little perceived relevance to their chosen career as a veterinary surgeon. The impetus for the development and introduction of Group Project Work was provided by concerns that students may be using superficial learning techniques due to the heavy content and perceived lack of relevance of pre-clinical courses. This was exemplified in the secondyear course, Musculoskeletal Structure and Function, where knowledge taught by traditional approaches did not appear to be satisfactorily retained in later courses of pathology and surgery. It was also apparent that students tended to form small groups to facilitate understanding. However, the traditional approach to structured group learning in medicallyorientated programs involved Problem-Based Learning (PBL) which required substantial resources and presented some concerns about the way students learned and were supported in solving problems. As a result of these concerns, a search of the literature on group learning was conducted. During this research, it was also realised that interactions between students undertaking group learning could engender the development of life skills, such as decision making, teamwork, problem solving and communication skills. These skills have traditionally been considered difficult to 'teach' yet appear to be essential to the successful transition to professional life. The specific structure and formation of groups towards the model of Group Project Work was therefore developed to maximise the group dynamics that would encourage life skills in individual group members. It was understood that group learning was not a novel concept but the specifics of the model, particularly group size and selection of group members, were critical to its success in terms of deep learning and the development of life skills. The small group size of four to five students was substantially lower than PBL groups commonly used in veterinary curricula. More importantly, engineering of group membership based on previous achievement exposed students to differing viewpoints and motivation and, importantly, removed the comfort zone of familiar peer support. This approach was analogous to initial entry into clinical practice and had also been shown to maximise group dynamics. Based on the literature, a model of Group Project Work was developed. An important aspect of model development was to therefore link course content to 'real life' aspects of veterinary clinical practice, which will drive motivation and learning. The model was also developed within the constraints of large class sizes and limited resources in terms of staff and facilities. A highly successful outcome was the integration of students within each cohort, particularly international students. The resultant collegiate atmosphere appeared to support students within each year and motivate appropriate learning strategies. Several iterations of the model have now been implemented with considerable success. Reflections on the learning from this experience have led to enhanced professional knowledge on the application of group work in large veterinary science cohorts and outcomes have been shared with the wider professional community through conference presentations and a number of publications in educational journals. This thesis begins by describing the context of Group Project Work and the concerns that provided the catalyst for this project. A review of the literature consulted then explains the basis of the model that was developed and supports the key features incorporated.

A randomized controlled trial (RCT) will furnish the highest level of evidence regarding the efficacy of a given intervention, but the immaturity of this area of research means that, currently, an RCT is not an appropriate research design. Therefore the purpose of the program of research presented in this thesis was to strategically contribute to the evidence base required to justify the conduct of a well designed RCT of an intervention promoting physical activity for people with ABI. By increasing participation in free-living, moderate intensity walking, people with ABI may reduce the oxygen cost of walking, thereby improving everyday functioning. The first study (presented in Chapter 3) evaluated a novel over-ground walking protocol in which a third party assists participants with ABI to reproduce previously self-selected comfortable and brisk walking speeds. Such a protocol could be used in conjunction with a portable indirect calorimetry to evaluate changes in oxygen cost of self-selected walking speeds over time. Thirteen people with ABI and related gait pattern impairment (age 31 + 8 yrs) completed two familiarization and two testing sessions. The first testing session used a self-paced (SP) protocol in which participants walked for 6 minutes at two self-selected speeds &#150; comfortable and brisk paces. The second, conducted one week later, used an externally-paced (EP) protocol in which participants were instructed to walk at the pace indicated by the test administrator, who verbally and visually guided the participant to walk at their previous self-selected comfortable and brisk paces. In each testing session participants wore a portable indirect calorimeter (Cosmed K4b2). Measures obtained were oxygen cost of walking (l.min-1) and distance walked (m). Analysis demonstrated that the EP protocol reproduced distances walked at comfortable and brisk speeds with a high degree of accuracy and that agreement between measures of oxygen cost obtained during the SP and EP protocols were acceptable. Steady-state oxygen uptake is characteristic of a constant workload and was elicited during both EP walking trials, indicating that walking speeds were constant throughout the walk trials. It was concluded that the EP protocol described is a valid means of assisting people with ABI to reproduce overground walking speeds and that the protocol would be useful for evaluating changes in the oxygen cost of those walking speeds that may occur over the course of an intervention. The purpose of the second study (presented in Chapter 4) was to evaluate the validity of a uniaxial accelerometer (MTI Actigraph) for measuring physical activity in people with acquired brain injury (ABI) using portable indirect calorimetry (Cosmed K4b2) as a criterion measure. Fourteen people with ABI and related gait pattern impairment (age 32 + 8 years), wore an MTI Actigraph that measured activity (counts.min-1) and a Cosmed K4b2 that measured oxygen consumption (ml.kg-1.min-1) during four activities &#150; quiet sitting (QS), comfortable paced (CP), brisk paced (BP) and fast paced (FP) walking. MET levels were predicted from Actigraph counts using a published equation and compared with Cosmed measures. Predicted METs for each of the 56 activity bouts (14 participants x four bouts) were classified (light, moderate, vigorous or very vigorous intensity) and compared with Cosmed-based classifications. Results indicated that Actigraph counts provide a valid index of activity across the intensities investigated in this study. For light to moderate activity, Actigraph-based estimates of METs are acceptable for group-level analysis and are a valid means of classifying activity intensity. The Actigraph significantly underestimated higher intensity activity although, in practice, this limitation will have minimal impact on activity measurement of most community-dwelling people with ABI as higher intensity activity is likely to be rare in this group. In the third study (presented in Chapter 5), 18 community-dwelling adults with acquired brain injury and a related gait pattern impairment (32.3 + 7.5 yrs) participated in an 8-week intervention promoting lifestyle physical activity. The aims were threefold: to evaluate the physical and psychosocial effects of the intervention; to assess whether the intervention increased the physical activity of participants; and to qualitatively evaluate the perceived effectiveness and acceptability of the intervention. Data were collected at six time points over 28 weeks: three pre-intervention, one each at 12 weeks prior (T1), 11 weeks prior (T2) and immediately pre-intervention (T3); and three post-intervention at immediately after (T4), four weeks after (T5) and eight weeks after (T6) the intervention. Physical outcomes measured were oxygen cost of comfortable and brisk-paced walking and maximum distance walked in three minutes. Psychosocial outcomes measured were SF-36, Depression Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS), Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES), Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) and the Barriers to Health Activities for Disabled Persons (BHADP). Physical activity was sampled 6 days at T3, T4 and T6 and two measures were obtained &#150; Actigraph counts per day and total minutes of activity greater than or equal to moderate intensity. Semi-structured interviews were used to evaluate the perceived effectiveness and acceptability of the intervention. The intervention comprised weekly, home-based, interactive problem-solving sessions designed to identify and overcome barriers to activity and to promote walking, together with facilitation of a community based leisure activity of the participant&#146;s choice. Results indicated that the intervention improved important aspects of physical and psychosocial health for community-dwelling people with ABI. Compared with mean baseline measures, improvements in oxygen cost of brisk walking and self-esteem occurred that were both clinically and statistically significant at T6 (p &lt; 0.01). Significant changes in two subscales of the SF-36 and the SWLS also occurred, although they were not sustained at T6. Measures of physical activity increased but not to an extent that was statistically significant. Qualitative data were principally positive, with 100% of participants and their significant others indicating they would recommend the program to another person with ABI. Given the particularly low levels of physical activity in the ABI population, and the correspondingly large individual and community benefits of that will be accrued if their physically active behavior can be increased, the promising results from this program of research indicate that there is a strong justification for allocating the resources necessary to conduct a sufficiently powered, randomized controlled trial of a lifestyle physical activity intervention for people with ABI.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321401 Exercise Physiology</field><field name="subject">750305 Ability and disability</field><field name="subject">disability</field><field name="subject">stroke</field><field name="subject">traumatic brain injury</field><field name="subject">walking</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158050</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Discovery of novel downstream target genes regulated by the hedgehog pathway</field><field name="creator">Ingram, Wendy Jill</field><field name="description">Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is a secreted morphogen involved in patterning a wide range of structures in the developing embryo. When cells receive the Shh signal a cascade of effects begin which in turn regulate downstream target genes. The genes controlled by Sonic hedgehog provide messages instructing cells how to differentiate or when to divide. Disruption of the hedgehog signalling cascade leads to a number of developmental disorders and plays a key role in the formation of a range of human cancers. Patched, the receptor for Shh, acts as a tumour suppressor and is mutated in naevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS). NBCCS patients display a susceptibility to tumour formation, particularly for basal cell carcinoma (BCC). The discovery of Patched mutations in sporadic BCCs and other tumour types further highlights the importance of this pathway to human cancer. The identification of genes regulated by hedgehog is crucial for understanding how disruption of this pathway leads to neoplastic transformation. It is assumed that the abnormal expression of such genes plays a large role in directing cells to divide at inappropriate times. Only a small number of genes controlled by Shh have been described in vertebrate tissues. In the work presented in this thesis a Sonic hedgehog responsive embryonic mouse cell line, C3H/10T1/2, was used as a model system for hedgehog target gene discovery. Known downstream target genes were profiled to determine their induction kinetics, building up a body of knowledge on the response to Shh for this cell type. During this work, it was discovered that C3H/10T1/2 cells do not become fully competent to respond to Shh stimulation until the cells reach a critical density, a factor that had to be taken into account when determining timepoints of interest for further investigation. Several techniques were employed to identify genes that show expression changes between Shh stimulated and control cells. In one of these techniques, RNA from cell cultures activated with Shh was used to interrogate cDNA microarrays, and this provided many insights into the downstream transcriptional consequences of hedgehog stimulation. Microarrays consist of thousands of spots of DNA of known sequence gridded onto glass slides. Experiments using this technology allow the expression level of thousands of genes to be measured simultaneously. Independent stimulation methods combined with northern blotting were used to investigate individual genes of interest, allowing genuine targets to be confirmed and false positives eliminated. This resulted in the identification of eleven target genes. Seven of these are induced by Sonic hedgehog (Thrombomodulin (Thbd), Glucocorticoid induced leucine zipper (Gilz), Brain factor 2 (Bf2), Nuclear receptor subfamily 4, group A, member 1 (Nr4a1), Insulin-like growth factor 2 (Igf2), Peripheral myelin protein 22 (Pmp22), Lim and SH3 Protein 1 (Lasp1)), and four are repressed (Secreted frizzled related proteins 1 and 2 (Sfrp1 and Sfrp2), Macrophage inflammatory protein-1 gamma (Mip-1?), and Anti-mullerian hormone (Amh)). The majority of these represent novel downstream genes not previously reported as targets of Shh. The new target genes have a diverse range of functions, and include transcriptional regulators and molecules known to be involved in regulating cell growth or apoptosis. The corroboration of genes previously implicated in hedgehog signalling, along with the finding of novel targets, demonstrates both the validity and power of the C3H/10T1/2 system for Shh target gene discovery. The identification of novel Sonic hedgehog responsive genes provides candidates whose abnormal expression may be decisive in initiating tumour formation and future studies will investigate their role in development and disease. It is expected that such findings will provide vital clues to the aetiology of various human cancers, and that an understanding of their roles may ultimately provide greater opportunities in the future design of anti-tumour therapies.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cancer</field><field name="subject">hedgehog</field><field name="subject">patched</field><field name="subject">sonic hedgehog</field><field name="subject">C3H/10T1/2</field><field name="subject">10T1/2</field><field name="subject">basal cell carcinoma</field><field name="subject">BCC</field><field name="subject">microarray</field><field name="subject">microarrays</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157937</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Froth recovery measurements in large industrial flotation cells</field><field name="creator">Alexander, Daniel John</field><field name="description">The role of mathematical models and simulators in describing the performance of mineral processing applications have had a large impact in optimising existing industrial plants and designing new plants over recent years. Before the development of sophisticated computer simulators, the design engineer used industrial &#8220;rules of thumb&#8221; to estimate the size and layout of plants. However, newly designed plants after commissioning, often do not meet the design product specification requirements and quite often years of &#8220;trial and error&#8221; optimisation is required. This process can be very costly especially with froth flotation processes where the complexity of the various stages of treatment makes &#8220;trial and error&#8221; optimisation very difficult to quantify and assess the benefits. Over the past 10 years, advances in the modelling of the flotation process have been conducted by many authors. The most significant flotation modelling advances in recent years have been provided by the AMIRA (Australian Mineral Industry Research Association) P9 project, whereby a new modelling methodology has been proposed. Within this methodology, the flotation response can be represented by a number of sub-processes including parameters describing the hydrodynamic, froth and ore characteristics. Although these parameters have been proposed, methods for measuring these parameters in large flotation cells are still developing, especially in the areas of the froth zone recovery and entrainment. In the light of this it was felt that the literature on froth recovery determination should be investigated to determine the most appropriate method for measuring froth recovery in large industrial flotation cells. It was found after the investigation of the literature that three techniques for measuring the froth recovery parameter stood out as potential methods for measurement within a large scale flotation cell. These were the methods decribed by Gorain et al (1998), Vera et al (1999) and Savassi et al (1997). It was decided that all three methods should be assessed on a quantitative and qualitative basis from data collected at the Mount Isa Mines (now Xstrata) Copper flotation circuit. In this assessment, all three methods were extensively trialed in a 2.8 m3 flotation cell which was operated in parallel to the main copper rougher flotation circuit. The cell could be operated at numerous operating conditions which allowed sufficient data to be collected. The conclusions from this work were that although the method proposed by Vera et al (1999) required significant amounts of data, the method appeared to be reliable in this scale of cell. The main recommendation from this work was to further test the Vera methodology in larger industrial flotation cells. A 100 m3 Outukumpu tank cell at the Mount Keith Nickel Concentrator was chosen for the further assessment of the Vera et al (1999) methodology and its applicability to large scale cells. This flotation cell was one of the largest flotation cells operating on a production scale at the time of the testwork. Numerous tests were conducted and data collected from this investigation showed that the Vera et al (1999) technique was applicable to this scale of flotation cell. Since the work at Mount Keith was conducted in a rougher flotation cell, it was decided to test the methodology with numerous cells of various sizes and duties at the Kambalda Nickel Concentrator. As with the previous investigation at Mount Keith, it was observed that the Vera method was able to measure froth recoveries in all cells measured at Kambalda (within typical operating ranges). However, the technique was not applicable at shallow froth depths since it does not take into account the effect of the pulp-froth interface within the froth recovery parameter estimation. The pulp froth interface and close to it is where a significant proportion of dropback occurs within the froth zone. In addition to this problem, the methodology required large numbers of samples and disturbed downstream processes which made the technique unpractical for operating industrial flotation plants. Hence, a new technique for measuring froth recovery in large flotation cells was required. For the technique to be successful on an industrial scale it required the following: &#8226; minimum disturbance on the process, &#8226; take into account the pulp froth interface within the froth recovery parameter, and &#8226; require a minimum amount of samples. To meet these needs a new technique was developed based on the Savassi et al (1997) technique and combining it with recent work by authors including Vera et al (2003). The methodology involves taking samples of the feed, concentrate and tail as per a typical flotation survey and combining them with two new samples: the air hold-up sample and the top of froth sample. With the addition of these samples, a mass balance across the pulp and froth phase could be conducted and the froth recovery parameter derived. In addition, the new method provided measurements of the pulp zone average bubble load and the amount recovered by the entrainment mechanism. The proposed method has a simple procedure which allows the technique to be used by academics and mill operators alike. The proposed froth recovery measurement technique was tested in numerous cells of various types (i.e. Wemco, Outokumpu, Dorr-Oliver etc), various sizes (up to 150 m3 in size), various duties (rougher, scavenger, cleaner, recleaner, etc) and various plants. In most cases the methodology proved to be a reliable measure of the froth recovery parameter. In addition, at the Century Zinc Operation, the methodology was compared directly with the original Vera et al (1999) technique and the results showed that there was a good comparison between the results with the off-set of the pulp-froth interface. A number of contributions to both the research and industrial areas have been provided from the outcomes of the thesis. The main contributions include: &#8226; A full assessment of the three current methods for measuring the froth recovery parameter within large flotation cells. With recommendations of developing a new technique. &#8226; The development of a froth recovery measurement technique which can be used in large cells to understand the impact of the froth zone in an individual cell, use within the AMIRA P9 modelling methodology and plant diagnostics. &#8226; The new method also allows the estimation of the average bubble load and quantifies the amount of material recovered by the entrainment mechanism which is invaluable to metallurgists in assessing the performance of a flotation circuit (plant diagnostics). Finally, the results of this thesis will provide practising metallurgists both within the research and operating fields, techniques to improve the profitability of flotation circuits worldwide. Metallurgists can quickly assess the performance of large flotation cells in terms of froth performance, bubble load and entrainment which has not been available before. In addition, the results from this thesis will also allow metallurgists to mathematically represent their plant through flotation models better and improve their understanding of their flotation circuits.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">091404 Mineral Processing/Beneficiation</field><field name="subject">840399 First Stage Treatment of Ores and Minerals not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158425</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of collaboration: a study of the influences of violinists on the violin repertoire of Sergei Prokofiev.</field><field name="creator">Maddick, Andrew Flannigan</field><field name="description">This critical commentary examines the process of composer-performer collaboration in the violin works of Sergei Prokofiev. It focuses on four of Prokofiev&#146;s major violin works: the Concerto no. 1 op. 19, Concerto no. 2 op. 63, Sonata no. 2 op. 94-bis, and Sonata no. 1 op. 80. In all these pieces Prokofiev collaborated with prominent violinists and this critical commentary highlights the ways in which these musicians variously affected Prokofiev&#146;s violin writing style. The collaborations examined are those involving the violinists Pawel Kocha;ski, Robert So&#235;tens, and David Oistrakh. The bulk of the critical commentary provides a comparison of the Flute Sonata op. 94 and the Violin Sonata no. 2 op. 94-bis (which was edited by David Oistrakh). By analysing the amendments to the flute score the extent to which Oistrakh influenced the arrangement of the violin version is established. The success of their working relationship is given testimony in the enduring popularity of this sonata.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158384</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploration and Analysis of the Origins, Nature and Development of the Sufi Movement in Australia</field><field name="creator">Genn, Celia Anne</field><field name="description">Between 1910 and 1926, Hazrat Inayat Khan, a musician and Sufi master from the Chishtiyya order in India, introduced Sufism to the United States of America and Europe. He established a Western Sufi order, the International Sufi Movement, with groups in America, England, and across Europe. In the early 1930s this Western Sufism was introduced into Australia. The aim of this study is to explore and analyse the origins, nature and development of the Sufi Movement in Australia with particular attention to the relationship between the spiritual teacher and the disciple. The study, in its various aspects, and as a whole, makes a contribution to understanding religious change, religion and New Religious Movements in Australia, Sufism in the West and the murshid-mureed relationship. Using what has been termed a &#147;dynamic of religions&#148; framework and Baumann&#146;s model of religious adaptation in cross-cultural circumstances, the study employs a combination of in-depth fieldwork, participant observation, interviews and historiography to identify and analyse both continuity and change in Sufi Movement groups in contemporary Australia. The study found that the early phases of transplantation from India to Europe and America, as well as the struggles within the group after the death of Inayat Khan, substantially shaped the Western Sufism that arrived in Australia. The most significant early adaptations included redefining the relationship between Sufism and exoteric Islam, gender equality, formation of a formal organisation, and the use of music to spread the Sufi Message. Addressing issues identified in the literature on the master-disciple relationship in Eastern traditions in the West, the study describes and analyses the murshid-mureed (master-disciple, spiritual teacher-student) relationship in Inayat Khan&#146;s time, and in contemporary Australia. It shows that Sufism&#146;s development in the West has been interconnected with understandings and practice of this central relationship. The study shows that the continued strength of the murshid-mureed relationship alongside emerging alternatives, the factors affecting change generally in the Sufi Movement, as well as the growing popularity of Sufism in Australia, demonstrate the need to consider not only East-West aspects of transplantation, but also the influences of modernity on spiritual traditions. As well as documenting the Australian history, the study describes the details of the variety of practices and rituals, forms of community and organisation, and forms of the murshid-mureed relationship, found in contemporary Australian groups. This provides insight into the intricacies of Sufi practice in Australia and provides a basis for comparison with other groups. Sufi practice within these groups in Australia includes highly innovative developments alongside preservation of the tradition as taught by Inayat Khan. It also reflects a tension between the spiritual and organisational hierarchy, and concerns for democracy and local autonomy.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">440206 Studies in Other Religious Traditions</field><field name="subject">780199 Other</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158753</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Complexity approach to national IT policy making: The case of Malaysia's Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC)</field><field name="creator">Abdul Wahab, Amirudin</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT This dissertation examines the design and implementation of Malaysia's national Information Technology (IT) policy with a focus on the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) project. Qualitative research methods, including in-depth interviews, document analysis and literature analysis, were used to build an understanding of the development of the MSC. The analysis adopts a holistic approach that draws upon the multidisciplinary perspectives of complex adaptive systems in order to understand how social, economic, political and institutional forces interact in a changing environment. This research contributes a policy framework called Goal-Policy-Implementation-Outcome (GPIO), which is used to understand, describe and assess the MSC policy design and methods. It is one of the first public studies of the MSC and one of very few complex systems analyses of a socio-economic system in a developing country. It has been argued that many countries around the world are competing rapidly to produce 'visionary' reports and policy statements on the future of their nations and societies in the 'Information Age'. This is due to the belief that IT can play critical role in stimulating the socio-economic growth of the countries. In Malaysia, the government embarked on an ambitious program to establish the MSC as an attempt to achieve Vision 2020, a national vision and Malaysia's statement of national goals that articulates the country's objective for developed-nation status, while moving towards the creation of an information-rich society by the year 2020. Despite the importance of national IT policies and the major commitment of resources to implement them, there are few critical studies of the positive and negative impacts of 'post-industrial' or 'information society' policy, particularly in the developing countries like Malaysia. This study seeks in part to fill this gap by providing a critical assessment of a Malaysian national IT policy. This research argues that IT policy for national development must be viewed holistically, taking into consideration innovations needed in the social, economic, political and institutional spheres, rather than taking limited view of IT as an economic growth engine. This is a paradigm shift that represents a movement from the traditional worldview (TWV), that was based on the Cartesian/Newtonian paradigm into new ways of thinking and action that is labelled here as the emerging worldview (EMV). The EMV is grounded in complexity theory, an interdisciplinary endeavour that draws upon ideas from a number of fields and seeks to understand and model systems with many interacting parts. This approach can help policy makers and analysts to understand, assess and develop a more balanced and comprehensive policy for the evolution of new technology such as IT and to tackle the complexity of socio-economic change of a dynamic real world setting. The data collection method is from in-depth, open-ended interviews and document analysis. This qualitative exploratory approach was chosen to understand and capture the points of view of other people without specifically limiting the lines of inquiry through questionnaires etc. This research was influenced by multiple theoretical frameworks, because taking one framework alone in analysing the complex issues involved in ICT would not provide a comprehensive understanding of the interplay of the socio-technical and techno-economic paradigms. This resulted in the contribution of a policy framework called Goal-Policy-Implementation-Outcome (GPIO), which is used to understand, describe and assess the MSC policy design and method. This research found that the MSC policy plan and process were not working as intended to achieve the goals of Vision 2020. The strategy of clustering businesses in one physical location to establish synergy did not work as anticipated because: (1) Cyberjaya was not yet fully ready with all the necessary people, infrastructure and community since many basic amenities have yet to be competed; (2) The distance of Cyberjaya to key cities were perceived to be too far; (3) Operational costs in Cyberjaya were perceived as high; (4) The Cyberjaya ecosystem lacks attractive incentives; and (5) Most of the current and potential MSC firms, customers and suppliers were already located outside Cyberjaya with existing networks of people and facilities in other locations. (6) The current environment of the MSC was also found not to be conducive to facilitating a self-organizing system due to the lack of a wide consultative and participatory process. Consequently, drastic changes to the organizational structure and behaviour are needed before success can happen. It was found that the key challenges and barriers to the transformation process in and through the MSC lie in the nature of the existing mindset, the operational practice, culture and power structural arrangements within and among the policy, people and institutions of the MSC. Discussion on the MSC tends to be centred on the technological and commercial without recognizing that technological change relies on concomitant social and political shifts. By succumbing to technology driven views and 'information society' rhetoric, policy makers are allowing real economic and social choices to be smothered. This dissertation argues that instead of presenting technology as something which is external to the society, with a dynamics of its own, and to which society must learn to adapt, effective debate about new technology must acknowledge the related political choices, power relationships and value judgments about the shape and direction of the society using the technology. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop policies to ensure that the economic benefits and social engineering associated with Malaysia&#146;s knowledge economy are managed through participatory and partnership methods at all levels of the country. This research has shown that complex systems analysis can lay the groundwork for a new approach that more accurately represents societal choices and outcomes than past approaches. Few researchers have undertaken complex systems analyses of social systems, with still fewer examining the context of a national public IT policy in a developing country like Malaysia. Further, there are very few thorough public studies done of the MSC itself, with most studies on the MSC either being done in confidence and/or being conducted by foreign consultants appointed by the government or by the Multimedia Development Corporation (MDC). As such, public accessibility to critical studies on the MSC or public documents on them is rarely available. This research, if not the first, is one of the first attempts made to provide a thorough constructive critical study on the MSC policy project since its official launch in 1996. It is also, if not the first, one of the first attempts made to apply the emerging paradigm or the new science of complexity in a real world national policy case study, specifically the MSC policy project. Moreover, there is a huge lacking of research done on behalf of 'marginalized communities'. This research is not carried out on behalf of private enterprise or national governments but rather it is done on behalf of its citizens.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">360203 Research, Science and Technology Policy</field><field name="subject">729901 Technological and organisational innovation</field><field name="subject">Multimedia Super Corridor</field><field name="subject">MSC</field><field name="subject">Malaysia</field><field name="subject">Complexity</field><field name="subject">IT Policy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157967</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Responding to International Terrorism: The Contribution of the United Nations</field><field name="creator">Emma Kennedy Da Silva</field><field name="description" /><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">360000 Policy and Political Science</field><field name="subject">united nations, international terrorism, multilateralism, unilateralism, international relations, cooperation, institutions, security</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159349</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New Insights into Diffusion-Controlled Bimolecular Termination using &#8216;Controlled/Living&#8217; Radical Polymerisation</field><field name="creator">Geoffrey Johnston-hall</field><field name="description">Free-radical polymerisation (FRP) has been one of the most important techniques for producing materials used in a very wide variety of applications and has enhanced the lives of millions of people around the world. However, for many years a number of fundamental questions regarding the key kinetic processes involved in FRP have remained unresolved. In particular, an accurate description of the mechanism for diffusion-controlled bimolecular termination has proven elusive. As a result, conventional modelling tools for FRP have often proven unreliable. The aim of this thesis, therefore, was to accurately study the evolution of the bimolecular termination rate coefficient during free radical polymerisation using a new and more accurate methodology based on &#8216;controlled/living&#8217; reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerisation. This was undertaken in order to develop a more precise understanding of bimolecular termination and thereby develop a more reliable modeling approach capable of predicting the rates of reaction and evolution of molecular weight distributions for a wide range of experimental conditions and a wide range of functional monomers. The RAFT-CLD-T (RAFT Chain-Length-Dependent Termination) Method was used to determine accurate values for the conversion and chain-length-dependent termination rate coefficient, kti,i(x), as a function of various parameters. These parameters included the chain size, i, polymer concentration (or conversion, x), chain length size distribution and chain architecture/structure. The accuracy of the RAFT-CLD-T Method was crucial to this work, therefore, an important part of this thesis was devoted to evaluating the reliability of this technique. Below 5 % conversion and above 80 % conversion the method was found to be unreliable due to the effects of chain-length-dependent propagation, high PDI&#8217;s and short-long termination. However, between 5 % and 80 % conversion it was found that the method is extremely robust and a series of easy-to-use experimental guidelines were determined for accurately applying the RAFT-CLD-T Method. The effects of chain size, chain size distribution, solution polymer concentration, and matrix architecture were examined for the RAFT-mediated polymerisations of methyl methacrylate (MMA), styrene (STY) and methyl acrylate (MA). It was found that four distinct scaling regimes of termination are observed: (1) a &#8216;short&#8217; chain dilute solution regime, (2) a &#8216;long&#8217; chain dilute solution regime, (3) a semi-dilute solution regime and (4) a concentrated solution regime. In dilute polymer solutions, chain-length-dependent power law exponents, &#61537;&#8217;s, determined during the polymerisation of MMA, STY and MA (where kti,i(x) &#61621; i-&#61537;) indicated that termination follows two major scaling regimes with exponents of approximately ~0.5 to 0.6 for &#8216;short&#8217; chains and and ~0.12 to 0.16 for &#8216;long&#8217; chains. Importantly, these exponents are in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions for translational and segmental diffusion-controlled termination, respectively. At increasing polymer concentrations, kti,i(x) falls rapidly coinciding with the onset of the gel effect. By comparing results from the RAFT-mediated polymerisations of MMA, STY, MA, and vinyl acetate (VAc) with theoretical models, we found that the onset of the gel effect coincided closely with the theoretical onset of chain overlap. Considerable uncertainty has plagued the evaluation of this phenomenon, but using a difunctional RAFT agent we showed this uncertainty arises from the influence of broad MWD&#8217;s on chain overlap and short-long termination. Finally, critical tests of this theory involving the bimolecular termination of linear radicals in solutions of star polymer confirmed that the gel effect coincided with chain overlap. Beyond the gel effect termination slows enormously, passing through the &#8216;semi-dilute solution&#8217; regime and into the &#8216;concentrated solution&#8217;. In semi-dilute solution, theoretical predictions based on scaling theory (i.e. the &#8216;blob&#8217; model) were in excellent agreement with results for the polymerisation of PSTY in linear and star polymer solutions, indicating that the solvent quality diminished both with increasing chain length and through the addition of a star polymer matrix. In concentrated solutions, the chain-length-dependent power law exponent increased linearly with conversion. For example, for MMA the chain length dependence of kt in the gel regime scaled as &#61537;gel = 1.8x + 0.056, suggesting that reptation alone does not describe termination in the concentrated solution. Values of &#61537;gel for PSTY, MA, and VAc were in similar agreement, indicating that a mechanism intermediate between unentangled and entangled semi-dilute scaling laws applies in the concentrated solution regime. Interestingly, &#61537;gel values for these monomers were found to decrease with increasing chain flexibility in the order &#61537;gel(MMA)&gt; &#61537;gel(STY)&gt; &#61537;gel(VAc)&gt; &#61537;gel(MA), suggesting matrix mobility is rate determining in concentrated solutions. Similarly, &#61537;gel values were also larger in star polymer solutions, coinciding with decreasing matrix mobility. Thus, although it has been commonly believed that polymer chains diffuse via reptation above the gel effect, these results show that this only occurs for solutions containing rigid and/or highly immobile macromolecules and in very high concentrations. To describe these behaviours, a semi-empirical &#8216;composite kt model&#8217; was also developed to describe kti,i(x) as a function of i and x up to high conversions. We showed that the model is very simple to implement and accurate for modelling a wide range of functional monomers and experimental conditions. In particular, we showed the method was accurate for modelling RAFT-mediated polymerisations of a very wide range of monomers (MA, MMA, and PSTY) and was even accurate for modelling conventional FRP&#8217;s. Thus, the model provides a simple, flexible and accurate method for predicting the rate of reaction and evolution of molecular weight distributions across a range of experimental conditions based on accurate kti,i(x) values.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Radical Reactions</field><field name="subject">Kinetics</field><field name="subject">Diffusion</field><field name="subject">Bimolecular Termination</field><field name="subject">Reversible Addition-Fragmentation Chain Transfer</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:183739</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On the Edge: The Border Sanctuaries of Attica and Athenian Territoriality</field><field name="creator">Rashna Taraporewalla</field><field name="description">The principal sanctuaries of Attica outside the asty were situated in strategically important positions at the territorial limits of Athens. It will be argued that the sanctuaries placed on the frontiers of Attica were important nodes in the social construction, expression and implementation of Athenian territoriality. Sanctuaries which accommodated polis-level cults outside the urban centre provided the Athenians with a highly visible means of demarcating and communicating the extent of their territorial sovereignty. These religious sites developed in a visually conspicuous manner at a time when the territorial and social boundaries between the Athenians and neighbouring communities were crystallising. From an early stage in the development of the sanctuary sites of Attica, they played an instrumental role in defining the extent of Athenian territory, a space imbued with meaning in terms of claims of sovereignty and membership within the Athenian community. During the Archaic period, the border sanctuaries of Attica and the cults which they accommodated were elaborated, augmenting Athenian claims to contested borderlands and enhancing the prestige of the polis. The relative ranking and status of Athens in her interpolis relations was thereby enhanced, allowing the Athenians to reduce the threat of invasion of the chora. Following the Persian Wars, the sanctuaries continued to disseminate messages of the power and status of Athens, now hegemon of the Delian League. The structures and rites of the border sanctuaries reified the hegemonic power of Athens. When, during the long and bitter conflict of the Peloponnesian War, it became necessary to control the points of access into Athenian territory along the coastline, Rhamnous and Sounion were fortified. In the Late Classical period, the military role of a number of these sanctuaries was institutionalised. Fortification walls were augmented and refurbished and ephebic involvement in rites and festivals attested the close connection between religious and military activity.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Border sanctuaries</field><field name="subject">Attica</field><field name="subject">Athenian polis</field><field name="subject">Defence</field><field name="subject">Frontiers</field><field name="subject">Boundaries</field><field name="subject">Territoriality</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:183725</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Response of Helicoverpa armigera to agricultural environments diversified through companion planting.</field><field name="creator">Renee Herde</field><field name="description">This study investigated the potential of companion planting as a strategy to aid in the management of Helicoverpa armigera in tomato and capsicum cropping systems. The investigaitons showed that a companion planting type system is unlikely to confer any benefits to the management of H. armigera in these crops. The project has contributed to the understanding of H. armigera host selection and how the pest responds to a diversified environment. Companion planting and vegetational diversity are strategies for reducing pest incidence on crops. Many theories have been devised to explain how introducing more than one plant species to a cropping space may reduce the incidence of a pest. Five ecological theories formed the basis of experiments in this study: The resource concentration hypothesis - Herbivores are more likely to find and remain on hosts that are growing in dense or nearly pure stands (Root, 1973). Associational resistance/Plant apparency - Crop plants grown as monocultures are more apparent to herbivorous insects than plants in diverse natural systems (Tahvanainen and Root, 1972). Trap cropping &#8211; the use of plants within a cropping area to attract oviposition away from the main crop (Banks and Ekbom, 1999). The ability of H. armigera to learn in regard to host seleciton (Cunningham et al., 1998a). The natural enemies hypothesis - generalist and specialist natural enemies are expected to be more abundant in diverse rather than simple systems (Root, 1973) A tall variety of sorghum (the forage variety Chopper) was tested for its ability to disrupt host location. Sorghum was planted around plots of tomatoes to act as a screen to disrupt visual cues for host location by Helicoverpa spp. No difference was found in egg numbers on tomatoes with or without sorghum companions. However, significantly higher numbers of Helicoverpa spp. larvae were found in the sorghum at flowering than in the tomatoes. This suggested the sorghum was acting as a trap crop, diverting oviposition away from the tomato crop. However, due to a short period of flowering and therefore peak attractiveness to H. armigera, sorghum was not considered to be a suitable companion plant for inclusion in commercial tomato production systems. A host preference study was conducted to determine the preferences of H. armigera for crop plants and possible companions in the hope of finding a suitable trap crop species. Tomatoes were shown to be a highly preferred plant making it difficult to find a compatible trap crop species that would be more attractive than the main crop. However, capsicums were less prefered and therefore more suitable for this type of experimentation. Marigolds were also found to be a highly preferred plant and formed the basis for further investigations into trap cropping systems. Field experiments were conducted in successive years in two geographical locations to assess the suitability of marigolds as a trap crop for capsicums in a field situation. However, in both years H. armigera incidence was extremely and unusually low leading to inconclusive results. A glasshouse experiment was performed to assess if the ratio of capsicum plants to marigolds plants had an effect on which species H. armigera would choose for oviposition. It was found that as more capsicum plants were introduced, moths became less likely to oviposit on the supposedly more preferred marigold plant. The diminishing attractiveness of a more preferred host in the presence of other hosts is a new observation of H. armigera behaviour. This result suggests that marigolds would be unlikely to be a successful trap crop in a field situation. The ability of H. armigera to learn in regard to host selection and the influence of this on host selection in the field was investigated. No evidence of learning was found. This was the first study investigating the effect of learning in a field situation; previously the behaviour had only been investigated in a laboratory situation (Cunningham, et al. 1998a). The ability of the Australian assassin bug, Pristhesancus plagipennis (Walker) (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) to predate H. armigera larvae on capsicum plants was investigated. This predator has been sucessfully been used for H. armigera management in cotton (Grundy, 2000b), but had not been investigated in horticultural crops. Significant reductions in larvae were achieved in treatments where assassin bugs were introduced. This predator warrants further investigation for inclusion in commercial integrated pest managment programs for capsicums. Pest repellent plants were also considered. Previous to this study, very little research work had been conducted on repellent plants for H. armigera. The herbs investigated were catnip (Nepta cataria), tansy (Tanacetum vulgare), basil (Ocium basilicum) and coriander (Coriander sativum). An olfactometer system was designed and built to test H. armigera moths&#8217; responses to odours from the herbs. Glasshouse experiments were also conducted. No repellent activity was recorded with any of the herbs tested. The results of this study support the theory that Helicoverpa spp. employ a strategy of passive host selection as suggested by Firempong (1986). This means that all available plants in an area may be oviposited on with successful ovipostion and larval development leading to the future utilisation of a species as a host plant. The implication of this finding is that in-field trap cropping is unlikely to be a successful strategy for reducing H. armigera oviposition in tomato or capsicum production systems in Australia. In cotton crops in Australia, trap cropping is used as part of an area wide management strategy and aims to reduce the total Helicoverpa spp. population of a region. Such a strategy may also be successful in horticultural crops but only with the full participation of the growers of all crops that are attractive to H. armigera in a horticultural growing region. Due to the diverse nature of horticultural production this may be a difficult task.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences</field><field name="subject">Helicoverpa armigera, companion planting, trap cropping, learning, marigold, host selection, repellent plants, Pristhesancus plagipennis</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:183732</field></doc><doc><field name="title">James V. Forrestal as Cold War Policymaker: A Re-Assessment</field><field name="creator">Belinda Lohrisch</field><field name="description">This thesis critically examines the career and significance of America&#8217;s first Secretary of Defence James V. Forrestal from a post-Cold War perspective. Within traditional Cold War scholarship, Forrestal&#8217;s legacy is problematic. The nature of his role as a defence administrator, combined with his suicide in 1949, has led scholars to underestimate his significance and relegate his legacy to the occasional biography. The few studies that examine his contribution utilise conventional analytical approaches that fail to fully assess his policymaking impact. The end of the Cold War, however, has brought additional insight into the policy concerns that dominated the conflict, new analytical approaches to its scholarship and fresh material on which to base a re-assessment. As this thesis demonstrates, the employment of new methodologies to study Forrestal&#8217;s impact is long overdue. By drawing on theories specifically related to leadership and decision-making behaviour, this thesis brings a deeper, fuller understanding of Forrestal&#8217;s policy-making impact as a Cold War official through an examination of his professional conduct. Despite Forrestal&#8217;s many successes, political controversies surrounding his defence career overshadowed his many achievements. This thesis argues that such controversies were the result of Forrestal&#8217;s dedication as a public official, his policy-making and management styles, and the structure of his authority as defence secretary. They were not, as some have argued, the result of his ineffectiveness as a policy-maker, &#8220;hawkish&#8221; attitudes or declining mental health. His collapse, furthermore, was not the natural conclusion of any paranoid delusions or obsessive nature, but rather a result of Forrestal&#8217;s dedication to his work at the expense of his own health. This thesis undertakes a content analysis of Forrestal&#8217;s writings and an examination of his policy-making approach, concentrating on the evolution and execution of his policy advice and initiatives, as well as the structure of his authority as secretary of defence. It begins with a biographical overview of his life and public service career, as well as an assessment of existing Cold War scholarship and its general tendency to underestimate Forrestal&#8217;s significance. The components of his legacy are then analysed thematically, with chapters devoted to his foreign policy influence, his role in the unification controversy and his administrative efforts as defence secretary. Throughout, Forrestal&#8217;s career and significance is reassessed both in the application of new theoretical and methodological insights, and the analysis of recently declassified and reorganised documents, particularly the complete and unexpurgated version of Forrestal&#8217;s official diaries.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">james forrestal, cold war, policy-making, defence policy, defence administration</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185150</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Communist Party and trade union work in Queensland in the third period: 1928-1935</field><field name="creator">Penrose, Beris Gene</field><field name="description" /><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1606 Political Science</field><field name="subject">Communist Party of Australia -- History</field><field name="subject">Labor unions and communism -- Queensland -- History.</field><field name="subject">Depressions -- 1929 -- Queensland</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185197</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Opposition to C. Julius Caesar: Motives, Methods, Successes and the Question of Tyranny.</field><field name="creator">Mark Avery</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the motives, methods and successes of opposition to C. Julius Caesar in the period 60-50 leading to the outbreak of civil war in 49. An attempt has been made to distinguish between traditional and innovative methods of opposition. An evaluation of creativity levels and the social acceptability of actions has been conducted in an effort to understand adherence to moral standards in the pre-war period. In Chapter 2, opposition to Caesar in 60 and 59 is examined and found to be fierce, persistent and, despite Caesar ultimately achieving his aims, successful in a limited way. Chapter 3 examines the circumstances of 58-57. Caesar&#8217;s position was more firmly secured through the agency of Clodius&#8217; tribunate, during which Cicero was exiled and Cato was removed from the political scene for both political and personal reasons. Examination of opposition to Caesar in Chapter 4 focuses on the period 56-54. It is demonstrated that prior to the conferences of Luca and Ravenna, opposition to Caesar was broadly undertaken by groups or individuals who fomented dissent between Crassus and Pompey in order to undermine the triumvirate as a whole. In 55 opposition to Caesar was nullified by a renewal of the triumvirate. In 54 opposition was resurgent and dominated the courts with limited success. In Chapter 5, opposition to Caesar in the period 53-50 is examined and is shown to be marked by anarchy, attempted reforms and the disintegration of the triumviral alliance. Given widespread impressions of pressure, corruption, violence and breakdown, especially in modern accounts of the period, it is suprising to discover that tactics used by Caesar&#8217;s opponents were traditional and socially acceptable for the most part, despite vehement political and personal disagreement. The will of the people was still respected by Caesar&#8217;s opponents; popular opinion in 59 was in fact the cause of opposition failure. While the Republic had suffered civil war in the opening decades of the first century BC, the state had resumed constitutional operation prior to 60. Traditional moral values and methods of gaining rank and prestige were still important and continued to be adhered to after 60. Methods of influence and social communication remained largely unchanged in the 50s, and ensured the continuity of political exchange without substantial innovation. From 56 to 54 opposition methods were opportunistic, a result of the renewal of the triumvirate. Caesar&#8217;s opponents continued to adhere to traditional political practice, despite dominance of the political machinary by the triumvirate. In 54 Caesar&#8217;s opponents gained control of the law courts, which resulted in numerous trials but no break with traditional or socially acceptable behaviour. Opposition between 53 and 50 remained traditional in most cases within an environment marked by anarchy and political stalemate, fueled by the intransigence of Caesar and Pompey who refused to recognise each others&#8217; dignitas. The Civil War, then, was not caused by an extended period of constitutional instability. The Civil War was the result of political deadlock at the end of the 50s, motivated by the social and political inflexibility of a small group of Senators.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">21 History and Archaeology</field><field name="subject">caesar, roman republic, politics, roman law, voting assemblies, roman senate, pompey, cicero, cato minor</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:186132</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental factors affecting teaching and learning in North Queensland, 1875-1905</field><field name="creator">De Jabrun, Mary</field><field name="description" /><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">13 Education</field><field name="subject">330102 History and Philosophy of Education</field><field name="subject">Public schools -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Education -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Queensland -- Social conditions -- 1788-1900</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:186226</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Analysis of Islamic Conceptualisations of Press Freedom in Malaysia</field><field name="creator">Nerawi Sedu</field><field name="description">This research study investigated the conceptions of press freedom from the Islamic perspective. It examined how certain segments of Malaysian society, including government officers, religious leaders, members of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and members of political parties, perceive press freedom in their country. Compared to previous studies on media freedom or press freedom in Malaysia, this study offered a comprehensive analysis of variables significantly related to the conceptualisation and practice of press freedom, which include economic development, information and communication technologies (ICTs) and globalisation. One significant difference between this study and previous studies was the specific examination of Islamic conceptions of press freedom, which represents a major contribution to existing knowledge. As Malaysia is a complex multi-racial and multi-religious nation, factors such as national ideologies and cultural values were addressed when examining conceptions of press freedom. Due to the focus of the study, two types of framework were utilised: an Islamic theoretical framework and media theories developed by Western scholars. Methodologically, this study employed an ethnographic approach for analysing Islamic conceptualisations of press freedom. A combination of three qualitative research techniques - in-depth face-to-face interviews, examination of archival documents, and personal observations - was utilised to investigate the issues identified in relation to perceptions of press freedom in Malaysia. In-depth face-to-face interviews involved the participation of staff and members from ten organisations and individuals who were not affiliated with these organisations. The organisations involved in this study were: Ministry of Internal Security Malaysia (MOIS); Institute of Islamic Understanding Malaysia (IKIM); Islamic Da&#8217;wah Foundation Malaysia (YADIM); Muslim Youth Movement of Malaysia (ABIM); Pertubuhan Jamaah Islah Malaysia (JIM); Centre for Independent Journalism (CIJ); Suara Rakyat Malaysia (SUARAM); Islamic Party of Malaysia (PAS), People&#8217;s Justice Party (PKR); and Puteri UMNO. The archival documents analysed in this study were gathered from these ten organisations. However, due to certain organisational policies and security concerns, personal observations were only conducted at eight organisations, IKIM, YADIM, ABIM, JIM, CIJ, SUARAM, PAS and PKR. The data were analysed using thematic analysis. The results of the data analysis were triangulated to ascertain the extent to which the information obtained was consistent or inconsistent across sources. The findings of the study showed that there were diverse views among respondents on what constitutes an Islamic press freedom in a multi-racial and multi-religious Malaysia. Due to the different levels of Islamic understanding and divergent interpretations of Islam among Muslims, especially among members of political parties, this study also found that the Islamic theory of press freedom is a highly contested concept. More often than not, the respondents of these organisations claimed that Islamic conceptualisations of press freedom should be based on their personal versions of Islam.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">20 Language, Communication and Culture</field><field name="subject">freedom, freedom of expression, press freedom, Islamic perspective, tawhid, conservatism, liberalism</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:194709</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A new method for computing anharmonic rovibrational densities of states of interstellar and atmospheric clusters at arbitrary angular momenta</field><field name="creator">Sarah Windsor</field><field name="description">A new methodology is developed to calculate density of states of interstellar and atmospheric clusters that takes account of their loosely bound nature and incorporates kinetically important angular momentum constraints explicitly. The method is based on classical phase space integration for the intermonomer modes of the cluster with imposition of the constraints of selected total energy and total angular momentum. It achieves considerable efficiency via essentially analytic evaluation of the momentum space integrals coupled with efficient Monte Carlo sampling of configurations. The derivation for the equation for the density of states is outlined and all steps in the simplification of the accessible momentum space volume are detailed. The method is tested rigorously against an entirely analytic result obtained for the ideal case of a dimer with spherical top fragments and no interaction potential. Interstellar applications of the new approach are presented for (HCN)2 and (CO)2. The new intermononmer density of states has been integrated over metastable states to obtain the intermonomer partition function, which in turn is used to calculate the metastable equilibrium constants for interstellar clusters, which in turn is used tocalculate the second order rate constant of overall dimer formation in the interstellar environment. Atmospheric applications of the new approach are presented for (H2O)2. The new intermonomer density of states is convoluted with the intramonomer density of states to obtain the convoluted density of states. This convoluted density of states is then integrated over total energy and angular momentum to obtain the anharmonic partition function, which in turn is used to calculate the equilibrium constant for atmospheric clusters, which in turn is used to calculate the third order rate constant for overall dimer formation in the atmospheric environment. Kinetic quantities are also calculated with the intermonomer and convoluted density of states for interstellar and atmospheric clusters, respectively. These densities of states are combined with RRKM theory to compute unimolecular dissociation rate constants, which are then averaged with respect to the thermal capture flux distribution to compute average lifetimes as a function of temperature.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">interstellar, atmospheric, classical, density of states, metastable, partition function,</field><field name="subject">equilibrium constant, rate constant, lifetime</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:195299</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation and recombinant expression of antigens for the rapid diagnosis of West Nile virus infection</field><field name="creator">Jody Hobson-Peters</field><field name="description">West Nile Virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne pathogen of global significance. It is active on several continents and is responsible for recent outbreaks of fever and fatal encephalitis in humans and horses. While highly virulent strains have been reported in Europe, North, Central and South America, only a benign subtype of WNV (Kunjin virus &#8211; KUNV) occurs in Australia. However, virulent, exotic WNV strains are seen as a significant threat to Australia due to the ease with which this virus can move between continents and the presence of suitable vectors and hosts already within Australia. KUNV and WNV subtypes are antigenically and genetically very closely related and cross-react in traditional serological tests. This cross-reactivity makes it very difficult to differentiate between KUNV and WNV infections using standard serological tests. The aim of this thesis was to identify immunogenic epitopes unique to KUNV or WNV and to use these epitopes in the development of a rapid assay that would enable the diagnosis of and surveillance for exotic virulent strains of WNV in Australia. The rapid diagnostic platform chosen was a red blood cell (RBC) agglutination assay that was originally patented and commercialised by AGEN Biomedical Ltd. The RBC agglutination assay reagent consists of the Fab region of a human erythrocyte-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) conjugated to the epitope of interest (in this instance, a WNV-specific peptide). This bi-functional reagent causes the agglutination of the patient&#8217;s erythrocytes in the presence of WNV-specific antibody in the patient&#8217;s serum. Traditionally, these RBC agglutination reagents have been produced by chemical conjugation. However, a potentially easier and cheaper method involves the linking of the gene encoding the erythrocyte-specific antibody to that encoding the epitope to create a recombinant version of the bi-functional agglutination reagent through expression using prokaryotic or eukaryotic systems. To identify potential differential epitopes, 18 mAbs to WNV (NY99 strain) prM and envelope (E) proteins were assessed. One mAb (17D7) differentially recognised WNV and KUNV in ELISA and maintained recognition of its corresponding epitope upon reduction and carboxymethylation of the viral antigen, suggesting a continuous (linear) epitope. Using synthetic peptides, the epitope was mapped to a 19 amino acid sequence (WN19: E147-165) encompassing the WNV NY99 E protein glycosylation site at position 154. An amino acid substitution at position E156 of many KUNV strains abolishes this glycosylation moiety. The inability of WNV-positive horse and mouse sera to bind the synthetic peptides indicated that glycosylation was required for recognition of peptide WN19 by WNV-specific antibodies in sera. N-linked glycosylation of WN19 was achieved through expression of the peptide as a C-terminal fusion protein in mammalian cells and specific reactivity of WNV-positive horse sera to the glycosylated WN19 fusion protein was shown by Western blot. Additional sera collected from horses that had been infected with Murray Valley encephalitis virus (MVEV), which is similarly glycosylated at position E154 and exhibits high sequence identity to WNV NY99 in this region, also recognised the recombinant peptide. In contrast, no reactivity with the recombinant peptide was observed by sera from horses infected with the unglycosylated WNV subtype, KUNV. Failure of most WNV- and MVEV-positive horse sera to recognise the epitope as a deglycosylated fusion protein (75% and 100% respectively) confirmed that the N-linked glycan is important for antibody recognition of the peptide. Together, these results suggest that the induction of antibodies to the WN19 epitope during WNV infection of horses is generally associated with E protein glycosylation of the infecting viral strain. To assess the feasibility of using peptide WN19 in a rapid immunoassay, the peptide was recombinantly fused to a RBC (glycophorin)-specific single chain antibody (scFv) using previously published constructs which were developed for the bacterial expression of similar bi-functional reagents. To facilitate glycosylation of peptide WN19, the genes for the bi-functional agglutination reagents were subsequently cloned into eukaryotic expression vectors. An additional set of constructs were also produced in which the genes for the variable regions of the anti-RBC antibody were cloned into a vector for the secreted expression of an intact, humanised IgG1 molecule. Stable cell lines were produced for each of these constructs and secreted up to 700 ng/mL glycophorin-reactive antibody. The secreted recombinant protein could be harvested directly from the cell culture medium and used in RBC agglutination assays, where these bi-functional agglutination reagents could be cross-linked either with mAb 17D7 or by anti-peptide WN19 antibodies present in WNV-positive horse serum. The WNV NY99 prM protein was also identified as a useful marker of WNV-infection in horses, as well as a putative antigen to differentiate equine WNV NY99 and KUNV infections using Western blot. Two anti-WNV prM mAbs were also generated in this study and will be extremely valuable in future studies. Preliminary analysis of the prM epitope(s) bound by these mAbs and WNV-immune sera indicate that the binding site(s) is likely to be localised to pr and is conformational.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">06 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">West Nile virus</field><field name="subject">Kunjin Virus</field><field name="subject">Flavivirus</field><field name="subject">Monoclonal Antibody</field><field name="subject">single chain antibody</field><field name="subject">red blood cell agglutination</field><field name="subject">Recombinant Antibody</field><field name="subject">Epitope mapping</field><field name="subject">prM</field><field name="subject">Envelope Protein</field><field name="subject">Diagnostic Assay</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:203818</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stepping stones towards linear optical quantum computing</field><field name="creator">Till Weinhold</field><field name="description">The experiments described in this thesis form an investigation into the path towards establishing the requirements of quantum computing in a linear optical system. Our qubits are polarisation encoded photons for which the basic operations of quantum computing, single qubit rotations, are a well understood problem. The difficulty lies in the interaction of photons. To achieve these we use measurement induced non-linearities. The first experiment in this thesis describes the thorough characterisation of a controlled-sign gate based on such non-linearities. The photons are provided as pairs generated through parametric down-conversion, and as such share correlations unlikely to carry over into large scale implementations of the future. En route to such larger circuits, a characterisation of the actions of the controlled-sign gate is conducted, when the input qubits have been generated independently from each other, revealing a large drop in process fidelity. To explore the cause of this degradation of the gate performance a thorough and highly accurate model of the gate is derived including the realistic description of faulty circuitry, photon loss and multi-photon emission by the source. By simulating the effects of the various noise sources individually, the heretofore largely ignored multi-photon emission is identified as the prime cause of the degraded gate performance, causing a drop in fidelity nearly three times as large as any other error source. I further draw the first comparison between the performance of an experimental gate to the error probabilities per gate derived as thresholds for fault-tolerant quantum computing. In the absence of a single vigourous threshold value, I compare the gate performance to the models that yielded the highest threshold to date as an upper bound and to the threshold of the Gremlin-model, which allows for the most general errors. Unsurprisingly this comparison reveals that the implemented gate is clearly insufficient, however just remedying the multi-photon emission error will allow this architecture to move to within striking distance of the boundary for fault-tolerant quantum computing. The utilised methodology can be applied to any gate in any architecture and can, combined with a suitable model of the noise sources, become an important guide for developments required to achieve fault tolerant quantum computing. The final experiment on the path towards linear optical quantum computing is the demonstration of a pair of basic versions of Shor's algorithm which display the essential entanglement for the algorithm. The results again highlight the need for extensive measurements to reveal the fundamental quality of the implemented algorithm, which is not accessible with limited indicative measurements. In the second part of the thesis, I describe two experiments on other forms of entanglement by extending the actions of a Fock-State filter, a filter that is capable of attenuating single photon states stronger than multi-photon states, to produce entangled states. Furthermore this device can be used in conjunction with standard wave-plates to extend the range of operations possible on the bi-photonic qutrit space, showing that this setup suffices to produce any desired qutrit state, thereby giving access to new measurement capabilities and in the process creating and proving the first entanglement between a qubit and a qutrit.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">quantum information</field><field name="subject">quantum optics</field><field name="subject">Quantum computing</field><field name="subject">Linear optical quantum computing</field><field name="subject">Pulsed Parametric Down-conversion</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:204520</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring the structure-property relationships in eumelanin</field><field name="creator">Jacques Bothma</field><field name="description">In this thesis we examine key structure-property relationships associated with eumelanin's photophysical properties. This has involved characterizing both the molecular and supramolecular structure of eumelanin, and examining how these relate to eumalanin's key optical properties that are relevant to their their role in the biosphere as photoprotectants. Using low-voltage high resolution transmission electron microscopy we definitively show that sheets of proto-molecules stack to form nanostructures. The inter-sheet spacings within these structures are between 3.7 and 4.0 &#197; consistent with non-covalent pie-pie stacking in heteroaromatic systems. Stacking interactions in similarly structured aromatic macromolecules play an important role in non-radiative energy dissipation and we propose that this may also be the case in the eumelanin system. We also examine the recently proposed hypothesis that excited state intramolecular proton transfer may play a role in the photophysics of 5,6-dihydoxyindole carboxylic acid, a key eumelanin monomer. The experimental results acquired in this study indicate that this hypothesis needs to be carefully re-examined and its justification would require more extensive experimental support. Key optical properties of 5,6-dihydoxyindole carboxylic acid are re-evaluated in an inert aprotic solvent and these have provided some insight into the electronic structure as well as the rates of radiative and non-radiative decay in this important eumelanin monomer. We go on to show how the structure of eumelanin can be manipulated to produce eumelanin thin films. These films display electrical conductivities comparable with amorphous silicon, as well as a host of other interesting and potentially useful optoelectronic properties. The results show great promise for eumelanin-based applications such as chemi-sensors (in a variety of architectures including organic field effect transistors with chemi-sensitive channels) and bolometric photon detectors.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">02 Physical Sciences</field><field name="subject">eumelanin, spectroscopy, thin films</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:204804</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Clathrin Independent Carriers: Molecular characterisation of a novel clathrin-independent endocytic pathway</field><field name="creator">Mark Howes</field><field name="description">Endocytosis effectuates a critical interface between the eukaryotic cell and its apposing environment. It is, subsequently, paramount for many physiologically important processes and encompasses a diverse array of mechanisms and pathways. The classical endocytic routes mediated by clathrin and caveolin are the best understood and the molecular roles of their major regulators, such as dynamin, adaptor proteins and various lipid species, are the most comprehensively described. Recent identification of an assortment of constitutive, noncaveolar, clathrin-independent endocytic (CIE) pathways has expanded the endocytic system. Unlike the classical endocytic pathways, little is known about the guiding parameters of CIE routes. Consequently, it is not possible to understand the important cellular roles these pathways may be fulfilling. This study has begun to characterise the very basic parameters governing the morphologically striking Clathrin-Independent Carrier (CLIC) pathway. Development of a diverse molecular toolkit has now allowed the quantitation of endocytic capacity provided by CLICs, the visualisation of subtle sorting components of the CLIC pathway, the isolation of novel CLIC cargo and regulators, and has linked this mechanism to the critical cellular processes of cellular migration and membrane repair. Calculation of the individual capacity of endocytic routes provides important information about the contribution of each pathway to total plasma membrane (PM) uptake and turnover. Quantitation of the volume, surface area and number of structures forming per minute in this study shows that CLICs provide the vast majority of constitutive endocytosis, up to four times the capacity of the clathrin mediated endocytic (CME) pathway. As the equivalent of the entire PM area could pass through the CLIC pathway within 12 minutes it is evident that CLICs are fundamental housekeepers of bulk membrane internalisation. Thus, they are likely to be central regulators of PM homeostasis and turnover. High-resolution tomography, in conjunction with analysis of CLIC cargo trafficking, identifies these carriers as complex, pleiomorphic structures that sort the bulk of membrane to early endosomes and recycle cargo back to the cell surface. Such vast internalisation combined with an ability to rapidly recycle components quickly attributes the CLIC pathway as a complex sorting station. Isolation of novel cargo and regulators has identified a striking array of proteins now associated with the CLIC pathway for the first time. A significant proportion of identified targets localise to lipid-rafts and recycle from the PM, facets consistent with association to the CLIC pathway. Numerous targets have also been directly implicated in clathrin-independent endocytosis by independent groups. Verification of selected cargo, such as CD44, Thy-1 and myoferlin, showing specific internalisation through the CLIC pathway, has provided insight into the sorting ability of the CLIC pathway and links to adhesion turnover and membrane recycling. Consistent with a role in cellular adhesion turnover, it was found that CLICs become polarised within migrating cells. This has shown the first instance of spatial separation between three major endocytic routes, CLICs, caveolae and CME and highlights the important and coordinated roles of multiple endocytic pathways during physiologically significant processes. The specific internalisation of paxillin, Thy-1 and CD44 through CLICs at the leading edge of migrating cells suggests that CLICs rapidly turnover adhesion components for dynamic extracellular sensation during directional cell migration. Indeed, specific ablation of the CLIC pathway significantly impedes cellular migration, implying coordination with CME at the leading edge. This study has defined numerous parameters of the CLIC pathway, developing the current understanding of this poorly defined route and places the CLIC pathway as a unique player during critical cellular processes.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Endocytosis</field><field name="subject">Endosome</field><field name="subject">Clathrin-independent Endocytosis</field><field name="subject">Gpi-anchored Protein-enriched Early Endosomal Compartment</field><field name="subject">Lipid Rafts</field><field name="subject">Membrane Trafficking</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205797</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Healing architecture': A study of daylight in public hospital designs in Malaysia</field><field name="creator">Srazali Aripin</field><field name="description">In the hospital building, where patients seek medical treatment and hospital staff provide continuous support, creating a healing environment is an imperative. However, it appears that the ultimate aim to create a healing environment is not given due attention by healthcare designers. Patients&#8217; negative experiences of the existing physical environment of a hospital building describing as depressing, confusing, dull, little natural light, stressful, noisy causing sleep deprivation, anxiety, isolation and physical restraint were noted in many studies of the built environment. Most of these criticisms are also experienced by the patients in the case studies of hospital buildings in Malaysia, particularly on thermal (too warm) and visual (glare) discomfort. Therefore, the term &#8216;Healing Architecture&#8217; is adopted to invoke a sense of a continuous process; creating an environment physically healthy and psychologically appropriate for patients&#8217; well-being. A majority of the literature on the healing environment has reached a consensus that the physical aspects of built environment could contribute indirectly to the health outcomes of patients and staff in a hospital building. These include shorter length of stay, reduced stress and increased patients&#8217; satisfaction. Among the physical aspects, daylighting is considered one of the most influential factors to achieve visual comfort contributing to a healing environment. The thesis aims to explore daylighting performance of a four-bed ward by means of a parametric study of design variables in order to achieve the visual as well as thermal comfort in creating a healing environment. Conflicting issues of &#8216;physical to physical&#8217; (e.g. daylight vs. solar heat gain) and &#8216;physical to psychological&#8217; (e.g. daylight vs. undesirable glare) are analysed. With the theme of daylight and health, previous studies related to the factors of the physical environments in hospital buildings that influence health outcomes are reviewed. The physical factors affecting daylighting to achieve visual comfort are also analysed. Reviews of the project briefs of the completed public hospital buildings in Malaysia are also conducted and seven hospitals are selected as the case studies to investigate daylighting conditions of the existing four-bed ward environment. Triangulation by means of analyses through questionnaire, measurement and computer simulation is the method adopted for the investigation. Available simulation programs are reviewed for suitability and compatibility of the study. The simulation software (validated) used for the study is Integrated Environmental Solutions &#8211; Virtual Environment (IES&#8211;VE). Based on the qualitative and quantitative analyses, it can be concluded that visual comfort in the existing four-bed ward environments of public hospital buildings in Malaysia is not achieved. Factors contributing to the failure are that the conflicting priorities (i.e. &#8216;physical vs. physical&#8217; and &#8216;physical vs. psychological&#8217;) were not analysed by healthcare designers when designing a window (size and position), there is clear evidence of glare and daylighting design failed to meet the daylight factor (DF) requirement of 1% at the (innermost) bed-head. The finding is that a healing environment in the four-bed ward is not achieved. The results of the analysis also confirmed that the key physical factors affecting daylighting in the hospital ward are orientation, window design (size and position), external shading device, glass transmittance and indoor surface reflectances. Parametric studies of daylighting design variables on the &#8216;base case&#8217; unit are formulated in order to find the remedy as well as to arrive at design guidelines. The Subang TRY weather data set is used and examined and found the two worst conditions days of the year: the hottest (day 60) and the cloudy (day 299). Evaluation criteria for measuring thermal as well as visual comfort are established to critically analyse the consequences of the variants in the permutations. A total of 186 simulations are run to appraise the comfort condition of the computer model of the four-bed ward environment. The simulation of daylighting conditions in a four-bed ward environment would take into consideration the magnitude of solar heat gain of one exposed wall (opaque wall and glass window) for the two selected worst days of the year and the &#8216;best&#8217; orientation (other enclosing elements are taken as adiabatic). The results of the parametric study are analysed by adopting the process of elimination for the selection of variants. The variants of design variables that satisfy the evaluation criteria for comfort criteria set in the study are identified. Design recommendations are made and guidelines on how best to achieve visual comfort through daylighting design strategies in the hospital ward environment in the future are established. The findings arrive at two crucial conclusions in creating a healing environment. Firstly, visual comfort can be achieved through appropriate daylighting design.The second is that in order to achieve visual comfort in the four-bed ward environment there is a need to find a balance between the acceptable magnitude of solar heat gain and satisfying the requirement of daylighting (i.e. the acceptable limit of glare not exceeding a luminance ratio of 10 and 1% DF).</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Healing architecture</field><field name="subject">Healing environment</field><field name="subject">Hospital design</field><field name="subject">Healthcare facilities</field><field name="subject">Daylighting design</field><field name="subject">Daylighting and lighting</field><field name="subject">Environment</field><field name="subject">Hospital lighting</field><field name="subject">Lighting</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206330</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Landscape matrix development intensity and its impact on mammals</field><field name="creator">Megan Brady</field><field name="description">Landscape modification resulting in habitat loss, fragmentation and intensification of land use is a serious threat to the earth&#8217;s biological diversity and the primary cause of the current extinction crisis. Recent research suggests the human-modified area of the landscape (that is not &#8216;traditional&#8217; habitat for native species but potentially once was), or the &#8216;matrix&#8217; (as it is hereafter called) has a major influence on wildlife persistence in modified landscapes. However, the matrix is a poorly studied and inadequately understood element of a modified landscape. There are at least two reasons for this. Firstly, the predominance of island biogeography and metapopulation theories in ecological thinking ensured that the matrix has historically been ignored in ecological research. Secondly, it is difficult to analyse matrix effects without confounding effects of habitat loss, habitat fragmentation and other aspects of landscape modification. As landscapes are modified attributes of the matrix co-vary with attributes of patches and landscapes, entangling their relative impacts on wildlife. Thus to investigate the independent influence of the matrix on mammals I selected 19 study landscapes by rigorous criteria to control for all potentially confounding patch and landscape attributes such as remnant forest patch size, shape, vegetation type, condition and position in the landscape, presence of any large (potential &#8216;source&#8217;) native forest patches within the landscape unit, as well as matrix land use composition and history. A study landscape was defined as the area within a 500 m radius of a remnant forest patch edge. Landscapes were selected along a gradient of rural-suburban residential development spanning the broadest achievable range of what I call &#8216;matrix development intensity&#8217;. This gradient was quantified by a novel weighted road-length metric that considered multiple road attributes to give significance to the ecological impact of different roads. Mammals and their habitat were sampled in three landscape elements within each landscape: remnant patch core, remnant patch edge and matrix to allow a landscape level inference. Mammals were sampled by a combination of Elliott traps, wire cage traps, hair funnels, scats and direct sightings. Thirty environmental variables were measured including habitat structure and disturbance and a full floristic survey was conducted. The matrix intensity gradient was characterised by increased anthropogenic disturbance such as increased housing density, closer proximity of sample sites to houses and higher human disturbance across the landscape mosaic, including in the core of remnant patches. However, matrix intensity was not the greatest source of overall variation in structural and floristic habitat attributes. Therefore the confounding of matrix effects with effects of remnant forest patch habitat attributes were successfully ruled out. Management actions of individual landholders can shape habitat attributes essential to mammals across the landscape mosaic. Mammal response to matrix intensity was species specific. Several native species declined in abundance, others were more resilient to moderate levels of matrix intensity, one species increased in abundance, and at least one species appeared unaffected by matrix intensity. Native species richness peaked at moderate levels, while exotic species richness and feral predators increased with matrix intensity and were negatively correlated with native species. Species response to matrix intensity appeared related to their use of edge or matrix habitat. However, an ability to use the matrix per se may not translate into an ability to persist in a landscape where development substantially reduces the habitat or movement value of the matrix. Seven a priori models of various remnant patch habitat, landscape and matrix influences on terrestrial mammal species richness were tested. Matrix attributes were the most important determinants of species richness. Matrix development intensity had a strong negative effect while matrix vegetation structural complexity had a strong positive effect on mammal species richness. Distance to the nearest remnant forest habitat was relatively unimportant. I hypothesised that thresholds of matrix intensity would exist where native species decline in abundance and exotic and native synanthropic species increase to dominate the mammal community. Thresholds were found for abundance of all native terrestrial species combined, macropod abundance and exotic rodent abundance. However, threshold models were only better than linear or cubic models for exotic rodent abundance. Matrix development intensity has a pervasive impact across the whole landscape mosaic that results in a complex range of environmental changes that individually and collectively impact the mammal community. Drawing on all results, I present a conceptual model of the overall impact of matrix development intensity on mammal community integrity. I conclude that a structurally complex matrix within a human-modified landscape can provide supplementary habitat resources and increase the probability of successful species movement across the landscape. Research needs to incorporate empirical data of specific matrix effects into models and theory of species distribution and abundance in human-modified landscapes. This can help guide application of management actions and landscape planning principles across different landscapes. Planning authorities and land managers need to explicitly acknowledge the importance of the matrix and the numerous factors that could be manipulated, such as retention or restoration of a structural vegetation layer that can assist mammal movement across the matrix, for greater landscape-wide conservation outcomes.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">06 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Matrix</field><field name="subject">landscape mosaic</field><field name="subject">mammals</field><field name="subject">edge</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">habitat fragmentation</field><field name="subject">urbanisation</field><field name="subject">urban-rural gradient</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:209484</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Breaking the Circle of Blame Achieving best practice ecological performance on medium to large scale mixed use precinct developments.</field><field name="creator">Richard Moore</field><field name="description" /><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">12 Built Environment and Design</field><field name="subject">Client/Developer Development Champion Project Manager Process Management, Sustainable Development and Sustainability Quality of Life Framework</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:209976</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on Tyrian purple and its precursors from Australian molluscs.</field><field name="creator">Baker, Joseph Thomas.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">03 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="subject">Purple.</field><field name="subject">Dyes and dyeing.</field><field name="subject">Mollusks.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:215452</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Some studies in protein chemistry</field><field name="creator">Augusteyn, Robert Cornelis.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">0601 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="subject">Proteins.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:215522</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The characteristics of hydrocyclones : and their application as control units in comminution circuits</field><field name="creator">Rao, T.

archaeology in Australia, and consider the implications of these relationships for the public  outreach strategies of Australian archaeologists. First, I review the limited survey data available regarding public opinions of archaeology in Australia, together with the results from more  extensive surveys conducted in North America. These surveys suggest that popular perceptions of archaeology include a variety of misconceptions that are incongruous with the ethical goals of the  profession. Second, I develop a theoretical model of mass media that articulates the nature of the relationships between the producers of mass media and their audiences. This model predicts that  widespread popular notions of archaeology are likely to be reflected in the texts of mainstream mass media. Third, I present the results of a content analysis study undertaken in relation to  archaeological documentary programs screened on Australian television, demonstrating that a number of misconceptions about archaeology are strongly reinforced by these programs. This suggests that  such misconceptions are deeply entrenched within contemporary Australian society. Finally, I identify a number of pathways along which archaeologists might seek to engage mass media as part of a  broader 'popularisation' approach to public outreach in Australian archaeology.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">370302 Social and Cultural Anthropology</field><field name="subject">archaeology</field><field name="subject">public archaeology</field><field name="subject">media</field><field name="subject">documentary</field><field name="subject">Australian television</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:9459</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Non-Financial Returns of Enterprise-Led Development Assistance - A Study of Energy-Related Enterprises</field><field name="creator">Kolominskas, Chaim</field><field name="description">The Rural Energy Enterprise Development (REED) initiative provides assistance to energy-related enterprises to prepare them for growth and to make eventual investments by          mainstream financial partners less risky.

This study concludes that desired development outcomes should provide the basis for programme objectives against which          non-financial returns can be measured. However, qualitative information is also necessary, as the context within which an enterprise operates largely defines the importance of these          returns. Further work to improve the understanding of this context is necessary prior to the development of a formalised monitoring programme.

However, a recent review of information available for the British Iron Age identified a relative lack of systematised information for Wales and consequently there is a pressing          need to re-examine the settlement record for this area, as the belief in a single Iron Age "culture" gives way to recognition of regional difference in material cultures, social          institutions and life-ways. This thesis examines the settlements and landscape of West Wales in an attempt to contribute to our understanding of this region in the Iron Age. In order to          make a regionally synthesised investigation of the social, I conducted a survey of excavation and survey information for Iron Age settlements in West Wales. Analysis centred on examining          the spatial patterning of settlements by considering the morphology, distribution, placement and structure of settlements, their place in the landscape and regional trends in the          structuring of space and artefacts. The investigation was contextualised within the wider body of material for the Iron Age in Britain. The use of landscape theory as an interpretive          framework in examining the spatial patterning of the material culture in the Iron Age proved an effective method for interpreting domestic settlements within the lived landscape. Social and          cosmological relations within settlements and within the referential structuring of a landscape, particularly with respect to pre-existing monuments, were suggested by the analysis. By          comparing these trends in the structuring of settlements within the landscape to settlements elsewhere in Britain, a distinct and regional culture for the Iron Age of West Wales was          identified.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">370402 Social and Cultural Geography</field><field name="subject">430203 Archaeology of Complex Societies - Europe, the Mediterranean and the Levant</field><field name="subject">Iron Age</field><field name="subject">Wales</field><field name="subject">Britain</field><field name="subject">landscape</field><field name="subject">archaeology</field><field name="subject">settlement</field><field name="subject">hillfort</field><field name="subject">enclosed</field><field name="subject">prehistory</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:8996</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gidyea Fire: A Study of the Transformation and Maintenance of Aboriginal Place Properties on the Georgina River</field><field name="creator">Long, Stephen</field><field name="description">In this thesis a platform of knowledge is provided for the development of enhanced Indigenous cultural heritage legislation by examining the specific nature of the cultural heritage of a Queensland Aboriginal group, the Dajarra Aboriginal community of Northwest Queensland for whom the Georgina River is a heartland in their cultural geography. The thesis was conducted during a period when the Queensland Government began to recognize demands for more effective Indigenous cultural heritage legislation. Queensland's latest Aboriginal cultural heritage legislation, introduced in 2004, emerged from a history of legislation dominated by an archaeological model of cultural heritage. However, despite some improvements this new legislation has maintained a physically orientated model of cultural heritage. Therefore Queensland's Indigenous societies, their places, place knowledge and certain types of place-specific behaviours continue to be exposed to imposed change. The thesis examines the 'lifeworld', the 'everyday' experiences of place of the Dajarra community. A broad definition of culture and an interactive model of place, coupled with a phenomenological approach provide a theoretical framework to engage with and describe cultural heritage as Dajarra people themselves experience it. The cultural heritage of Dajarra people involves interactions with a diversity of places and various combinations of behavioural, knowledge and physical properties. All of the places examined were interrelated with other places to form both small and large-scale place complexes. This dissertation reveals that the cultural heritage of an Aboriginal community lies not just in the physical environment but also in the diverse everyday people-environment interactions of that community. Effective cultural heritage legislation must be capable of encompassing this diversity. Cultural heritage is essentially dynamic, it is found in processes of change, it is found in ongoing people-environment interactions as well as those of the past. It is argued that Aboriginal people hold 'active cultural heritage rights'; these are rights to interact with places and rights to control action in places. Ideal cultural heritage legislation would recognize these active rights and provide for Aboriginal control of them, that is, Aboriginal defined and controlled change. This study reveals that it is difficult to separate places in time and space from other places with which they are co-dependent or inextricably intertwined. Studies of Aboriginal people-environment interactions and legislative measures must respond to the broader place complexes within which individual places are embedded and within which the everyday experiences of place are had. It is shown that there is a range of ways that an Aboriginal cultural heritage community can be defined and a range of Aboriginal people that might have interests in the cultural heritage of an area. Lastly, the thesis calls for the adoption of an interactive model of place as a foundation to cultural heritage studies and legislation in order to respond to the cultural heritage of Aboriginal people as they themselves experience it and wish to experience it.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="subject">750309 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander development and welfare</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal cultural heritage</field><field name="subject">place</field><field name="subject">place theory</field><field name="subject">Dajarra</field><field name="subject">Georgina River</field><field name="subject">people-environment interactions</field><field name="subject">Waluwarra</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal environments</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:8675</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental Risk Factors for Parkinson's Disease</field><field name="creator">Gartner, Coral E.</field><field name="description">Parkinson&#8217;s disease (PD) is a progressive, degenerative, neurological disease. The progressive disability associated with PD results in substantial burdens for those with the condition, their families and society in terms of increased health resource use, earnings loss of affected individuals and family caregivers, poorer quality of life, caregiver burden, disrupted family relationships, decreased social and leisure activities, and deteriorating emotional well-being. Currently, no cure is available and the efficacy of available treatments, such as medication and surgical interventions, decreases with longer duration of the disease. Whilst the cause of PD is unknown, genetic and environmental factors are believed to contribute to its aetiology. Descriptive and analytical epidemiological studies have been conducted in a number of countries in an effort to elucidate the cause, or causes, of PD. Rural residency, farming, well water consumption, pesticide exposure, metals and solvents have been implicated as potential risk factors for PD in some previous epidemiological studies. However, there is substantial disagreement between the results of existing studies. Therefore, the role of environmental exposures in the aetiology of PD remains unclear. The main component of this thesis consists of a case-control study that assessed the contribution of environmental exposures to the risk of developing PD. An existing, previously unanalysed, dataset from a local case-control study was analysed to inform the design of the new case-control study. The analysis results suggested that regular exposure to pesticides and head injury were important risk factors for PD. However, due to the substantial limitations of this existing study, further confirmation of these results was desirable with a more robustly designed epidemiological study. A new exposure measurement instrument (a structured interviewer-delivered questionnaire) was developed for the new case-control study to obtain data on demographic, lifestyle, environmental and medical factors. Prior to its use in the case-control study, the questionnaire was assessed for test-retest repeatability in a series of 32 PD cases and 29 healthy sex-, age- and residential suburb-matched electoral roll controls. High repeatability was demonstrated for lifestyle exposures, such as smoking and coffee/tea consumption (kappas 0.70-1.00). The majority of environmental exposures, including use of pesticides, solvents and exposure to metal dusts and fumes, also showed high repeatability (kappas &gt;0.78). A consecutive series of 163 PD case participants was recruited from a neurology clinic in Brisbane. One hundred and fifty-one (151) control participants were randomly selected from the Australian Commonwealth Electoral Roll and individually matched to the PD cases on age (&#177; 2 years), sex and current residential suburb. Participants ranged in age from 40-89 years (mean age 67 years). Exposure data were collected in face-to-face interviews. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using conditional logistic regression for matched sets in SAS version 9.1. Consistent with previous studies, ever having been a regular smoker or coffee drinker was inversely associated with PD with dose-response relationships evident for packyears smoked and number of cups of coffee drunk per day. Passive smoking from ever having lived with a smoker or worked in a smoky workplace was also inversely related to PD. Ever having been a regular tea drinker was associated with decreased odds of PD. Hobby gardening was inversely associated with PD. However, use of fungicides in the home garden or occupationally was associated with increased odds of PD. Exposure to welding fumes, cleaning solvents, or thinners occupationally was associated with increased odds of PD. Ever having resided in a rural or remote area was inversely associated with PD. Ever having resided on a farm was only associated with moderately increased odds of PD. Whilst the current study&#8217;s results suggest that environmental exposures on their own are only modest contributors to overall PD risk, the possibility that interaction with genetic factors may additively or synergistically increase risk should be considered. The results of this research support the theory that PD has a multifactorial aetiology and that environmental exposures are some of a number of factors to contribute to PD risk. There was also evidence of interaction between some factors (eg smoking and welding) to moderate PD risk.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="subject">321202 Epidemiology</field><field name="subject">environmental exposures</field><field name="subject">exposure assessment</field><field name="subject">environmental health</field><field name="subject">Parkinson's disease</field><field name="subject">case-control study</field><field name="subject">neurodegenerative disease</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:12921</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of taxation on put-call parity and option exercise behavior</field><field name="creator">Alpert, K.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">350301 Finance</field><field name="subject">720106 Taxation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:106726</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification and characterisation of bacterial multi-copper oxidases and their potential role in iron acquisition</field><field name="creator">Huston, W.

In Queensland, Australia, a class of temporary traffic signs is used for roadwork applications, and has recently been expanded to include Multiple-Message Signs: a novel, and as yet empirically untested system, which presents numerous advantages in terms of flexibility and economy. However, potential Human Factors problems surround aspects of the design of multiple message signs. In particular, the efficiency with which information is communication may be compromised relative to single message signs. The project involved a series of laboratory studies focussing on the behavioural requirements of temporary roadworks signs, beginning with the improvement of response characteristics of a sign used to communicate lane-closure. In the first empirical study, a proposed redesign of the Lane-Status sign based on principles of warning communication was found to be more effective than the original sign. The same sign was then examined in the context of multiple-message presentation, and significant cost s with respect to the speed and accuracy of responses relative to single-message presentation were found. A subsequent study investigated multiple-message presentation of speed limit information, which is more familiar and widely encountered than lane-closure information. Similar costs for multiple-message presentation were found. However, there were data to suggest that the additional information in multiple-message signs, if used correctly, may offer drivers and additional incentive to reduce speed. The next two studies were concerned with the effects of presentation, content type (e.g., speed-limit, symbolic and text-based) and visual clutter on recognition and visual search for traffic signs. The presentation of information via multiple message signs was compared with spatially distributed single message signs, with information matched with respect to message length and sign content. Overall advantages for multiple message presentation were found for recognition, which were particularly robust for speed limit information. The results for visual search indicated some benefits to multiple message presentation, but were less decisive than those for recognition. The final two studies investigated the possibility of improving response characteristics of single-message signs with sequential, rather then individual presentation. The role of the temporal interval between successive sign presentations was explored, which has implications for the feasibility of sequential presentation in practice. In addition, the nature of sign pairs presented in sequence &#8211; identical, or of the same meaning &#8211; was found to be important. Generally, benefits to sequential presentation diminished with increases in the temporal separation interval. In terms of practical implications, the viability of introducing the proposed design changes to the Lane Status sign is discussed. The results pertaining to multiple-message sign are evaluated in the context of published design guidelines, and theoretical and practical issues surrounding sequential sign presentation are reviewed. Finally, possibilities for future research, in part based on the limitations of the current work, are expounded.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">380303 Computer Perception, Memory and Attention</field><field name="subject">380101 Sensory Processes, Perception and Performance</field><field name="subject">690101 Road safety</field><field name="subject">multiple-message sign</field><field name="subject">single-message sign</field><field name="subject">Human Factors</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:114219</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re-thinking helping and altruism: A social identity perspective</field><field name="creator">Lai, S. H.</field><field name="description">Research on helping and altruism has been revitalized by the shift in focus from individual and interpersonal processed to group processed in the last decade. In particular, the social identity approach (Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1979; Turner, 1985; Turner, Hogg, Oakes, Reicher, &amp; Wetherell, 1987), which ahs been increasingly applied to helping situations, has provided a valuable group perspective on helping behaviour. The significance of social groups and shared identity for altruism has also been suggested (e.g., Monroe, 1996; Sober &amp; Wilson, 1998). Although helping and altruism are typically undifferentiated, central to altruism is the issue of motivation, which as additional theoretical and applied implications. The eight studies reported in this thesis aimed to build upon current social identity research on helping behaviour and to extend the social identity approach to altruism. In line with the social identity perspective, factors associated with group membership were expected to have important implication for individual helping decisions, especially among high identifying group members. Studies 1 to 3 tested the combined effects of target group membership and group identification on individual helping intentions. In all three studies, participant completed an ingroup identification scale and reported their intentions to help the target, who was either an ingroup or an outgroup member. Consistent with expectations, high identifiers were willing to offer more help to a more ingroup-like target in study 1 (N = 141). However, in Study 2 (N = 93). High identifiers offered more help to an outgroup than to an ingroup target. In an attempt to clarify these conflicting finding, Study 3 (N = 138) examined group members&#8217; helping responses in a group-relevant and a group-irrelevant helping situation. Results indicated that high identifiers were more willing to help an outgroup target when the helping situation was group-irrelevant rather than group-relevant. The helping intentions of low identifiers were largely unaffected by the group membership of the target or the group-relevance of the helping dimension. In a further analysis of the impact of target group membership on helping behaviour, Study 4 considered the moderating effects of perceived need on intergroup helping decisions. Using a realistic helping paradigm, participants (N = 94) heard a voice recording of a request for help from either an ingroup or an outgroup target, who expressed either a high or a low need for help. Where as people were more likely to help the ingroup than the outgroup target when there was a high need for help, the group membership of the target did not affect helping decisions when the need for help was low. While Studies 1 to 4 elaborated on the role of social identity factors in intergroup helping contexts, Studies 5 and 6 Focused on helping with intragroup contexts by considering how the intragroup position of the target can also influence people&#8217;s helping intentions. In Study 5 (N = 166), social identity salience was manipulated, whereas ingroup identification was measured in Study 6 (N = 118). Participants in both studies were then presented with a profile of either a prototypical or a non-prototypical target and were asked to indicate their helping intentions. As predicted, people who perceived their ingroup identity to be more salient (Study 5) or identified more highly with the ingroup (Study 6) were willing to offer more help to the prototypical than to the non-prototypical target. In addition, concern for the target was found to be a mediator in predicting individual helping intentions. The final two studies investigated social identity processed in field settings. Study 7 (N =618) assessed both helping intentions and behaviour in the context of a charity door-knock appeal. Respondents in both studies completed a survey, which included measures of group identification, concern, and helping intentions. Greater identification with the group was associated with increased willingness to contribute to the community (Study 7) and intentions to donate more money to the door-knock appeal (Study 8). Further more, the relationship between group identification and individual helping intentions was mediated by concern. Together, these eight studies highlighted the complexities of social identity influences on helping behavior as well as the contributions that the social identity approach can make to the study of helping and altruism.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:119790</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of the taxonomy and ecology of the oscillatoriales (Cyanoprokaryota) of north-eastern Australia</field><field name="creator">MacGregor, G.

There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Numerical Simulation of a Hot Dry Rock Geothermal Reservoir in the Cooper Basin, South Australia</field><field name="creator">Bronwyn Muller</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the development and production of numerical simulations of the creation of a Hot Dry Rock (HDR) geothermal reservoir. This geothermal reservoir that was simulated is owned by Geodynamics Limited and is located in the Cooper Basin, South Australia. The simulations show the geometry of the geothermal reservoir and predict the productive lifespan of the reservoir. Geothermal energy, which is the thermal energy that is stored in the interior of the earth, is an enormous energy source and as such there is great interest in technology that allows this energy to be harnessed. The HDR process of extracting the geothermal energy from rock involves drilling a borehole to a suitable depth and injecting cold water into the rock via this well (known as the injection well) to create a reservoir by opening up fractures in the rock. As water is forced through the reservoir, heat is extracted from the rock via conduction and transferred to the water, creating an heat exchange. Warm water is brought to the surface via another well known as the extraction well. The heat from the water is used to generate electricity and then the water is fed back into the injection well, completing the cycle. The creation of a HDR geothermal reservoir comprises of many aspects: the injection of the fluid into the jointed rock system, the opening and shearing of the joints, the creation of the fluid reservoir in the rock and the temperature effects of the fluid flow through the joints. This work incorporates all of these aspects. Due to the multi-physics nature of this process multiple computational modelling strategies were implemented to allow for authentic simulation of the entire process. The mechanical rock behaviour was primarily simulated the Distinct Element Method. This two dimensional Distinct Element Method program allowed for a realistically scaled model of the whole geothermal reservoir to be developed. This model was particularly useful for modelling the joint behaviour as the discrete nature of this method compares well with the joint system on such a scale. A discrete particle based model was used to model the joint behaviour on a small scale. These models demonstrated the behaviour of joints under compressional strain, showing slip and the effects of joint dilatancy. The productive lifespan of the geothermal reservoir was modelled using a Finite Element Method program based on Darcy's Law and an height-averaged heat equation. The aim of this model was to simulate the effects on the rock temperature of the fluid flow through the reservoir. The lifespan of the reservoir with differing well geometries was tested using this model to show which geometry would extend the productive lifetime of the geothermal reservoir. The results produced from the DEM models showed that the reservoir geometry is very much dependent upon the joint angle, and under the Cooper Basin stress regime steeper joints will be more likely to open. Joint dilatancy also affects the fluid flow rates as the amount of joint opening is dependent upon the joint dilatancy angle. The modelling of the temperature drawdown of the rock due to the fluid flow showed that a square configuration of wells is the ideal configuration to prolong the productive lifespan of the HDR geothermal reservoir. Results produced with the modelling parameters provided by Geodynamics Limited indicate that the productive lifespan of the Cooper Basin HDR geothermal reservoir created is approximately 50 years. This reservoir is only one of many that can be created at the site to prolong the productivity of the energy plant. The combined results of this modelling strategy give an overall image of the creation and lifetime of the HDR geothermal energy plant in the Cooper Basin.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">260000 Earth Sciences</field><field name="subject">HDR</field><field name="subject">geothermal</field><field name="subject">Cooper Basin</field><field name="subject">Geodynamics</field><field name="subject">finite element</field><field name="subject">distinct element</field><field name="subject">Escript</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:173606</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding indigenous entrepreneurship: A case study analysis</field><field name="creator">Foley. Denis L.</field><field name="description">This PhD research project views and examines the socio-economic environment of the urban Indigenous Australian entrepreneur. The proposed research project explores Indigenous entrepreneurs. As they experience enlightenment, empowerment and emancipation through success in business, do they identify less with Indigenous culture and more with the Anglo-European values of the dominant Australian or American culture? Do successful Indigenous entrepreneurs, in effect, need to take on or adopt values of the dominant Anglo-European culture to remain successful in business? Are there impediments/inhibitors existing that restrict business growth and subsequent success to the Indigenous entrepreneur? From case study analysis and literature review, is the Indigenous entrepreneur different in comparison with the non-indigenous entrepreneur? Does entrepreneurship free the Indigenous business person from the welfare system? These are the questions that this research attempts to answer. The project involved a case study analysis of twenty five contemporary urban Indigenous Australian entrepreneurs geographically spread from Hobart, Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane and Cairns and a few major regional centres. The Hawaiian study was similar with twenty five case studies from the major urban centres on the islands of Oahu, Molokai, Kauai, Hawaii and Maui. The Hawaiian study also included a control study of sixteen non-Hawaiian minority entrepreneurs to ensure that the Hawaiian findings were objective. Indigenous Standpoint theory was applied together with a Grounded theory approach to ensure that the research was based in an Indigenous epistemological approach to knowledge. Constant comparative coding was used to ensure the qualitative data was analysed using a semi structured format. The outcomes of the study provide a rich insight into the world of minority entrepreneurs who operate within post-colonial cultures of western dominance and negative stereotypes that have created welfare dependant societies. In summary the outcomes identify that the intrinsic motivator for Indigenous entrepreneurs is to provide for their family, to give their children a better life than what they experienced, and to escape the entrapments of poverty. Racism and discrimination combined with lack of capital and access to micro-credit were seen as the major inhibitors to business success. The Indigenous entrepreneurs are struggling to cast off the shackles of welfare, to no longer be at the mercy of successive government programmes. The study results indicate that success in small enterprise undertakings by Indigenous entrepreneurs is a move up from self management, success in entrepreneurial activity is self-determination for those entrepreneurs. The end result is one of micro-economic reform within the Indigenous families who benefit from the success in small business enterprise and entrepreneurial activity. Indigenous values in Hawaii were maintained with a strong connection to land and language, whether it be spoken or not by the entrepreneur. It was the values attached to language that included a strong work ethic, maturity and respect that were seen to be dominant issues. Within Indigenous Australia the result of genocide inflicted on successive Indigenous generations has not destroyed Indigenous Australian culture altogether. Strong views remain concerning protocol and ethics, what has evolved are contemporary Indigenous values that allow the Indigenous Australian to maintain cultural standards revolving around kinship in contemporary Australia.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="subject">350299 Business and Management not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">indigenous entrepreneurship</field><field name="subject">case study research</field><field name="subject">minority groups</field><field name="subject">entrepreneurship</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179923</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Indigenous living conditions problem: 'Need', policy construction, and potential for change</field><field name="creator">Thompson, Lester</field><field name="description" /><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">160104 Social and Cultural Anthropology</field><field name="subject">379902 Aboriginal Studies</field><field name="subject">750309 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander development and welfare</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians -- Social conditions.</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians -- Government relations.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184608</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Deregulating and developing dairy-food chain relationships: Implications for farm business management in south east Queensland</field><field name="creator">Parker, Amanda Jane</field><field name="description" /><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">0701 Agriculture, Land and Farm Management</field><field name="subject">1503 Business and Management</field><field name="subject">Dairy farms -- Economic aspects -- Queensland.</field><field name="subject">Dairy products industry -- Deregulation -- Queensland.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184849</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rape and other sexual offences in Queensland : An historical and behavioral analysis</field><field name="creator">Barber, Ross Noel</field><field name="description" /><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rape -- Queensland</field><field name="subject">Sex crimes -- Research -- Queensland</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184894</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Widening horizons: The YWCA in Queensland 1888-1988</field><field name="creator">Gillespie, Aline</field><field name="description" /><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">16 Studies in Human Society</field><field name="subject">Young Womens' Christian Association of Australia -- History</field><field name="subject">Young Womens' Christian Association of Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Women -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185009</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Christian Brothers in secondary education in Queensland, 1875-1965.</field><field name="creator">Connole, P.

The biography of Crawford Munro (1904-76) describes his early life in Toowoomba and Sydney, and his maturation as an engineer, working for Sydney Water, Sydney Technical College and in the production of Cruiser tanks in World War II. He was a large confident man with a big voice and an optimistic, humorous personality. As the Foundation Professor of Civil Engineering at the University of New South Wales Munro was liberal, fostered humanist studies and developed the School of Engineering with a unique emphasis on water engineering. He recruited excellent staff for research and postgraduate education who led the nation across all phases of hydrology and hydraulics. Munro developed a remarkable, rational solution for flood mitigation at Launceston, and actively promoted research, partly through the Australian Water Research Foundation and the Institution of Engineers, Australia. He was much involved with predicting flood runoff, developing benefit/cost relations for irrigation schemes, which led him into public controversy, and other hydrological projects. Munro&#8217;s attempts to raise social consciousness about water problems, his multi-disciplinary approach to the evaluation of water resources and his campaigns for the collection of stream and rainfall data helped provide a better basis for proper planning. In his later years he undertook the first Australian environmental impact study. The concluding chapter outlines a vision for the current management of Australia&#8217;s water. Munro posed necessary questions about measuring the supply of water and bringing the demand of water into synchrony with its supply, while providing water security in terms of its availability and quality. He raised the debate about the balance between sustaining environmental flows, utilizing water for agriculture and secondary industry, and maintaining the health of communities. Munro hoped equitable decision making would emerge from public engagement on these issues. 2. Twentieth century science biography in Australia is the province of a group of elite male scientists, whose interests cover wide disciplinary fields; it is focused on popular imagination: health, food and adventure (Antarctica) accounting for fifteen of the seventeen scientists. Empathy for the subject is a significant feature of the nineteen biographers, of whom five are scientists. This small genre is often supported by institutions in small print runs. A key role of biography is to place through science history a more epistemologically plausible version of events. Public discourses of science treated in the essay include conflict about the attribution of scientific discovery, the vocation of the scientist as a contributor to a wider social polity, the light biography sheds on sources of creativity and the evolution of the research and culture of institutions. The biographer attempts to generate a personal portrait of the scientist which conveys authority about the significance and origins of his or her scientific discoveries and their impact in the wider social context. Daniel S&#246;derqvist&#8217;s affirmation of the existential approach which &#8216;emphasizes the freedom and responsibility of the human individual&#8217; resonates with the candidate as expressing characteristics of the lives of many Australian scientists in their passion for intellectual discovery, their motivation to self-empowerment, and their readiness top step outside their social conditioning. This essay extends S&#246;derqvist&#8217;s paradigm to the context of Australian science biography and indicates some constraints on its depiction which arise in the practice of writing science biography. Some epistemological issues are raised in the texts, especially when dealing with oral history and family mythology, and thematic, thematic within a chronological framework or chronological structures of the text are compared. The level of detail and context influence the sustainability of the reader&#8217;s interest. Case studies of the biographies written by the candidate (Ian Clunies Ross, Samuel Wadham, Allan Callaghan, Victor Trikojus, Raymond Hoffenberg and Crawford Munro) illustrate issues which arise in the writing of science biography. The dominant question is the relationship of the biographer to the subject, and this determines the voice the reader hears. The motivation of the biographer may arise in varying degrees of empathy felt for the subject. The high affinity the candidate had for Clunies Ross and Hoffenberg causes him to offer a defence against the charge of hagiography, and the selectivity and subjectivity of the biographer is evident in the arrangement and presentation of factual material. The motivation of the biographer is additionally directed to the communication of the subject&#8217;s research outputs to the wider Australian community, and in the case of Callaghan, Wadham and Clunies Ross there was a specific programmatic function of advancing the status of agricultural science. It is argued that the description of the public life of the subject needs to be complemented from the private life if the biographer is &#8216;to view the world through the eyes of the subject&#8217;.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">20 Language, Communication and Culture</field><field name="subject">science

community, the Lockyer Valley, Queensland</field><field name="creator">Oo, Khin</field><field name="description">This study was conducted in two shires of Laidley and Gatton in the Lockyer Valley in 1986. The research method used was a self-administered mail questionnaire sent to four hundred primary producers. The response rate received was 49.5 percent which is quite reasonable for a random sample of a non-specific interest group. The study area was divided into six zones based on the 198 respondents&#8217; assessment of the enterprise from which they derived major income. The main approach of this project was a situational analysis o the Lockyer Valley. Central to this research was identification of the pressure and extent of problems relating to several aspects of land use, notably soil erosion, weed infestation; availability and quality of water and more general community-based problems. The characteristics of farm households, the role of family members in decision-making and tasks related to farm as well as home, were also included in this study. The Lockyer Valley is a major production area of vegetables as well as a mixed farming area. Natural pasture, which was extensively found in Zone 6, was largely used for cattle grazing. Generally, rural women were better educated than their husbands, and the ratio of educational level of husband and wife was higher than previous research findings. A large number of producers and their wives have taken off-farm work, and women tended to spend more time in off-farm employment. Only 6.1 percent of producers&#8217; children had completed tertiary education and the majority of all sons were working on the farm. Partnership was found to be the major type of property ownership and inter-generational transfer of the property was the future plan. The producers who were from a non-farm upbringing and who had already taken up off-farm work intended to leave their properties at some time in the future. With the running of the farm business , 35 percent of rural women worked full-time in partnership with their husbands, and 42 percent worked part-time. However, 23 percent of rural women were homemakers and were not involved in running the farm business. The association between decision-making of husband and wife and situational factors such as ownership, involvement in farm tasks, record-keeping, education, on-farm upbringing and age were analysed. Joint involvement of wives in decision-making was to be related to ownership, farm tasks and record-keeping. However, husbands were more likely to take a major role in decision-making if they were more educated and had an on-farm upbringing. Age was found to be a factor affecting joint decision-making, although this result conflicted with findings of earlier research. The opinions of the farm community in identifying the problems of the specific small area in the Lockyer Valley were revealed. Lantana was the most severe weed problem in the whole catchment. The catchment area also had problems with wattle. The recommended control method of lantana was replacement by improved pasture, but it was adopted by few primary producers. Soil erosion in the form of gullies, bank erosion, sheet erosion, salinity and flooding were some of the problems perceived by the local community. Regular &#8216;slash and burn&#8217; was practised by most of the producers. This is one of the causes of land degradation. Bore, creek and river, and dam were the main water sources for farm supply and irrigation. Only 60 percent of bored had adequate water supply and good water quality. Farm dam and creek/river sources were less reliable due to the inadequate availability of water. Consequently, operators at about half the cropped farms had to stop growing some vegetables which were previously commercially successful. Within the context of farm family needs, emphasis was placed on conservation of water, because of the erosion and water problems. The community&#8217;s opinion on community development activities emphasised the involvement of farm families. Finally, suggestions for the extension program which should be emphasised on rural development by means of community participation were included. The bases for further studies was also provided in this report.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">070101 Agricultural Land Management</field><field name="subject">070102 Agricultural Land Planning</field><field name="subject">0701 Agriculture, Land and Farm Management</field><field name="subject">Lockyer Valley</field><field name="subject">farming communities</field><field name="subject">Queensland</field><field name="subject">primary producers</field><field name="subject">farm management</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:211168</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The tripartite model of anxiety and depression : a new look at theory and measurement</field><field name="creator">Boschen, Mark Justin.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences</field><field name="subject">780108 Behavioural and cognitive sciences</field><field name="subject">Anxiety -- Classification.</field><field name="subject">Depression, Mental -- Classification.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:216680</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Capturing a process an analysis of culture and subcultures in a changing university 1993-1995</field><field name="creator">Hiscock, Jane E</field><field name="description">The globalisation of the world economy and world markets has had far reaching effects on national economies as governments try to allocate funding to potentially profitable market areas.

Whilst results from ESS for CRS are generally good, postoperative bleeding and impaired wound healing with adhesion formation remains a concern. Due to patient discomfort and the detrimental effects on wound healing caused by most packing materials, many surgeons no longer routinely use nasal packing. Surgeons have in the past sought agents which would provide post-operative haemostasis without detrimentally affecting wound healing. Antifibrinolytics have been available for many years, however, their topical application has only been explored in the last few years. Recently different forms of chitosan have separately shown significant promise as powerful haemostatic and anti-adhesion agents. The aim of this thesis was to explore the progressive understanding of the interaction between haemostasis and wound healing with possible development of a novel agent. Methods: The first step to scientifically assess bleeding after sinus surgery was to develop a standardised method of video endoscopy and grading the surgical field during ESS. This was done as a multinational collaborative trial. Once this assessment tool was validated a randomised controlled trial evaluating the effect of two antifibrinolytics (epsilon aminocaproic acid and tranexamic acid) was conducted. Further evaluation was then conducted on other possible hemostatic and antiadhesion substances. This included various combinations of a novel chitosan gel. These gels were trialled in vitro to determine their effect on human nasal fibroblasts derived from CRS patients. Fibroblast adhesion and proliferation as well as closure of standardised wounds were studied. The most promising of these gels was then used in an in vivo sheep model. Once effectiveness of the chitosan-dextran gel was shown in the laboratory, this was evaluated against a number of currently available hemostatic and anti-adhesion substances in a standardised model of wound healing in sheep with CRS. This model had been previously extensively validated in our department. Full thickness mucosal injuries were created on the lateral nasal wall and ethmoids of twenty sheep and recombinant tissue factor (rTF), SprayGel or Chitosan-Dextran derivative gel applied topically in a randomized fashion. Adhesion formation and severity as well as microscopic wound healing and ciliary function were analysed at day 28, 56, 84 and 112 post initial surgery. A further sheep study was conducted applying chitosan dextran gel to standardised mucosal injuries and comparing its effect on the control of bleeding to control. Bleeding time and grade were recorded and wound healing monitored via serial videoendoscopy over two weeks and objectively measured. Results: a) Assessment of the bleeding scales showed that inter and intra observer reliability for both scales tested were significantly improved by employing a standardized video-endoscopy technique. The Wormald scale proved to be more reliable and sensitive to changes in the most common surgical fields encountered in ESS. b) Tranexamic acid showed a modest but clinically significant improvement in the surgical field at 2, 4 and 6 minutes after application. Epsilon aminocaproic acid did not effectively improve the surgical field. c) Nasal fibroblast adhesion and proliferation were significantly impaired with dextran and chitosan. The most effective ratio that delayed but did not prevent wound closure were 5 % chitosan: 5 % dextran gel. d) In a standardised sheep model of mucosal wound healing the chitosan gel significantly decreased lateral nasal wall and ethmoidal adhesions at all time points. The chitosan group had a significantly greater percentage of re-epithelialisation and reciliation than control and rTF. In addition the mean cilial grade in the chitosan group was significantly better than control. e) The chitosan dextran gel was significantly more haemostatic at 2,4, and 6 minutes after injury with no significant difference noted in wound healing. Conclusions: Standardised methods of videoendoscopy and grading the surgical field in ESS are valuable tools for further research. Tranexamic acid significantly improved the surgical field to a moderate degree in ESS compared to control. Chitosan gel is a promising new powerful haemostatic bio-polymer which has a mild inhibitory effect on fibroblast attachment and proliferation. This may partially explain the significant improvement in microscopic wound healing and reduction in adhesion formation seen in a sheep model of chronic sinusitis. Future work evaluating this gel in the setting of a human trial is currently underway.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">haemostasis; wound healing; chitosan; sinus surgery; antifibrinolytics; surgical field; tronexamic acid</field><field name="subject">Nasal mucosa Surgery.</field><field name="subject">Endoscopic surgery</field><field name="subject">Wound healing Physiology.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/58972</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assay and array technologies for G-protein coupled receptors.</field><field name="creator">Bailey, Kelly</field><field name="description">The overall aim of this thesis is to investigate strategies to aid in the measurement of G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) activity for high-throughput screening and sensing applications. GPCRs are cell surface receptors which have seven membrane spanning domains. They are the largest family of membrane proteins in the human genome and are involved in a number of physiological and pathophysiological pathways. They are the most widely targeted protein family for therapeutics being the target for over 30% of the currently available prescription drugs (Jacoby et al. 2006). For this reason commercial interest and investment into compound screening using these receptors as targets is of high importance in lead drug discovery. Additionally, the extensive ligand range of the GPCR superfamily, which includes light, odorants/ volatiles, neurotransmitters and hormones, make them an attractive biological recognition element in biosensor applications. This thesis demonstrates the functional expression of the H1-histamine, M2-muscarinic and &#945;&#8322;&#8336;-adrenergic receptors of the G-protein coupled receptor family, along with their associated G-proteins (G&#945;, G&#946; and G&#947;). Expression was achieved using the Sf9/baculovirus expression system. The G-proteins were successfully incorporated into an assay system using time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TRFRET). TR-FRET was used in order to create a homogeneous assay format capable of monitoring GPCR activation through the movement of the G-protein subunits. Fluorescence changes in the TR-FRET assay indicated a change in distance between the G&#945; subunit and G&#946;&#947; dimer. The separation of the G&#945; subunit and the G&#946;&#947; dimer after activation resulted in a significant decrease in TR-FRET measurement. The homogeneous set-up of the TR-FRET assay could potentially be adaptable to an array based format. This thesis describes the capture of vesicles containing functional GPCRs onto a solid substrate via the specific interaction between complementary oligonucleotides. GPCR presence and function within the immobilized vesicles, was demonstrated using fluorescent ligands. Further to this, alternative lipid hosts (to the vesicles), known as cubosomes, were introduced. When tagged with an oligonucleotide, these cubosome particles were also shown to immobilize site specifically onto a complementary oligonucleotide surface.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">G-protein coupled receptors; TR-FRET; G-protein assay; membrane protein array; vesicles; oligonucleotide-directed immobilisation; cubosomes</field><field name="subject">G proteins Receptors.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/59447</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multiple Objective Linear Programming in Radiotherapy Treatment Planning</field><field name="creator">Shao, Lizhen</field><field name="description">The aim of intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is to kill tumor cells while at the same time protecting the surrounding tissue and organs from the damaging effect of radiation. To achieve these goals computerized inverse planning systems are used. Given the number of beams and beam directions, beam intensity profiles that yield the best dose distribution under consideration of clinical and physical constraints are calculated. This is called beam intensity optimization problem. In this thesis, we first review existing mathematical models and computation methods for the beam intensity optimization problem. Next, we formulate the beam intensity optimization problem as a multiobjective linear programme (MOLP) with three objectives. For clinical cases this optimization problem involves thousands of variables and tens of thousands of constraints and existing methods such as multiobjective simplex methods can not handle it. The rest of the thesis is dedicated to developing methods to solve this large MOLP efficiently and to the application in the beam intensity optimization problem. Benson (1998c) argues that solving an MOLP in objective space needs less computation time than solving it in decision space if the number of objectives of the MOLP is much smaller than the number of variables. Moreover, the constraint matrix of the problem relies on the calculation of dose deposited in tissue. Since this calculation is always imprecise solving the MOLP exactly is not necessary in practice. This motivates us to develop algorithms for solving an MOLP in objective space approximately. We summarize Benson&#8217;s outer approximation algorithm for solving MOLPs in objective space and propose some small changes to improve computational performance. Then in order to approximate the true nondominated set we propose a modification of Benson&#8217;s algorithm which is called an approximation version of Benson&#8217;s algorithm. Our approximation algorithm computes an inner and an outer approximation of the nondominated set. We prove that the inner approximation provides a set of &#949;-nondominated points. The geometric duality theory of Heyde and L&#168;ohne (2006) defines a dual to an MOLP and it assures us to be able to find the nondominated set of the primal MOLP by solving its dual MOLP. Based on this we develop a dual variant of Benson&#8217;s outer approximation algorithm to solve the dual MOLP in objective space. We prove that solving the dual provides a weight set decomposition. We compare the primal algorithm and the dual algorithm on small illustrative and on radiotherapy examples. Furthermore, we propose an algorithm to solve the dual MOLP approximately but within specified tolerance. This approximate solution set can be used to calculate an approximation of the nondominated set of the primal MOLP.We show that this set is an &#949;-nondominated set of the original primal MOLP and provide numerical evidence that this approach can be faster than solving the primal MOLP approximately. Considering that the set of nondominated points is infinite, it is not very useful from the planners&#8217; point of view. We address the problem of finding well distributed nondominated points for an MOLP.We propose a method which combines the global shooting and normal boundary intersection methods. By doing so, we overcome the limitation of normal boundary intersection method that parts of the nondominated set may be missed. Discrepancy analysis of the nondominated points from a geometry point of view shows that this method produces evenly distributed nondominated  points. Moreover, the coverage error and the uniformity level can be measured. Finally, we apply the algorithms developed to the beam intensity optimization problem of 3D clinical cases with voxel size of 5mm and 3mm. A technique of reducing the resolution in normal tissue has been used to reduce the computation time. The results clearly illustrate the advantages of our methods.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2478</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The nature of the relationship of the Crown in New Zealand with iwi Maori</field><field name="creator">Healy, Susan</field><field name="description">This study investigates the nature of the relationship that the state in New Zealand, the Crown, has established with M&#257;ori as a tribally-based people. Despite the efforts of recent New Zealand Governments to address the history of Crown injustice to M&#257;ori, the relationship of the Crown with Iwi M&#257;ori continues to be fraught with contradictions and tension. It is the argument of the thesis that the tension exists because the Crown has imposed a social, political, and economic order that is inherently contradictory to the social, political, and economic order of the M&#257;ori tribal world. Overriding an order where relationships are negotiated and alliances built between autonomous groups, the Crown constituted itself as a government with single, undivided sovereignty, used its unilateral power to introduce policy and legislation that facilitated the dispossession of wh&#257;nau and hap&#363; of their resources and their authority in the land, and enshrined its own authority and capitalist social relations instead. The thesis is built round a critical reading of five Waitangi Tribunal reports, namely the Muriwhenua Fishing Report, Mangonui Sewerage Report, The Te Roroa Report, Muriwhenua Land Report, and Te Whanau o Waipareira Report.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2930</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The mechanics of rocking structures subjected to ground motion</field><field name="creator">Ma, Quincy Tsun Ming</field><field name="description">This thesis describes an investigation into the dynamic response of structures that are permitted to rock or uplift when subjected to ground excitations. Previous studies have demonstrated that rocking motion can mitigate undesirable seismic actions on structures, and this has been further confirmed through extensive numerical time integration analyses in the present study. Despite the intuitive nature of rocking motion, it has been shown that the underlying process is in fact highly complex, sensitive to initial conditions, consequently history dependent and by no means well understood. The present work aims to contribute to the current understanding of the fundamental mechanics of rocking systems. With the aid of experimental data, the dynamic response of free rocking rigid blocks, controlled rocking systems and simple rocking structures was closely examined. It was found that Housner&#8217;s simple rocking model remains the most theoretically consistent and is the simplest model to implement. The result is also generally satisfactory for modelling rigid rocking blocks, apart from the model's inability to correctly predict energy dissipation at impacts. The migration of the rotation centre during rocking was identified as central to understand the dynamic characteristics of a controlled rocking system (an elastically restrained rocking system). A novel approach was proposed to describe the rotation centre&#8217;s migration behaviour. Then by considering the energy content of the system, the pseudo-static force-displacement behaviour of a controlled rocking wall was able to be accurately predicted. This was then successfully extended to predict the timehistory response of controlled rocking systems. Finally, new formulations were developed for predicting the time-history response of three idealised rocking structural systems from first principles. These were validated against published shake table tests results. Two of the highlights arising from these formulations were 1) a set of simplified, closed form formulae which precisely predicted the nonlinear static force-displacement relationship of a rigid rocking structure on flexible ground, and 2) the governing differential equations for a flexible structure rocking on rigid ground. This latter outcome provided users with a valuable quantitative tool for assessing the benefit of implementing a rocking isolation solution.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5861</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bayesian calibration of geothermal reservoir models via Markov Chain Monte Carlo</field><field name="creator">Cui, Tiangang</field><field name="description">The aim of the research described in this thesis is the development of methods for  solving computationally intensive computer model calibration problems by sample  based inference.

In this study, the Bayesian framework is employed to construct the posterior  distribution over all model parameters consistent with the measured data, accounting  for various uncertainties in the calibration process. To construct the posterior  distribution for computer model calibration problems, several methods such as the  additive bias framework of Kennedy and O'Hagan (2001) and the enhanced error  model (Kaipio and Somersalo, 2007) are investigated.  Then, the solutions of computer model calibration problems are given by estimating  the expected value of statistics of interest over the posterior distribution.  Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm  (Metropolis et al., 1953; Hastings, 1970) in particular, is empoyed to explore  the posterior distribution, and Monte Carlo integration is used to calculating the  expected values.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5944</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Totara Valley micro-hydro development : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Applied Science in Renewable Energy Engineering, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Donnelly, David Ronald</field><field name="description">This study focuses on the design, construction and operation of a distributed generation system based on micro-hydro technology. The project is sited in the Totara Valley, a small rural community approximately 70km from the Massey University, Turitea campus, Palmerston North. The Massey University Centre for Energy Research (MUCER) has a long history of renewable energy research within the Totara Valley community. This project complements these existing schemes and provides a foundation for future research into distributed generation technologies. The project encompasses the following objectives: - to gain practical experience in the design, engineering and implementation of a distributed generation system in rural New Zealand; - to evaluate contemporary micro-hydro technology and compare the performance of this equipment in a theoretical and practical context; - to identify barriers that hinder the widespread adoption of micro-hydro systems in rural New Zealand; - to develop a spreadsheet based life cycle costing tool. The results from this study demonstrate that economic considerations are the fundamental aspect to be considered when assessing the long-term viability of these projects. The viability of micro-hydro projects are primarily determined by four factors: - the volume and head (height) of water available above the turbine site; - the length and therefore the cost of the pipeline required for transporting water to the turbine; - the legal and administrative costs involved in obtaining a resource consent to maintain access to the water resources; - the prices received and paid for electricity. Considerable charges were payable to the local authority to secure and maintain the right to harness the water resources at this site. This cost contributed considerable risk to the project and creates a significant barrier to establishing similar systems at other sites. The reduction of resource consent charges to levels that fairly reflect the negligible environmental impacts of these projects would encourage the adoption of this technology and deliver benefits to rural New Zealand communities.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">micro-hydro technology</field><field name="subject">distributed generation system</field><field name="subject">renewable energy</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">construction</field><field name="subject">viability</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291100 Environmental Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/695</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The electronic, structural, and magnetic properties of the chromium dihalides - from the gas-phase to the solid-state : a thesis submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements of the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Theoretical Chemistry at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Vest, Brian Michael</field><field name="description">Unrestricted Kohn-Sham (broken symmetry) density functional calculations have been used to determine the low-energy geometries of the chromium dihalide molecules (CrX2) and their clusters, Cr2X4, Cr3X6, and Cr4X8. The monomers are also investigated at a higher level, including coupled-cluster and state-average CASSCF computations. Our calculations show that the monomers have a 5B2 ground state arising from the Renner-Teller distorted 5IIg transition state, leading to a bent geometry. The global minima of the gas-phase clusters of CrF2 and CrCl2 consist of two-dimensional, anti-ferromagnetically coupled chains of CrX2 units forming four-membered, doubly bridged Cr2X2 rings, closely resembling their solid-state structures. The global minima of the CrBr2 and CrI2 clusters consist of the same two-dimensional chain-like structures for their dimers, but their trimers and tetramers consist of three-dimensional &#8217;triangular&#8217; structures which contain two capping ligands bound to three chromium atoms along with a Cr-Cr bond. Each Cr atom within these clusters has spin quantum number S=2. There is approximately a constant change in energy, between 45-55 kcal/mol, with every new CrX2 unit during cluster formation. Information about the structure of the CrCl2 clusters is used in the reanalysis of high-temperature electron diffraction data. The vapor at 1170 K contains about 77% monomeric molecules, 19% dimers, and a small amount of trimers. Monomeric CrCl2 is found to be bent with a bond angle of 149(10)degrees, in good agreement with our computations. Solid-state DFT calculations are performed on alpha-CrCl2 to determine the lattice structure and spin-coupling constants for the Cr atoms within the crystals. The GGA (PW91) method produces a structure in good agreement with the literature. In the lowest energy structure, the spins of the Cr atoms within the chains along the crystallographic c-axis are anti-ferromagnetically coupled with four parallel spins situated almost exclusively in the d-bands of Cr along these chains. This anti-ferromagnetic coupling is also seen in the CrX2 clusters.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chromium dihalides</field><field name="subject">Properties</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences::250600 Theoretical and Computational Chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/744</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the antioxidant activity of milk proteins in model oil-in-water emulsions : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Food Technology, Riddet Institute, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ries, Daniel</field><field name="description">The present study was aimed at extending our knowledge of the antioxidative properties of the milk protein products, whey protein isolate (WPI) and sodium caseinate (NaCas), in oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). In particular, the objective was to contribute to our understanding of the compositional and processing factors that influence the oxidative stability of protein-stabilised O/W emulsions. Linoleic acid (approximately 60 %) was used as the lipid for the oil phase (10.6 %). The emulsion samples were usually incubated at 50 &#176;C to accelerate lipid oxidation. Lipid oxidation indicators were lipid hydroperoxides and headspace hexanal, determined by solid phase microextraction (SPME) combined with gas chromatography (GC). WPI- or NaCas-stabilised emulsions were prepared using a wide range of protein concentrations (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 7.0 or 10.0 %) at two droplet sizes (d32 = 0.31 and 0.65 &#181;m). In general, higher lipid oxidation levels were found for the larger droplet size. Increasing protein concentration led to a decrease in the lipid oxidation rate. The greatest decrease in lipid hydroperoxide levels (values after 4 h) occurred at up to 4.0 % protein concentration. The greatest decrease in hexanal levels (values after 24 h) occurred at up to 4.0 % protein concentration in WPI emulsions (0.31 &#181;m). The hexanal levels were more independent of the protein concentration in the other emulsion types. The hexanal level decreased at protein concentrations &gt; 4.0 % in NaCas emulsions (0.31 and 0.65 &#181;m) and at protein concentrations &gt; 7.0 % in WPI emulsions (0.65 &#181;m). The difference between lipid hydroperoxide generation in emulsions with small and large droplet sizes decreased with increasing protein concentration. This effect was more pronounced in NaCas emulsions. In general, NaCas was a better inhibitor of lipid oxidation than WPI, but WPI appeared to be the better antioxidant at some droplet size/protein concentration combinations. The protein in the continuous phase, i.e. the unadsorbed protein, played an important role in lipid oxidation. In principal, the lipid hydroperoxide and hexanal levels showed the same development over the continuous phase protein concentration as over the protein concentration in WPI and NaCas emulsions (d32 = 0.31 &#181;m). A low NaCas level in the continuous phase already led to a relatively low hexanal level, whereas a higher WPI level was required. When NaCas solution was added to a WPI emulsion or WPI solution was added to a NaCas emulsion, a synergistic antioxidative effect was observed. The high molecular weight fractions (molecular weight = 12000-14000) of WPI and NaCas contained pro-oxidative metal ions that contributed to lipid oxidation in the emulsions. An enrichment of NaCas emulsions with the low molecular weight fraction of NaCas (with a molecular weight = 12000-14000) notably inhibited lipid oxidation. An enrichment of WPI emulsions with the low molecular weight fraction of WPI (with a molecular weight = 12000-14000) also seemed to inhibit lipid oxidation, but the effect was not significant. The protein solutions were enriched with these fractions before emulsion preparation. Pure WPI solution or mixed WPI/NaCas (1:1, weight/weight) solution with 1.12 or 2.24 % protein concentration was heated at 84 &#176;C for up to 40 min, cooled and then used to prepare emulsions. Lipid oxidation was generally not affected by the heat treatment or the degree of whey protein denaturation. However, at the lower WPI concentration, more hexanal was produced for the longer heating times (20, 30 and 40 min) and this appeared to be connected with the physical instability of the emulsions. Greater oxidative stability was found at the higher protein concentration and when the proteins were mixed, pointing to a possible synergistic antioxidative effect of WPI and NaCas. The addition of the free radical source 2,2&#8217;-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH) greatly increased the oxygen uptake and the generation of lipid hydroperoxides in the emulsions. The oxidative stability increased with increasing protein concentration (1.0, 4.0 and 7.0 %). NaCas had a greater antioxidative effect than WPI. The inhibition of oxygen uptake appeared to be largely influenced by the free-radical-scavenging activity of the system, determined by the protein type and the protein concentration, as the radicals were produced linearly over time and oxygen was consumed linearly over time. It can therefore be concluded that free-radical-scavenging activity represents a major antioxidative mechanism of the milk proteins. Oxygen was consumed much faster in emulsions than in protein solutions when the same level of AAPH was incorporated. In a WPI (1.0 % protein) emulsion, much lower levels of protein hydroperoxides than of lipid hydroperoxides developed. This pointed to a much greater reactivity of linoleic acid than of the milk proteins with oxygen. In contrast, the exposure of WPI to oxidising linoleic acid in an emulsion (1.0 % protein) or to AAPH in aqueous solution led to oxidative damage of the whey proteins, indicated by the loss of amino acids. The loss of specific amino acids was different for proteins in the continuous phase or cream phase of an emulsion or in WPI solution. The present study confirms the antioxidative potential of WPI and NaCas and gives new insights into their functionality as oxidative stabilisers in O/W emulsions.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">whey protein isolate</field><field name="subject">sodium caseinate</field><field name="subject">lipid oxidation</field><field name="subject">oxidative stabilisers</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290101 Fermentation, biotechnology and industrial microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1084</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Neospora caninum : studies toward isolation in New Zealand : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Veterinary Studies at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Walton, Julie K</field><field name="description">Background: Neospora caninum is a parasite that causes disease, largely in cattle and dogs. It is a disease of significant interest within New Zealand due to its association with bovine abortion. The economic impact of bovine abortion justifies the development of a bovine vaccine against N. caninum. Aim: To develop and optimise diagnostic procedures for the detection of Neospora from a variety of blood and tissue samples and to isolate a New Zealand strain of Neospora caninum. Methods: A local strain of Toxoplasma gondii and an imported Neospora caninum strain, Nc-Liverpool, were used to optimise tachyzoite growing conditions in bovine endothelial (BE) cells and Vero host cell cultures. A serum study using 112 tissue culture flasks was performed to determine whether foetal bovine serum or horse serum supplemented media provided the optimal growing conditions for Nc-Liverpool tachyzoites. Nc-Liverpool tachyzoites were also used to determine the optimal growth period between passage, and harvest for cryopreservation and cryopreservation conditions. Percoll gradients were also tested using Nc-Liverpool tachyzoites. A known Neospora positive canine sample and murine tissues infected with Toxoplasma, were used during the development of the immunohistochemical diagnostic technique. Antibody concentrations and incubation temperatures were tested to reduce cross-reactivity and increase specific stain intensity. Immunohistochemistry was performed on sections of all tissue samples used for N. caninum isolation and experimentally infected murine tissue. Several PCR techniques were developed, the final PCR used being a combination of the different techniques, which produced a 250kb band. PCR-3 used the NF6/GA1 primer combination for Neospora detection and TF6/GA1 for Toxoplasma detection, additional Mg2+ and an annealing temperature of 55&#176;C were required. Whole tissue was processed via DNA elution whereas cell culture and Percoll purified tachyzoites were used following crude lysis techniques. All bovine and canine tissues used for parasite isolation as well as all experimentally infected mouse tissues were tested for N. caninum using PCR. An immunoblot technique was developed for the detection of N. caninum antibodies in murine blood samples. Lysed Nc-Liverpool tachyzoites were used as antigen with varied results. The primary and secondary antibodies were commercially available and used at concentrations of 1:1,000 and 1:25,000 respectively. BALB/c and CF1 mice were experimentally infected with Toxoplasma gondii and Nc-Liverpool. Forty female BALB/c and 40 female CF1 mice were used in 2 studies to determine the optimal Nc-Liverpool inoculation dose and immunosuppression requirements. Mice were immunosuppressed with 2.5mg of methylprednisolone acetate (MPA) and Nc-Liverpool inoculation ranged from 1.3x106 to 5x103 tachyzoites. Upon death, the brain and blood was harvested from the mouse carcases. Attempts were made to isolate a New Zealand strain of N. caninum from bovine and canine central nervous system (CNS) tissue, and to maintain the parasites in cell culture and by small animal passage, in order to attenuate the parasite strain for use as a live large animal vaccine. Twenty one bovine tissue samples were used for N. caninum isolation attempts, 18 of which were positive for Neospora antibodies using a commercial IFAT. Isolation tissues were purified using a 30% Percoll gradient and inoculated onto 8 cell culture flasks and into 8 immunosuppressed mice (BALB/c and CF1). Results: Nc-Liverpool tachyzoites were found to be viable when grown at 37&#176;C in antibiotic-MEM supplemented with either FBS or ES and grew optimally in FBS despite Neospora antibodies being detected using an IFAT. Passaging cultures at approx. 4 day intervals resulted in the greatest parasite growth. However, cryopreserved parasites should be harvested 2 days post inoculation (PI) for optimal viability. Viable parasites could be isolated using a 30% Percoll gradient and centrifuged at 2,700 x g (3,400 rpm) in a bucket centrifuge for 10 minutes. Tissue cysts could be detected using immunohistochemistry but some degree of cross reaction remained despite optimisation. Cysts were not found in tissues used for isolation attempts or in mouse brains following inoculation with Nc-Liverpool, however cysts were commonly found in mice experimentally infected with T. gondii tachyzoites. PCR-3 was successfully used to detect N. caninum and T. gondii infected tissue and tachyzoites from tissue culture. PCR-3 could detect N. caninum DNA in the brain tissue of 9/24 mice experimentally infected with Nc-Liverpool, even though most mice were culled within 1 week. Although production of N. caninum antigen was only moderately successful, N. caninum antibody detection in mouse blood using one specific antigen batch was reliable and specific. The immunoblot could only detect N. caninum antibody approximately 14 days PI, but was sensitive enough to detect 100% of mice experimentally infected with Nc-Liverpool tachyzoites. PCR-3 strongly correlated with the immunoblot results from 14 days PI. BALB/c mice were found to be far more sensitive to Nc-Liverpool than CF1 mice and developed severe disease at concentrations of approximately 1x106 Nc-Liverpool tachyzoites. Neither BALB/c nor CF1 mice developed peritoneal exudate, irrespective of the parasite inoculation concentration. Despite Neospora DNA being present in the brains of experimentally infected mice, re-isolation and continuous parasite passage from the brains could not be achieved. No mice experimentally infected with either Nc-Liverpool or isolation attempts were found to have brain cysts when tested using immunohistochemistry. Only 1 mouse inoculated with bovine isolation material was found to have a Neospora positive PCR. Through the detection of DNA, antigens and antibodies, parasites were determined to have been present in 10 of the 18 IFAT positive bovine isolation samples, indicating that 55% of calves born to seropositive dams were infected with N. caninum. However, despite numerous attempts to isolate Neospora parasites from naturally infected canine and bovine tissue and culturing using the optimised Nc-Liverpool technique, maintenance of a live culture of a New Zealand strain of N. caninum could not be established. Conclusions: Findings from this study could be used to assist in the maintenance of Neospora caninum and Toxoplasma gondii parasite strains and for detection or diagnosis of these parasites in host tissues.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Neospora caninum</field><field name="subject">pathogenic protozoa</field><field name="subject">Toxoplasma gondii</field><field name="subject">cattle parasites</field><field name="subject">cattle diseases</field><field name="subject">veterinary parasitology</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300500 Veterinary Medicine::300508 Parasitology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1089</field></doc><doc><field name="title">K&#257;ore te aroha-- : te hua o te w&#257;nanga : a thesis presented for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in M&#257;ori Studies at Massey University, Palmerston North, Aotearoa, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Black, Taiarahia</field><field name="description">Te Ora &#274; noho an&#257; n&#333; i te koko ko &#332;hiwa, kia whakarongo rua, Aku taringa ki te Tai o tuar&#257; e o Kanawa, E &#257;ki ana mai ki uta r o &#332;hakana.

For the past few decades, colloid scientists have focussed mainly on the effects of processing conditions (e.g. heat, high pressure, and shear) on the physicochemical properties of emulsions (e.g. viscosity, droplet size distribution and phase stability). However, the information about the behaviour of food structures post consumption is very limited. Fundamental knowledge of how the food structures behave in the mouth is critical, as these oral interactions of food components influence the common sensorial perceptions (e.g. creaminess, smoothness) and the release of fat-soluble flavours. Initial studies also suggest that the breakdown of emulsions in the gastrointestinal tract and the generated interfacial structures impact lipid digestion, which can consequently influence post-prandial metabolic responses. This area of research needs to be intensively investigated before the knowledge can be applied to rational design of healthier food structures that could modulate the rate of lipid metabolism, bioavailability of nutrients, and also help in providing targeted delivery of flavour molecules and/or bioactive components. Hence, the objective of this research was to gain understanding of how emulsions behave during their passage through the gastrointestinal tract. In vitro digestion models that mimic the physicochemical processes and biological conditions in the mouth and gastrointestinal tract were successfully employed. Behaviour of model protein-stabilized emulsions (both positively charged (lactoferrin) as well as negatively charged [&#946;-lactoglobulin (&#946;-lg)] oil-in-water emulsions) at each step of simulated physiological processing (using model oral, gastric and duodenal fluids individually) were investigated. In simulated mouth conditions, oil-in-water emulsions stabilized by lactoferrin or &#946;-lg at the interfacial layers were mixed with artificial saliva at neutral pH that contained a range of mucin concentrations and salts. The &#946;-lg emulsions did not interact with the artificial saliva due to the dominant repulsion between mutually opposite charges of anionic mucin and anionic &#946;-lg interfacial layer at neutral pH. However, &#946;-lg emulsions underwent some depletion flocculation on addition of higher concentrations of mucin due to the presence of unadsorbed mucin molecules in the continuous phase. In contrast, positively charged lactoferrin emulsions showed considerable salt-induced aggregation in the presence of salts (from the saliva) alone. Furthermore, lactoferrin emulsions underwent bridging flocculation because of electrostatic binding of anionic mucin to the positively charged lactoferrin-stabilized emulsion droplets. In acidic pH conditions (pH 1.2) of the simulated gastric fluid (SGF), both protein-stabilized emulsions were positively charged. Addition of pepsin resulted in extensive droplet flocculation in both emulsions with a greater extent of droplet instability in lactoferrin emulsions. Coalescence of the droplets was observed as a result of peptic hydrolysis of the interfacial protein layers. Conditions such as ionic strength, pH and exposure to mucin were shown to significantly influence the rate of hydrolysis of &#946;-lg-stabilized emulsion by pepsin. Addition of simulated intestinal fluid (SIF) containing physiological concentrations of bile salts to the emulsions showed competitive interfacial displacement of &#946;-lg by bile salts. In the case of lactoferrin-stabilized emulsion droplets, there was considerable aggregation in the presence of intestinal electrolytes alone (without added bile salts) at pH 7.5. Binding of anionic bile salts to cationic interfacial lactoferrin layer resulted in re-stabilization of salt-aggregated lactoferrin emulsions. On mixing with physiological concentrations of pancreatin (mixture of pancreatic lipase, amylase and protease), significant degree of coalescence and fatty acid release occurred for both the emulsions. This was attributed to the interfacial proteolysis by trypsin (proteolytic fractions of pancreatin) resulting in interfacial film rupturing. Exchange of initial interfacial materials by bile salts and trypsin-induced film breakage enhanced the potential for lipolytic fractions of pancreatin to act on the hydrophobic lipid core. The lipid digestion products (free fatty acids and mono and/or diglycerides) generated at the droplet surface further removed the residual intact protein layers from the interface by competitive displacement mechanisms. The sequential treatment of the cationic and anionic emulsions with artificial saliva, SGF and SIF, respectively, was determined to understand the impact of initial protein type during complete physiological processing from mouth to intestine. Broadly, both the protein-stabilized emulsions underwent charge reversals, extensive droplet flocculation, and significant coalescence as they passed through various stages of the in vitro digestion conditions. Except in the simulated mouth environment, the initial charge of the emulsifiers had relatively limited influence on droplet behaviour during the simulated digestion. The results contribute to the knowledge of how structure and charge of the emulsified lipid droplets impact digestion at various stages of physiology. This information might have important consequences for developing suitable microstructures that allow controlled breakdown of droplets in the mouth and predictable release of lipids in the gastrointestinal tract.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Milk protein</field><field name="subject">Emulsions</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290103 Food processing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1409</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adaptation of colour perception through dynamic ICC profile modification : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Computer Science at Massey University, Albany (Auckland), New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Kloss, Guy Kristoffer</field><field name="description">Digital colour cameras are dramatically falling in price, making them a ordable for ubiquitous appliances in many applications. Change in colour perception with changing light conditions induce errors that may escape a user's awareness. Colour constancy algorithms are based on inferring light properties (usually the white point) to correct colour. Other attempts using more data for colour correction   such as (ICC based) colour management   characterise a capturing device under given conditions through an input device pro le. This pro le can be applied to correct for deviating colour perception. But this pro le is only valid for the speci c conditions at the time of the characterisation, but fails with changes in light. This research presents a solution to the problem of long time observations with changes in the scene's illumination for common natural (overcast or clear, blue sky) and arti cial sources (incandescent or  uorescent lamps). Colour measurements for colour based reasoning need to be represented in a robustly de ned way. One such suitable and well de ned description is given by the CIE LAB colour space, a device-independent, visually linearised colour description. Colour transformations using ICC pro le are also based on CIE colour descriptions. Therefore, also the corrective colour processing has been based on ICC based colour management. To verify the viability of CIE LAB based corrective colour processing colour constancy algorithms (White Patch Retinex and Grey World Assumption) have been modi ed to operate on L a b  colour tuples. Results were compared visually and numerically (using colour indexing) against those using the same algorithms operating on RGB colour tuples. We can take advantage of the fact that we are dealing with image streams over time, adding another dimension usable for analysis. A solution to the problem of slowly changing light conditions in scenes with a static camera perspective is presented. It takes advantage of the small (frame-to-frame) changes in appearance of colour within the scene over time. Reoccurring objects or (background) areas of the scene are tracked to gather data points for an analysis. As a result, a suitable colour space distortion model has been devised through a  rst order Taylor approximation (a ne transformation). By performing a multidimensional linear regression analysis on the tracked data points, parameterisations for the a ne transformations were derived. Finally, the device pro le is updated by amalgamating the corrections from the model into the ICC pro le for a single, comprehensive transformation. Following applications of the ICC based colour pro les are very fast and can be used in real-time with the camera's capturing frame rate (for current normal web cameras and low spec desktop computers). As light conditions usually change on a much slower time scale than the capturing rate of a camera, the computationally expensive pro le adaptation generally showed to be usable for many frames. The goal was to set out and  nd a solution for consistent colour capturing using digital cameras, which is capable of coping with changing light conditions. Theoretical backgrounds and strategies for such a system have been devised and implemented successfully.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer colour image processing</field><field name="subject">Colour perception</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280200 Artificial Intelligence and Signal and Image Processing::280208 Computer vision</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1683</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of dietary fish oil or other lipids and Sanovite on pig performance and pork quality : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Animal Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Nuijten, Wilhelmina Gerardina Maria</field><field name="description">In this experiment, the effects of (1) lipid type (soy bean oil, tallow and fish oil), (2) the period the fish oil was provided and (3) a dietary supplement containing conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), selenium (Se), vitamin E and vitamin C on pig performance and pork quality were studied. Forty-eight female pigs (PIC hybrids, with a mean live weight of 16.19 kg &#177; 1.56 SD) were obtained from a single commercial operation in the North Island of New Zealand. The pigs were rank ordered by weight and assigned to one of six dietary treatment groups. The diet base was either a combination of animal and plant feedstuffs (AT and PTS), plant feedstuffs only (PO, POS) or plant feedstuffs combined with fish oil (PFSe and PFSl). The diets also differed depending on the presence or absence of the nutritional supplement SanoviteTM and a vitamin C supplement. SanoviteTM is a trademarked dietary supplement containing CLA (BASF, Auckland, New Zealand), organic Selenium (Alltech Inc., Nicholasville, KY) and vitamin E (Morel et al., 2008). Diets POS, PTS, PFSe, PFSl contained SanoviteTM and a vitamin C supplement. Diets PO and POS were used to establish the effect of the supplementation with SanoviteTM and the vitamin C supplement. Pigs fed diet PFSe received plant feedstuffs and fish oil with supplement between days 1 and 35 and then diet POS up to day 84. Pigs fed diet PFSl received diet POS between days 1 and 35; plant feedstuffs and fish oil with supplement between days 36 and 56 and then diet POS up to day 84. Pigs in group PFSe and PFSl both received the same total amount of fish oil per pig (2.52 l/ 2.31 kg). Between days 1 and 56 of the experiment grower diets were fed, and finisher diets were fed between days 57 and 84 of the experiment. The pigs were kept in pens of six, but fed individually twice daily (at approximately 8 am and 3.30 pm) according to a fixed feeding schedule. Water was available at all times. Individual feed intakes were measured daily and live weight recorded weekly. Faeces were collected once a day during two days in week five of the trail for digestibility determination. Carcass quality characteristics determined at the abattoir included carcass weight and back fat thickness as measured at the end of the slaughter line. Meat quality assessments were performed on the Semimembranosus muscle (SM) from one of the topside cuts of each pig. Measurements of fatty acid profile (loin and backfat) and the Se content (lean meat) were conducted in Singapore by Mrs. J. Leong (MSc). In this study plant or animal feedstuffs, lipid type, SanoviteTM and vitamin C supplementation had no significant effects on growth performance and carcass quality. There were no differences in apparent faecal digestibility characteristics for dry matter (DDM) and organic matter (DOM) in the un-supplemented animal (AT) and plant based (PO) diets. Lipid type had a significant effect on the digestibility of ash (DA), and an increased ratio of unsaturated fatty acid to saturated fatty acid resulted in increases in DDM and DOM. DDM and DOM increased when soybean and linseed oil (POS) were used instead of tallow (PTS) or fish oil (PFS). The main differences in DDM, DOM and DA were observed between diets PO and POS. A positive effect of selenium, vitamin E and CLA supplementation is suggested. Increased cooking temperatures reduced tenderness (higher mean, peak force, yield force and peak force &#8211; yield force) and increased cooking loss. There was a significant negative relationship between ultimate pH and relative lightness (L*). There were highly significant positive correlations between all three measurements of expressed juice, and there was a significant positive correlation between cooking loss at 60 and 70oC (P&lt;0.01) but correlations between expressed juice values and cooking loss were not significant. The P-values for the contrasts for cooking loss at 70 0C were significant for all contrasts except for AT vs PO and PFSe vs PFSl. For all other contrasts, the P-values for cooking loss at 70 0C were significantly higher in group POS than for groups PO, PTS and PFSe+PFSl. The P-value for (Peak force &#8211; Yield force) at 70&#176;C was significantly higher in samples from group PFSe than for samples from group PFSl. The P-value for the myofibrillar fragmentation index (MFI) was significantly higher for group AT in contrast to group PO. Group POS had a significantly higher P-value for MFI in contrast to groups PO, PTS and PFSe and PFSl. Group POS had a lower P-value for sarcomere length in contrast to groups PFSe and PFSl. Group PFSe had a significantly higher P-value for sarcomere length in contrast to group PFSl. Group PFSe had a significantly higher P-value for expressed juice percentage loss in weight in contrast to group PFSl. Supplementing with SanoviteTM increased the Se content (P = 0.002) in lean meat as analysed by J. Leong (2010, personal communication). In general it was concluded that an increase in the ratio of unsaturated fatty acid to saturated fatty acid (U/S) in the diet resulted in higher levels of unsaturated fatty acids in loin and backfat. The fatty acid profile in the diet reflected the fatty acid profile of pork. Backfat of pigs fed diets including soybean and linseed oil contained higher levels of linoleic and &#945;-linolenic acids. Diets PO and POS were used to establish the effect of the supplementation of CLA. The backfat of pigs fed diet POS contained higher levels of CLA (C18:2-trans-10, cis-12) and &#945;-linolenic acid than pigs fed diet PO. The loin of pigs fed diet POS contained higher levels of palmitoleic and linoleic acid and CLA (C18:2-cis-9, trans-11) and lower levels of oleic acid than pigs fed diet PO. The use of fish-oil as a lipid type resulted in the highest levels of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in loin and backfat. The loin and backfat of pigs fed fish-oil in the second part of the grower phase (PFSl) contained higher levels of EPA, DPA and DHA than pigs fed fish-oil in the first part of the grower phase (PFSe). By enriching the swine diet with long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC n-3 PUFA) it was possible to increase the EPA, DPA and DHA content of pork. Enriching pork with LC n-3 PUFA will contribute to achieving standards for adequate intake (AI), but might not be suitable to reach suggested dietary targets (SDT). In conclusion, it was possible to change the pork composition by dietary manipulation without compromising pig performance and meat quality. There were a few significant effects from treatments on meat quality characteristics, but differences reported in this study were small and relatively unimportant. A negative influence of the dietary regime on palatability and meat processing was expected, but these issues are beyond the scope of this experiment.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dietary supplements</field><field name="subject">Pig feed</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300400 Animal Production::300403 Animal nutrition</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1702</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Variation in populations of enteral microflora in people with coeliac disease following the implementation of a gluten free diet : a thesis in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Human Nutrition through the Institute of Food, Nutrition and Human Health at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">MacKenzie, Delwyn Lynley</field><field name="description">Coeliac disease (CD) is a disorder resulting from interactions between diet, genome and immunity. This research seeks to further our understanding of the pathology of CD in regard to its secondary effects on the diversity of enteral microflora via changes in immune tolerance. It proposes that enteral mucosal pro-inflammatory change in CD is associated with a decrease in microbial diversity whilst remission from inflammation may result in an increase in enteral microbial diversity that could contribute to the restoration of tolerance. The first study analyses whether remission from active CD is associated with change in generic enteral microbial diversity by assessing people at diagnosis and following their response to gluten exclusion. A comparison is made to people without CD consuming a &#8217;normal diet&#8217;. DGGE profiling of faecal microflora in subjects with CD at diagnosis (confirmed by serology and by duodenal biopsy) and over three consecutive months on a gluten-free diet (GFD) was performed and profiles were compared with those of age and gender matched control subjects taken at monthly intervals. Diversity of faecal microflora (measured as Simpsons Index ) was significantly lower in people with CD than in control subjects. It was possible to distinguish the profiles of coeliac subjects at diagnosis from those obtained after three months on a GFD but it was not possible to distinguish between the samples from control subjects taken at monthly intervals. The profiles of CD subjects after three months on a GFD were more dissimilar to those of the control subjects than those obtained prior to dietary treatment, chiefly on the basis of three bands that were not found in the faeces of any control subjects. The second study analyses dietary intake to determine if a lack of nutrients at diagnosis (before institution of a GFD) and at monthly intervals for three consecutive months post diagnosis (on a GFD) exists, as it is known that CD is associated with nutrient deficiencies resulting from malabsorption due to intestinal inflammation and damage. Subjects completed a customised food questionnaire at each sampling period. Dietary intake was analysed using Foodworks Professional 2007. Significant differences were identified in gluten, starch and carbohydrate intake but not in other macronutrients. Contrary to established literature, these analyses identified few significant differences in micronutrient intake within coeliac subjects over time, however, significant differences were found in iron and sodium.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Coeliac disease</field><field name="subject">Gluten avoidance</field><field name="subject">enteral intestinal microflora</field><field name="subject">DGGE</field><field name="subject">Nutrient aberrations</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321205 Nutrition and dietetics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1703</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CASTLE : a computer-assisted sentence stress teaching and learning environment : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Computer Science at Massey University, Manawatu, New Zealand EMBARGOED TILL 1 JUNE 2012</field><field name="creator">Lu, Jingli</field><field name="description">A Computer-Assisted sentence Stress Teaching and Learning Environment (CASTLE) is proposed and developed, in order to help learners of English as a Second Language (ESL) to perceive and produce English stress correctly. Sentence stress plays an important role in English verbal communication. Incorrect stress may confuse listeners, and even break down a conversation. Stress is also challenging for ESL learners to master. It is neither easy for them to produce nor easy to perceive stress. Learners tend to transfer the stress patterns of their first language into English, which is not always appropriate. However, stress has been overlooked in English language teaching classes, due to the time limits of a class and teachers&#8217; lack of confidence of teaching stress. Thus, CASTLE is intended to help ESL learners to use sentence stress correctly. There are three modules in CASTLE: an individualised speech learning material providing module, a perception assistance module and a production assistance module. Through conducting an investigation into which voice features (i.e. gender, pitch and speech rate) makes a teacher&#8217;s voice preferable for learners to imitate, we find that learners&#8217; imitation preferences vary, according to many factors (e.g. English background and language proficiency). Thus, the speech material providing module of CASTLE can provide individualised speech material for different learners, based on their preferred voice features. In the perception assistance module of CASTLE, we propose a set of stress exaggeration methods that can automatically enlarge the differences between stressed and unstressed syllables in teachers&#8217; voice. These stress exaggeration methods are implemented by the manipulation of different prosodic features (i.e. pitch, duration and intensity) of the teachers&#8217; voice. Our experimental results show that all our proposed exaggeration methods could help ESL learners to perceive sentence stress more accurately. In the production assistance module of CASTLE, we propose a clapping-based sentence stress practice model that is intended to help ESL learners to be aware of the rhythm of English language. By analysing the limitation of conventional categorical representation of stress, we propose a fuzzy representation which is intended to better represent the subjective nature of stress. Based on the fuzzy representation of stress, we propose three feedback models in order to help the learners correct their stress errors. In addition to the development of CASTLE, we also propose an enhanced fuzzy linear regression model which can overcome the spreads increasing problem encountered by previous fuzzy linear regression models.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer-assisted learning</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280200 Artificial Intelligence and Signal and Image Processing::280213 Other artificial intelligence</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1706</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Children's sleep in the family environment : a pilot study using actigraphy with 6-8-year-old New Zealand children : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Public Health at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Muller, Diane P.</field><field name="description">Historically, children were considered to rarely experience sleep problems and daytime sleepiness in middle childhood (5 &#8211; 12-years of age), however more recent findings indicate this may have changed. Psychosocial and environmental factors, such as technology use and bedtime routines, have been associated with reduced sleep quantity and/or quality. Links have also emerged between shorter sleep duration in children, and an increased risk of obesity in childhood and adulthood. Although a number of studies have investigated children&#8217;s sleep internationally, data are limited on both average sleep duration and the stability of sleep patterns of New Zealand children. This study aimed to collect normative data on the sleep of 6 &#8211; 8-year-olds, living in New Zealand, across both school and non-school nights, identify modifiable factors that impact on children&#8217;s sleep within the family environment, explore the relationship between children&#8217;s sleep and BMI, and pilot methods for potential future research. Actigraphy and diaries were used for seven consecutive days and nights, as well as a questionnaire incorporating the Children&#8217;s Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ), with 52 families living in the Wellington region. Stable objectively measured sleep patterns were identified, consistent with findings of Nixon et al. (2008). School night sleep duration was found to be, on average, longer than non-school night sleep, and parents tended to over-estimate their children&#8217;s sleep duration. Mean school night sleep duration was 9.9 hours (SD = 0.5) and non-school night sleep duration was 9.5 hours (SD = 0.7). No differences were identified between boys&#8217; and girls&#8217; sleep, and the 14% of children categorised as being overweight did not exhibit significantly different sleep patterns from the rest of the sample. Modifiable factors of technology and caffeine use were associated with differences in children&#8217;s sleep, as were non-modifiable familial factors of shiftworking adults living in the home, childcare duration and finishing times, and younger children in the household. Recommendations for future research include increasing the size and diversity of the sample, extending actigraphic recording to at least 10 consecutive days and nights to incorporate two weekends, using PSG with a sub-sample of children, and implementing a longitudinal study.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sleep quality</field><field name="subject">Sleep patterns</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321209 Family care</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1704</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Digital foundations : a study of perceptions and practices surrounding the use of ICT in ECE centres : this thesis is submitted in part fulfilment of the requirements for the Doctor of Education, Massey University</field><field name="creator">Oldridge, Lisa Anne</field><field name="description">The use of information and communication technologies (ICT) in early childhood education (ECE) is controversial. Currently, ICT in ECE is experiencing a second wave of popularity. While many of the recurring debates exist around the use of technology in the education sector it would appear that ICT is here to stay. A distinguishing feature of the literature across both waves is a growing appreciation of the importance of pedagogy and the key role of the teacher. This thesis builds on this broad concept of pedagogy by investigating the growth of ICT in ECE. The aim of the study was to discover new insight and understanding of how parents&#8223;, teachers&#8223; and children&#8223;s perceptions of the use of ICT in ECE influence the surrounding practice. A mixed-method approach was undertaken with a sample group in three distinct phases in one geographical location in the greater Wellington region. The study adopted an interpretive framework to inform the research methodology and help explain the findings. The findings across the three phases show the multifaceted nature of ICT and the many layers that are required to ensure that it can be offered in an authentic and meaningful way in ECE. When this approach is not evident it constrains the integrated use of ICT and affects the quality of the programme offered. Factors that influence the level of quality include: (a) the role of teacher&#8223;s beliefs and self-efficacy; (b) fluid conceptions of pedagogy; (c) the competing and co-existing drivers associated with the use of ICT in ECE; (d) the changing face of literacy; (e) barriers affecting the full integration; and (f) the implications of policy on practice. The thesis draws on the framework of an enabled and enacted ICT curriculum developed in the literature review, as a tool to indicate and understand the current state of the level of ICT integration in ECE centres. Overall the findings show that participating teachers have begun their ICT journey and are working towards the goal of offering an authentic and meaningful educational experience. Yet, the research shows that the many layers of support necessary to ensure teachers continue to move forward on this journey are not well understood. A failure to address these gaps may sadly lead to a &#8220;third wave&#8221; of ICT in which history repeats itself.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Early childhood centres</field><field name="subject">Information and communication technologies</field><field name="subject">Computers in early childhood education</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330110 Early childhood education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1705</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Meta-analysis of moderators of psycho-oncology therapy effectiveness : "it's the sick who need a doctor" : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Psychology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Heron, Heather Adele</field><field name="description">Reviews conflict regarding the effectiveness of psycho-oncological therapies at reducing patient anxiety, depression and general distress, suggesting that unknown factors are moderating trial results. This meta-analysis investigates the moderating impact of a large range of socio-demographic, psychological, medical and therapy factors using published and unpublished data from 146 prospective controlled trials, including non-random designs. Preliminary analyses of trial design quality features exposed 2 moderators: recruit screening for psychological distress or history, and the nature of the control condition. These structured a 2 x 2 matrix used to conduct substantive analyses. Admitting only recruits with established baseline distress was found to predict greater effect size, as was excluding patients with a history of distress. Main effects for patients with baseline distress compared with untreated controls, were medium-strong at g = 0.52 - 0.70. Evidence of varying strengths indicated that patients who were older, of lower income, male, single, or suffering from cancer sited elsewhere than breast produced higher effect sizes. Data also highlighted particular stages in the cancer journey: re-entry to normal life at the end of medical treatment, recurrence, and distant disease spread. Findings suggest that risk and distress screening should be employed by both clinicians and researchers. Researchers should also re-direct attention away from unscreened middle class early stage breast cancer patients, towards more vulnerable socio-demographic and medical groups. The potential of using survivors and indirect therapies to effectively and efficiently reach vulnerable groups deserves exploration. Reviewers need to take into account the 2 trial design moderators discovered, and should include non-random controlled trials which may have more access to particularly vulnerable groups because some past conclusions were confounded by the co-variation of study design with sampling characteristics.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cancer patients</field><field name="subject">Psychotherapy</field><field name="subject">Psycho-oncology therapy</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380107 Health, clinical and counselling psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1707</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Learning about user interface design through the use of user interface pattern languages : a thesis dissertation presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Computer Science at Massey University, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Todd, Elisabeth-Ann Gynn</field><field name="description">The focus of this research is to investigate the potential of user interface (UI) pattern languages in assisting students of Human Computer Interaction (HCI) to learn the principles of UI design. A graphical representation named a UI-pattern model was developed. It arose from the evaluation of four existing pattern languages. The UI-pattern model is an enhanced form of UI pattern list that represents a specific UI. It was recognised that the UI-pattern model has the potential to help students learn about pattern language structure. It was also realised that UI-pattern modelling can be used to incrementally improve pattern languages through the generative process proposed by Alexander (1979). A UI pattern language Maturity Model (UMM) has been developed. This model can be used by educators when selecting and/or modifying existing UI pattern languages so that they are more appropriate for student use. A method for developing detailed UI designs that utilises a UI pattern language has been developed with the aim of providing students with an &#8216;authentic&#8217; real-world UI design experience, as envisaged by constructivist educational theory (Jonassen 1999). This UI design method (TUIPL) guides the students&#8217; development of user interface conceptual models. To establish the authenticity of TUIPL three case studies were undertaken out with developers who had differing levels of UI design experience. A series of studies investigated how HCI students used TUIPL to guide the development of UI-pattern models and canonical abstract prototypes. The studies also ascertained the students&#8217; views on using three different forms of UI pattern (illustrated, narrative and diagrammed). Data was collected by observation, questionnaires and completed exercises. The results indicate that the students developed an understanding of pattern language structure, were positive about their experience building UI-pattern models and canonical abstract prototypes, and that patterns aided communication. The learning outcomes were encouraging and students responded positively to using a UI pattern language.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Human-computer interaction</field><field name="subject">User interface development</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280100 Information Systems::280104 Computer-human interaction</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1708</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Technological advances in the analysis of work in dangerous environments : tree felling and rural fire fighting : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Management and Ergonomics at Massey University, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Parker, Richard John</field><field name="description">Ergonomists have always been interested in studying work and especially the safety aspects of work. Studying work in dangerous situations is an area that presents particular challenges to the researcher and potentially to the worker. The objective of this study was to explore the use of new technologies in facilitating the field study of people engaged in dangerous work situations without disrupting the work or adding to the danger. This was achieved through the investigation of work activity in dangerous environments: tree felling and rural fire fighting. The two case studies formed the basis for an investigation into three aspects of work: first, to record, measure and understand the work (including physiological workload) of people engaged in dangerous occupations; second, to understand how hazards were identified and dealt with by individuals working in extreme conditions and third, to gain insight into hazardous work environments for the purpose of enhancing training for personnel working in dangerous conditions. An innovative suite of equipment was developed for the study, enabling data collection that did not disturb or inhibit the individual working in dangerous, and sometimes extreme, conditions. The results of the study have shown that, through triangulation of novel combinations of recording instrumentation and video-cued reflective interview, we can gain rich interpretative insights into the working world of the tree faller and rural fire fighter and understand how they manage the hazards they confront in their work. This in turn enables us to develop practices designed to minimise or avoid physical risk to the worker, Furthermore, the annotated video collected in the forests and at fires can be utilised as an authentic resource for training of both workers and trainers. My study has highlighted the value of, and need for, research that is situated in real work environments, and that captures the multidimensionality of workers&#8217; activities without impeding or altering their behaviour.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Work safety</field><field name="subject">Work environment</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::359900 Other Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1709</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gonadal growth and regression in Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) and the effect of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) on luteinising hormone (LH) and ovarian growth : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Physiology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Henare, Sharon Jane</field><field name="description">Improvements in breeding success are needed for conservation of endangered birds such as the New Zealand kakapo. A potential method to stimulate breeding is treatment with exogenous hormones. Hormone treatment is used in captive breeding programmes for endangered mammals but reliable techniques are not available for birds. Gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH), the principal hormone controlling reproduction, has been used to induce ovarian growth and ovulation in seasonally anoestrous mammals. The goal of the research in this thesis was to determine the potential of GnRH for hormone treatment in birds. The Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) was used in the current research. Female quail held outdoors with male quail and with access to nesting materials and nest sites showed clear seasonal patterns in the width of the cloacal opening (indicative of oviduct development) and FSH concentrations, whilst LH concentrations were low during winter and increased during spring and summer. Prolactin concentrations were elevated in birds incubating eggs in nests and birds caring for young. Photoperiodically induced gonadal growth and regression were described in detail for male and female quail under controlled conditions. Testicular and ovarian growth was preceded by increased LH and FSH concentrations and accompanied by increased gonadal steroid concentrations. Administration of various types of GnRH stimulated luteinising hormone (LH) secretion in sexually regressed female Japanese quail. LH responses to cGnRH-II were greater than those to cGnRH-I. Low doses of buserelin stimulated similar LH responses to cGnRH-II, whilst high doses of buserelin and D-Lys6Trp7Tyr8-GnRH induced sustained LH secretion. Single daily injections of various doses of cGnRH-II, buserelin or D-Lys6Trp7Tyr8-GnRH in saline or polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) did not induce elevated baseline LH or stimulate ovarian growth. Repeated injections of D-Lys6Trp7Tyr8-GnRH did not increase LH concentrations over a short-term period. Continuous infusion of D-Lys6Trp7Tyr8-GnRH by osmotic mini-pump severely blunted the LH response and did not stimulate ovarian growth. Future studies using quail exposed to marginally stimulatory photoperiods will offer the opportunities to determine the effects of GnRH in birds under conditions which mimic photoperiod changes during the breeding season. Further studies on the potential development of a hormone treatment programme will continue to offer a promising future for endangered avian species including the New Zealand kakapo.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bird breeding</field><field name="subject">Hormone treatment</field><field name="subject">Hormones in birds</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270600 Physiology::270603 Animal physiology-systems</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1710</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of rootzone composition and cultivation/aeration treatment on the performance of golf greens under New Zealand conditions : a thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Turfgrass Science at Massey University, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Liu, Cunqi</field><field name="description">The performance of golf greens in terms of rootzone physical properties, sward characteristics and playing quality is highly dependent upon the original rootzone composition and subsequent management. Such performance also continuously changes with time under usage. A study to this performance was conducted from April 1998 to January 2003 at the research site of the New Zealand Sports Turf Institute. This thesis reports results of both the field measurements made of rootzone physical properties, sward characteristics and playing quality of five alternative golf green rootzones during the first five years after sowing, and of the simulation modeling of their performance predicted for the first 30 years after sowing. Rootzone treatments were partially amended sand rootzone, soil rootzone, pure sand rootzone, fully amended sand rootzone, and partially amended sand + zeolite rootzone. A split-plot design was superimposed on the rootzone treatments consisting of twice-yearly cultivation/aeration treatments (control, HydroJect, scarification and Verti-drain). Results showed that performance of golf greens could be objectively, quantitatively and comprehensively assessed and monitored over the long-term at the rootzone level by using an Integrated Rate Methodology (IRM) model through computing the Comprehensive Golf Green Performance Index (CGGPI). The performance of golf greens showed a gradual improvement during the first two years after sowing. It then deteriorated progressively over the remainder of the 30 years predicted for all rootzone and cultivation/aeration treatments. This general trend was reflected mainly by a gradual decrease with time in water infiltration rate, oxygen diffusion rate, air-filled porosity and deep rooting. Also, there was a gradual increase in green speed, surface hardness, root mass and organic matter content near the surface profiles. By the 14th and 27th year after sowing, the IRM model predicted that the CGGPI for all the three amended sand rootzones and the pure sand rootzone were below the minimum acceptable threshold. The key factor that caused the general deterioration in green performance of all the sand-based rootzones appeared to be excess accumulation of organic matter in the surface of the profiles. Whilst there were marked differences in the performance of golf greens between the rootzone types, it was only the conventional soil rootzone that consistently performed unacceptably. Quantitative benefits of upgrading from a soil-based to a sand-based rootzone were evident in terms of improved infiltration rate, increased oxygen diffusion rate and macroporosity, reduced organic matter accumulation near the surface, better root growth and distribution, more stable turfgrass sward, lower weed cover and less fluctuation with seasons in surface hardness. Among the four sand-based rootzones, the pure sand rootzone had the highest incidence of dry patch disorder, poorest turf visual quality, greatest changes over time in the relative balance of Festuca and Agrostis, and largest fluctuation with seasons in surface hardness. However, it contained the best root growth distribution. After the fifth year from sowing, the green performance of the pure sand rootzone remained significantly better than the three amended sand rootzones. There was negligible difference in the performance of golf greens between the three amended sand rootzones on all measured or predicted occasions. The supposed benefits of burying a zeolite-amended sand layer at 100-200 mm depth, ostensibly for encouraging deep rooting, were not apparent under the experimental conditions used, possibly because the experimental plots were never managed under nutrient or moisture stress conditions. Beneficial effects of twice-yearly cultivation/aeration treatments on rootzone physical properties, sward characteristics and playing quality were evident, although these effects were extremely short-lived. Verti-drain treatment with hollow tines tended to be most effective in controlling surface organic matter accumulation and the resultant rootzone physical deterioration. In contrast, the scarification treatment gave variable response, reducing root mass, hence organic matter accumulation, near the surface on the one hand, but on the other decreasing infiltration rate and turfgrass cover. HydroJect treatment, although tending to induce a higher incidence of disease and pest damage, appeared particularly effective in minimizing the occurrence of dry patch disorder on sand-based rootzones when used in conjunction with a proprietary wetting agent. None of the cultivation/aeration treatments could effectively halt the general deterioration with time in the performance of golf greens under the twice-yearly treatment frequency used. It was concluded that: (a) The performance of sand-based rootzones for golf greens will be limited in the long term by excess accumulation of organic matter near the surface of the profile; (b) Cultivation/aeration treatments will need to commence immediately after full turf establishment and should be carried out more than twice per year on golf greens under New Zealand conditions; (c) HydroJect treatment, when used in conjunction with wetting agent application, is an effective management tool for prevention of dry patch disorder on sand-based golf greens; while scarification should not be used in isolation of other physical cultivation; (d) Upgrading from a conventional soil rootzone to a high-grade, sand-based rootzone will greatly improve golf green performance; (e) The practice of constructing only the top 100 mm of the sand rootzone with organic-amended sand is an alternative method that can be used successfully for putting green construction instead of the fully amended, standard USGA-type profile; the pure sand rootzone system is also an appropriate alternative for rootzone construction of golf greens, provided the initial establishment can be managed successfully; (f) The integrated rate modeling approach is potentially an effective decision-making tool for rootzone upgrading, surface preparation planning, performance assessment and monitoring, professional consultancy, and seasonal management of golf greens.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Golf courses</field><field name="subject">Turf management</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300900 Land, Parks and Agriculture Management::300902 Land and parks management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1711</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Relationships between treatment knowledge, beliefs and outcome following cognitive behaviour therapy for panic disorder and agoraphobia</field><field name="creator">Drobny, Juliette Victoria</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">treatment knowledge</field><field name="subject">patient beliefs</field><field name="subject">panic disorder</field><field name="subject">cognitive behaviour therapy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/6621</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Opto-acoustic interactions in high power interferometric gravitational wave detectors</field><field name="creator">Gras, Slawomir M.</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Advanced laser interferometer gravitational wave detectors require an extremely high optical power in order to improve the coupling between the gravitational wave signal and the optical field. This high power requirement leads to new physical phenomena arising from nonlinear interactions associated with radiation pressure. In particular, detectors with multi-kilometer-long arm cavities containing high density optical fields suffer the possibility of 3-mode opto-acoustic interactions. This involves the process where ultrasonic vibrations of the test mass cause the steady state optical modes to scatter. These 3-mode interactions induce transverse optical modes in the arm cavities, which then can provide positive feedback to the acoustic vibrations in the test masses. This may result in the exponential growth of many acoustic mode amplitudes, known as Parametric Instability (PI). This thesis describes research on 3-mode opto-acoustic interactions in advanced interferometric gravitational wave detectors through numerical investigations of these interactions for various interferometer configurations. Detailed analysis reveals the properties of opto-acoustic interactions, and their dependence on the interferometer configuration. This thesis is designed to provide a pathway towards a tool for the analysis of the parametric instabilities in the next generation interferometers. Possible techniques which could be helpful in the design of control schemes to mitigate this undesirable phenomenon are also discussed. The first predictions of parametric instability considered only single interactions involving one transverse mode and one acoustic mode in a simple optical cavity. ... In Chapter 6, I was able to make use of a new analytical model due to Strigin et al., which describes parametric instability in dual recycling interferometers. To make the solution tractable, it was necessary to consider two extreme cases. In the worst case, recycling cavities are assumed to be resonant for all transverse modes, whereas in the best cases, both recycling cavities are anti-resonant for the transverse modes. Results show that, for the worst case, parametric gain values as high as ~1000 can be expected, while in the best case the gain can be as low as ~ 3. The gain is shown to be very sensitive to the precise conditions of the interferometer, emphasising the importance of understanding the behaviour of the detectors when the cavity locking deviates from ideal conditions. Chapter 7 of this thesis contains work on the observation of 3-mode interactions in an optical cavity at Gingin, which confirms the analysis presented here, and also a paper which shows how the problem of 3-mode interactions can be harnessed to create new devices called opto-acoustic parametric amplifiers. In the conclusions in Chapter 8, I discuss the next important steps in understanding parametric interactions in real interferometers &#150; including the need for more automated codes relevant to the design requirements for recycling cavities. In particular, it is pointed out how the modal structure of power and signal recycling cavities must be understood in detail, including the Gouy phase for each transverse mode, to be able to obtain precise predictions of parametric gain.

The rationale was to use controlled traffic technology to facilitate relay and double cropping and thus research a cropping system that could exploit late winter crop rainfall. In Field Trial I, grain sorghum and sunflower, broadacre crops already grown within the Southern and Darling Downs regions of Queensland and New South Wales were intercropped into wheat; sunflower was intercropped with wheat in Field Trial II. Sole summer plantings were made at the same time as intercrops were planted. The wheat crop was cut and stubble removed to facilitate this. Various planting dates (three for Field Trial I; four for Field Trial II) for the relayed summer crops were used to determine if an optimum planting time existed. Plant height, tiller number, light interception, grain yield, soil moisture and economic return were used as parameters to compare the intercrop with sole plantings in Field Trial I. Grain yield, soil moisture, rainfall infiltration and economic return were measured in Field Trial II. Research also involved the modification and testing of a tractor to carry out the sowing of the intercrop. In Field Trial I, light interception was shown to vary at different stages of the wheat crop and the use of these stages to determine optimum planting dates of the relay crop is suggested. In both trials, no differences were recorded in the grain yield between intercropped and sole cropped wheat treatments suggesting the trafficking of the plot did not affect the wheat. As neither sorghum or sunflower established as intercrops, competition was not a factor in affecting wheat yields. Moisture readings in both trials showed little change below a depth of 100 cm; however some treatment differences were present at shallower depths. In Field ii Trial I, sole summer sorghum, especially the first planting date, showed reduced water capture/ higher soil evaporation due to wheat removal initially and later transpiration loss due to crop growth and increased weed pressure. Sole wheat treatments showed increased moisture storage after harvest due to lack of water use by the crop and increased infiltration/reduced runoff due to stubble retention. Improved soil moisture recharge after rainfall events was apparent in double cropped treatments suggesting not only improved water utilisation but also improved capture and storage is possible within this system. Sorghum, commonly used throughout south eastern Queensland as a summer crop option, proved unsuitable for relay intercropping in Field Trial I for Planting Dates 1 and 2. Minimum soil temperatures for these plantings were marginal as they were close to the 15o Celsius level recommended for sorghum. However, even though establishment was poor for the intercropped plantings, it was higher for sole sorghum plantings. Wheat allelopathic effects may be involved. To avoid the temperature limitations of sorghum, sunflower was selected as an alternative intercrop in the later planting dates of Field Trial I and all dates for Field Trial II. Reasons for the poor establishment and yield of sunflowers in the earlier intercrop planting dates compared to sole plantings remain unknown but also may be related to allelopathic effects from intercropped wheat. Low soil temperature was not a factor affecting establishment Yields for planting dates were recorded in the intercropped sunflower treatments for Field Trial II and the optimal planting time for sunflowers in a wheat/sunflower relay intercrop was identified as when physiological maturity of the wheat had occurred. This may relate to the wheat crop stage. In Field Trial II, no significant differences in soil moisture were recorded between treatments from overall water use for the trial period. There were differences in water use between intercropped and sole cropped treatments for iii some rainfall events. Three rainfall events were chosen for closer study in each of the field trials conducted. Each event varied in the length and time as well as the duration and intensity of the rain that fell for the period. For the first rainfall period the moisture content of the first planting date of the sole summer treatment and to a lesser extent the second planting date of the same treatment increased, most likely due to wheat removal. In the third rainfall period the double cropped sunflower treatment with stubble tended to store less moisture and this may be due to the active crop growth at this time. It was evident in both field trials of the need for an effective weed control program in the intercrop plots. Weeds were controlled in wheel tracks by glyphosate sprays. Cultural methods may help but a herbicide suitable for both components of the intercrop would be very useful. A tractor was successfully modified to a 3 metre wheelspace and a clearance of 70 cm. This proved sufficient for planting the relay intercrop in Field Trial II without negatively affecting the yield of the standing crop. The row spacing of 18 cm for wheat in a 3 metre fixed bed and wheeltrack configuration assisted with guidance and interplanting of the relay crop. The relay crop was sown as single alternating rows.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences</field><field name="subject">relay intercropping, controlled traffic, wheat, sunflower, sorghum, LER, ATER, CPR, tramlining, reaised beds</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159371</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of the Applicability of Two Informal Language Assessments for Use with Malay-Speaking Children</field><field name="creator">Ms Nor Azrita Mohamed Zain</field><field name="description" /><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="subject">Language assessments, Malay-speaking children, receptive language, expressive language, pragmatics</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159355</field></doc><doc><field name="title">2-Iodoxybenzoic Acid: Acidity Investigations and The Total Synthesis of 5,14-bis-epi-Spirovibsanin A</field><field name="creator">Mr Michael Gallen</field><field name="description" /><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ibx, acidity, pka, oxidation, spirovibsanin a, diterpene, total synthesis, natural product, spirolactone</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159354</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification of factors responsible for boar testicular hypertrophy following neonatal hemicastration</field><field name="creator">Mr Reece Wells</field><field name="description" /><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159350</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Responding to International Terrorism: The Contribution of the United Nations</field><field name="creator">Emma Kennedy Da Silva</field><field name="description" /><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">360000 Policy and Political Science</field><field name="subject">united nations, international terrorism, multilateralism, unilateralism, international relations, cooperation, institutions, security</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159349</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physiology of the PNSB Genus Rhodobacter: Volatile Fatty Acid Metabolism and Global Metabolic Regulation</field><field name="creator">Miss Jessica Welch</field><field name="description" /><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159346</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental systems analysis as an aid to policy development, application and auditing</field><field name="creator">Hill, Richard J.</field><field name="description">Environmental management in modern industry entails much more than simply measuring the level of contaminants at the discharge point of a chimney stack or pipeline and operating within defined licence limits. It involves: 1) Understanding the environmental risks associated with the industrial operation; 2) Quantifying the environmental assets at risk; 3) Evaluating the environmental challenge from the industry (determining the likely effect of particular emission levels on different environments); 4) Monitoring the condition of environmental assets in response to this challenge; 5) Devising appropriate remedial action where necessary. This study aimed to provide a rigorous and effective framework for decision making concerning vegetated landscapes surrounding industrial premises, particularly those associated with emissions of pollutants to air. Three Alcoa of Australia managed facilities in Victoria were used to develop and test the procedures, namely a coastal site at Point Henry, Geelong, a hinterland forest and heath site at Anglesea and a coastal heath site at Portland. The three facilities were involved in the aluminium smelting industry and the major atmospheric emissions were gaseous and particulate fluorides and sulfur dioxide. Analyses of vegetation distribution and condition were undertaken in order to establish whether the industrial activities at the three sites could be identified as the causes of changes in vegetation. A geographic information system (GIS) was implemented at each facility, to contain cadastral information as well as records of the physical environment and plant and animal species occurrences and condition, where appropriate. The GIS was used to create a surface of vegetation condition over the area of interest at the time of assessment and then over time to evaluate vegetation change and relationship to meteorological and production data. Baseline vegetation condition was established for each facility using large-scale high quality aerial photography and multi-spectral imagery. The photography for each site contained large amounts of latent information on vegetation distribution and condition. When properly rectified and geo-referenced, the images became accessible and open to manipulation within the GIS. At each of the three sites investigated, image classes were selected that provided appropriate detail for the vegetation type. In effect the image became a surrogate of the vegetation frozen in time and space. The ability to extract information on past vegetation condition was shown to be a very valuable asset providing the opportunity to generate new contemporaneous data to augment poor or lost historical data. The process was illustrated by developing vegetation change maps and trend information using past and current photography and limited historical field data. A verified emission model was applied to two of the facilities (Anglesea and Portland) to predict emission effects over the vegetated areas. These were used to evaluate current vegetation condition and change in terms of industrial challenge and other change agencies known or suspected. In each case, further developments of the model were required in order to achieve acceptable predictions of known atmospheric and air pollutant conditions. The investigations at Anglesea demonstrated the importance of fine-scale topographic description and meteorological modelling in order to reconcile modelled and observed environmental conditions in hilly coastal terrain. At Portland, the study revealed the importance of marine aerosols in the distribution and deposition of fluoride in the vicinity of the source. Within the broad framework of vegetation type and general condition at Anglesea and Portland, differences at the micro-scale of individual plants and clumps of plants were examined using multi-spectral imagery. Here differences in image characteristics that related to increased pigmentation and loss of chlorophyll in leaves and increased amounts of dead tissue on plants were evaluated. The change agents for the detected differences within sets and between sets of imagery were analysed and again shown to be mainly non-industrial. Only at Portland did atmospheric emissions from the aluminium smelter play a role at some locations, and then only because the effect was being reinforced by other factors (lack of burning and drought). At Portland, population data for associated fauna and an orchid were examined in relation to the baseline vegetation condition, vegetation change and industrial impact. The distribution and welfare of these species were shown to be generally dependent on vegetation condition and other non-industrial factors. If the vegetation overall was maintained in a condition of vigorous growth and structural diversity, it could be expected that specific dependant flora and fauna would thrive within it. The exception was the orchid, which was shown to be sensitive to emissions and could only thrive in its natural habitat in the vicinity of the smelter if protected by screening vegetation or nurtured by an intensive set of cultural practices that were developed as a result of this study.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300804 Environmental Impact Assessment</field><field name="subject">300800 Environmental Sciences</field><field name="subject">300801 Environmental Management and Rehabilitation</field><field name="subject">Alcoa</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158761</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploration and Analysis of the Origins, Nature and Development of the Sufi Movement in Australia</field><field name="creator">Genn, Celia Anne</field><field name="description">Between 1910 and 1926, Hazrat Inayat Khan, a musician and Sufi master from the Chishtiyya order in India, introduced Sufism to the United States of America and Europe. He established a Western Sufi order, the International Sufi Movement, with groups in America, England, and across Europe. In the early 1930s this Western Sufism was introduced into Australia. The aim of this study is to explore and analyse the origins, nature and development of the Sufi Movement in Australia with particular attention to the relationship between the spiritual teacher and the disciple. The study, in its various aspects, and as a whole, makes a contribution to understanding religious change, religion and New Religious Movements in Australia, Sufism in the West and the murshid-mureed relationship. Using what has been termed a &#147;dynamic of religions&#148; framework and Baumann&#146;s model of religious adaptation in cross-cultural circumstances, the study employs a combination of in-depth fieldwork, participant observation, interviews and historiography to identify and analyse both continuity and change in Sufi Movement groups in contemporary Australia. The study found that the early phases of transplantation from India to Europe and America, as well as the struggles within the group after the death of Inayat Khan, substantially shaped the Western Sufism that arrived in Australia. The most significant early adaptations included redefining the relationship between Sufism and exoteric Islam, gender equality, formation of a formal organisation, and the use of music to spread the Sufi Message. Addressing issues identified in the literature on the master-disciple relationship in Eastern traditions in the West, the study describes and analyses the murshid-mureed (master-disciple, spiritual teacher-student) relationship in Inayat Khan&#146;s time, and in contemporary Australia. It shows that Sufism&#146;s development in the West has been interconnected with understandings and practice of this central relationship. The study shows that the continued strength of the murshid-mureed relationship alongside emerging alternatives, the factors affecting change generally in the Sufi Movement, as well as the growing popularity of Sufism in Australia, demonstrate the need to consider not only East-West aspects of transplantation, but also the influences of modernity on spiritual traditions. As well as documenting the Australian history, the study describes the details of the variety of practices and rituals, forms of community and organisation, and forms of the murshid-mureed relationship, found in contemporary Australian groups. This provides insight into the intricacies of Sufi practice in Australia and provides a basis for comparison with other groups. Sufi practice within these groups in Australia includes highly innovative developments alongside preservation of the tradition as taught by Inayat Khan. It also reflects a tension between the spiritual and organisational hierarchy, and concerns for democracy and local autonomy.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">440206 Studies in Other Religious Traditions</field><field name="subject">780199 Other</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158753</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Small scale quantum algorithms</field><field name="creator">Travaglione, Benjamin Christopher</field><field name="description">It appears, in principle, that the laws of quantum mechanics allow a quantum computer to solve certain mathematical problems more rapidly than can be done using a classical computer. However, in order to build such a quantum computer, a number of technological problems need to be overcome. A stepping stone to this goal is the implementation of relatively simple quantum algorithms using current experimental techniques. The research work presented in this thesis consists of several theoretical studies exploring small scale quantum algorithms and methods of implementing them. Included in this thesis are an investigation of a small scale version of the phase estimation algorithm, methods of implementing the quantum random walk, a discussion of protecting quantum information by encoding it in an oscillator, and a look at the power of a quantum computer with a restricted number of qubits.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">240201 Theoretical Physics</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158745</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Entanglement, geometry and quantum computation</field><field name="creator">Dowling, Mark</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses a number of problems within the emerging field of quantum information science. Quantum information science can be said to encompass the more-established disciplines of quantum computation and quantum information, as well as rather more recent attempts to apply concepts, tools and techniques from these disciplines to gain greater understanding of quantum systems in general. The role of entanglement &#151; non-classical correlation &#151; has been of particular interest to date. Part I contributes to this later goal. In particular, we establish a connection between the energy of a many-body quantum system and the idea of an entanglement witness from the theory of mixed-state entanglement. This connection allows mathematical results about entanglement witnesses to be translated into physical results about many-body quantum systems, specifically energy and temperature thresholds for entanglement. For the case of two qubits we are able to establish fairly detailed results about the behaviour of entanglement with temperature. We also study entanglement in systems of indistinguishable particles, where even the question of which quantum states should be regarded as entangled has been the subject of much controversy. We aim to clarify this issue by applying Wiseman and Vaccaro&#146;s notion of entanglement of particles to a number of wellunderstood model systems. We discuss the advantages of the entanglement of particles approach compared with other methods in common use. Finally, we study the operational meaning of superselection rules in quantum physics, in particular the connection to the existence or not of an appropriate reference frame. We propose an experiment that aims to exhibit a coherent superposition of an atom and a molecule, apparently in violation of the commonly-accepted particle-number superselection rule. This result sheds light on the entanglement of particles approach to entanglement of indistinguishable particles. Part II returns to a fundamental question at the heart of quantum computation and quantum information, namely: how many quantum gates are required to perform a particular quantum computation? In other words, how efficiently can a quantum computer solve a particular computational problem? We establish a connection between this question and the field of Riemannian geometry. Intuitively, optimal quantum circuits correspond to &#147;free-falling&#148; along the shortest path between two points in a curved space. This opens up the possibility of using Riemannian geometry to study quantum computation, a possibility that was previously unknown. We provide explicit calculations of all the basic geometric quantities associated with the space, and give some preliminary results of applying geometric ideas to quantum computing. Finally, we explore more generally the connection between optimal control and quantum circuit complexity, of which the Riemannian metric described above can be viewed as a special case.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">240301 Atomic and Molecular Physics</field><field name="subject">780102 Physical sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158661</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An analysis of the underlying biochemical and genetic mechanisms that control gender and fertility in the Kuruma shrimp, Marsupenaeus japonicus (Bate)</field><field name="creator">Sellars, Melony J.</field><field name="description">Centuries of experience with terrestrial agriculture have demonstrated the value of domestication and selective breeding to improve production efficiency, profitability and sustainability. Compared to terrestrial agriculture there are remarkably few aquaculture industries that have progressed beyond the use of wild or unselected genotypes. This presents a major opportunity for the global aquaculture industry to capitalize on the benefits of domestication and selective breeding. However, there is a parallel need to ensure that a balance is achieved between optimizing genetic gains and conserving the biodiversity of the captive and wild stocks from which they are derived. In progressing towards domestication and genetic improvement, one of the key areas of interest includes the factors that control gender and fertility. Gender is of particular interest in species that are sexually dimorphic, with one gender being more attractive from a production point of view. Fertility is of broad interest as a key aspect of reproductive performance. Controlling fertility is also one method of protecting unwanted or unlicensed breeding of elite genotypes and preventing escapees from mating with wild stocks. For most aquacuculture species there is a fundamental lack of knowledge of the underlying biochemical and genetic mechanisms that control gender and fertility. The focus of this study was on developing methods for controlling gender and fertility in the Kuruma shrimp Marsupenaeus japonicus (Bate). This high value species has been farmed for several decades using the progeny of wild broodstock and, more recently, progeny of domesticated, selectively bred captive broodstock. The biological, biochemical and genetic processes that control gender and fertility in M. japonicus are of direct commercial interest and of wider interest to science. Commercial interest is for two reasons: First, M. japonicus are sexually dimorphic with females growing 30% larger than males and second, recent success in the genetic improvement of M. japonicus has prompted farmers to seek ways to protect superior genetic stocks from unlicensed breeding and to prevent escapees from genetically contributing to natural fishery populations. Thus, the knowledge and technology that could permit farmers to cost-effectively produce all-female, sterile stocks could be of significant commercial value. More broadly, research directed towards this goal could provide new insights into the underlying biological, genetic and biochemical processes that control gender and reproduction in penaeid shrimp. Previous studies on inducing sterility have demonstrated that this can result in altered gende r ratios in the target species. Accordingly, the approach adopted in this study was to investigate these traits simultaneously. There were three principal research components in this project, each of which focused on a different approach to achieving gender and/or fertility control in M. japonicus. The three components were; (1) the potential of ploidy manipulation to control gender and fertility; (2) the effect of ionizing radiation on fertility; (3) the potential of genetic engineering to control gender determination and germ cell specification. PLOIDY MANIPULATION Previous research on M. japonicus has shown that triploids produced by preventing polar body (PB) II extrusion are always female and sterile, however, induction rates never result in 100% triploid progeny. Therefore, experiments in the present study focused on developing a technique to produce triploids with a 100% induction rate. As mating of tetraploids and diploids is the only documented technique that has achieved 100% triploids in other cultured species, the present study investigated methods to induce tetraploidy in M. japonicus. First I attempted to prevent the first division in mitosis using temperature and chemical shocks. Second I attempted to inhibit extrusion of PBI and both PBI and II using chemical shocks only. I was successful at stopping the first mitotic division, preventing the extrusion of PBI and preventing the extrusion of both PBI and II in M. japonicus by applying different shocks at different times post-spawning for different durations. Tetraploid M. japonicus embryos were produced by stopping the first division in mitosis, however, they were not viable and did not hatch. The most suitable treatment regime for inducing tetraploidy, giving frequency (number of spawnings induced that result in some polyploids) and induction rate (number of individuals within a spawning induction which are tetraploid or triploid) equal importance, was a 36&#176;C shock administered 23 min post-spawning for a 5 or 10 min duration. Preventing the extrusion of PBI and both PBI and II using 150 &#181;M 6-dimethylaminopurine at 1 to 3 min post-spawning for either a 4 to 5 min duration (timed to stop PBI extrusion) or a 16 min duration (timed to stop both PBI and II extrusion) consistently resulted in the production of viable triploid M. japonicus embryos, which hatched into nauplii. No tetraploids were produced by preventing the extrusion of PBI or both PBI and II. This is the first report of successful PBI, and PBI and II prevention in shrimp, and production of triploids using the reported treatment regimes. These findings indicate that manipulation of the ploidy level may not be suitable for producing 100% all-female, sterile M. japonicus, as all tetraploids produced to-date are not viable and all known triploidy induction techniques never result in 100% triploid progeny. There may, however, be commercial value in utilising the PBI triploidy induction methods of the present study in an attempt to improve productivity as: - PBI triploids are believed to have increased heterozygosisty over PBII triploids and diploids, and possibly better growth performance, and - Stocking of ponds with spawnings that have received shocks to prevent PBI extrusion would result in a greater proportion of females to males (as the frequency of induction is always 100%), therefore resulting in improved farm profit based on greater total harvestable product in terms of weight, and the fact that females attract higher prices per kilogram due to their larger size class. IONIZING RADIATION Ionizing radiation (IR) has been successfully used to prevent reproduction in a wide range of organisms and can be effective at sterilizing 100% of treated individuals. IR also plays a role in producing monosex populations through gynogenesis and androgensis in a range of aquatic species. Despite this, there is no information on the effects of IR on penaeid shrimp reproduction. Experiments in the present study assessed the capacity of IR to confer sexual sterilization in female and male M. japonicus. Initial experiments were focused on optimizing IR dose ranges. For these experiments, harvest age shrimp were treated with 0, 10 or 20 gray (Gy) of IR and their ability to produce viable offspring was assessed by performing rigorous reproductive evaluations. Later experiments assessed the reproductive performance of 10 month old M. japonicus treated with IR at postlarval stage 15 (PL15) (15 days since metamorphosis from mysis to postlarval stage 1). Initially, a lethal dose curve of IR for PL15 M. japonicus was established. Based on these results, PL15 shrimp were treated with IR at 0, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 Gy to examine the effect of IR dose on their reproductive capacity at 10 months of age. IR was found to impair the reproductive performance of M. japonicus when treated at harvest age and when treated as postlarvae and reared to reproductive maturity. IR was, however, not 100% effective at preventing the production of viable offspring at the reported doses. Harvest age male shrimp were more sensitive to IR, being reproductively impaired at 10 Gy as compared to 20 Gy for harvest age females. PL15 females treated with 0 Gy of IR matured and spawned more frequently than PL15 females treated with 10, 15 and 20 Gy of IR. There were, however, no other significant effects of IR observed on M. japonicus reproductive performance when treated at PL15. IR doses higher than 35 Gy resulted in 100% mortality (i.e. lethal dose rate) of PL15 M. japonicus within 30 days after treatment, whilst doses of 25 and 30 Gy significantly reduced postlarval survival compared to controls. From preliminary research, dose rates of 25 Gy or more resulted in 100% mortality of harvest age females, whilst 20 Gy significantly reduced harvest age male survival. These findings indicate that IR doses that do not result in 100% mortality of harvest age and postlarval M. japonicus can reduce their reproductive capacity, however, these doses of IR can not confer 100% sterility. GENETIC ENGINEERING The combined use of molecular biotechnology and genetics to investigate mechanisms of gender and fertility determination in numerous animal phyla has gained increased research attention over the last decade. However, to-date there is only one known penaeid shrimp gene for which the complete coding sequence has been isolated (but not functionally characterized) that is known to be involved in gender and fertility determination of other species. The present study assessed the potential of using genetic engineering methodologies to control gender and fertility of M. japonicus using a multi-step approach. Initially this study attempted to identify one or more candidate genes in M. japonicus that had been previously selected from a comprehensive literature search (sex-lethal, transformer, double-sex and vasa), and subsequently characterize their complete coding sequence. Expression profiles of the isolated genes were then determined throughout embryonic, larval and postlarval development, and in female and male gonad tissue to identify key periods during early development when their expression is naturally up-regulated. Using an RNAi approach, this study then attempted to silence the candidate genes from being expressed during these key developmental periods and assess the resulting loss-of-function genotypes. In addition to these experiments, this study also investigated the suitability of different real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) assay methodologies for the studied diverse morphological sample set (relative vs absolute quantitation) and investigated different methodologies to deliver nucleic acids into shrimp embryos (electroporation vs a polyethylenimine (PEI) transfection reagent). A partial coding sequence for a dsx-like gene homologue, DMRT2, and a complete coding sequence for a PL10 vasa-like gene was isolated from M. japonicus. The PL10 vasa-like gene was named Mjpl10. Both genes were differentially expressed during embryonic, larval and postlarval development, and in female and male gonad. Using absolute qRT-PCR, I demonstrated that dsx-like gene transcripts were present at low levels throughout the first 5 h of embryogenesis after which transcript abundance increased significantly by the time embryos were 6 h old, suggesting a functional role for dsx transcripts at this developmental stage. Expression of the dsx-like gene was consistently high but variable throughout the remainder of embryogenesis and during larval and postlarval development up until PL48 at which point dsx transcripts were no longer detectible. This expression pattern indicated a functional role for the isolated dsx-like gene from 6 h post-spawning until PL30. Transcripts of the dsx-like gene were also detected in testes at low levels and were close to undetectable in the ovary of mature adults. Using absolute qRT- PCR I also demonstrated that Mjpl10 transcripts were present in the first developmental stage sampled (2-cell embryos) onwards, suggesting it is maternally expressed, and continually at low levels throughout embryogenesis. Mjpl10 expression increased significantly in the first 25 h after hatching (nauplii IV) and then decreased in a linear fashion by 316-fold over the next 52 day period. Its continued expression throughout embryonic and larval development is compatible with a conserved role in early germ cell specification. Transcript levels of Mjpl10 were also detected in the ovary and testes of mature adults. To silence expression of the identified candidate genes in vivo, short hairpin RNA (shRNA) DNA expression vectors were constructed that were capable of in vivo transcription of a dsxlike and Mjpl10 shRNA molecule. These shRNA molecules would theoretically trigger the RNAi pathway and result in gene-specific silencing of the target dsx-like gene and Mjpl10 gene transcripts. The white spot syndrome virus immediate early 1 (WSSV IE1) promoter was chosen to drive expression of the shRNA molecules. The WSSV IE1 promoter was initially isolated and cloned into a vector to drive expression of a luciferase mRNA. WSSV IE1 promoter function was found to be &gt;56% as efficient as the Orgyia pseudotsugata (Douglasfir Tussock moth) multicapsid nucleopolyhedrosis virus immediately-early 2 (OpIE2) promoter when compared in Fall Army worm, Spodopterea frugiperda (Sf) 9 insect cell culture. The vector containing the WSSV IE1 promoter was subsequently used to construct three recombinant DNA vectors capable of in vivo expression of a shRNA fragment of either the dsx-like gene, Mjpl10 or a placebo control luciferase gene. Three additional recombinant vectors were constructed with each containing a fragment of either the dsx-like gene, Mjpl10 or luciferase gene (identical to the sense strand of the shRNA fragments) that was inserted behind coding sequence for a green fluorescent protein and before the polyA tail. These three GFP fusion vectors were co-transfected with their corresponding shRNA expression vectors in Sf 9 cell culture. Theoretically mRNAs expressed by the GFP fusion vectors would be silenced and unable to express GFP if the corresponding shRNA expression vector was transcribing shRNA molecules that were capable of cleaving the GFP fusion mRNA polyA tail off the molecule through the RNAi pathway. Using this approach all three shRNA expression vectors constructed in this study were shown to be functional and capable of inducing a gene-specific silencing response in Sf 9 insect cell culture. Relative to a positive control, treatments transfected with the dsx-like shRNA expression vector had a reduced percentage of insect cells expressing GFP (i.e.18.07 &#177; 0.38% and 8.75 &#177; 0.15% compared to 100% in two independent experiments). Treatments transfected with the Mjpl10 shRNA expression vector also had a reduced percentage of cells expressing GFP relative to a positive control (i.e. 14.63 &#177; 0.59% and 9.19 &#177; 0.02% compared to 100% in two independent experiments). Similarly, treatments transfected with the luciferase shRNA expression vector had a reduced percentage of cells expressing GFP relative to a positive control (1.64 &#177; 0.02 and 0.47 &#177; 0.06% compared to 100% in two independent experiments). From these experiments it was evident that the WSSV IE1 promoter was functional, and that the shRNA fragments of the recombinant vectors were being expressed, folding and initiating a specific RNAi response. The three shRNA expressing recombinant DNA vectors and the positive transfection control luciferase mRNA expression vector were transfected into 1-cell M. japonicus embryos using the commercially available jetPEITM transfection reagent. Using qRT-PCR I demonstrated that jetPEITM DNA complexes were successfully transfected into 1-cell embryos as evidenced by the presence of in vivo transcribed exogenous luciferase mRNA in the positive transfection controls. Using qRT-PCR I then demonstrated that the Mjpl10 shRNA molecules were able to induce a small, but significant non-specific gene silencing response in vivo. The number of Mjpl10 mRNA copies detected per ng of total RNA was 14,108 &#177; 1,763 in the control compared to 6,701 &#177; 494 in the placebo shRNA treatment and 8,151 &#177; 1,151 in the genespecific Mjpl10 shRNA treatment. In comparison, the dsx-like shRNA molecules did not result in a non-specific silencing response. No specific gene silencing response was observed for either of the shRNA expression vectors. Given that the Mjpl10 and luciferase shRNA expression vectors were capable of reducing the total number of Mjpl10 mRNAs but no specific gene silencing was observed; the fact that the two endogenous targets, the dsx-like homologue and Mjpl10, are known to be expressed in specific cell types (i.e. the genital ridge and the germ cell lineage respectively) and a measurable gene silencing result would therefore require that large numbers of shRNA be in vivo transcribed in these specific cell types; and that the shRNA expression vectors had been demonstrated to be functional in Sf 9 cell culture, these results indicate that the WSSV IE1 promoter was not strong enough to drive in vivo expression of suitable quantities of shRNA molecules to induce a measurable gene silencing response. Future research should isolate alternative shrimp specific constitutive promoters such as &#946;-actin which are highly active at all life-history stages in the majority of cell types. The use of such promoters instead of the WSSV IE1 promoter would ensure a high level of expression of recombinant DNA vectors that are transfected in vivo. Comparison of the relative and absolute qRT-PCR quantitation approaches revealed significant differences in transcript level profiles between the two procedures for both target genes, the dsx-like gene and Mjpl10. When 18S rRNA was used as a reference, target gene expression was more similar to that of the absolute method than when &#946;-actin was used as a reference. Variability between the relative and absolute procedures occurred for a greater Percentage of the embryonic stages compared to later developmental stages. This study indicates that the use of 18S rRNA or &#946;-actin as reference genes for studying gene expression patterns in M. japonicus embryonic, larval, postlarval and gonad samples will give significantly variable results, and illustrates the proposition that housekeeping genes are not necessarily appropriate references for qRT- PCR data normalization. Until suitable reference genes are characterized, gene expression experiments using the studied M. japonicus tissues of different morphological developmental stages should use absolute quantification procedures. Finally, comparison of electroporation and the polyethylenimine (PEI) transfection reagent procedures demonstrated the jetPEITM transfection reagent was the most suitable means by which to transform 1-cell M. japonicus embryos. Electroporation was not found to be suitable for delivering nucleic acids into 1-cell M. japonicus embryos at quantities greater than what is detectible from nucleic acids attached to the outer embryo surface after DNase or RNase treatment. However, the commercially available jetPEITM transfection reagent was able to deliver nucleic acids into 1-cell M. japonicus embryos when soaked in the transfection media for between 50 min to 4 h post-spawning. Transfection was most successful when complexation was performed for 15 min in a sodium chloride buffer, followed by a 3 to 4 h incubation in sterile seawater prior to the addition of embryos. Greatest transformation rates (as measured by the number of exogenous mRNA template copies per ng of total RNA) were achieved when 1 mL of seawater and embryos were added to complexation mixtures within the first 5 min of spawning.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158613</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Expression and promoter analysis of Glycine max nodule autoregulation receptor kinase gene</field><field name="creator">Nontachaiyapoom, Sureeporn</field><field name="description">Legume-rhizobia symbioses contribute at least 20% of the biosphere's supply of reactive nitrogen. These unique associations rely on the exchange of specific molecular signals between nitrogen-fixing soil bacteria, collectively called rhizobia, and their host plants and, with few exceptions, result in the formation of root nodules, which provide an environment suitable for nitrogen fixation. However, nitrogen fixation is energetically expensive and nodule proliferation, in much the same manner as the proliferation of other meristems in plants, must be controlled in order to attain equilibrium between cell proliferation and differentiation. Nodule proliferation is controlled primarily and systemically by autoregulation of nodulation (AON). A gene central to this process was first isolated by map-based cloning from soybean (Glycine max) and was named G. max Nodule Autoregulation Receptor Kinase (GmNARK) in accordance with its biochemical and physiological functions. Expression patterns of GmNARK have been described by several investigators; however, these reports were based on either non-quantitative methods or a limited number of tissue types. More importantly, the expression domains of GmNARK were completely unknown. The study described in this thesis utilised techniques such as quantitative RT-PCR (QRTPCR), transcription start site mapping, promoter-reporter gene fusion, and promoter deletion, to analyse the expression levels and domains of GmNARK across a variety of tissues as well as identify the promoter elements that are responsible for the basal and tissue-specific expression of GmNARK. In addition, the promoter activity of GmNARK was also compared with that of Lotus japonicus HAR1, the GmNARK orthologue, in both homologous and heterologous transformation systems. Based on QRT-PCR, GmNARK was expressed to varying levels throughout the plant; the transcript was detected at high levels in mature leaves and roots but to a lesser extent in young leaves, shoot tips and nodules. The transcript level was not significantly affected by Bradyrhizobium japonicum during the first week following inoculation. Histochemical analysis of L. japonicus plants carrying either a 1.7 kb GmNARK promoter or 2.0 kb LjHAR1 promoter fused to a beta-glucuronidase reporter gene localised GUS activity to living cells within vascular bundles, especially phloem cells in leaves, stems, roots, and nodules. Phloem-specific expression was also detected in soybean hairy roots carrying these constructs. These results suggested that both cis- and trans-acting elements required for the transcriptional regulation of these orthologous genes are likely to be conserved. In contrast, 1.7 kb of the GmNARK promoter did not drive phloem-specific expression in Arabidopsis thaliana, indicating the absence of the trans-acting elements required for the tissue-specificity of GmNARK in this distantly related species. The comparison of 2.0 kb of promoter sequences of GmNARK, LjHAR1 and Medicago truncatula SUNN, another GmNARK orthologue, using bioinformatics and computational approaches indicated several highly conserved motifs including a putative negative regulatory region (NRR), which was previously reported to repress gene expression in non-phloem cell types. Deletion analysis of the GmNARK promoter, however, ruled out the possibility that this motif, found at -308 bp with respect to the translation start site, was truly functional and located the region controlling phloem-specific expression to DNA sequence between 908 bp and 1.7 kb upstream of the start codon. Two other candidate regions were identified by Multiple EM for Motif Elicitation (MEME). These regions, namely MEME3 and MEME4 showed strong sequence similarity to the corresponding regions of the LjHAR1 promoter. Interestingly, the MEME3 motif was also found in the MtSUNN promoter at a similar location to that of LjHAR1. Potential NRRs in the LjHAR1 and MtSUNN promoters were found in the MEME3 motifs, whereas only a variant form of a NRR in the GmNARK promoter was found in this region. Additionally, an identical semi-palindromic sequence was also observed in the MEME3 motifs of the three orthologous promoters. Based on these findings, the semi-palindromic sequence and the variant form of the NRR are proposed to be positive and negative regulatory elements for the phloem-specific expression of GmNARK, respectively. The computational approaches also identified two potential TATA elements in the GmNARK promoter. Rapid amplification of 5' cDNA ends and promoter deletion analysis have confirmed that they were functional. The two TATA elements in GmNARK promoter appeared to cooperatively direct transcription of GmNARK, but either was adequate for basal transcription. The finding that the expression of AON receptor-like kinase genes is phloem-specific has contributed to a better understanding of AON signalling pathways. The QRT-PCR study and the discovery of cis-acting regulatory regions have also provided crucial information on the transcriptional regulation of GmNARK as well as plant genes in general. Additionally, the promoters of GmNARK and LjHAR1 could potentially be used to drive phloem-specific expression in legume biotechnology research.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300203 Plant Improvement (Selection, Breeding and Genetic Engineering)</field><field name="subject">legumes</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158587</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Longwall shearer cutting force estimation</field><field name="creator">Reid, Anthony Walton</field><field name="description">A methodology to monitor the real-time cutting forces generated by a longwall shearer is developed. Longwall shearers are the single productive element in an underground longwall coal mine, and are a major source of unscheduled system downtime. The cutting forces constitute the interaction between the longwall and the coal face. Knowledge of the forces can improve the reliability and productivity of longwall mines by providing a means of shearer condition monitoring. A Kalman filter based cutting force estimator is developed, and then tested using a comprehensive shearer simulation incorporating a dynamic representation of the cutterhead. Subsequently, prior work on autonomous shearer guidance with measured pick forces is extended by employing the estimated cutting forces to track changes to the shearer's horizon. This is validated by simulation. The force estimation methodology uses an extended Kalman filter to blend noisy measurement information with a nonlinear system model, the latter combining the dynamics of the shearer and its inputs. A detailed model is developed of the shearer rigid body dynamics, and of the measurements required for observability. The formulation avoids the use of sensors at the coal cutting interface. The methodology uses proven, practicable and reliable sensor technologies, making it suitable for longterm force monitoring. A comprehensive simulation of a longwall shearer is developed using the MATLAB(R) Simulink(R) and MSC.visualNastran 4DTM software environments. This incorporates dynamic representations of the major structures and inputs, including the interaction between the cutterhead and the coal face. The simulation is used to investigate the cutting forces in a number of different operational scenarios. This facilitates the construction of a basic dynamic model of the forces, and provides insight into the relationship between the cutting forces and the condition of the cutting interface. The cutting force estimator is tested using measurements from the shearer simulations. It is shown that the cutting force estimates track the fiducial forces well in each scenario. A number of modifications to the force models are also shown to improve the performance of the estimator. Sensitivity analyses are conducted to investigate the effect of tuned process noise covariance and model parameter errors on the estimates. The application to the problems of shearer condition monitoring and horizon tracking are considered. The first is demonstrated by detecting the effects of a worn pick and a seam hardness gradient on the force estimates, and the second by using the force estimates to track the motion of the cutterhead relative to an embedded stone band. The results show that it is possible, in principle, to estimate the cutting forces generated by a longwall shearer from indirect measurements using a Kalman filter methodology. Furthermore, the force estimates reveal changes to the cutting environment, and can track the vertical motion of the shearer as it operates. This thesis represents the first step in the development of a shearer cutting force estimator. The ultimate goal of the research is to improve the reliability and productivity of Australian longwall operations, using the estimated forces to monitor shearer condition. Autonomous horizon tracking with estimated forces can lead to further improvements to longwall productivity, and to the health and safety of mine personnel. A number of recommendations are made for future field validation, and development of an automated shearer condition monitoring system based on the cutting force estimates.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">290502 Industrial Engineering</field><field name="subject">650202 Coal</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158453</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Froth recovery measurements in large industrial flotation cells</field><field name="creator">Alexander, Daniel John</field><field name="description">The role of mathematical models and simulators in describing the performance of mineral processing applications have had a large impact in optimising existing industrial plants and designing new plants over recent years. Before the development of sophisticated computer simulators, the design engineer used industrial &#8220;rules of thumb&#8221; to estimate the size and layout of plants. However, newly designed plants after commissioning, often do not meet the design product specification requirements and quite often years of &#8220;trial and error&#8221; optimisation is required. This process can be very costly especially with froth flotation processes where the complexity of the various stages of treatment makes &#8220;trial and error&#8221; optimisation very difficult to quantify and assess the benefits. Over the past 10 years, advances in the modelling of the flotation process have been conducted by many authors. The most significant flotation modelling advances in recent years have been provided by the AMIRA (Australian Mineral Industry Research Association) P9 project, whereby a new modelling methodology has been proposed. Within this methodology, the flotation response can be represented by a number of sub-processes including parameters describing the hydrodynamic, froth and ore characteristics. Although these parameters have been proposed, methods for measuring these parameters in large flotation cells are still developing, especially in the areas of the froth zone recovery and entrainment. In the light of this it was felt that the literature on froth recovery determination should be investigated to determine the most appropriate method for measuring froth recovery in large industrial flotation cells. It was found after the investigation of the literature that three techniques for measuring the froth recovery parameter stood out as potential methods for measurement within a large scale flotation cell. These were the methods decribed by Gorain et al (1998), Vera et al (1999) and Savassi et al (1997). It was decided that all three methods should be assessed on a quantitative and qualitative basis from data collected at the Mount Isa Mines (now Xstrata) Copper flotation circuit. In this assessment, all three methods were extensively trialed in a 2.8 m3 flotation cell which was operated in parallel to the main copper rougher flotation circuit. The cell could be operated at numerous operating conditions which allowed sufficient data to be collected. The conclusions from this work were that although the method proposed by Vera et al (1999) required significant amounts of data, the method appeared to be reliable in this scale of cell. The main recommendation from this work was to further test the Vera methodology in larger industrial flotation cells. A 100 m3 Outukumpu tank cell at the Mount Keith Nickel Concentrator was chosen for the further assessment of the Vera et al (1999) methodology and its applicability to large scale cells. This flotation cell was one of the largest flotation cells operating on a production scale at the time of the testwork. Numerous tests were conducted and data collected from this investigation showed that the Vera et al (1999) technique was applicable to this scale of flotation cell. Since the work at Mount Keith was conducted in a rougher flotation cell, it was decided to test the methodology with numerous cells of various sizes and duties at the Kambalda Nickel Concentrator. As with the previous investigation at Mount Keith, it was observed that the Vera method was able to measure froth recoveries in all cells measured at Kambalda (within typical operating ranges). However, the technique was not applicable at shallow froth depths since it does not take into account the effect of the pulp-froth interface within the froth recovery parameter estimation. The pulp froth interface and close to it is where a significant proportion of dropback occurs within the froth zone. In addition to this problem, the methodology required large numbers of samples and disturbed downstream processes which made the technique unpractical for operating industrial flotation plants. Hence, a new technique for measuring froth recovery in large flotation cells was required. For the technique to be successful on an industrial scale it required the following: &#8226; minimum disturbance on the process, &#8226; take into account the pulp froth interface within the froth recovery parameter, and &#8226; require a minimum amount of samples. To meet these needs a new technique was developed based on the Savassi et al (1997) technique and combining it with recent work by authors including Vera et al (2003). The methodology involves taking samples of the feed, concentrate and tail as per a typical flotation survey and combining them with two new samples: the air hold-up sample and the top of froth sample. With the addition of these samples, a mass balance across the pulp and froth phase could be conducted and the froth recovery parameter derived. In addition, the new method provided measurements of the pulp zone average bubble load and the amount recovered by the entrainment mechanism. The proposed method has a simple procedure which allows the technique to be used by academics and mill operators alike. The proposed froth recovery measurement technique was tested in numerous cells of various types (i.e. Wemco, Outokumpu, Dorr-Oliver etc), various sizes (up to 150 m3 in size), various duties (rougher, scavenger, cleaner, recleaner, etc) and various plants. In most cases the methodology proved to be a reliable measure of the froth recovery parameter. In addition, at the Century Zinc Operation, the methodology was compared directly with the original Vera et al (1999) technique and the results showed that there was a good comparison between the results with the off-set of the pulp-froth interface. A number of contributions to both the research and industrial areas have been provided from the outcomes of the thesis. The main contributions include: &#8226; A full assessment of the three current methods for measuring the froth recovery parameter within large flotation cells. With recommendations of developing a new technique. &#8226; The development of a froth recovery measurement technique which can be used in large cells to understand the impact of the froth zone in an individual cell, use within the AMIRA P9 modelling methodology and plant diagnostics. &#8226; The new method also allows the estimation of the average bubble load and quantifies the amount of material recovered by the entrainment mechanism which is invaluable to metallurgists in assessing the performance of a flotation circuit (plant diagnostics). Finally, the results of this thesis will provide practising metallurgists both within the research and operating fields, techniques to improve the profitability of flotation circuits worldwide. Metallurgists can quickly assess the performance of large flotation cells in terms of froth performance, bubble load and entrainment which has not been available before. In addition, the results from this thesis will also allow metallurgists to mathematically represent their plant through flotation models better and improve their understanding of their flotation circuits.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">091404 Mineral Processing/Beneficiation</field><field name="subject">840399 First Stage Treatment of Ores and Minerals not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158425</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of collaboration: a study of the influences of violinists on the violin repertoire of Sergei Prokofiev.</field><field name="creator">Maddick, Andrew Flannigan</field><field name="description">This critical commentary examines the process of composer-performer collaboration in the violin works of Sergei Prokofiev. It focuses on four of Prokofiev&#146;s major violin works: the Concerto no. 1 op. 19, Concerto no. 2 op. 63, Sonata no. 2 op. 94-bis, and Sonata no. 1 op. 80. In all these pieces Prokofiev collaborated with prominent violinists and this critical commentary highlights the ways in which these musicians variously affected Prokofiev&#146;s violin writing style. The collaborations examined are those involving the violinists Pawel Kocha;ski, Robert So&#235;tens, and David Oistrakh. The bulk of the critical commentary provides a comparison of the Flute Sonata op. 94 and the Violin Sonata no. 2 op. 94-bis (which was edited by David Oistrakh). By analysing the amendments to the flute score the extent to which Oistrakh influenced the arrangement of the violin version is established. The success of their working relationship is given testimony in the enduring popularity of this sonata.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158384</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Expression of hnRNPs A/B in cancer cells and their roles in carcinogenesis</field><field name="creator">He, Yaowu</field><field name="description">The identification of specific and reproducible biomarkers is critical for the early diagnosis of cancer, which has a profound effect the survival rate of patients. Comprehensive laboratory and clinical evidence needs to be collected to confirm the accuracy of the biomarkers prior to their clinical use. Heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) A2 and B1 have been suggested as biomarkers for cancer since 1988 when hnRNP A2/B1 overexpression was first linked with the occurrence of lung cancer. Later studies established a correlation between the expression levels of these hnRNPs and other cancers, such as breast, pancreatic, and lymphatic tumours. In this study, the expression of hnRNPs A1, A2, A3, and B1 has been investigated in various cancer cell lines. hnRNPs A1 and A3, in addition to A2 and B1, were found to be overexpressed in some cancer types. However, the overexpression of none of the hnRNP A/B proteins was universal, and their upregulation may be limited to a few cell types, suggesting they may be effective biomarkers for a subset of cancers. The upregulation of hnRNP A/B proteins in tumours and cancer cell lines led to the hypothesis that they are involved in the uncontrolled cell growth in cancer. According to our Western blot analysis, expression of the hnRNP proteins, A1, A2, and B1, is dependent on the cell cycle whereas no significant change was detected for hnRNP A3, implying that the former three are needed during certain cell cycle stages. The results, together with the transcription factor analysis of the promoter regions of the HNRPA1, HNRPA2, and HNRPA3 genes, suggest that hnRNPs A1, A2, and A3 may have distinct regulatory machineries and cellular functions although they have high amino acid sequence identity. However, their mRNA levels were unchanged across the cell cycle, suggesting the cell-cycle-dependent expression of hnRNPs A1, A2, and B1 is modulated at the translational level. Previous studies showed higher expression of hnRNPs A1 and A2 in rapidly proliferating cells than in quiescent cells, suggesting a role of these proteins in cell proliferation. Though interruption of hnRNP A1 expression did not result in significant change in the viability of murine CB3 cells, simultaneous suppression of hnRNPs A1 and A2 caused apoptosis in a few cell lines. Consistent with this, suppression of hnRNP A1 or A3 expression in our study in Colo16 squamous cells using RNA interference did not affect cell proliferation, but simultaneous suppression of both caused slow cell proliferation. By contrast, reduction of the hnRNP A2 level alone slowed the proliferation of Colo16 cells. These results suggest that although hnRNPs A1, A2, and A3 share some roles in cell proliferation, each of them may have distinct tasks. This conclusion is supported by the data from the comparative analysis of the downstream targets of hnRNPs A1, A2, and A3, which has shown that these three proteins share a limited number of common downstream proteins. The observed impact on cell proliferation of suppressing hnRNP A2 subfamily proteins is in accord with our finding that the downstream targets of hnRNP A2 are overrepresented by genes involved in proliferation regulation, as shown in microarray and real-time PCR analysis. These include cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors, p21 and p27, and their regulatory proteins, such as Skp2 and Rpn10. Skp2 controls the ubiquitination of p21 and p27, and Rpn10 links them to the 26S proteasome, the complex that degrades these two CDK inhibitors. hnRNP A2 also regulates the transcription of securin and separin, which are essential for sister chromatid separation during late anaphase. In addition, hnRNP A2 can also influence cell proliferation through cell growth factors, including fibroblast, vascular endothelial, transforming, and insulin growth factors. Our gene array and real-time PCR analysis have shown that hnRNP A2 regulates the expression of these factors, their receptors, or associated proteins such as IGFBP7 and TGFBR2. The data presented in this thesis link the overexpression of hnRNP A/B proteins, in particular the A2/B1 subfamily, in cancer with their regulatory roles in cell division and cell proliferation. Our findings provide mechanistic evidence that these proteins may be a driving force for the uncontrolled cell growth in cancer, suggesting that some of hnRNP A/B proteins may be potential therapeutic targets for cancer. However, further studies are needed to obtain a global view of the roles of these proteins in cancer.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270201 Gene Expression</field><field name="subject">780105 Biological sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158357</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of motivation through repertoire in intermediate cello students</field><field name="creator">Berry, Anne Irma</field><field name="description">The decision to research motivation through repertoire in intermediate cellists arose from two different perceived areas of need. Firstly, it was found that there was a scarcity of availability and accessibility of Australian compositions for intermediate cellists. Secondly, the literature suggested that there was a need for the further research of intrinsic motivation in the field of instrumental pedagogy. A review of the literature found that research into intrinsic motivation in instrumental pedagogy was mostly related to the 'process' of developing and maintaining motivation. Of the research which examined the aspect of 'content' in the maintenance of intrinsic motivation, this was mostly related to 'student choice'. This study emerged as a way of providing information to composers and teachers about what aspects of repertoire may be motivational. It investigates intrinsic motivation by questioning students and their teachers about which aspects of music repertoire are most likely to inspire students to practice more and strive for excellence. A discussion of the philosophies of Bruner and Csikszentmihalyi is included to give meaning and context to 'intrinsic motivation' in instrumental pedagogy. Research was conducted through purpose-designed questionnaires distributed to cello teachers and their students in Queensland. Questionnaires for teachers and students were very similar although the student questionnaire was a little shorter. The questionnaires gathered information on the most frequently used general teaching repertoire, as well as teachers&#146; experiences in teaching contemporary and Australian repertoire. Musical aspects investigated included style, emotional content, harmony, articulation, tempo (speed), tonality, and rhythm as well as cellistic techniques. This information was balanced with questions regarding the technical developmental requirements perceived necessary for intermediate students. In comparison with other motivators such as verbal encouragement, ensemble participation and preparation for performances and exams, repertoire was found to be a significant motivator for 'students' best work'. Students' preference for challenging music, or by contrast, beautiful music was a persistent theme throughout the results. The three characteristics which were nominated as most motivating by both teachers and students were fast and lively, from the Romantic period and for cello and piano. The strongest difference between results for teachers and students was on the characteristic of folk feel which produced opposite results for the two groups of respondents. Some differences were also found within the respondent groups on the basis of gender and age. It is noted that students acknowledged the benefits of learning more advanced aspects of technique, such as thumb position, in expanding the pool of repertoire which they would be able to play. It was confirmed that Australian repertoire was not often taught to students at this level and that this was, at least in part, because of a lack of availability. Suggestions have been made for both composers and teachers in choosing techniques and repertoire for intermediate students. However, the importance of asking students about their preferences is borne out by the volume and detail of students' individual responses. Also, by questioning their students, teachers are likely to be stimulating the valued development of 'metacognitive strategies' in adolescent students.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">410101 Music</field><field name="subject">750201 The performing arts (incl. music, theatre and dance)</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158346</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Scientists in Conflict: Hans Bethe, Edward Teller and the Shaping of United States Nuclear Weapons Policy, 1945-1972</field><field name="creator">Bird, Jacqueline Maree</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the adversarial roles of nuclear physicists Hans Bethe and Edward Teller as political advisors during the first three decades of the nuclear era and the part each played in the shaping of US nuclear weapons policy. It focuses on four episodes - post-war arms control, the development of the hydrogen bomb, the banning of nuclear weapons testing and the deployment and subsequent banning of a limited system of missile defence, and in each episode, it contrasts the scientists&#146; individual motives, political agendas, means of affecting policy and respective degrees of success. Thereafter, it assesses the pair as Cold War political advisors by considering the validity of their advice as regards the Soviet nuclear program. Whereas a number of scholarly works have been devoted to the political career of Teller, these have typically focused on his role in the hydrogen bomb controversy. In contrast, very little has been written about Bethe&#146;s political role, despite its obvious significance. Interestingly, no work to date has focused specifically on the openly confrontational roles of these two scientific advisors, who remained at the forefront of the decision-making process over nuclear weapons policy for many years. This thesis meets this objective by providing an historical voice to Bethe, a largely overlooked historical figure, while offering fresh insight into Teller, a contentious Cold War character. In doing so, it utilizes a range of recently declassified sources to shed further light on previously documented episodes, such as the hydrogen bomb affair, while chronicling largely untold episodes, including the pair&#146;s involvement in the debate over missile defence. At the same time, it challenges a commonly-held conception that Teller, by utilizing his connections to influential Washington conservatives, was able largely to dictate the course of nuclear policy throughout this period. Indeed, a central contention of this study is that Bethe, by effectively employing both his personal and professional reputation, was able to moderate the influence of his well-placed colleague. Finally, through the use of recently published sources on the Soviet nuclear progam, this study assesses the validity of the political advice of the two scientists, concluding that both men were hindered to a certain extent by the rigidity of their respective positions. Specifically, it argues that Bethe&#146;s advice was characterized by an unduly benign view of Soviet intentions, and Teller&#146;s by an exaggeration of Soviet capabilities.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">430104 History - North American</field><field name="subject">780199 Other</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158344</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vapours and visions religious dimensions of DMT use</field><field name="creator">Tramacchi, Desmond Thomas</field><field name="description">Not available</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">440207 Religion and Society</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158343</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The choice between rural living and agriculture: Implications for land use and subdivision policy</field><field name="creator">Anstey, Geoff</field><field name="description">In much of Australia and the United States, the almost universal right to have a house on rural allotments has resulted in rural living settlement in areas intended, by land use planning policy, to be used for agriculture. Such &#145;unplanned&#146; rural living has a range of potential adverse impacts, including, among other things, loss of agricultural production, land use conflicts with agriculture, land value constraints on farm restructuring, and changes to the rural landscape character. Given the strongly held community perception of a house as a development right, this research was motivated by the need to understand the effects of that right, in order to assess the potential value of any change in policy. An integral consideration was the influence of the size of allotments with any such right. The research was also driven by an interest in explaining the pattern of unplanned rural living settlement, i.e. why are particular allotments converted and others not? Largely in the absence of previous studies of unplanned rural living as a distinct phenomenon, there was scope for this thesis to make a contribution to knowledge in these respects. The research involved three stages of empirical analysis. Firstly, a Queensland-wide survey of land use conversion from sugarcane production supported the choice of the Bundaberg region as the study area. Contingency table analyses were then conducted into the current land use and other attributes of land in the study area that, in 1980, was used for sugarcane. Those analyses identified distinguishing attributes of the different land use sub-sets of allotments, and informed the selection of observation units for the third stage. The third stage provided the principal basis for fulfilling the research objectives. It focused on logit models of the choice, at the time of sale, between using a particular allotment for unplanned rural living or sugarcane production. Those analyses provided an indication of the role of individual land attributes while controlling for the effects of other attributes. It was found there had been limited conversion of suitable, productive sugarcane land to unplanned rural living. Compared to those allotments that remained in sugarcane production, allotments converted to rural living were, on average, much smaller, of less value, had lower agricultural production potential, and were situated in more undulating and forested landscapes further from Bundaberg. These clear distinctions between rural living and sugarcane allotments contributed to logit models with high explanatory power. The expected productive income of allotments had overwhelming weight and was highly statistically significant in explaining the land use choice between unplanned rural living and sugarcane. This is a notable finding, because some other studies have not shown such a strong relationship between land use and measures such as soil productivity. There was a degree of natural coincidence between more undulating and forested landscapes and lower productive potential. Notably, landscape attributes appeared to be of secondary importance in determining land use. The presence of a house at the time of sale was not a statistically significant explanatory factor for land use. This finding, together with that of limited conversion of suitable, productive land to unplanned rural living, meant there was a lack of evidence to support a change to the right to have a house on rural allotments. The findings did indicate that the allotment area required to avoid conversion to unplanned rural living was different to the area required for agricultural viability. In the circumstances of this study area and period, 20 ha would have been an acceptable minimum to retain suitable cropping land in productive use. This is compared to the 60 ha suggested as necessary for farm viability. However, the potential for changed economic conditions to reduce the productive value of agricultural land, and increase demand for rural living, makes it appropriate to be cautious about permitted allotment sizes. A detailed conceptual framework informed the selection of observation units and variables for the third stage of analyses. The framework helped to confirm allotment sales as the observation units, and provided the rationale for excluding the difficult to measure influences of a landowner&#146;s attachment to the land, and inertia, as explanatory variables. The high explanatory power of the logit models provides support for the approach, which may be useful in future studies.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300804 Environmental Impact Assessment</field><field name="subject">770905 Integrated (ecosystem) assessment and management</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158323</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling thickness in a stratiform deposit using joint simulation techniques</field><field name="creator">Eggins, Ronald George</field><field name="description">The estimated economic value of a stratiform mineral deposit is often very sensitive to the modelling of thickness in a conformable sequence of beds. A coregionalisation model of thickness expresses the assumed underlying spatial relationships of bedding thickness on a regional scale. Joint simulation of thickness directly models the cross-correlation of bedding thickness in such a model. Many of the current techniques of joint simulation are limited in the number of variables that can be simulated due to the multiplicative increase in processing times, based on the number of variables and number of samples simulated. To minimise processing times some methods make use of simplifying assumptions on the coregionalisation model. For example the Markov model, in which the dependence of one variable on the other is limited to the collocated data, would be unlikely to apply to the thickness of conformable bedding in a stratiform deposit. Transforming the thickness variables to remove correlation, simulating, and then back transforming to original data space offered a possible solution. The Minimum/Maximum Autocorrelation Factor (MAF) technique was chosen as one most likely to successfully decorrelate numbers of thickness variables, if the assumptions regarding a two-structure linear coregionalisation model were reasonably satisfied by the sampled data. The assumptions are that a simple intrinsic model of coregionalisation can represent both a lower correlation (&#145;noise&#146;) component and a higher correlation (&#145;signal&#146;) component of the modelled data. This implies that the final coregionalisation model (noise plus signal) is made up of linear combinations of a single basic structure at different spatial scales. In a number of previous applications, this had not proved to be a particularly restrictive requirement of the model. The decorrelated variables can be independently simulated, and back transformed twice; firstly using a MAF back-transformation to obtain correlated Gaussian variables, and finally to original data space. The McArthur River silver/lead/zinc stratiform deposit in the Northern Territory of Australia was chosen as the case study because it had many of the characteristics needed to test and evaluate the MAF technique in a typical stratiform deposit. The orebody model contained seventeen (17) mineralised units forming a conformable sequence which had varying thickness and degrees of mineralisation, and which had good continuity across the deposit. Cross-correlation between the thicknesses of the seventeen stratigraphic units was significant. The deposit was heavily folded in certain areas and true thickness of the bedding was calculated from drillhole log data, and used for the simulation studies. A simple unfolding algorithm was utilised to effectively flatten the deposit to allow the application of 2-D simulation techniques. Drillhole intersections often did not contain the full stratigraphic sequence of beds due to a series of normal faults criss-crossing the deposit. Therefore, incomplete data in the drillhole would need to be removed from the data set, or the number of beds in the joint simulation would need to be reduced, to utilise the MAF technique. A method was developed and validated for the generation of missing thicknesses at a sample point which removed the requirement to delete real incomplete sub-sets of the data when utilising MAF. Sequential Gaussian Simulation (SGS) was used to simulate the MAF decorrelated variables under the assumption that the multi-Gaussian assumptions held. Bedding surface simulations were generated by the addition of true thickness perpendicular to a basal reference surface. The 2-D joint simulations of thicknesses and surfaces were considered successful within a domain of the deposit where drillholes were approximately perpendicular to bedding after unfolding. The univariate, bivariate and spatial statistics of the original thickness data were reproduced accurately in the joint simulation model, including the crossvariograms of original thickness; especially compared to those obtained using independent simulation of thickness. It was concluded that the techniques could be successfully applied to other stratiform deposits if the recommended validation steps were carried out. No further difficulties should be encountered in applying the method to 2-D joint simulation of grades in a stratiform deposit. The full 3-D joint simulation of variables in any deposit using MAF would be assisted by the technique to generate missing variables at a point.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">260100 Geology</field><field name="subject">780104 Earth sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158312</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Selective transport of attached particles across the froth phase</field><field name="creator">Seaman, David Richard</field><field name="description">Over many years, researchers in the field of flotation have developed an in-depth understanding of processes occurring in the pulp phase of flotation machines. Until recently, however, the froth phase has received little attention. The froth phase serves to separate bubble-particle aggregates from suspended slurry in a flotation cell. The mechanism of recovery by entrainment, its relationship to water recovery and particle size dependency is well understood. Froth recovery, (the fraction of particles entering the concentrate launder that entered the froth phase attached to air bubbles), is not well understood. Up until now, there has been doubt over whether this property is dependent on particle size and hydrophobicity. Difficulties in measuring froth recovery had previously prevented researchers from gaining a deeper understanding of the transport of attached particles across the froth phase. A novel device was designed and tested to measure froth recovery by isolating bubble-particle aggregates in the pulp-phase of flotation machines through the determination of the bubble loading in the pulp phase (mass of particles attached per unit volume of air bubbles). This technique can be used with other measurements to investigate froth selectivity by directly comparing these captured particles to those found in the froth phase. Evidence was collected at Red Dog Mine, Alaska and Newmont Golden Grove Operations, Western Australia which showed that the froth phase selectively transported more hydrophobic and smaller sized particles across the froth than less hydrophobic and larger particles. Particles collected in the device were compared to those found in the concentrate stream on a size by mineral by liberation class. Froth recovery was also calculated on a size by mineral by liberation class for two valuable sulphide minerals in a continuous 3m&#179; flotation cell. These results show that the froth phase is responsible for the upgrading of attached particles across the froth phase as well as for the separation of bubble-particle aggregates from suspended slurry. The pulp phase is responsible for creating bubble-particle aggregates through the attachment of hdyrophobic mineral particles to air bubbles. Many complex factors affect the extent to which this occurs including the size and hdyrophobicity of the particles, the size and number of air bubbles produced by the flotation machine, the rate of collisions between particles and bubbles and the overall chemistry of the system. This measurement of bubble loading presents an opportunity to measure the impact of all these factors on the successful creation of bubble-particle aggregates. Based on a literature review suggesting that there was a high probability of particles being detached at the pulp-froth interface due to the aggregates change in momentum, a three phase description of a flotation cell was proposed. The three phases were: pulp, pulp-froth interface and upper froth zones. A second froth recovery measurement technique (changing froth depth) was used in combination with the bubble load technique to determine the recovery across each of the two froth zones. It was found that the pulp-froth interface appears to be responsible for the selectivity observed across the froth phase as a whole. These findings will enable more in-depth research into the sub-process of the froth phase as well as assisting flotation cell design through a better understanding of the roles of the pulp-froth interface and the upper froth region.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">290702 Mineral Processing</field><field name="subject">640300 First Stage Treatment of Ores and Minerals</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158293</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bivalves and the Bucephalidae: A parasitic system on the Great Barrier Reef</field><field name="creator">Bott, Nathan James</field><field name="description">This study set out to examine, for the first time, both the molluscan intermediate and the teleost definitive hosts of a major assemblage of trematode parasites present on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). The parasite taxon was the Bucephalidae which occur in piscivorous fishes as sexually reproducing adults and in bivalves as asexually reproducing stages. The goal was to characterise the overall richness of the system and to explore patterns of host-specificity. Because of the size of this fauna it was not possible to incorporate all the taxa found in this study. This thesis reports the results of a survey of bivalves from this region, taxonomic studies on several elements of the fauna of fishes, and efforts to link life-cycles between bivalves and fishes. I surveyed 2256 bivalve individuals (47 species, 17 families) from South-east Queensland, Heron Island (southern GBR) and Lizard Island (northern GBR). Infections of trematode species from three families, Bucephalidae, Gorgoderidae and Monorchiidae, were found. Overall prevalence of infection was 2.3%. The Bucephalidae (11 species) was the most commonly found family. A single gorgoderid infection was found from a venerid, Lioconcha castrensis. This is the first report of a gorgoderid from a marine bivalve and phylogenetic analysis suggests that the species belongs to the Gorgoderinae. Monorchiids (5 species) were found from Tellinidae and Lucinidae. All infections are new host/parasite records. I deduce that this study produced lifecycle information, but no actual identifications, for 10% of the species of trematodes that infect bivalves of Queensland marine waters. Prosorhynchoides apogonis n. sp. is described from the intestine of the apogonid Cheilodipterus macrodon from the southern GBR. This is the first bucephalid to be described from the teleost family Apogonidae. Prosorhynchoides lamprelli n. sp. is described from the intestine of the carangid Caranx papuensis from off Lizard Island, GBR. This is the first bucephalid to be described from Caranx papuensis. A new trematode genus, Grammatorcynicola n. g. (Dolichoenterinae), and two new species, G. brayi n. sp. and G. nolani n. sp., are described from the intestines of the scombrids, Grammatorcynus bicarinatus and Gr. bilineatus respectively. Grammatorcynicola n. g. differs from other dolichoenterine genera in having a simple sucker-like rhynchus, the ovary anterior to the testes and by not having a particularly thick cirrus-sac wall. Six new species of bucephalid trematodes from the prosorhynchine bucephalid genera Prosorhynchus Odhner, 1905 and Neidhartia Nagaty, 1937 are reported from the epinepheline serranid genera Cephalopholis, Cromileptes, Epinephelus and Variola from the GBR. Two species of Prosorhynchus and one Neidhartia are reported from Epinephelus spp., P. jexi n. sp. from E. quoyanus, P. lafii n. sp. from E. fuscoguttatus, and N. epinepheli n. sp. from E. maculatus. The other species are P. robertsthomsoni n. sp. from several species of Cephalopholis, P. conorjonesi n. sp. from Cromileptes altivelis, and P. milleri n. sp. from Variola louti. I examined three species of Plectropomus (Serranidae: Epinephelinae), Pl. laevis, Pl. leopardus and Pl. maculatus from off Heron Island and Lizard Island on the GBR. Nine bucephalid species from the Prosorhynchinae were found, three species of Neidhartia and six species of Prosorhynchus. The three species of Neidhartia, N. haywardi n. sp., N. plectropomi n. sp. and N. tyleri n. sp., are readily distinguishable by morphology. Two of the six species of Prosorhynchus (P. lesteri n. sp. and P. wrightae n. sp.) are easily distinguished from their other congeners by morphology but the other four species (P. adlardi n. sp., P. heronensis n. sp., P. munozae n. sp. and P. plectropomi n. sp.) are highly similar in morphology and were only distinguished convincingly by comparing their ITS2 rDNA sequences. Both P. adlardi n. sp. and P. wrightae n. sp. have also been found once in V. louti at Lizard Island. This is also the first study to identify life-cycle matches of the Bucephalidae using molecular techniques. I found two perfect life-cycle matches (identical sequences). The bivalve host of Prosorhynchoides lamprelli is a tellinid, Exotica clathrata; Rhipidocotyle sp. from the sphyraenid Sphyraena jello also has E. clathrata as its first intermediate host. Bayesian Inference Analysis shows that all seven species from bivalves that were sequenced belong to the Bucephalinae. Perhaps the most striking finding of the study was that one bivalve species, E. clathrata, was shown to harbour four separate species. Matching of ITS2 rDNA sequences between life-cycle stages is highly effective in circumstances of great richness such as the Great Barrier Reef. Based on my data collected, the total bucephalid species in the system is estimated to be 84.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300508 Parasitology</field><field name="subject">780105 Biological sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158287</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Palynology, sequence stratigraphy, and palaeoenvironments of Middle to Upper Jurassic strata, Bayu-Undan Field, Timor Sea region</field><field name="creator">Mantle, Daniel</field><field name="description">Detailed palynological analysis of 230 core and sidewall core samples from the uppermost Plover, Elang, and lower Frigate formations, Bayu-Undan Field, Timor Sea, reveals the presence of diverse and moderately well preserved palynomorph assemblages (predominantly dinoflagellate cysts, together with acritarchs, spores, and pollen grains) that facilitate biostratigraphic, sequence stratigraphic, and palaeoenvironmental interpretations. The palynomorph assemblages, detailed systematically herein, comprise 96 spore and pollen species, 84 dinoflagellate species, and 15 acritarch species. Of these, the following 14 dinoflagellate cyst species are newly instituted: Ampulladinium aiax, Batiacasphaera macbethiae, Broomea fusticulum, Cauca bayuiana, Egmontodinium elongatum, Ellipsoidictyum fenestellum, Evansia? lacryma, Leberidocysta? strigosus, Leptodinium? ancoralium, Meiourogonyaulax baculata, Nannoceratopsis reticulata, Paragonyaulacysta? feneseptata, P. helbyi, and Yalkalpodinium playfordii. A further five species are not formally named due to a lack of adequately preserved specimens. One genus, Broomea COOKSON&amp;EISENACK, is formally emended. The palynostratigraphic sequence has previously been assessed as latest Bathonian to early Oxfordian in age, based mainly on correlations with European dinoflagellate assemblages dated by ammonite faunas. Ten subzones (TB1-5 and VT1-5) are informally erected, collectively encompassing the Ternia balmei and Voodooia tabulata dinoflagellate cyst Interval Zones. The subzones are defined variously on first and last appearance datums, first and last common occurrences, and species acmes. The acme events are coincident with marine flooding surfaces and enable precise correlation across the Bayu-Undan Field. The Elang Formation &#150; the prime focus of this study &#150; is divided into three third order sequences, each comprising a lowstand, transgressive, and highstand systems tract. These tracts and their delimiting stratal horizons or flooding surfaces possess distinctive palynological or palynodebris assemblages. Qualitative and quantitative variations of these assemblages correlate very closely with gamma-ray log profiles and can be consistently placed within a sequence stratigraphic framework across the Bayu- Undan Field. Palynofacies analyses provide additional means to distinguish among the systems tracts; viz., microphytoplankton diversity increases through transgressive systems tracts to a peak diversity at the maximum flooding surface; atypically brown wood frequencies may also peak at maximum flooding surfaces; and black debris frequencies increase higher in the highstand systems tracts. Palaeoenvironmental interpretations based primarily on palynological assemblages (especially microphytoplankton groupings and palynodebris distribution) provide a means to identify depositional settings in non-cored intervals. For instance, the occurrences of Ternia balmei, the Meiourogonyaulax group, the Ctenidodinium group, and the Rigaudella group represent an approximate gradient from very nearshore to offshore environments or possibly an increase in salinities from euryhaline to stenohaline conditions.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">260113 Palynology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158275</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of affect, fairness, and social identification in vertical and lateral exchange relationships</field><field name="creator">Tse, Ho-Man Herman</field><field name="description">Considerable research attention has been devoted to understanding the implications of leader-member exchange (LMX) theory over the last thirty years (see Graen &amp; Uhl-Bien, 1995, for a review). A review of research has suggested that LMX substantially influences employees' work attitudes and behaviours (e.g., see Gerstner &amp; Day, 1997; Janssen &amp; Van Yperen, 2004). Nonetheless, there is an important omission in LMX research; namely, how does LMX quality influence people outside of the dyadic relationships (Sias &amp; Jablin, 1995)? Sparrowe and Liden (1997), Liden and Sparrowe (in press) and Oh, Chung and Labianca (2004) suggest that interpersonal exchange relationships between leaders, subordinates, and coworkers are interconnected to constitute a larger social system that operates in teams and organisations. Similarly, based on a systems perspective, Graen and Uhl-Bien (1995) call for more research to understand how LMX dyadic relationships influence employees' work attitudes, behaviours and perceptions in larger collectives of workgroups. This is because LMX quality is not only influenced by, but may also influence other exchange relationships within the larger system. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that the characteristics of a dyadic relationship between a leader and a subordinate will also have implications for team member exchange (TMX), defined by Seers (1989) as the relationship quality between an individual and her or his team members (see also Sherony &amp; Green, 2002; Sias, 1996; Sias &amp; Jablin, 1995). In this thesis, therefore, my aim is to advance the research on interpersonal exchange relationships by addressing research questions that explore how vertical exchange relationships between supervisors and subordinates influence lateral exchange relationships among team members in organisations. Specifically, I have integrated social exchange theory (SET), social identity theory (SIT), emotional contagion theory (ECT), and climate research to develop and to test a multilevel model. At the individual level, I theorised that LMX quality influences individual team members' perceptions of TMX quality. I also hypothesised that social identification and affect act as cognitive and affective mechanisms that mediate the relationship between LMX quality and TMX quality. At the group level, I hypothesised that LMX differentiation fairness moderates the relationship between LMX quality and social identification, while affective climate moderates the relationship between individual team members' positive affect and TMX quality. In order to test the validity of my model, I adopted the post-positivist research position resting on a realist ontology (what is the nature of reality), an objective epistemology (the relationship between the knowledge and the inquirer), where both qualitative and quantitative methods were used to investigate the hypothesised relationships in three studies. Study 1 was an exploratory study intended to identify the nature of TMX and the role of emotions within the team member exchange relationships. Personal in-depth interviews and surveys were used to collect qualitative and quantitative data in this study. The sample for this study was 25 employees working in five different teams in a private health service provider and a medium-sized construction material company in Australia. The qualitative results revealed that a variety of exchanges occur within the team member relationships, including relationship-oriented and task-oriented exchanges. Team members also reported that they experienced both positive and negative emotions in response to their TMX relationships. The quantitative results further indicated that positive emotions, rather than negative emotions, were associated with effective TMX relationships. These results support the findings of past research on TMX and emotions in teams, suggesting TMX relationship was an important outcome variable. Based on these results, only positive affect was included in the model to be examined in the remainder of the studies. Study 2 used a quantitative cross-sectional design to examine the relationships between LMX quality, social identification, positive affect, and TMX quality at the individual level of the multilevel model. The sample for this study was 262 employees of an Australian bank and a national restaurant chain. A web-survey was developed and used to collect data from employees and structural equation modelling (SEM) was utilised to analyse the data. Results showed that LMX quality was positively related to social identification and TMX quality. Further, social identification was found to mediate the relationship between LMX quality and TMX quality, while positive affect mediated the relationship between social identification and TMX quality. These results are consistent with SET, SIT and ECT and support the individual-level relationships between the variables in the model. Study 3 was designed to test the group-level moderating effects of LMX differentiation fairness and affective climate on individual-level relationships between the variables. This study built on the results of Study 2 to evaluate the validity of the overall model. Manager-reported and self-reported questionnaires were used to collected data from 2 15 manager-employee matched dyads working in 36 teams for an Australian bank. Managers provided ratings on LMX quality for each of their subordinates within a team, while employees provided ratings on LMX differentiation fairness, affective climate, social identification, positive affect, and TMX quality. Hierarchical liner modelling (HLM) was used to analyse the multilevel data. Results confirmed that the individual-level relationship between individual team members' positive affect and TMX quality was moderated by group-level affective climate. Overall, findings from this research provide mostly supportive evidence for the hypothesised relationships in the model. The major findings demonstrate that employees enjoying high-quality LMX relationships tend to develop high-quality TMX relationships with their team members because they strongly identify with their teams, and that this identification induces positive emotions, which in turn enhances TMX quality. In addition, individual team members experiencing positive affect were found to be more likely to form high-quality TMX relationships with others when the affective climate in their teams is strong. To the best of my knowledge, this research is among the first to explore interpersonal exchange relationships in a larger social system in organisations by developing and testing a multilevel model. I have outlined the theoretical contributions of this research to SET, SIT, ECT, and climate research. In practical terms, this research increases our understanding of how managers use high-quality relationships with subordinates as a means of maximising individual and team effectiveness by demonstrating concern for subordinates' emotional well-being in the workplace.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">L</field><field name="subject">350200 Business and Management</field><field name="subject">720403 Management</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158266</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Implications of Adult Attachment Theory for Chronic Pain</field><field name="creator">Meredith, Pamela Joy</field><field name="description">This thesis presents empirical evidence supporting the relevance of adult attachment theory in understanding the chronic pain experience. The thesis arose from the recognition that, although pain-related psychosocial variables have been used to differentiate subgroups of individuals in chronic pain, little is known about the developmental origins or cognitive, behavioural, or affective correlates of these subgroups. Attachment theory offers a development framework, which is of potential value in guiding early pain intervention and prevention efforts, as well as tailoring interventions to suit specific patient needs. In order to investigate the value of applying adult attachment theory to the chronic pain field, five central research questions were identified: 1) Does insecure attachment contribute to a more negative experience of acute pain for those not diagnosed with a chronic pain condition? That is, does the association between insecure attachment and maladaptive pain-related variables precede the onset of chronic pain)? 2) How do the subgroups of adult attachment, identified in a chronic pain sample, compare to the clusters identified by pain-related psychosocial measures in the same sample? 3) Are the documented associations between attachment and psychosocial variables (i.e., cognitive appraisals, self-efficacy, coping, social support) evident in the context of chronic pain? 4) Do attachment variables moderate the associations between these psychosocial variables and painrelated variables?, and 5) What is the association between adult attachment variables and outcomes from chronic pain rehabilitation programs? To address the first question, an experimental study was designed to explore the perceptions, emotions and coping patterns of 58 pain-free individuals exposed to an acute (coldpressor) pain experience. Findings revealed that higher levels of anxiety over relationships were associated with lower pain thresholds, more stress, depression and anxiety, diminished perceptions of control over pain, and diminished ability to decrease pain. More secure attachment, on the other hand, was associated with greater perceptions of control over pain, and lower levels of depression and catastrophizing. In order to explore research questions 2-5, data from two clinical samples were collected on the first and last days of participation in one of two chronic pain rehabilitation programs (program length varied from two to three weeks). A total of 152 participants completed questionnaires before treatment, with 100 of these participants also completing questionnaires after treatment. Participants were aged between 18 and 82 years (M = 38.8, SD = 12.4), and had been in pain for an average of 3.7 years (SD = 6.9). Approximately 41% of participants were women, and 58% were men (gender for one participant was unknown). In order to address question two regarding the similarity between adult attachment subgroups and pain clusters based on a psychosocial pain measure (Multidimensional Pain Inventory, MPI), pre-treatment data were analyzed. The clustering approach using the MPI, known as Multiaxial Assessment of Pain (MAP), identifies three subgroups of individuals, labeled interpersonally distressed, dysfunctional, and adaptive copers. These clusters were compared with the four subgroups and two dimensions obtained with adult attachment measures. Results revealed that the interpersonally distressed MAP subgroup was associated with fearful attachment, while the dysfunctional MAP subgroup was linked with avoidant (low comfort) attachment. The comfort attachment dimension was associated with more adaptive MPI variables, while the anxious attachment dimension was linked with more maladaptive MPI variables. Consideration of research questions three to five prompted development of an integrative model, the Attachment-Diathesis Model of Chronic Pain (ADMCP), which provided a framework for exploring the psychosocial mechanisms linking attachment security with the outcome variables of perceived pain intensity, disability, and treatment outcomes. Based on predictions emerging from this model, a set of five studies explored pre-treatment associations between adult attachment variables, six psychosocial mechanisms (pain appraisal, depression, pain self-efficacy, anxiety, perceptions of social support, and coping), and outcome variables pre-treatment. One further paper was devoted to implications of adult attachment for treatment outcome. In general, findings from these studies revealed that variables representing attachment insecurity were significantly associated with more maladaptive coping, cognitive, affective and interpersonal characteristics, both before and after treatment, compared to variables reflecting secure attachment. Overall, both securely and insecurely attached individuals made progress in response to pain rehabilitation. Finally, a summary of the evidence of associations between attachment variables, psychosocial mechanisms, and treatment outcomes revealed by this research is presented, permitting discussion regarding the explanatory value of the ADMCP and clinical implications. Limitations to the present research, including family-wise error, the use of self-report measures, and the self-selecting nature of the sample, are discussed, and directions for further research are proposed. The evidence presented in this thesis advances our understanding of the developmental origins of chronic pain conditions, and provides a lens through which to view the heterogeneity of people with chronic pain. Overall, this project highlights the value of applying adult attachment principles to this field. It is anticipated that findings will assist in the development of a more differentiated range of treatment approaches for the individuals who experience chronic pain. In addition, the findings of this project may have important implications for prevention and early intervention of these conditions.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158257</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sensitivity of bovine morulae and blastocysts to heat shock in vitro</field><field name="creator">Naik, Veena</field><field name="description">Bovine pre-implantation embryos are sensitive to high temperatures. The hyperthermia resulting from maternal heat stress leads to an increased loss of early stage embryos. The effects of hyperthermia appear to be more pronounced in the zygote than blastocyst stages. There is also evidence to suggest that B. indicus embryos show better resistance to heat shock as compared to B. taurus embryos. The mechanism of thermotolerance in B. indicus embryos is unknown and it is also unclear if the thermotolerance of these embryos is a result of maternal or paternal contributions. There is also evidence to suggest that male embryos survive heat shock better than female embryos. This research therefore aimed 1. To examine the effect of heat shock on day-7 bovine embryos 2. To study the influence of maternal and paternal genotype on the embryo's ability to survive up to 48 hours post heat shock treatment 3. To study the expression of HSP70 in heat-shocked and non-heat shocked embryos and compare B. indicus and B. taurus embryos. 4. To compare the effects of heat shock on rapidly developing (day-6 morulae) and slowly developing (day-7 morulae) embryos to heat shock treatments 5. To determine the effect of heat shock on the sex ratio of the surviving embryos The work described in this thesis used an in vitro protocol for heat shock studies on embryos, based on observed in vivo rectal temperature fluctuations in heat stressed cows. The first study examined the effects of heat shock on embryos at the morula or blastocyst stage on day 7 of in vitro culture. The embryos were produced in vitro from oocytes collected from ovaries of either pure breed B. indicus or B. taurus and fertilised by frozen semen straws of either B. indicus or B. taurus bulls. Day-7 morulae or blastocysts were used for the study. The embryos were subjected to heat shock (HS) (41.5&amp;degC) or non-heat shock (NHS) (39&amp;degC) temperatures. Embryo survival and development 48 hours (48 h) post treatment were recorded. The data were analysed using binary logistic regression using logit link function to determine the Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence limits for individual factors. The variables used as factors in the analysis were replicate, heat shock, maternal genotype (B. indicus vs B. taurus), paternal genotype (B. indicus vs B. taurus) and stage at which heat shock was applied (morula or blastocyst). The outcome variables used for analysis were the number of viable embryos from the total treated and the proportion reaching expanded or hatched blastocyst stage, and the proportion of male embryos. Heat shock significantly reduced the probability of embryo survival by more than half (OR = 0.47; P &#8804; 0.001) and reduced the probability of the embryo's progression to the expanded or hatched blastocyst stage by almost half (OR = 0.58; P = 0.005) as compared to NHS embryos. The probability of survival of embryos with B. indicus paternal genotype (confounded by the use of a single sire) was double (OR = 2.00; P = 0.002) that of embryos with B. taurus paternal genotype. The heat shock x paternal B. indicus genotype interaction was found to be non-significant. Maternal B. indicus genotype showed no influence on thermotolerance. Nevertheless, the probability of progression to expanded blastocysts for embryos with maternal B. indicus genotypes was double (OR = 2.05; P = 0.030) that of embryos with maternal B. taurus genotype. Comparison of day-7 morulae with day-7 blastocysts showed that the probability of day-7 blastocysts surviving until 48 h after treatment was almost two and half times greater (OR = 2.39; P &#8804; 0.001). The probability of survival of a blastocyst with paternal B. indicus genotype was almost twice (OR = 1.95; P = 0.041) when compared to a blastocyst with B. taurus paternal genotype. The interaction term of heat shock &#215; blastocyst stage was found to be significant (OR = 2.70; P = 0.038) indicating that blastocyst stage embryos were resistant to heat shock. The study showed a trend towards survival of more male embryos (61% males vs 39% females) under heat shock conditions (OR = 1.64; P = 0.070) indicating that male embryos may be resistant to heat shock. The second study was designed to detect the induced form of HSP70 in heat shocked and non-heat shocked day-7 bovine embryos and to compare the patterns between B. indicus embryos and B. taurus embryos. Comparison of confocal images showed that staining for HSP70 was present in most embryos whether heat shocked or not and found to be concentrated in the nuclei and cytoplasm. Heat shock appears to have increased HSP70 staining intensity in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, suggesting increased expression of HSP70 after heat shock. The same general staining patterns were seen in heat shocked and non-heat shocked embryos of B. indicus and B. taurus embryos. In the third experiment, embryos were examined for the effects of heat shock on day-7 or on day-6 of their in vitro culture. The data were analysed to study the effects of heat shock, stage at heat shock (day-7 blastocysts vs day-7 morulae) and day of heat shock (day-7 vs day-6) on embryo survival and progression to expanded or hatched blastocysts 48 h post treatment. We found that heat shock reduced the probability of survival by more than half (OR = 0.40; P = 0.004). Probability of survival of day-7 embryos (confounded by rapidly developing blastocysts and slow developing morulae) was less than half (OR = 0.36; P = 0.008), that of day-6 embryos. The data were then analysed to study the effects of heat shock on day-7 blastocysts and day-7 morulae for embryo survival post treatment. Heat shock negatively affected embryo survival (OR = 0.35; P = 0.007). The probability of day-7 blastocysts surviving HS and NHS was more than two and a half times greater (OR = 2.71; P = 0.008) than that of day-7 morulae. No interaction of heat shock and blastocyst stage was noticed. Subsequently the effects of heat shock and the effects of the day of heat shock on morula stage embryos were examined. Overall, heat shock reduced the probability of survival (OR = 0.35; P = 0.009) and the probability of embryo development to the expanded or hatched blastocysts (OR = 0.35; P &#8804; 0.001), 48 h post treatment. The probability of day-6 morulae surviving HS and NHS was almost three times higher (OR = 2.81; P = 0.007) than that of day-7 morulae. The interaction of stage of development with heat shock was not significant. We concluded that an embryo that was capable of developing to the blastocyst stage by day-7 or morula stage by day-6 had better survival and higher probability of progressing to expanded or hatched stage when compared to an embryo that had slow development (day-7 morulae). The study showed a significantly different effect of heat shock on the survival of male and female embryos (63% males vs 36% females, OR = 1.79; P = 0.014). In our final study, embryos were produced from three different bulls each of B. indicus or B. taurus genotype. Heat shock effects consistently and negatively affected survival of embryos (OR = 0.29; P &#8804; 0.001) and their ability to progress to the expanded or hatched blastocysts (OR = 0.42; P &#8804; 0.001). Embryos with paternal B. indicus genotype showed no advantage of survival over embryos with paternal B. taurus genotype embryos. When the day-7 blastocysts were compared with the day-7 morulae, the probability of day-7 blastocysts surviving HS or NHS was more than double (OR = 2.23; P = 0.009) that of day-7 morulae. In this study the effect of survival of the interaction term of heat shock treatment with the blastocyst stage was significant and negative (OR = 0.49; P = 0.040). However the interaction term of blastocyst stage x HS for an embryo&#146;s ability to progress to expanded or hatched blastocyst stage was positive (OR = 2.00; P = 0.052), indicating that the embryos that did survive heat shock were capable of continuing their developmental progress. Although more male embryos (55% male vs 45% female) survived heat shock, the effect for this study was non-significant. In summary, the studies described in this thesis successfully tested a new in vitro heat shock protocol based on in vivo temperature changes experienced by heat stressed cows. Heat shock was consistent in negatively affecting embryo survival. Heat shock also negatively affected the embryo's progression to the expanded or hatched blastocyst stage by 48 h post treatment. We observed variable cytoplasmic and nuclear staining for HSP70 in day-7 blastocysts of both B. indicus and B. taurus. This distribution did not change dramatically after heat shock, but staining appeared to be more intense in heat shocked embryos, suggesting that there was increased expression of HSP70 after heat shock. No difference in this pattern was observed between B. indicus and B. taurus embryos. The speed of development of an embryo until being subjected to either heat shock or non heat shock temperatures affected the probability of survival and further development. However, the interaction term of day-7 blastocyst stage and heat shock was inconsistent, meaning that the rate of development appeared to specifically protect against heat shock in some studies while in the other studies, the apparent protective effect extended to control as well as heat shocked embryos. Our study found no significant influence of B. indicus paternal genotype on embryo survival. Our study showed evidence of B. indicus maternal genotype influence on the embryo's ability to progress to expanded blastocysts but not on embryo survival. The study found a clear trend towards an increased proportion of male embryos surviving heat shock conditions. In some studies this was significant, and in others it was not, but the trend was always in the same direction. This suggests that male embryos are more resistant to the effects of heat shock in vitro.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300402 Animal Reproduction</field><field name="subject">630103 Beef cattle</field><field name="subject">Sensitivity</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158248</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of bovine colostrum supplementation on immune variables and exercise performance in trained cyclists</field><field name="creator">Shing, Cecilia Mary</field><field name="description">Bovine colostrum is homologous in composition to human colostrum but contains greater concentrations of key bioactive components that contribute directly to growth and immunity.

This is despite limited data in support of its value to athletes and the relative absence of strong data that identify mechanisms that could improve exercise performance and immune function. The aim of the three studies that comprise this thesis was therefore to investigate the influence of a bovine colostrum protein concentrate (CPC) on immune variables, hormone concentrations, autonomic activity and exercise performance in highly-trained endurance cyclists. Study one involved monitoring exercise performance and immune variables during an eight week bovine CPC supplementation period, which included five consecutive days of high-intensity training (HIT). Twenty-nine highly-trained male road cyclists completed an initial 40-km time trial (TT40) and were then randomly assigned to either a supplement (n=14, 10 g bovine CPC per day) or placebo group (n=15, 10 g whey protein concentrate per day). Following five weeks of supplementation, the cyclists completed a second TT40 before undertaking five consecutive days of high-intensity training (HIT) that included another TT40. A final TT40 was completed one week following the HIT. Venous blood and saliva samples were collected immediately before and after each TT40, and upper respiratory illness symptoms were recorded over the experimental period.

When compared to the placebo group, bovine CPC supplementation significantly increased pre-exercise serum soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor 1 during the HIT period (p&lt;0.039).

When compared to the placebo group, bovine CPC supplementation significantly increased pre-exercise serum soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor 1 during the HIT period (p&lt;0.039). Supplementation also suppressed the post-exercise decrease in cytotoxic/suppressor T cells during the HIT period (bovine CPC=- 1.0&#177;2.7%, placebo=-9.2&#177;2.8%; mean&#177;SE, p=0.017) and during the following week (bovine CPC=1.4&#177;2.9%, placebo=-8.2&#177;2.8%, p=0.004). In addition, bovine CPC supplementation prevented a post-exercise decrease in serum IgG2 concentration at the end of the HIT period (bovine CPC=4.8&#177;6.8%, p=0.88; placebo=-9.7&#177;6.9%, p=0.013) and there was a trend towards reduced incidence of upper respiratory illness symptoms in the bovine CPC group (p=0.055). Study one demonstrated that low dose bovine CPC supplementation elicited improvements in TT40 performance during a HIT period and maintained ventilatory threshold following five consecutive days of HIT. Supplementation was also found to modulate immune variables during normal training and following an acute period of intense exercise, which may have contributed to the trend toward reduced upper respiratory illness in the bovine CPC group. The maintenance of performance, prevention of post-exercise suppression of IgG2 and cytotoxic/suppressor T cells and increase in anti-inflammatory serum soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor 1 suggest that bovine CPC supplementation is beneficial to cyclists during a period of high-intensity training. The aim of Study two was to investigate the hormonal, immune and autonomic responses of competitive cyclists over a five-day stage race following eight weeks of bovine CPC supplementation. Ten highly-trained male road cyclists were randomly assigned to a placebo (n=6, 10 g whey protein concentrate/day) or bovine CPC group (n=4, 10 g bovine CPC/day). Cyclists provided a baseline saliva sample before commencing supplementation that culminated in a five day competitive cycle race. The cyclists provided daily saliva samples and heart rate variability (HRV) was measured on each day of the race. A Profile of Mood States questionnaire was completed on days one, three and five of the race and cyclists recorded upper respiratory illness symptoms throughout the experimental period. While there was no influence of bovine CPC on salivary IgA, supplementation maintained testosterone concentrations over the competition period (p&lt;0.05) and prevented a decrease in parasympathetic activity (p&lt;0.05). There was also a trend towards improved mood state (p=0.06) in the bovine CPC group. These data indicate that bovine CPC supplementation may prevent disturbances in autonomic function and the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis associated with consecutive days of cycle racing The aim of study three was to assess whether bovine CPC would directly stimulate cytokine production of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), with and without lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and phytohemagglutinin (PHA) stimulation. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was added to cell cultures as a potent enhancer of monocyte and macrophage cytokine release and a model of exercise stress. Phytohemagglutinin was added to PBMC to stimulate T cell proliferation. Blood was sampled from four healthy, male endurance cyclists who had abstained from exercise for 48 hours. PBMC were separated and cultured with bovine CPC concentrations of 0 (control), 1.25, 2.5 and 5% with and without LPS (3&#181;g&#183;mL-1) and PHA (2.5&#181;g&#183;mL-1). Cell supernatants were collected at 6 and 24 hours of culture for the determination of tumour necrosis factor (TNF), interferon (IFN)-y, interleukin (IL)-10, IL-6, IL-4 and IL-2 concentrations. Following six hours of PBMC incubation at 37&#176;C with 5% CO2, IFN-y, IL-10 and IL-2 secretion were increased with increasing concentrations of bovine CPC (p&lt;0.05). In a dose dependent manner, IFN-y and IL-2 remained elevated following 24 hours of incubation (p&lt;0.05). Data from this final study showed that bovine CPC modulates in vitro cytokine production of human PBMC. In conclusion, the present data suggest that bovine CPC supplementation is beneficial to highlytrained cyclists during periods of high-intensity training and competition. Bovine CPC promotes the release of cell mediated cytokines from PBMC and has the potential therefore to influence a number of physiological systems. Supplementation was associated with enhanced recovery over consecutive days of high-intensity training and competition, as evidenced by maintained exercise performance, ventilatory threshold and testosterone concentrations. Bovine CPC modulated immune function, particularly at the end of a HIT period, and there was a trend for reduced incidence of upper respiratory symptoms following bovine CPC supplementation in Study one. The data collectively suggest that bovine CPC supplementation may influence a combination of physiological pathways including the autonomic nervous system and the hypothalamic-pituitary axis.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321401 Exercise Physiology</field><field name="subject">750203 Organised sports</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158236</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards the development of a talent identification and development program for coaches</field><field name="creator">O'Keeffe, Erin Elizabeth</field><field name="description">Coach retention is a significant problem for sport at all levels. Coach turnover, especially of talented and experienced coaches, creates a multitude of operational complexities for many sport organisations. The importance of having quality coaches available to assist the development of high performing athletes has been identified by both sports administrators and elite athletes. However, the data indicate that in Australia, coach accreditation rates are decreasing by more than 9% each year (ASC, 2004). Although programs focusing on coach education and pathways have been developed, minimal research has addressed the elements involved in identifying and retaining talented coaches. The first step in developing a coach talent identification and development program is the formulation of a definition of coaching talent. Although definitions of 'talent' exist in the business and sport performance arenas, these are not directly applicable to the sport coaching context. This study used a multi-method approach through the combination of interviews and questionnaires to develop a comprehensive definition of a talented coach. Two research questions were addressed: What are the attributes of a talented coach (and do perceptions of these differ between different stakeholders)? What are the factors that identify a talented coach (and do perceptions of these differ between different stakeholders)? Information gathered from interviews with experienced personnel in sport (seven coaches and administrators and two senior athletes) was transcribed and coded using open, axial and reflective coding. Themes identified in the analysis were incorporated with the literature to inform construction of the Talent in Coaching Questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of 100 items investigating three separate but related areas: Demographic Intbrmation (10 items); Attributes of a Talented Coach (77 items); and Identification of a Talented Coach (13 items). Within the Attributes of a Talented Coach section, items were allocated six different categories: Background (10 items); Knowledge (1 3 items); Athlete-Coach Interaction (1 1 items); Operational Practices (12 items); Motivation (7 items); and Attributes (24 items). TWO areas were addressed in the Talent Identification section: the populations in which a talented coach could be found (6 items) and the best possible selection methods to identify a talented coach (7 items). Items were answered using a 5-point Likert scale where 1 = strongly disagree and 5 = strongly agree. The Talent in Coaching Questionnaire was piloted with nine experienced sport personnel and 21 high performing athletics coaches to obtain feedback on face validity, ease of understanding and readability prior to delivery to 300 coaches and administrators across Queensland. The sample incorporated beginner, experienced, retired and lapsed coaches fiom individual and team sports at club, state and national levels. Administrators were defined as involved in the coordination of coaching and support services at club, state or national level. Subjects were sourced fiom 38 different sports through their respective State Sporting Organisations. Within the time fiame allowed, 162 questionnaires were received (54% response rate), which included responses fiom 32 different sports. The sample comprised 27.7% female and 72.3% male subjects, 66.7% of whom were over the age of 40. Using SPSS, the data were analyzed through descriptive statistics, reliability and factor analysis, ANOVA, and Chi square. Items and categories were ranked according to the mean score fiom all participants. The top five attributes of a talented coach were considered to be an individual who; is aware of the individual differences among athletes (mean = 4.74), has an enjoyment of coaching (mean = 4.71), is always looking for improvement in his / her coaching (mean = 4-70), is willing to learn (mean = 4-69), and has knowledge of the fundamental skills required for the sport (mean = 4.65). Attributes considered less important in a talented coach were; one who is motivated by money (mean = 1-70), introverted (mean = 2.38), makes the athlete the first priority in life (mean = 2.42), has received awards for coaching (mean = 2.92) and coached as a head coach (mean = 2.40), State coach (mean = 2.96), or National coach (mean = 2.83). Results suggest that a talented coach may be found among those individuals already coaching or retiring athletes and may be effectively identified through observation at training and competition, possibly through the use of a talent scout. Significant differences were found when item scores were compared by age, gender, experience, and qualifications (National Coaching Accreditation Scheme). Female coaches considered nurturing and teaching attributes more important than did males, additionally career stage may affect consideration of the most important attributes. Practical implications and directions for future research are also discussed.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321401 Exercise Physiology</field><field name="subject">750203 Organised sports</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158233</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Outside Orders : Religious Faith and Practice of the Laity in Twelfth and Thirteenth-Century France Based on Chansons de Geste of the Charlemagne Cycle</field><field name="creator">Smith, Kay Lynette</field><field name="description">The centuries under discussion in this thesis, the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, were a time of great change in practice of the rituals of the Christian church in Europe as well as in the development of their underlying theology. And the society that this thesis will investigate, the French speaking people of north western Europe, was the theatre in which much of that debate and change took place. The opinions and arguments of the erudite from that time and place are well known. Studies of their interactions illustrate the existence of many schools and individuals whose deliberations were written down, and which supply ample material to modern scholars who research the theological development of the time. However, what is not so abundantly documented is the impact that religion had on the lay and sometimes illiterate Christians of the day. If, in fact, they did debate their religious beliefs and practices, their debates were not written down for posterity to read. Their opinions can only be accessed obliquely. This thesis takes the form of small social history, history from the lower echelons of society rather than the higher, that plumbs the experiences of ordinary people whose opinions were not important enough to occupy the scholars and administrators of the day. In this case a branch of their literature in the vernacular will be used as source material. I propose drawing out a picture of what the people of the time believed, and how they expressed that belief in action, through a close reading of the popular medieval genre of the chanson de geste. The subject has been broached before, by Carl Josef Merk in 1914, Adolphe Jacques Dickman in 1926, Marianna Gildea in 1943 and J-L. Roland B&#233;langer in 1975. This study will differ from previous studies in its concentration on only one cycle of poems and the depth of examination of those poems. Where Merk, Gildea and Dickman used many poems, almost the entire available corpus, and B&#233;langer used a mixture of the poems of the Loherain Cycle and other earlier chansons, this study will be confined to the poems of the Charlemagne Cycle. The poems of one cycle grew out of a common store of subject matter, in this case stories surrounding the great eighth and ninth century king, Charlemagne. By the time of the production and recording of chansons, Charlemagne had acquired legendary status and been credited with conquests and journeys that he never made in his lifetime. He represented an ideal of kingship and his actions were the actions of the ideal Christian conqueror, a monarch who, with his people, was loved by God and guided and assisted by God in all he undertook. For the most part the stories about him involved the conquest and conversion of non-Christian people. Consequently, although the poems are not overtly concerned with religious teaching or religious practice, their subject matter is imbued with religious language and significance. It is the religious significance of the language and subject matter of these poems and the similarity of the hierarchical structure of the society described to the conjectured celestial structure that makes these poems suitable as subject matter for this study. Eleven poems have been chosen for study, nine concerned with conquest of non- Christian people and two with the existence of traitors among the followers of the king. These two poems add the dimension of loyalty to one&#146;s monarch and preservation of the status quo to that of warfare against non-Christians. The findings are set out in two sections, one concerned with rituals that mark the milestones in the protagonists&#146; lives and the other with more spontaneous expressions of faith. Conclusions are drawn from each section and then melded to give an overall picture of the faith of the laity of the time. Where parallels or contrasts with the practice accepted and prescribed by the ecclesiastical establishment are detected, these are examined in the relevant chapters.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">780199 Other</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158226</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sensory processing and classroom emotional, behavioural and educational outcomes in children with autism spectrum disorder</field><field name="creator">Ashburner, Jill</field><field name="description">Many occupational therapists recommend adaptations to school tasks and classroom environments to accommodate the atypical sensory processing of students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), on the assumption that sensory processing impacts on classroom emotional, behavioural and educational outcomes. The purpose of this study was to explore the rationale underpinning this practice. Specifically, the first aim was to determine whether or not children with ASD differ significantly from typically developing children with regard to sensory processing. The second aim was to provide descriptive information about the nature and prevalence of atypical sensory processing in children with ASD. The third aim was to explore associations between the sensory processing patterns and classroom emotional, behavioural and educational outcomes in children with ASD and typically developing children. This study employed a matched case-control design. To control for differences in teaching styles, classroom environments and educational programs, two typically developing children were selected as controls from each of the classes of thirty students with ASD aged between 6 and 10 years. Twenty-eight children with ASD and fifty-one age- and gender-matched typically developing children were included in the final analysis. The children were all included in mainstream classrooms and were screened using the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test to ensure that their estimated IQ was within the average range. Sensory processing was measured using the Short Sensory Profile. Other independent variables that may have impacted on classroom emotional, behavioural and educational outcomes included symptoms of ASD, IQ and classroom environmental factors. Symptoms of ASD were measured using the Gilliam Asperger Disorder Scale and Gilliam Autism Rating Scale. The Kaufmann Brief Intelligence Test was used as an estimate of IQ, as well as for screening purposes. The investigator recorded observations of the sensory aspects of each classroom environment, including estimates of visual clutter, crowding and background noise. The dependent variables, which included classroom emotional regulation, behaviour regulation (e.g., compliance, attention and social behaviours) and educational outcomes, were measured using two teacher questionnaires: the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment Teacher Report Form and the Conners&#146; Teacher Report Form Revised &#150; Long Form. No significant differences were found between the two groups with respect to IQ or age in months, suggesting that the two groups were well matched. Observations of the classroom environments revealed high levels of background noise, visual clutter and unpredictable tactile input. The majority of the typically developing children achieved scores at or near ceiling level on both the measures of classroom emotional and behavioural outcomes and sensory processing. This suggested that most of these children processed sensory input in a typical way and were coping well with the emotional, behavioural and academic demands of school. No significant relationships were found between the measures of sensory processing and classroom emotional, behavioural and educational outcomes in the typically developing children. The teachers rated the children with ASD as demonstrating significantly more difficulties with attention, emotional and behaviour regulation and social skills and significantly poorer academic performance than the controls. The Short Sensory Profile scores suggested a high prevalence of atypical sensory processing in the children with ASD. There were highly significant group differences on all of the Short Sensory Profile scores (p &gt; .001), with the exception of the Short Sensory Profile score: Movement Sensitivity (p = .016). Multiple regression analysis suggested that the Short Sensory Profile scores: Under-responsive/Seeks Sensation and Auditory Filtering accounted for 47% of the variance in academic performance as measured by the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment Teacher Report Form. As estimated intelligence and autistic symptoms were not predictors in this multiple regression model, these specific sensory processing difficulties appeared to contribute significantly to academic underachievement. The Short Sensory Profile Score: Auditory Filtering was also associated with inattention as measured by the Conners&#146; Teacher Report Form. An association between Short Sensory Profile Score: Auditory Filtering and social problems as measured by the Conners&#146; Teacher Report Form approached significance (p = .019). Auditory filtering difficulties therefore appeared to be highly problematic for the children with ASD and likely to be exacerbated by high levels of background noise in classrooms. Multiple regression analysis suggested that the Short Sensory Profile scores for Tactile Sensitivity and Auditory Filtering accounted for 36% of the variance in the score for Conners&#146; Teacher Report Form score for inattention. The Short Sensory Profile score for Tactile Sensitivity accounted for 22% of the variance in a Conners&#146; Teacher Report Form measure of the combined symptoms of ADHD (including inattention and hyperactivity). The Short Sensory Profile score: Movement Sensitivity accounted for 22% in the Conners&#146; Teacher Report Form score for oppositional behaviours. An association between Short Sensory Profile Score: Tactile Sensitivity and oppositional behaviours as measured by the Conners&#146; Teacher Report Form approached significance (p = .015). As atypical sensory processing was found to be associated with difficulties in learning, attention and behaviour regulation at school, sensory processing may need to be considered in the planning of educational programs for students with ASD. The development of effective strategies to accommodate the atypical sensory processing of these students is a priority.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158222</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On the Edge of Their Seats: The Novel Manuscript 'Frantic', and the critical essay 'Suspense in Fiction: Its Operation and Techniques'</field><field name="creator">Howell, Katherine Leslie</field><field name="description">The thesis consists of the critical essay and the creative project. The critical essay is an investigation into the nature of narrative suspense, its operation, and the techniques by which an author can develop it. Narrative suspense requires that readers care for characters and feel uncertain about events. An author can use a number of story-telling techniques to make the most of this emotion and uncertainty. Readers may embark on a variety of activities including imagining outcomes and piecing together clues, and these too can be utilised by the author to build suspense. Following the examination of the subject, I explore the development of the drafts of Frantic with particular emphasis on how my research into suspense changed my approach to characterisation, structure, and the process of writing. The creative project is the manuscript Frantic, a crime thriller set in present-day Sydney. When Paramedic Sophie Phillips&#146; husband Chris is shot and their baby kidnapped, Detective Ella Marconi struggles to solve the case. Evidence suggests the act may be revenge by a bereaved father for Sophie&#146;s failure to save a mother and her newborn, and equally that senior constable Chris may have been involved in the police corruption that increasingly appears rife. Distraught Sophie knows what she believes, and when the police fail to find her son she takes matters into her own hands.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">400103 Professional Creative Writing</field><field name="subject">751001 Languages and literature</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158213</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sedimentology of the South East Bowen Basin, South East Queensland, Australia, Implications for groundwater resources in the Kalahari basin of Botswana</field><field name="creator">Lasarwe, Reneilwe</field><field name="description">Sedimentary deposits are important aquifers in many parts of the world and in order to explore, develop and manage these aquifers, it is necessary to determine the relationship between the hydrogeologic properties and sedimentary facies (aquifer characterization). Within a sedimentary hydrogeologic system, the environment of deposition and the resulting distribution of grain sizes, texture, and facies associations within different individual aquifer bodies influence variations in hydraulic properties. Successful prediction of the quality of the aquifer is dependent on the accurate mapping of both lithologic units and hydrogeologic parameters. In this project, the influence of petrophysical characteristics of the sedimentary rocks to the quality of the aquifer is investigated with a view to finding a correlation between these characteristics, the type and nature of sedimentary rocks present and their hydrogeologic properties. Investigation methods involved the use of geophysical wireline log data, lithological core logging, thin section microscopy and X-Ray Diffraction analysis. All this was done to characterize the sedimentary rocks in terms of composition, grain size and diagenesis. Porosity tests were also performed on the samples collected while permeability data was collected from the Department of Natural Resources and Mines (DNR &amp; M), Australia. The basins of interest for this project are the Bowen Basin in Australia and the Kalahari Basin in Botswana. The two basins are similar, though structurally different. The basins are similar in the sense that they have got similarity in their rock sequence. All the work done on the Bowen Basin and the results obtained are extrapolated to the similar Kalahari Basin. The units of the Bowen Basin are underlain by the Late Carboniferous to Early Permian Camboon Volcanics. The Permian units include the Buffel, Barfield, Flat Top, and Gyranda Formations and the Baralaba Coal Measures. The Triassic units are the Rewan Group, Clematis Sandstone and Moolayember Formation. Within the Bowen Basin the Permian units are generally argillaceous and therefore have generally low porosities and permeabilities and also give low resistivity (RES) base lines and high gamma ray (GR) baselines. However where fractured, the units yield some water from the shale. Boreholes drawing water from the Barfield, Flat Top and Gyranda Formations tap the fractured shales. The Triassic aquifers present a different picture. The best aquifers with high porosities and permeabilities are of the Triassic age and their distribution is influenced by their proximity to the source area. Sedimentary rocks of the Triassic age in the Bowen Basin become more argillaceous at more distal positions from the source area. The Rewan Group in particular shows this trend and hence better aquifers within the Rewan are those close to the source area. The Kalahari Basin Karoo stratigraphy commences with the Late Carboniferous to Early Permian glaciogenic sedimentary rocks of the Dwyka Group. The Dwyka Group is overlain by the argillaceous Permian to Early Triassic sedimentary rocks of The Ecca Group and the Beaufort Group. Overlying the Beaufort Group is the Lebung Group (lower Mosolotsane Formation-dominantly mudstone and siltstone sequence and upper Ntane Sandstone Formation- aeolian sandstone). Basaltic lavas of the stormberg Lava Group cap the Karoo stratigraphy. Few groundwater studies in the Karoo of the Kalahari Basin have shown that the Ecca Group does not posses good aquifer characteristics because of its argillaceous nature. However, thin arenaceous interbeds within the Ecca Group have yielded some groundwater. Non-measurable quantities of groundwater have been recorded from boreholes sunk in the Beaufort Group. Few boreholes penetrating the Mosolotsane Formation yielded very little groundwater whereas Ntane Sandstone have yielded a fair amount of groundwater. Groundwater yield from the Stormberg Lava Group is related to the presence of fractures.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">260501 Groundwater Hydrology</field><field name="subject">780104 Earth sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158198</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Post-transcriptional regulation of BRCA1: Investigation of the roles of RNA-binding proteins and cis-acting elements in the 3&#146;untranslated region</field><field name="creator">Saunus, Jodi Marie</field><field name="description">BRCA1 is a breast cancer susceptibility gene that is down-regulated in the majority of cases of sporadic breast cancer. Accordingly, there is considerable interest in the mechanisms that regulate normal expression of BRCA1, with a view to elucidating how this could be disrupted in breast cancer. In tumours with reduced BRCA1 protein expression, there can be a concomitant reduction in mRNA level to variable degrees, or no change in mRNA level, suggesting that disruption of multiple different regulatory processes may contribute to BRCA1 down-regulation. Despite this, efforts to date have chiefly focussed on transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of the gene, whilst post-transcriptional processes that regulate the dynamics of the BRCA1 transcript, such as decay, localisation and translation efficiency, are poorly understood. Post-transcriptional regulatory pathways are critical for sustaining normal cellular physiology, as evidenced by many examples where disruption of these processes results in disease, including cancer. Regulation of gene expression at this level is often mediated by RNA-binding proteins that recognise specific cis-acting sequence motifs in the untranslated regions (UTRs) of certain messenger RNAs, and recruit, or shield them from macromolecular complexes involved in RNA metabolism, such as the translation apparatus, exosome, and subcellular transport particles. This thesis is centred on investigating post-transcriptional regulation of BRCA1. Others have shown that expression of the transcript and protein is regulated throughout the mammalian cell division cycle. Results presented in this thesis suggest that changes in mRNA stability may contribute to cell cycle-dependent expression of BRCA1, and therefore that post-transcriptional regulation of BRCA1 is a biologically-relevant phenomenon. To begin to address the molecular mechanisms involved in regulation of BRCA1 mRNA decay, and possibly other post-transcriptional regulatory processes, the 3&#146;UTR of BRCA1, which had not been previously characterised, was analysed for functional regulatory motifs using a combination of bioinformatics, reporter assays and RNA-proteinbinding analysis. An evolutionarily-conserved 3&#146;UTR subsequence was identified which contains sequence elements capable of regulating reporter activity, and forming complexes with multiple proteins from human epithelial cell lines. Some of these elements have been previously characterised in the context of other genes, including a Hu-antigen R (HuR)-binding motif, adenosine-uridine (AU)- rich sequences and a differentiation control element (DICE). Experiments were also conducted to determine the identities of the RNA-binding proteins detected using an RNA probe containing the 3&#146;UTR elements. A preliminary screen of a small group of RNA-binding proteins with previously-characterised roles in 3&#146;UTR-mediated post-transcriptional gene regulation identified HuR as a negative regulator of BRCA1 protein expression. Interestingly, HuR is over-expressed in breast cancer. Evidence presented in this thesis suggests that the mechanism of HuR-mediated down-regulation of BRCA1 involves direct binding of HuR to the BRCA1 3&#146;UTR, and no changes to mRNA stability or abundance. Finally, proteomics-based analysis of protein extracts enriched with BRCA1 3&#146;UTR RNA-binding proteins yielded several interesting candidates with previously-reported RNA-binding and/or post-transcriptional regulatory activities, including Far upstream element-binding protein 1 (FBP1), Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPD) and Heat-shock protein 27 (HSP27). This thesis addresses a clear deficiency in the literature concerning regulation of BRCA1, and contributes to our general understanding of the molecular mechanisms controlling gene expression in mammalian cells. Additionally, the finding that RNA-binding proteins that are over-expressed in breast cancer can negatively regulate BRCA1 expression constitutes important groundwork for identifying potential novel breast cancer therapeutics in the future.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270299 Genetics not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158183</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Not blind enough: Living in the borderland called legal blindness</field><field name="creator">Omansky, Beth Fay</field><field name="description">This qualitative study explored the experiences of people categorised as legally blind. Adopting a phenomenological approach, the study gathered four life stories of three recruited participants and my own story as a legally blind person. These case studies revealed that people who are legally blind traverse a borderland between sighted and blind worlds, a position which carries with it experiences that are vastly different than both totally blind and sighted people. Located in disability studies, the thesis examined the experience of legal blindness in a unique way, cross-fertilising the best elements of an American cultural studies approach with a British social model of disability. The British social model, rooted in sociological materialist analysis, is often positioned by its proponents as at odds with the United States humanities-based cultural or minority model of disability. This thesis sought to discover if a bridge could be built between the two models to allow for several theoretical analyses with the higher goal of understanding both phenomenological and social aspects of borderland blindness. Another original aspect of this study is the use of the postmodern metaphor &#147;borderland&#148; to carve out a geographical space unique to legal blindness -- a territory between sightedness and blindness where residents are pressed to migrate back and forth across its borders from situation to situation. The research developed a combination of social constructionism, materialism, postmodernism, and existential phenomenology, while aiming to meet the goals of emancipatory disability research. Participants told their stories in their own words, they chose what was important for us to know about them, and they maintained control over their stories throughout the research and write-up processes. The study was interested in how society treats blind people, and was also keen to know what meaning blind people made of such treatment. Its design strayed from orthodox disability studies research in that it wanted to learn and record the embodied experience of legal blindness as well as blindness identity formation. However, to examine physical aspects of blindness did not imply approval of ocularcentric medical model practices; both the American and British social models have at their foundations critical analyses of medicine&#146;s control over the lives of disabled people. While this study utilised social constructionism as a primary method of analysis, it simultaneously challenged the binary of essentialism/social constructionism because impairment, disablement, and disability are complex and do not all fit into either stance. The experience of impairment is integral to understanding the lived experience of blindness. Further, the study rejected the blindness/sightedness binary which positions blindness as &#145;lack&#146; (Michalko, 1999), and instead, examined borderland blindness as a medically and legally constructed social category that is neither better nor worse than &#145;normal&#146; sight and vision, but is merely neutral difference. The research was conducted from an &#145;insider&#146; position because I wanted to learn how other legally blind people experience life in the borderland; and, in the tradition of disability studies and disability activism, I consider this work a political act -- &#147;a commitment to openly partisan inquiry&#148; (Barnes and Mercer, 2004). I was curious to explore the strengths, weaknesses, and complexities of conducting research as an &#147;insider&#148; &#150; as a member of the population of research interest. Another feature of this study was the application of Rogerian techniques of establishing an environment in which genuineness, trust, and unconditional positive regard would flourish; this model provided a natural marriage to emancipatory life story and insider research. The research findings conclude that there is no conflict between British and American social models of disability; and further argue that the two models enhance each other in that together they provide a more holistic examination of the everyday lived experience of disabled people. Use of both models strengthened inherent weaknesses that arise when each model stands alone. Furthermore, the findings suggest that more studies about blindness concentrate on &#147;legal&#148; or borderland blindness because this population has experiences that are vastly different from both totally blind and sighted people. These differences have significant ramifications for education, rehabilitation and other human service policy and provision.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">750305 Ability and disability</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158179</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modeling unplanned landscape change: A Colombian case study</field><field name="creator">Etter, Andres</field><field name="description">The broad aim of this study is, to contribute to a broader and more comprehensive understanding of the patterns, processes and drivers of unplanned land cover change in the tropics, using Colombia as a study case. Land cover change is an important global issue because of the expanding ecological footprint of a rapidly increasing human population and per capita level of resource consumption. This has a major impact on natural ecosystems and their function at the local (hundreds of square kilometers) and global scales. The understanding of extent and rate of land cover change is an important issue confronting biodiversity conservation, land use planning, protected area management, and global climate change analysis. Tropical deforestation is the major source of global land cover change, with the highest absolute rates occurring in South America, especially in the Brazilian Amazon, where government planning is an important driver of deforestation. However, unplanned deforestation for cropping and ranching is also occurring in Colombia. This is of international concern because Colombia&#146;s diverse ecosystems support high levels of species richness and endemism. Improving the understanding of the spatial and temporal patterns and drivers ofland cover change (both deforestation and regeneration) is an important step in developing planning and conservation strategies to address this problem. I applied a spatial and temporal statistical modelling approach to predict changes in land cover in Colombia at the local (100 km2), regional (104 km2) and national (106 km2) levels, with a timeframe spanning from decades to centuries. As dependant variable data, binary forest/non-forest data are used. Explanatory variables comprise biophysical and socioeconomic data sourced from a broad range of information sources, including remotely sensed data from aerial photographs and satellite images, secondary sources of biophysical and socioeconomic data, and historical data. At the local-level, I addressed the deforestation process over the last 60 years using six case studies of 100 km2 of humid lowland forests, by applying logistic regression and spatial analysis. At the regional-level, I studied the deforestation in the Caquet&#225; colonization front of the Colombian Amazon region from 1988-2004 by applying a forest-cover zoning method and logistic regression models to predict deforestation and forest regeneration from biophysical and socio-economic explanatory variables. At the national level, I quantified and analysed patterns and drivers of land cover change over the past 500 years for key periods of Colombian history, and identified the extent and duration of impacts on broad ecosystem types. At the national and regional-levels, I also modelled current landscape transformation patterns and predicted areas at a high risk of future deforestation using a joint logistic regression and regression tree approach. I discovered that the rate of deforestation across several lowland regions of Colombia follows a simple sigmoid pattern composed of four phases of transformation: an initial phase of gradual forest loss; an intermediate phase of rapid loss; a second intermediate phase where the rate of decline slows; and a final phase where the forest loss stabilises and is balanced by forest regeneration creating a dynamic equilibrium. At the end of this final phase, the landscape is in a highly transformed state with forest cover stabilizing at 2 to 10% of the original extent and an average forest patch size of 15.4 (&#177; 9.2) ha. As a general rule, the transformed landscape will have two forest components: a stable component of remnant mature tropical forests, and a dynamic component of secondary forests of different ages that is repeatedly cleared. A second important discovery was that unplanned deforestation in the Colombian Amazon moves as a colonisation wave, extending from population centres. The rate of movement was 0.84 km.yr-1 between 1989 and 2002. The regional average annual deforestation rate was 2.6%, but varied locally between &#150;1.8% (regeneration) and 5.3%. The parallel deforestation and regeneration processes operating within the colonization front showed consistent patterns and rates directly related to the proportion of forest in the neighbourhood, with the highest rates of deforestation occurring in the areas with intermediate (40-60%) forest cover, following an overall quadratic function, and therefore confirming the sigmoid pattern across an entire colonization front. Landscapes with intermediate forest cover also have the highest density of edge habitat, with the deforestation process mimicking the spread of disease. At the national-level, the study reveals two important outcomes. First, there are significant regional differences in the spatial and temporal patterns and drivers of land cover change. The importance of such regional differences in factors explainingland cover change is highlighted by the greatest discrimination ability shown by a regional-level classification tree model. The coefficients and significance of variables in a regional logistic regression model confirmed these differences. Overall, factors related to accessibility (distance to roads and towns) had the strongest influence on the probability of deforestation. The second national-level outcome highlights the need for a longer-term historical perspective spanning centuries to understand present-day landscapes and their level of human impact. The historical analysis reveals that the main drivers of landscape change varied in the early colonial period, with cattle grazing becoming increasingly important, and finally the high impact of economic globalization in the 1990s. The historic land cover maps show the transformed areas increasing from approximately 15 million ha in 1500 to 42 million ha in 2000. Also, during this period, the transformed areas changed from predominantly cropping land uses in 1500 to predominantly (&lt; 75%) grazing in 2000. The research outcomes collectively provide an understanding of the spatial dynamics of unplannedland cover change in tropical forest landscapes, by showing how deforestation and regeneration processes vary along a transformation gradient, and linking the amount of remnant forests is related to the rate of change. The work has implications for policy and management. For example, the method of calculating the movement speed of a colonization front provides a spatially explicit prediction of threat that can be used in conservation planning. The improved understanding of the deforestation and regeneration dynamics over an entire colonization fronts permits more accurate calculation of carbon budgeting for climate change applications. I recommend that future work test of the generalities presented here in both, countries with unplanned deforestation and countries with planned land clearing, to evaluate the effects government controlled planning has on the end result of human transformed landscapes in tropical and subtropical forest regions.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270704 Landscape Ecology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158178</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Groundwater dynamics and the salinity structure in sandy beaches</field><field name="creator">Cartwright, Nick</field><field name="description">Groundwater dynamics in beaches have been investigated through field and laboratory experiments. The observations have been used to test the ability of currently available mathematical and numerical models to adequately account for the influence of processes such as vertical flow and capillarity. New 1D sand column experiments have been conducted to examine the influence of a truncated capillary fringe on periodic water table oscillations. As the fringe becomes increasingly truncated the aquifer storage term, the complex effective porosity n &#969;, is substantially reduced in agreement with previous findings under steady flow conditions. The findings are a useful starting point for an investigation of the dynamics of the water table exit point in beaches where the water table lies just below the sand surface. A simple 2D laboratory aquifer, influenced by finite-depth and capillarity effects, subject to simple harmonic periodic forcing has been used to investigate the dispersion of the water table waves. The performance of existing dispersion relation theories, accounting for both capillarity and finite-depth effects, deteriorates at higher oscillation frequencies suggesting that other, neglected processes have some influence. Horizontal flow in the capillary fringe is suggested as such a process. The generation of higher harmonics due to a sloping beach face is also investigated in the laboratory. The observations reveal that the generation process is strongest near the sand surface, likely to be due to vertical flows into the aquifer being strongest near the sand surface. A 2DV numerical model is applied to the data and does well in predicting the nature of the generation process, qualitatively reproducing the variation in oscillation amplitude with depth in the inter-tidal zone. Application of a modified Boussinesq equation to estimate aquifer recharge due to infiltration from wave runup is critically applied to field and laboratory measurements. Finite amounts of flux across the water table are seen at, and landward of, the runup limit where there is zero infiltration at the sand surface. This suggests that the capillary fringe and vertical flows in this region are significant and that application of the model be undertaken with care. Field observations of the salinity structure and its response to ocean forcing reveal no response to tidal forcing but a significant response to a wave-induced pulse in groundwater levels. The infiltration of salty ocean water due to infiltration from wave runup is shown to reverse the traditional &#147;salt-wedge&#148; scenario in the surficial aquifer with a thin salty layer overlying the fresh water.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">L</field><field name="subject">290801 Structural Engineering</field><field name="subject">680203 Civil</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158177</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dark husk of beauty</field><field name="creator">Leggett, Andrew Alfred George</field><field name="description">In my dissertation &#8211; a collection of poems entitled Dark Husk of Beauty &#8211; I struggle with the dualities of beauty and ugliness, of creation and destruction. This Dark Husk of Beauty is what remains when I follow the exhortation of John Scott&#8217;s magician Aosman to take the ugly, or the deformed, or the old, and transcend &#8230; natural revulsion by uniting with it aesthetically &#8211; sometimes even physically. The body, subject to such a union, becomes the central metaphor of this creative work. The poems in the title section address the fierce disintegrative beauty of the body subject to the ravages of passion, disease and death. Those of the second section take up the metaphor of &#8220;Prophecy&#8221; &#8211; Ezekial&#146;s prophecy over the plain of dry bones that, gathered together, grow flesh and are restored to life. In the third section, &#8220;Wings of Desire&#8221;, the poems defiantly transcend aesthetic dualism, undeterred by the punishments inflicted on the body for the artists&#8217; heresy. The final poem, a sequence of versions of lesser known works of Rilke, attempts to negotiate the portal separating such extremes through grace. My critical essay &#8211; A Psychoanalytic Discourse on Creation, Destruction, Perversion, Reparation and Creation in the Works of John Scott &#8211; addresses the problems of such creation by means of a psychoanalytic literary discourse. The relationship between creativity and perversion is discussed in the course of comparatively examining issues of indebtedness, desire, damage, destruction and repair in the poetry and fiction of John Scott and in my Dark Husk of Beauty.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158141</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An exploration of the performer-composer dynamic</field><field name="creator">Morgan, Christy J.</field><field name="description">The purpose of this critical commentary is to explore the concept of the composerperformer relationship.

Fault-tolerance can be defined as the art of building reliable devices from unreliable components, and is of particular importance for quantum computers that aim to precisely control the dynamics of extremely sensitive quantum systems. A model of quantum computation is a specification of the basic building blocks by which a quantum computation is implemented. The best known model is the quantum circuit model, where computations are implemented by means of unitary quantum gates that are applied to two-level quantum systems known as qubits. In a physical implementation of a quantum circuit, the gates and qubits will inevitably be affected by noise. Fault-tolerant quantum circuits are designed to be resilient against the effects of this noise, provided that it is not too strong. Fault-tolerance in the quantum circuit model is well developed thanks to the theory of quantum error-correcting codes. These codes allow for the correction of small numbers of errors introduced by a variety of noise processes. In a fault-tolerant quantum circuit, qubits are replaced with encoded qubits, and quantum gates with encoded gates that are immediately followed by special quantum circuits for error correction. Provided the rate at which errors occur is below a constant threshold value, the accumulation of errors can be checked so that the correct output of the computation correctly determined. The threshold acts as both a measure of how good the design of a quantum circuit is, and also as a target for experimenters aiming to implement quantum circuits. Much current research in quantum computation is aimed at designing quantum circuits that increase the noise threshold, hopefully to the point where it becomes within the reach of experimenters. A fault-tolerant encoded quantum gate must limit the propagation of errors so that the code&#146;s corrective capabilities are not overwhelmed. It is not so easy to design encoded gates that satisfy this property, and to date only a finite handful of such gates are known. In a faulttolerant quantum circuit, all quantum gates must be decomposed or compiled in terms of those that may be implemented fault-tolerantly. In the first part of this thesis, we present two results that may be applied to this problem of gate compilation. The first is a generic method based on the Solovay-Kitaev theorem that may be applied to all quantum gates, but is most effective for those that act on single qubits. We present the Solovay-Kitaev theorem in its simples known form as an algorithm, together with novel constructions that can be used to implement it. Following this we give a two specialized methods for two-qubit gate decomposition, based on the Cartan decomposition of the Lie group SU(4). The cluster-state model of computation is an alternative to the quantum circuit model, and makes use of quantum measurements and highly entangled cluster-states to implement a quantum computation. The fault-tolerant techniques developed for quantum circuits are not immediately applicable in this model, so in order for it to be a realistic candidate for performing computations we prove that such techniques are possible. In the second part of the thesis we prove that constant fault-tolerance thresholds may be achieved in the cluster-state model, and in particular in an adaption to an optical implementation. Following this we design a complete error correction scheme for optical cluster-state computation, and numerically determine the threshold of this model in the face of the dominant noise models likely to affect such an implementation.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">249999 Physical Sciences not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158120</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gene expression in the human brain: adaptive changes associated with tobacco and alcohol exposure</field><field name="creator">Flatscher-Bader, Traute</field><field name="description">Alcohol and tobacco are drugs of abuse which are legal to sell and consume in most western societies. Addiction to these two substances has major social and health implications worldwide. The brain structure known to mediate addictive behaviour is the dopaminergic mesocorticolimbic system. Dopaminegic neurons arise from the ventral tegmental area, project to the nucleus accumbens and interact with the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex. Chronic alcoholism elicits marked damage in the prefrontal cortex with significant loss of neurons and glia. The key components of addiction, tolerance and dependence, are thought to be the result of semipermanent adaptive changes in gene expression. Gene expression profiling of the mesocorticolimbic system from human alcoholics and alcohol-dependent animals has revealed highly region-specific alterations. How these molecular changes result in the development of alcohol dependence in humans is not fully understood. Complicating factors in human alcoholism include a high comorbidity with smoking, socioeconomic factors and the prevalence of underlying psychological pathologies. Gene expression profiling of the prefrontal cortex of six alcoholics and six controls resulted in the identification of functional gene groups sensitive to alcoholism. Mitochondrial function was found down regulated while mRNA levels of genes involved in stress response and cell protection were elevated. These results correlate with the pathology of the prefrontal cortex in chronic alcoholism. Some of the control cases used for gene expression profiling were later identified as chronic smokers, while all of the alcoholics were heavy smokers. To date the heavy co-morbidity of alcoholism with smoking has not been taken into account. Thus the expression of selected genes were investigated by realtime PCR in an extended case set of non-smoking alcoholics, smoking alcoholics, smoking non-alcoholics and non-smoking, non-alcoholics. This study revealed that alcoholism itself had a significant impact on the expression of midkine, the high affinity glial glutamate transporter, member 1 and the tissue inhibitor of the metalloproteinase 3. Heavy smoking itself led to a small but significant elevation of MDK mRNA levels as well as an increase in variation of excitatory amino acid transporter 1 and metalloproteinase inhibitor, member 3 expression. Apolipoprotein D however was induced by chronic smoking but not by alcohol dependence. These results highlight the need of careful case selection in future studies on gene expression in the human alcoholic brain. Peptide antibodies were produced to midkine and a polyclonal antibody against the excitatory amino acid transporter 1 was obtained from a collaborating laboratory. Western blots utilizing these antibodies revealed a marked increase in midkine and excitatory amino acid transporter 1 protein in alcoholics compared to non-smoking and non-drinking controls. In coronal sections of human prefrontal cortex of alcoholics and non-smoking non-drinking controls, immunofluorescence of midkine was obtained from nuclei throughout the layers of the cortex and from the cell bodies of a distinct set of astrocytes in cortical layer II. Double staining with glial fibrillary acidic protein revealed that a portion of midkine-positive nuclei were localised in glial cells. There was no difference in immunostaining of alcohol and control sections with midkine. In summary these results indicate that midkine protein is induced in the prefrontal cortex of the chronic alcoholic. However, this increase in protein may not be strong enough to be visualised by immunohistochemistry. Midkine induction may be reflective of reparative processes in the prefrontal cortex of the chronic alcoholic. Excitatory amino acid transporter 1 staining in non-alcoholic, non-smoking control cases were obtained as a confluent band in cortical layer II and sparsely in deeper cortical layers. Excitatory amino acid transporter 1 immunoreactivity overlapped partially with glial fibrillary acidic protein labelling. In chronic alcoholics, excitatory amino acid transporter 1 staining in the area between the cortical layer II and VI was significantly increased. At withdrawal, glutamate levels may reach toxic levels in the cortex. The increase in cells expressing excitatory amino acid transporter 1 throughout the cortical layers may indicate a protective measure of this brain region in the chronic alcoholic. Additionally, layer specific expression of midkine and excitatory amino acid transporter 1 in the prefrontal cortex of the healthy individual may implicate a specialised role of these astrocytes.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270201 Gene Expression</field><field name="subject">780105 Biological sciences</field><field name="subject">gene expression</field><field name="subject">brain chemistry</field><field name="subject">alcohol</field><field name="subject">tobacco</field><field name="subject">drug dependency</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158114</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The limits of liberal justice: Normative constraints on multicultural policies and indigenous policies in Australia</field><field name="creator">Antal, Ildiko Barbara</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the question of the extent to which theories of citizenship, especially as developed in political liberalism, help to formulate an understanding of cultural diversity in relation to political stability and justice.

The principal aim is to establish that political liberalism provides appropriate political and ethical norms for adjudicating multicultural and indigenous rights claims. Thus, the exposition is twofold: first the thesis explores the concepts of justice as fairness as expounded in Rawlsian political liberalism. Second it applies the Rawlsian perspective to analyse the implications of multiculturalism and indigenous politics for the Australian liberal state.

Transitional justice is an interregnum characteristic and comprises both accountability and the establishment of a moral society. Historically, the South African government's principal adversary, the African National Congress (ANC) advocated a just, multi-racial and equitable society through leaders such as Pixley ka Isaka Seme, Professor Z.K. Matthews and Chief Albert Luthuli. ANC leaders from 191 2-1 960 were mission educated and regarded segregation as the antithesis of their strong Christian principles and in opposition to Gospel values. They advocated the reformation of South African society through passive resistance and the attainment of the franchise. After the 1960 Sharpeville massacre and the entrenchment of "grand apartheid", the ANC adopted the armed struggle while the state committed numerous gross human rights violations to maintain apartheid. While exiled, the ANC established its just war claims with a meritorious cause, its jus ad bellum. By 1990 a settlement was negotiated between the principal adversaries. The interregnum was characterised by violence, commissions of inquiry and various requests for indemnification/amnesty. The ANC's just war claims were eroded with allegations of atrocities in its military camps that severely undermined its claims to the moral high-ground. Its poor conduct of the armed struggle, its jus in bello, was confirmed in various subsequent reports. The ANC's decisive election victory of April 1994 provided the Congress with an opportunity to structure transitional justice through the enabling legislation to the TRC on its own terms and prove through the self-incriminating evidence that emerged at the TRC hearings that apartheid was a crime against humanity and that the armed struggle was a just war with a meritorious jus ad bellum.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">430111 History - Other</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158109</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transformative Power in Motherwork: A Study of Mothering in the 1950s and 1960s</field><field name="creator">Porter, Marie</field><field name="description">In this thesis I explore the experiences of a group of Australian women who became first-time mothers between 1950 and 1965. I interviewed twenty-four mothers, half of whom were selected as practising Roman Catholics. The other half was AnglicanfProtestant by co-incidence rather than selection. The data in this research have been collected via in-depth, unstructured interviews with the participants. The interviews were taped and transcribed verbatim, before the data were analysed. I present a grounded theory of transformative power in motherwork that has emerged from the analysis of interviews. The mothers talked about what they did in their active mothering years. I argue that despite being constrained by the gender bias in the patriarchal context, these mothers were agents who developed skills that enabled them to resist or creatively deal with the constraints they faced. Their emphasis was on their agency and the power to nurture their children into responsible adults. Their awareness of the importance of their motherwork acted as a motivator in this development. My thesis is that the relationship between each mother and each of her children is a transformative power relationship in which both mother and child are transformedthe child into an independent adult and the mother into a skilled self-motivated agent through her mothenvork. Any threat to this process resulted in the mother doing all she could to resist or counteract the constraintls she was encountering. Transformative power expressed in motherwork can be recognised analytically by several characteristics. It empowers both parties in the motherlchild duality. Complexity, diversity, fluidity, and responsiveness to the physical, intellectual, and emotional aspects of the relationship are all evident in transformative power relationships. Through their own transformation, the mothers saw the falsity of the master narratives of motherhood, prevalent in society in the 1950s and 1960s, which they had believed as inexperienced girls. From their stories about motherwork, I reveal a counter narrative that was portrayed not only in their telling of their stories: but in their discursivelreflexive practices as mothers.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">370104 Urban Sociology and Community Studies</field><field name="subject">440207 Religion and Society</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158105</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Service recovery: A re-conceptualisation</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Doan Thuy Thi</field><field name="description">Despite considerable effort by organisations to provide excellent service, service failures occur. Increasingly, as the business environment becomes more dynamic and complex, it is unrealistic to expect service delivery to be completely error free (Bansal and Taylor 1999; Keaveney 1995a). When service failure occurs, firms are advised to put in effort to recover customers, because lost customers typically result in substantial financial and reputational loss (Hogan, Lemon and Libai 2003). Moreover, building relationships with customers is always considered as an ideal approach to avoid customers&#146; dissatisfaction with the recovery attempt. However, it appears that the majority (81%) of customers who complain are not happy with the complaint handling process (TARP 2001). The high percentage of dissatisfied customers suggests that current approaches to recovery are largely ineffective (Davidow 2003). In searching for explanations for the ineffectiveness of service recovery strategies, a programmatic research study was conducted. Study 1 is a qualitative study, including Study 1A and Study 1B. Study 1A was conducted on 199 consumer complaint letters, and Study 1B was conducted using 22 in-depth interviews. Study 2 is a quantitative study conducted on a consumer sample of 431 respondents. Study 2A is a scale development study and Study 2B is a structural equation modelling study. The research program is reported in seven chapters. Chapter 1 provides an overview of the thesis. Chapter 2 reviews service recovery literature. Chapter 3 outlines the methodology. Chapter 4 reports the results of Study 1. Chapters 5 and 6 report results of Study 2. Finally, Chapter 7 presents the conclusions, key theoretical and managerial implications, limitations, and suggestions for future research. In sum, the thesis proposes a conceptualisation of service recovery by providing a model that highlights the different aspects of the relationships between the following constructs: (1) Customer Recovery Expectations; (2) Purchase Deliberation Recollection; (3) Customer Emotional Attachment; and (4) customer&#146;s Recovery Expectation Disconfirmation. Customer Recovery Expectations concept reflects the customer&#146;s perception of an appropriate recovery attempt that they prefer in a particular service recovery context. Purchase Deliberation Recollection reflects the customer&#146;s recalled time and effort invested in the purchase deliberation process. Customer Emotional Attachment captures the emotional connection between the customer and the service provider that motivates the customer to act in the provider&#146;s interest. Lastly, the customer&#146;s Recovery Expectation Disconfirmation describes the customer&#146;s comparison between their preferred recovery solution and their received recovery solution. The relationships between these constructs significantly influence the two dependent variables: the customer&#146;s satisfaction with recovery and their repurchase intention. The findings highlight that, in service recovery, creating a customer&#146;s positive perception of recovery expectation matching attempt is the key. To affect this, employees should understand that the customer has a recovery expectation which the organisation should attempt to match. In addition, customers with a good and long term relationship with the organisation tend to have more sympathy when service failure occurs. However, long term customers may also be more demanding and have higher expectations than short term customers. When the organisation fails to recover the service failure for a long term customer, the negative effect of not appropriately recovering may outweigh the positive benefits of having a relationship. Therefore, once a good relationship has been built, organisations should be prepared to invest more resources to maintain it through time. That is, a relationship should be maintained in normal as well as in service failure situations. The findings thus have significant theoretical and managerial implications.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">350204 Marketing and Market Research</field><field name="subject">720401 Marketing</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158081</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of the epidemiology and molecular biology of Koala retrovirus (KoRV)</field><field name="creator">Tarlinton, R. E.</field><field name="description">Gammaretroviruses are known to cause leukaemia, lymphoma and immunosuppression in many species and the original isolation of KoRV (koala retrovirus) (Hanger et al 2000) was made as part of a study into the cause of the high rate of leukaemia and lymphoma in koalas. The virus however displayed some unusual features. While classified as an endogenous (inherited) gammaretrovirus it was unusually active. While endogenous viruses are very common with up to 8% of the human genome consisting of retroviral material they are usually mutated and inactive (Gifford and Tristem 2002). KoRV possessed a full length replication competent genome, was actively transcribed and produced viral particles. KoRV was also very closely related to the exogenous (horizontally transmitted) retrovirus of Gibbons (Gibbon ape leukaemia virus or GaLV). Normally closely related viruses are found in closely related species. This unusual similarity between KoRV and GaLV raised the possibility of a recent host species jump (Hanger et al 2000). This thesis makes a case for the recent introduction of KoRV into the koala genome and ongoing endogenisation into the koala genome. KoRV is demonstrated definitively as an endogenous virus but present at a mixed prevalence within the Australian koala population. The thesis also further characterizes KoRV&#146;s activity and establishes an association between KoRV and disease in koalas. It is difficult to prove that a virus present in all animals in a population (as is the case for most endogenous viruses) is the cause of a particular disease syndrome. Here real time PCR was used to quantify the level of viraemia and proviral DNA load in the blood of individuals. A significant association between high viral load and leukaemia and lymphoma was demonstrated. This was further confirmed in a follow up study of a group of animals where those with a high viral RNA level were at a greater risk of dying from neoplasia. The real time PCR study also indicated that animals suffering from clinical chlamydiosis had higher viral RNA levels than their healthy counterparts though this was not significant. This disease association was further strengthened when KoRV free populations were identified and were shown to have lower incidences of these diseases. The real time PCR studies demonstrated a considerable variation in the proviral copy number in individual animals. With most endogenous retroviruses the proviral copy number is fixed within the species or population (Boeke and Stoye 1997). Southern blotting was used to confirm this variation in copy number and also demonstrated variation in the pattern of these proviral inserts between unrelated animals. The random insertion pattern of KoRV provirus loci was further confirmed using cytogenetics. Sequencing of the KoRV envelope gene revealed marked variation in sequence within individual animals. These sequences despite considerable mutation in some cases were all potentially functional and indicate positive selection pressure for active virus within the individual animals. Inverse PCR was used to identify the koala genomic sequence interrupted by the proviral loci. While koala genomic sequence was successfully amplified no potential oncogenes were found. This study did however demonstrate the presence of truncated KoRV sequences missing a large part of the gagpro- pol gene. Electron microscopy also demonstrated KoRV viral particles in the bone marrow of a leukaemic animal. KoRV had originally been classified as an endogenous virus based on the fact that it was present in all animals tested and in all tissues of individual animals. However the accepted definition of an endogenous virus is one that is present in the germ line DNA and is inherited over several generations (Boeke and Stoye 1997). Single cell PCR of koala sperm was used to demonstrate that KoRV is present in germ line DNA. This was confirmed using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) techniques. Southern blotting of blood obtained from a group of related captive animals showed the inheritance of proviral loci over several generations. To determine whether all koalas carried KoRV loci, samples from geographically diverse populations were obtained. As expected all animals in Queensland were positive for KoRV using PCR techniques. Unexpectedly animals from Kangaroo Island in South Australia were free of KoRV. Samples obtained from Victorian animals demonstrated a mixed KoRV status. The animals on Kangaroo Island have been isolated from other populations since the 1920&#146;s and this raises the possibility that KoRV has integrated into the mainland koala population during the last 100 years. This is unprecedented for an endogenous virus with the most recent estimate for integration in other species being the type C viruses of pigs 5000 years ago (Mang et al 2001). The mixed prevalence of KoRV and its high activity indicate that this virus is still undergoing the process of endogenisation and provides a unique opportunity to study this process in a wild animal population.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270303 Virology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158074</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Handwriting of eight year old children with and without autistic spectrum disorder</field><field name="creator">Cartmill, Linda Joan</field><field name="description">Anecdotally it was found that Queensland occupational therapists reported a surprisingly high referral rate for handwriting problems amongst school aged children with Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD). A subsequent review of the literature revealed a number of anecdotal reports of disordered handwriting in this population but limited research in the area. This thesis presents a descriptive and exploratory study of the nature of handwriting in eight year old children with and without ASD. Issues of handwriting development and motor learning are canvassed followed by an examination of concepts of motor control. Next follows a review of current handwriting models. The Systems Model of Handwriting was proposed as a response to the evidence for both dynamic and motor programme aspects of handwriting. Using this model as an organizing structure, the literature on ASD and handwriting was then examined which led to the framing of three research questions: 1. Is the handwriting speed of children with ASD significantly different from that of children without ASD? 2. Is the handwriting legibility of children with ASD significantly different from that of children without ASD? 3. At what stage/s of the Sequential Handwriting Process, is the handwriting of children with ASD different from that of children without ASD? Twenty-eight eight year old children with ASD and a matched control group of twentyeight comparison children were recruited from state primary schools in Brisbane and surrounding areas. These fifty-six children were assessed on thirteen handwriting process variables and two handwriting outcome variables in order to answer the research questions. Data produced were analyzed primarily with t-tests for between group differences and by examination of correlations between process and outcome variables. Small but measurable differences were found in both speed and legibility between the two groups, with the handwriting of the children with ASD being both less legible (t=- 2.47, df=54, p=0.02) and slower (t=-2.47, df=54, p=0.02). Accuracy of letter formation was also found to be significantly worse for the children with ASD compared to children in the control group (t=3.53, df=54, p=0.001). Further, the two groups were found to differ in some aspects of the Sequential Handwriting Process. Specifically, the children with ASD showed significant correlations between legibility and Perceiving, Conceptualizing and Planning stages, while the comparison children showed significant correlations between legibility and Interpreting, Conceptualizing, Planning and Activating stages. Only one process variable (consistency of letter formation) showed a moderate correlation with handwriting speed &#150; all other variables were of only slight to fair strength. Finally, the implications of the research findings are discussed, limitations described and directions for future research canvassed. As a result of the present study, a revised Systems Model of Handwriting is proposed. Several recommendations for occupational therapy intervention in handwriting practices in the classroom are made, notably: clear and focussed initial tuition of letter formation and secondly, the development of automaticity of the handwriting skill.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158068</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Practising self-determination: Participation in planning and local governance in discrete indigenous settlements</field><field name="creator">Moran, Mark F.</field><field name="description">The principle and policy of self-determination holds that Aboriginal people should have the right to pursue a lifestyle of their choosing and to have control over their interactions with the wider society. Self-determination policy has been in place at a federal level since the 1970&#146;s, yet after thirty years of implementation, there is considerable disarray and disagreement over its merits. This study investigated the transactions of decision-makers as they practised two of the main policy instruments of self-determination: participatory planning and self-governance. The research settings were Mapoon and Kowanyama, two discrete Indigenous settlements on the West Coast of Cape York Peninsula, in the state of Queensland, northern Australia. Three typologies for settlements, planning, and organisations were established, which gave the context for the study, as well as a basis from which to generalise findings. From the types of planning in practice, a participatory plan at Mapoon was singled out for further study since it specifically recreated the language of self-determination. The Mapoon Plan was found to be successful technically, but it fell short of its stated social development goals. Planning proved to be a highly politicised and idealised activity, brokered by external consultants. The complex interplay among knowledge, ideology and politics, as observed, could not be described in terms of two separate domains, but rather in terms of intercultural production across an interethnic field. The anthropological literature tended to treat Aboriginal polities as cultural isolates, situated within administrative vacuums. To progress the study, it became necessary to apply a functional and administrative rationality to what needed to be done in practice. Twenty case studies of decision-making forums were analysed in the main research setting of Kowanyama. Each involved the contemporary practice of self-determination, as local decision-makers engaged with the wider society. In the majority of cases, all six proposed factors were found to be necessary, but not sufficient, for success: (1) participation, (2) technical expertise, (3) negotiation, (4) institutional capacity, (5) focal driver, and (6) jurisdictional devolution. A typology of actors was established to define the different decision-makers involved. Of the 600 adults in Kowanyama, only 30 were found to be actively involved in decision-making. This was unexpectedly low given the quantity of government activity purporting to further Kowanyama&#146;s self-determination. Six determinants were found to influence the level of participation: efficacy in practice, jurisdictional devolution, representativeness, function, informality, language and motivation. In particular, form followed function, whereby the function of a decision-making forum decided the level of participation that was appropriate. Contrary to accounts in the anthropological literature, the study found a fledgling system of representation in Kowanyama, complete with informal &#145;extra-constitutional&#146; checks and balances. Factions were a powerful aspect of Kowanyama society, but they did not monopolise politics. The local polity was better conceptualised in terms of its political pluralism, encompassing a complex array of balancing and competing interests. Significantly, constituents were beginning to exert local political influence over their leaders. The analysis found that notions of &#145;community control,&#146; as promulgated in the community development literature, were not adequate to explain the intercultural production underway. The full spectrum of participation was relevant to the actors of governance, from political activism to ambivalent apathy. Community control was found in the absence of government interventions, imbedded within informal institutions and cultural norms. Yet, introduced political structures, including Councils, were no less a part of the local political arena. The notion of governance better encapsulated the array of decision-making activities and actors occurring across a broad range of institutional positions. The study documented multiple dilemmas and indeterminacies as actors practised self-determination in the interethnic field, especially the interplay between local and external ideologies and knowledge. All of the examples of political innovation in the contemporary history of governance in Kowanyama involved productive social contexts developing locally between leaders and trusted outsiders. The complexity of problems and their solutions were only revealed through practice, one step at a time. Successful initiatives in Kowanyama were to a degree inadvertent; it was not until the end that actors understood what they had done right or wrong. Significantly, political innovation occurred in practice, often without any active intervention by government. Ironically, one of the greatest obstacles limiting local capacity was the size of the task of administering the programs of self-determination. An accepted role for leaders and employees was radical action to manipulate the system and to create the institutional space to permit the subjects of self-determination to participate. The analysis suggested that the importance assigned to government policy, legislation, and structure has fallen out of balance with their actual practice. Rather than fixating on policy solutions to self-determination, policy-makers should be focusing more on creating an enabling framework for practice. The six success factors proven in the study give the basis for such a framework.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310101 Architecture</field><field name="subject">780107 Studies in human society</field><field name="subject">governance</field><field name="subject">participatory planning</field><field name="subject">indigenous settlements</field><field name="subject">community development</field><field name="subject">Mapoon</field><field name="subject">Kowanyama</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158053</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Promoting physical activity among community-dwelling people with acquired brain injury</field><field name="creator">Tweedy, Sean Michael</field><field name="description">The overall aim of this thesis is to contribute to the development and implementation of evidence-based physical activity promotion strategies for people with acquired brain injury (ABI). A randomized controlled trial (RCT) will furnish the highest level of evidence regarding the efficacy of a given intervention, but the immaturity of this area of research means that, currently, an RCT is not an appropriate research design. Therefore the purpose of the program of research presented in this thesis was to strategically contribute to the evidence base required to justify the conduct of a well designed RCT of an intervention promoting physical activity for people with ABI. By increasing participation in free-living, moderate intensity walking, people with ABI may reduce the oxygen cost of walking, thereby improving everyday functioning. The first study (presented in Chapter 3) evaluated a novel over-ground walking protocol in which a third party assists participants with ABI to reproduce previously self-selected comfortable and brisk walking speeds. Such a protocol could be used in conjunction with a portable indirect calorimetry to evaluate changes in oxygen cost of self-selected walking speeds over time. Thirteen people with ABI and related gait pattern impairment (age 31 + 8 yrs) completed two familiarization and two testing sessions. The first testing session used a self-paced (SP) protocol in which participants walked for 6 minutes at two self-selected speeds &#150; comfortable and brisk paces. The second, conducted one week later, used an externally-paced (EP) protocol in which participants were instructed to walk at the pace indicated by the test administrator, who verbally and visually guided the participant to walk at their previous self-selected comfortable and brisk paces. In each testing session participants wore a portable indirect calorimeter (Cosmed K4b2). Measures obtained were oxygen cost of walking (l.min-1) and distance walked (m). Analysis demonstrated that the EP protocol reproduced distances walked at comfortable and brisk speeds with a high degree of accuracy and that agreement between measures of oxygen cost obtained during the SP and EP protocols were acceptable. Steady-state oxygen uptake is characteristic of a constant workload and was elicited during both EP walking trials, indicating that walking speeds were constant throughout the walk trials. It was concluded that the EP protocol described is a valid means of assisting people with ABI to reproduce overground walking speeds and that the protocol would be useful for evaluating changes in the oxygen cost of those walking speeds that may occur over the course of an intervention. The purpose of the second study (presented in Chapter 4) was to evaluate the validity of a uniaxial accelerometer (MTI Actigraph) for measuring physical activity in people with acquired brain injury (ABI) using portable indirect calorimetry (Cosmed K4b2) as a criterion measure. Fourteen people with ABI and related gait pattern impairment (age 32 + 8 years), wore an MTI Actigraph that measured activity (counts.min-1) and a Cosmed K4b2 that measured oxygen consumption (ml.kg-1.min-1) during four activities &#150; quiet sitting (QS), comfortable paced (CP), brisk paced (BP) and fast paced (FP) walking. MET levels were predicted from Actigraph counts using a published equation and compared with Cosmed measures. Predicted METs for each of the 56 activity bouts (14 participants x four bouts) were classified (light, moderate, vigorous or very vigorous intensity) and compared with Cosmed-based classifications. Results indicated that Actigraph counts provide a valid index of activity across the intensities investigated in this study. For light to moderate activity, Actigraph-based estimates of METs are acceptable for group-level analysis and are a valid means of classifying activity intensity. The Actigraph significantly underestimated higher intensity activity although, in practice, this limitation will have minimal impact on activity measurement of most community-dwelling people with ABI as higher intensity activity is likely to be rare in this group. In the third study (presented in Chapter 5), 18 community-dwelling adults with acquired brain injury and a related gait pattern impairment (32.3 + 7.5 yrs) participated in an 8-week intervention promoting lifestyle physical activity. The aims were threefold: to evaluate the physical and psychosocial effects of the intervention; to assess whether the intervention increased the physical activity of participants; and to qualitatively evaluate the perceived effectiveness and acceptability of the intervention. Data were collected at six time points over 28 weeks: three pre-intervention, one each at 12 weeks prior (T1), 11 weeks prior (T2) and immediately pre-intervention (T3); and three post-intervention at immediately after (T4), four weeks after (T5) and eight weeks after (T6) the intervention. Physical outcomes measured were oxygen cost of comfortable and brisk-paced walking and maximum distance walked in three minutes. Psychosocial outcomes measured were SF-36, Depression Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS), Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES), Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) and the Barriers to Health Activities for Disabled Persons (BHADP). Physical activity was sampled 6 days at T3, T4 and T6 and two measures were obtained &#150; Actigraph counts per day and total minutes of activity greater than or equal to moderate intensity. Semi-structured interviews were used to evaluate the perceived effectiveness and acceptability of the intervention. The intervention comprised weekly, home-based, interactive problem-solving sessions designed to identify and overcome barriers to activity and to promote walking, together with facilitation of a community based leisure activity of the participant&#146;s choice. Results indicated that the intervention improved important aspects of physical and psychosocial health for community-dwelling people with ABI. Compared with mean baseline measures, improvements in oxygen cost of brisk walking and self-esteem occurred that were both clinically and statistically significant at T6 (p &lt; 0.01). Significant changes in two subscales of the SF-36 and the SWLS also occurred, although they were not sustained at T6. Measures of physical activity increased but not to an extent that was statistically significant. Qualitative data were principally positive, with 100% of participants and their significant others indicating they would recommend the program to another person with ABI. Given the particularly low levels of physical activity in the ABI population, and the correspondingly large individual and community benefits of that will be accrued if their physically active behavior can be increased, the promising results from this program of research indicate that there is a strong justification for allocating the resources necessary to conduct a sufficiently powered, randomized controlled trial of a lifestyle physical activity intervention for people with ABI.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321401 Exercise Physiology</field><field name="subject">750305 Ability and disability</field><field name="subject">disability</field><field name="subject">stroke</field><field name="subject">traumatic brain injury</field><field name="subject">walking</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158050</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In/visibility: Women looking at men's bodies in and through contemporary Australian women's fiction</field><field name="creator">Bode, Katherine</field><field name="description">Masculinity is an increasingly prominent and important issue in debates within feminism, literary studies and visual theory. This study intervenes in and contributes to such debates by analysing an emerging group of Australian women&#146;s fictions (published between 1998 and 2002) which focus on male characters and, in particular, on the description and narrative potential of their bodies. The majority of these texts, and the ones that are explored in this thesis &#150; namely, Jillian Watkinson&#146;s The Architect, Georgia Blain&#146;s The Blind Eye, Mireille Juchau&#146;s Machines for Feeling, Fiona Capp&#146;s Last of the Sane Days, Sarah Myles&#146;s Transplanted and Wendy Scarfe&#146;s Miranda &#150; share two preoccupations. Firstly, male characters bodies&#146; are almost always damaged or suffering in some way; secondly, the ability (or inability) of female characters to look at these bodies is repeatedly foregrounded. I argue that the interactions between male characters&#146; bodies and female characters&#146; gazes function in complex ways both to confirm and to challenge patriarchal constructions of masculinity and male corporeality. Specifically, this occurs in relation to the engagement of each text with popular discourses of feminism and masculinity crisis, discourses that emerge and interact in complex and often contradictory ways in depictions of male visibility and exposure. While my approach is generally feminist, it is also fiction-centred. Thus, I draw on a variety of theoretical perspectives, including literary theory, masculinity studies, visual theory, history, sociology and philosophy, in order to unpack and engage with these contemporary Australian women&#146;s fictions. Paradoxically, one of the main consequences of this fiction-centred approach is a reengagement with and a rethinking of theoretical concepts emerging from psychoanalytic feminist film theory. In a remarkably consistent and explicitly pedagogical way, these fictions explore notions of objectification and dichotomisation, especially as they are elucidated in Laura Mulvey&#146;s analysis of Hollywood narrative cinema. Objectification is overwhelmingly aligned with oppressive power structures and identified as problematic, and the first half of this thesis explores the novels&#146; critiques of this mode of visual interaction. The second half investigates the alternatives to objectification imagined in these fictions. While, upon closer consideration, some of these alternatives recapture male and female characters within traditional patriarchal power relations, others enable a rethinking of both women&#146;s vision and desire, and men&#146;s subjectivity, visibility and desirability.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">420303 Culture, Gender, Sexuality</field><field name="subject">751001 Languages and literature</field><field name="subject">masculinity</field><field name="subject">female gaze</field><field name="subject">men's bodies</field><field name="subject">contemporary Australian women's fiction</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158036</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Validation of a CFD Solver for Hypersonic Flows</field><field name="creator">Elford, Michael Charles</field><field name="description">In this thesis the validation of a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code against published experimental data and alternative CFD results is explored. Six case studies are presented with flow speeds ranging from mid supersonic to hypersonic. The studies include complex compressible flow phenomena such as the interaction of shockwaves with boundary layers, vortices and other shockwaves. Two of the six validation cases also consider complex thermodynamic behaviour such as vibrational and chemical nonequilibrium. The problems chosen are limited in scope to flows which are planar or axisymmetric and remain laminar throughout the region of flow studied. This allows the studies to focus on simulating the fundamental behaviour of the flow without the added complication of turbulence or the need for large scale computing facilities. The problems which arose during the validation studies and a background to why they occurred and, wherever possible, strategies to avoid their occurrence are discussed. General modelling strategies in compressible CFD are also discussed. In this thesis the software suite CFD-FASTRAN is used to construct and analyse the CFD models.

In this study, several of these growth limiting factors were investigated. The toxicity of the hydroxyl ion (OH-) was examined using a solution culture system developed to allow studies at high pH without nutritional limitations. Also using this solution culture system, the effect of the high Na and Mg concentrations of bauxite residue on the Ca nutrition of plants was investigated. As the toxicity of Al at high pH is not known, a study was conducted to examine the rhizotoxicity of aluminate (Al(OH)4-) and polycationic Al at high pH. The ability of plant roots to reduce rhizosphere pH in bauxite residue was also considered. A novel gypsum application method was assessed for its efficiency at improving the Ca status of bauxite residue. Manual adjustment, ion exchange resins and automated titration were examined for their suitability for nutrient solution pH control in alkaline conditions. For short-term studies, it was found that a solution without supply of Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn, and aerated with CO2 depleted air, greatly reduced nutrient precipitation at high pH, thus eliminating nutritional differences between treatments. Manual pH adjustment and the use of ion exchange resins as pH buffers were unsuitable methods of pH control. In contrast, pH control by automated titration had little effect on solution composition while maintaining constant pH. The solution culture system was used to examine OH- toxicity in mungbeans (Vigna radiata (L.) Wilczek cv. Emerald), with root length reduced at a bulk solution pH of 8.5 and greater. The effect of Ca activity ratio (CAR) and pH on Ca uptake by mungbeans and Rhodes grass (Chloris gayana cv. Pioneer) in Na dominated solution cultures and in soil was investigated. Changes in pH in the alkaline range were shown to have no effect on the critical CAR of 0.024 (corresponding to 90 % relative root length) for mungbeans grown in solution culture. Results from soil grown mungbeans confirmed those from solution culture, with a critical CAR of 0.025. A critical CAR of 0.034 was also established for soil grown Rhodes grass. However, using dilute nutrient solutions dominated by Mg at pH 9.0, root growth was found to be more limited than had been observed for Na solutions, with growth reduced beneath a critical CAR of 0.050. Using a CAR equation modified with plasma membrane binding constants (to incorporate the differing antagonistic effects of Mg and Na), new critical CAR values were calculated for Na (0.56) and Mg (0.44) dominated solutions. This modified CAR equation permits the calculation of CAR irrespective of the dominant salt present. Solubilities of various gypsum sources and size fractions in seawater were studied to investigate the effectiveness of gypsum addition to the residue sand pipeline, rather than as a direct field application. The dissolution rate constant varied with gypsum source (analytical grade (AR) &gt; phosphogypsum (PG) &gt; mined gypsum (MG)) due to reactivity and surface area differences, generally reaching saturation within 15 s (AR) to 30 min (MG &gt; 2.0). The ability of bauxite residue to remove Ca from solution (due to cation exchange and precipitation) was also examined; the quantity of the total solution Ca adsorbed was found to be small (5 %). These low rates of solution Ca adsorption, comparatively rapid dissolution rates, and long pumping times (20 min), preclude the application of gypsum to the residue sand/seawater slurry as a method for residue amelioration. Dilute, alkaline (pH 9.5) nutrient solutions were used to investigate the effects of aluminate (Al(OH)4-) on mungbean root growth. Although root growth in Al(OH)4- solutions was slightly limited, the symptoms associated with this growth reduction were observed to be similar to those caused by the Al13 polycation at concentrations lower than that which can be detected. Also, when roots displaying these symptoms were transferred to fresh Al(OH)4- solutions, no root tip lesions were observed, and root hair growth on the lateral roots improved. Thus, Al(OH)4- is considered to be non-toxic, with the observed reduction in root growth in solutions containing Al(OH)4- due to the gradual formation of toxic Al13 in the bulk nutrient solution resulting from the acidification of the alkaline nutrient solution by the plant roots. The effect of Mn deficiency in Rhodes grass and of legume inoculation in lucerne (Medicago sativa L. cv. Hunter River), on the rhizosphere pH of plants grown in highly alkaline bauxite residue was investigated. In response to Mn deficiency in residue sand, Rhodes grass was observed to increase acidification of its rhizosphere (being up to 1.22 pH units lower than the bulk soil). Due to its ability to fix atmospheric N2 rather than relying on soil N (NO3-) reserves, inoculated lucerne (1.75 pH unit decrease) was also found to acidify its rhizosphere to a greater extent than non-inoculated lucerne (1.16 pH unit decrease).</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300804 Environmental Impact Assessment</field><field name="subject">770806 Remnant vegetation and protected conservation areas</field><field name="subject">Aluminate toxicity</field><field name="subject">alkalinity</field><field name="subject">salinity</field><field name="subject">rhizosphere pH</field><field name="subject">gypsum dissolution</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157976</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Complexity approach to national IT policy making: The case of Malaysia's Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC)</field><field name="creator">Abdul Wahab, Amirudin</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT This dissertation examines the design and implementation of Malaysia's national Information Technology (IT) policy with a focus on the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) project. Qualitative research methods, including in-depth interviews, document analysis and literature analysis, were used to build an understanding of the development of the MSC. The analysis adopts a holistic approach that draws upon the multidisciplinary perspectives of complex adaptive systems in order to understand how social, economic, political and institutional forces interact in a changing environment. This research contributes a policy framework called Goal-Policy-Implementation-Outcome (GPIO), which is used to understand, describe and assess the MSC policy design and methods. It is one of the first public studies of the MSC and one of very few complex systems analyses of a socio-economic system in a developing country. It has been argued that many countries around the world are competing rapidly to produce 'visionary' reports and policy statements on the future of their nations and societies in the 'Information Age'. This is due to the belief that IT can play critical role in stimulating the socio-economic growth of the countries. In Malaysia, the government embarked on an ambitious program to establish the MSC as an attempt to achieve Vision 2020, a national vision and Malaysia's statement of national goals that articulates the country's objective for developed-nation status, while moving towards the creation of an information-rich society by the year 2020. Despite the importance of national IT policies and the major commitment of resources to implement them, there are few critical studies of the positive and negative impacts of 'post-industrial' or 'information society' policy, particularly in the developing countries like Malaysia. This study seeks in part to fill this gap by providing a critical assessment of a Malaysian national IT policy. This research argues that IT policy for national development must be viewed holistically, taking into consideration innovations needed in the social, economic, political and institutional spheres, rather than taking limited view of IT as an economic growth engine. This is a paradigm shift that represents a movement from the traditional worldview (TWV), that was based on the Cartesian/Newtonian paradigm into new ways of thinking and action that is labelled here as the emerging worldview (EMV). The EMV is grounded in complexity theory, an interdisciplinary endeavour that draws upon ideas from a number of fields and seeks to understand and model systems with many interacting parts. This approach can help policy makers and analysts to understand, assess and develop a more balanced and comprehensive policy for the evolution of new technology such as IT and to tackle the complexity of socio-economic change of a dynamic real world setting. The data collection method is from in-depth, open-ended interviews and document analysis. This qualitative exploratory approach was chosen to understand and capture the points of view of other people without specifically limiting the lines of inquiry through questionnaires etc. This research was influenced by multiple theoretical frameworks, because taking one framework alone in analysing the complex issues involved in ICT would not provide a comprehensive understanding of the interplay of the socio-technical and techno-economic paradigms. This resulted in the contribution of a policy framework called Goal-Policy-Implementation-Outcome (GPIO), which is used to understand, describe and assess the MSC policy design and method. This research found that the MSC policy plan and process were not working as intended to achieve the goals of Vision 2020. The strategy of clustering businesses in one physical location to establish synergy did not work as anticipated because: (1) Cyberjaya was not yet fully ready with all the necessary people, infrastructure and community since many basic amenities have yet to be competed; (2) The distance of Cyberjaya to key cities were perceived to be too far; (3) Operational costs in Cyberjaya were perceived as high; (4) The Cyberjaya ecosystem lacks attractive incentives; and (5) Most of the current and potential MSC firms, customers and suppliers were already located outside Cyberjaya with existing networks of people and facilities in other locations. (6) The current environment of the MSC was also found not to be conducive to facilitating a self-organizing system due to the lack of a wide consultative and participatory process. Consequently, drastic changes to the organizational structure and behaviour are needed before success can happen. It was found that the key challenges and barriers to the transformation process in and through the MSC lie in the nature of the existing mindset, the operational practice, culture and power structural arrangements within and among the policy, people and institutions of the MSC. Discussion on the MSC tends to be centred on the technological and commercial without recognizing that technological change relies on concomitant social and political shifts. By succumbing to technology driven views and 'information society' rhetoric, policy makers are allowing real economic and social choices to be smothered. This dissertation argues that instead of presenting technology as something which is external to the society, with a dynamics of its own, and to which society must learn to adapt, effective debate about new technology must acknowledge the related political choices, power relationships and value judgments about the shape and direction of the society using the technology. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop policies to ensure that the economic benefits and social engineering associated with Malaysia&#146;s knowledge economy are managed through participatory and partnership methods at all levels of the country. This research has shown that complex systems analysis can lay the groundwork for a new approach that more accurately represents societal choices and outcomes than past approaches. Few researchers have undertaken complex systems analyses of social systems, with still fewer examining the context of a national public IT policy in a developing country like Malaysia. Further, there are very few thorough public studies done of the MSC itself, with most studies on the MSC either being done in confidence and/or being conducted by foreign consultants appointed by the government or by the Multimedia Development Corporation (MDC). As such, public accessibility to critical studies on the MSC or public documents on them is rarely available. This research, if not the first, is one of the first attempts made to provide a thorough constructive critical study on the MSC policy project since its official launch in 1996. It is also, if not the first, one of the first attempts made to apply the emerging paradigm or the new science of complexity in a real world national policy case study, specifically the MSC policy project. Moreover, there is a huge lacking of research done on behalf of 'marginalized communities'. This research is not carried out on behalf of private enterprise or national governments but rather it is done on behalf of its citizens.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">360203 Research, Science and Technology Policy</field><field name="subject">729901 Technological and organisational innovation</field><field name="subject">Multimedia Super Corridor</field><field name="subject">MSC</field><field name="subject">Malaysia</field><field name="subject">Complexity</field><field name="subject">IT Policy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157967</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Establishing the efficacy of telemedicine as a clinical tool for physiotherapists: From systems design to a randomised controlled trial</field><field name="creator">Russell, Trevor Glen</field><field name="description">High quality health services are often difficult to access in rural and remote areas of Australia. This is due to a shortage of health care professionals and specialists, inadequate and poorly distributed resources, and the tyranny of distance. The result is a reduced level of health and a higher mortality rate than seen in urban communities. Telemedicine, which is the use of various technologies to deliver a range of health care services over a distance, has the potential to increase equity and access to health care in rural and remote areas. To date there has been a poor uptake of telemedicine technology within the profession of physiotherapy. This undoubtedly stems from the perceived, and indeed, real difficulty of performing what is traditionally &#145;hands on&#146; therapy, via an electronic medium. Added to this is a paucity of rigorous clinical outcome studies to demonstrate the efficacy of performing successful treatment via this delivery method. The aim of this thesis was to establish the efficacy of telemedicine as a clinical tool for physiotherapists. To achieve this, the first major undertaking was the development of a telemedicine system to meet the unique needs of clinical physiotherapists and their patients. A series of studies was then performed to calibrate the system and establish its validity and reliability as a clinical assessment tool. Finally, a randomised controlled trial was conducted to assess the treatment efficacy of the telemedicine system. The telemedicine system was constructed using a human systems development approach, with close consultation with senior clinical physiotherapists and potential users of the system. The personal computer-based system was designed to connect patients in their home with physiotherapists in the hospital, via low-speed and low-cost communications. The system incorporated real-time videoconferencing and physical measurement tools to enable the remote assessment of patients. The validity and reliability of the telemedicine physical measurement tools were established through a series of five studies. The results demonstrated these measurements to be accurate and reliable, under various measurement conditions, when compared to reference instruments. A prospective randomised controlled trial was conducted to assess the treatment efficacy of the telemedicine system. The research model chosen for this study was the rehabilitation of subjects who had undergone total knee replacement surgery. Block randomisation was used to assign 65 participants to either a traditional face-to-face therapy group or a telemedicine rehabilitation group. Participants in both groups received treatment over a six week period. Data analysis focussed on comparing physical and functional rehabilitation outcomes achieved in each treatment group. The results of this study demonstrated that the rehabilitation outcomes produced via the telemedicine system were similar to those achieved in the traditional manner. Additionally, the telemedicine therapy was found to produce greater improvements in a number of functional outcome measurements. A high level of satisfaction was expressed by participants who received treatment via the telemedicine method. This thesis provides evidence of the efficacy of telemedicine as a clinical tool for physiotherapists. Furthermore, the work detailed in this thesis represents one of the first randomised control trials in telerehabilitation and makes a significant contribution towards the knowledge of low-bandwidth telemedicine in general. This thesis provides a framework upon which further research and telemedicine applications may be developed, with the ultimate goal of improving equity and access to high quality health services in rural and remote areas.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="subject">telemedicine</field><field name="subject">telerehabilitation</field><field name="subject">telehealth</field><field name="subject">physiotherapy</field><field name="subject">physical therapy</field><field name="subject">rehabilitation</field><field name="subject">total knee replacement</field><field name="subject">total knee arthroplasty</field><field name="subject">rural</field><field name="subject">remote</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157964</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Discovery of novel downstream target genes regulated by the hedgehog pathway</field><field name="creator">Ingram, Wendy Jill</field><field name="description">Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is a secreted morphogen involved in patterning a wide range of structures in the developing embryo.

Disruption of the hedgehog signalling cascade leads to a number of developmental disorders and plays a key role in the formation of a range of human cancers. Patched, the receptor for Shh, acts as a tumour suppressor and is mutated in naevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS). NBCCS patients display a susceptibility to tumour formation, particularly for basal cell carcinoma (BCC). The discovery of Patched mutations in sporadic BCCs and other tumour types further highlights the importance of this pathway to human cancer. The identification of genes regulated by hedgehog is crucial for understanding how disruption of this pathway leads to neoplastic transformation. It is assumed that the abnormal expression of such genes plays a large role in directing cells to divide at inappropriate times. Only a small number of genes controlled by Shh have been described in vertebrate tissues. In the work presented in this thesis a Sonic hedgehog responsive embryonic mouse cell line, C3H/10T1/2, was used as a model system for hedgehog target gene discovery. Known downstream target genes were profiled to determine their induction kinetics, building up a body of knowledge on the response to Shh for this cell type. During this work, it was discovered that C3H/10T1/2 cells do not become fully competent to respond to Shh stimulation until the cells reach a critical density, a factor that had to be taken into account when determining timepoints of interest for further investigation. Several techniques were employed to identify genes that show expression changes between Shh stimulated and control cells. In one of these techniques, RNA from cell cultures activated with Shh was used to interrogate cDNA microarrays, and this provided many insights into the downstream transcriptional consequences of hedgehog stimulation. Microarrays consist of thousands of spots of DNA of known sequence gridded onto glass slides. Experiments using this technology allow the expression level of thousands of genes to be measured simultaneously. Independent stimulation methods combined with northern blotting were used to investigate individual genes of interest, allowing genuine targets to be confirmed and false positives eliminated. This resulted in the identification of eleven target genes. Seven of these are induced by Sonic hedgehog (Thrombomodulin (Thbd), Glucocorticoid induced leucine zipper (Gilz), Brain factor 2 (Bf2), Nuclear receptor subfamily 4, group A, member 1 (Nr4a1), Insulin-like growth factor 2 (Igf2), Peripheral myelin protein 22 (Pmp22), Lim and SH3 Protein 1 (Lasp1)), and four are repressed (Secreted frizzled related proteins 1 and 2 (Sfrp1 and Sfrp2), Macrophage inflammatory protein-1 gamma (Mip-1?), and Anti-mullerian hormone (Amh)). The majority of these represent novel downstream genes not previously reported as targets of Shh. The new target genes have a diverse range of functions, and include transcriptional regulators and molecules known to be involved in regulating cell growth or apoptosis. The corroboration of genes previously implicated in hedgehog signalling, along with the finding of novel targets, demonstrates both the validity and power of the C3H/10T1/2 system for Shh target gene discovery. The identification of novel Sonic hedgehog responsive genes provides candidates whose abnormal expression may be decisive in initiating tumour formation and future studies will investigate their role in development and disease. It is expected that such findings will provide vital clues to the aetiology of various human cancers, and that an understanding of their roles may ultimately provide greater opportunities in the future design of anti-tumour therapies.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cancer</field><field name="subject">hedgehog</field><field name="subject">patched</field><field name="subject">sonic hedgehog</field><field name="subject">C3H/10T1/2</field><field name="subject">10T1/2</field><field name="subject">basal cell carcinoma</field><field name="subject">BCC</field><field name="subject">microarray</field><field name="subject">microarrays</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157937</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Practical approaches to improve the value of the Falkland Islands' sheep and wool industry</field><field name="creator">Miller, Sean Michael</field><field name="description">Studies were conducted to determine basic aspects of intake and digestion of native pastures by young sheep in the Falkland Islands, and to evaluate practical methods to improve the productivity of these animals. The studies were conducted in support of Industry and Government initiatives to reinvigorate Falklands&#146; agriculture. The current industry is based on broad diameter wools harvested from sheep grazing poor quality native pastures, and sheep suffer low growth rates, poor productivity and high mortality, and farmers rely on small flocks to produce a single commodity for their total income. The dramatic collapse of wool markets in the 1980&#146;s crippled the Falklands&#146; wool industry and farmers have relied heavily on subsidies for more than 12 years. The studies in this thesis were initiated to support the efforts to reinvigorate Falklands&#146; agriculture, and they examined basic aspects of the nutrition provided to sheep by native pastures and evaluated practical methods to improve the survival of sheep, their subsequent rate of growth and productive value to the economy. Five studies examined specific hypotheses posed at the outset of the research programme and they were broadly supported by the data presented in the thesis: &#183; A wether trial was used to benchmark the productivity of wool sheep in the Islands, and the trial demonstrated that substantial genetic variation exists within the national flock that may be exploited in the future to improve the productivity of the wool industry, &#183; Microhistological techniques were used in conjunction with n-alkane marker technology to investigate the diets consumed by sheep grazing native pastures. The diet studies concluded that the low quality of native pasture in the Falklands during autumn, winter and spring restricts growth and productivity of young sheep, &#183; Studies with weaner sheep treated with controlled release anthelmintics established that infection with gastrointestinal nematodes exacerbates poor nutrition of young sheep consuming native pastures, &#183; A short-term metabolism study demonstrated that native pasture hay fortified with molasses and urea, or winter forage crops may be used as supplements to enhance sheep productivity, and &#183; Forage crops were grown and evaluated under Falklands&#146; conditions, and when lambs were fed the resulting highly productive and nutritious forages, the study demonstrated that lamb growth can be increased significantly, and lamb carcasses offer local farmers the potential to diversify farm income by using existing Falklands&#146;-bred lambs to develop an export meat industry The data presented in this thesis demonstrate that the potential to improve the productive and financial position of Falklands&#146; farmers is substantial. If both the local Industry and Government maintain their joint commitment to industry-restructure, pastoral development and enterprise diversification, the Falklands&#146; agricultural economy stands to benefit considerably by adopting low risk solutions to address widespread problems.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">630102 Sheep-wool</field><field name="subject">native pasture</field><field name="subject">alkanes</field><field name="subject">wool quality</field><field name="subject">sheep diets</field><field name="subject">gastrointestinal parasitism</field><field name="subject">urea-molasses treatment</field><field name="subject">brassicas</field><field name="subject">carcass quality</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157933</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Viable Software: the Intelligent Control Paradigm for Adaptable and Adaptive Architecture</field><field name="creator">Herring, Charles Edward</field><field name="description">The Intelligent Control Paradigm for software architecture is the result of this work. The Viable Software Approach is developed as an instance of the paradigm. The approach uses the Viable System Model as the basis for software system architecture. The result is a model-based architecture and approach for developing software systems by piecemeal adaptation with the goal that they become adaptive systems at runtime. Software built in this manner is called Viable Software. Viable Software represents a unifying class of self-controlling software that is an &#147;intelligent&#148; control system. Cybernetics, Control Theory, and Complexity Theory are the background for this work, and aspects relevant to this work are presented. These results are related to software architecture and software engineering. Rationale for the selection of the Viable System Model as a basis for software systems is given. The Viable System Model is described. The model is restated as an Alexanderian &#147;pattern language&#148; to make it more accessible to software engineering. A Viable Software Approach is proposed and expressed in the form of a Product Line Architecture that arranges the Viable System Model, the Viable Software Architecture, a Viable Component Framework, and a Component Transfer Protocol into a system for generative programming. An important result is the formalisation of the pattern of the Viable System into the interface specifications of the Viable Component. Three case studies illustrate the approach. The first is an analysis and extension of the Groove collaboration system. This study shows how the approach is used to map an existing system into the Viable Software Architecture and add fuzzy-adaptive user interface controllers. The second study presents the design and detailed software construction of an adaptive camera controller as part of a smart environment. The final study shows how a Business-to-Business e-Commerce system can be evolved and an expert system-based controller developed to implement business contracts.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">L</field><field name="subject">280302 Software Engineering</field><field name="subject">700199 Computer software and services not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">Software Architecture</field><field name="subject">Viable System Model</field><field name="subject">Intelligent Control</field><field name="subject">Adaptive Control</field><field name="subject">Adaptable Software</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157886</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thor's Hammer Deflected: A history of the protection of power systems from lightning, with special reference to Queensland, 1950 to 1995</field><field name="creator">Mercer, Douglas Roy</field><field name="description">Electric power systems are a recent feature of community infrastructure, little more than a century having elapsed since the first public electricity supply was offered. The speed with which they have spread across the world, and the extent to which electricity has displaced other energy sources in commercial, industrial and domestic applications, has been quite remarkable. The widespread availability of a reliable supply of electricity has become one of the dominant factors in the lifestyle of the citizens of developed countries, and one of the differences between developed and developing countries. Yet not many histories of this remarkable industry have been written, and most of those have confined their attention to political and administrative matters, although technical issues have virtually dictated the pace of development of the industry. In the 1920s, when power systems began to spread beyond city centres, lightning became a major adverse factor in their capital costs, operating costs and reliability, and inadequate reliability reduced the rate of acceptance of electricity supply by the public, especially in rural areas. Although lightning has long inspired fear and wonder, its fundamental nature - the fact that it is an electrical discharge - was not known until less than three centuries ago, and the first measurements of lightning currents and voltages were not made until the middle 1920s, when instruments for measuring the electrical properties of lightning first became available. Intensive research programmes were undertaken in America, Britain, and some European countries from about 1925 onwards, but no research on the effects of lightning on power systems was undertaken in Australia until after 1950. This delay of almost three decades forced Australian power system engineers to base some very important aspects of power system design entirely upon data from other countries, which was of doubtful applicability in Australian conditions. During this period, the uncertainty over basic design data resulted in some power systems being over-insulated, with consequent waste of capital expenditure, while others were under-insulated, and had to be modified later to achieve adequate reliability. It is believed that this long delay in commencing lightning research in Australia was caused by a number of factors, including community attitudes to higher education and research (other than primary industry research), and the belief of many managers in the electricity supply industry that only the major manufacturers of electrical plant, located mainly in the United Kingdom and the United States of America, could successfully conduct power system research. In 1948 the Senate of the University of Queensland decided to replace the Chair of Engineering with four Chairs in separate branches of engineering. The founding Professor of Electrical Engineering, S.A. Prentice, was appointed in 1950 and soon decided to adopt lightning and its effects on power systems as the principal research thrust of the new Department. By the late 1950s, the University of Queensland had become the recognised centre of Australian research in lightning and high voltage insulation. With financial support from the electricity industry, the University completed a new high voltage laboratory in 1960, and soon began to be recognised overseas as a significant contributor to the world-wide search for knowledge in those areas. During the next fifteen years, the cooperative research programme of the University and the electricity industry developed fully, and valuable research was pursued in a number of areas, including the impulse strength and arc-quenching properties of Australian hardwoods used in poles and crossarms, the prediction of lightning outage rates of transmission lines, the causes of high lightning-failure rates in distribution systems, the performance of insulation under pollution conditions, and the validity of high voltage test procedures. The work frequently involved people from the electricity supply industry as well as people from the university, and attracted attention in overseas countries as well as in Australia. In 1974 Prentice reached retiring age, but the principal members of the staff he had recruited continued to produce research of high quality, and of considerable practical benefit to the electricity industry. By 1995, Prentice's principal staff members had reached or were approaching retirement, and the nature of lightning research had changed somewhat, with the principal interest turning to the details of the lightning stroke itself, and to protection of buildings and electronic equipment rather than power systems.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">430111 History - Other</field><field name="subject">780107 Studies in human society</field><field name="subject">lightning</field><field name="subject">electric power systems</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157883</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Critical Sets in Latin Squares and Associated Structures</field><field name="creator">Bean, Richard Winston</field><field name="description">A critical set in a Latin square of order n is a set of entries in an n&#215;n array which can be embedded in precisely one Latin square of order n, with the property that if any entry of the critical set is deleted, the remaining set can be embedded in more than one Latin square of order n. The number of critical sets grows super-exponentially as the order of the Latin square increases. It is difficult to find patterns in Latin squares of small order (order 5 or less) which can be generalised in the process of creating new theorems. Thus, I have written many algorithms to find critical sets with various properties in Latin squares of order greater than 5, and to deal with other related structures. Some algorithms used in the body of the thesis are presented in Chapter 3; results which arise from the computational studies and observations of the patterns and subsequent results are presented in Chapters 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8. The cardinality of the largest critical set in any Latin square of order n is denoted by lcs(n). In 1978 Curran and van Rees proved that lcs(n)&lt;=n&#178;-n. In Chapter 4, it is shown that lcs(n)&lt;=n&#178;-3n+3. Chapter 5 provides new bounds on the maximum number of intercalates in Latin squares of orders m&#215;2^&#945; (m odd, &#945;&gt;=2) and m&#215;2^&#945;+1 (m odd, &#945;&gt;=2 and &#945;&#8800;3), and a new lower bound on lcs(4m). It also discusses critical sets in intercalate-rich Latin squares of orders 11 and 14. In Chapter 6 a construction is given which verifies the existence of a critical set of size n&#178;&#247; 4 + 1 when n is even and n&gt;=6. The construction is based on the discovery of a critical set of size 17 for a Latin square of order 8. In Chapter 7 the representation of Steiner trades of volume less than or equal to nine is examined. Computational results are used to identify those trades for which the associated partial Latin square can be decomposed into six disjoint Latin interchanges. Chapter 8 focusses on critical sets in Latin squares of order at most six and extensive computational routines are used to identify all the critical sets of different sizes in these Latin squares.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">280401 Analysis of Algorithms and Complexity</field><field name="subject">230101 Mathematical Logic, Set Theory, Lattices And Combinatorics</field><field name="subject">280405 Discrete Mathematics</field><field name="subject">780101 Mathematical sciences</field><field name="subject">Latin interchanges</field><field name="subject">intercalates</field><field name="subject">combinatorics</field><field name="subject">Steiner trades</field><field name="subject">Steiner triple systems</field><field name="subject">algorithms</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157877</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reading Authority and Subjectivity Cross-Culturally: Some Women&#8217;s Fiction and Autobiography Since the 1950s</field><field name="creator">Ms Leili Golafshani</field><field name="description" /><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">420000 Language and Culture</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159361</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of enacted capabilities on adoption and utilisation of innovative information systems : a study of small- and medium-sized enterprises.</field><field name="creator">Salleh, Noor Akma Mohd</field><field name="description">This thesis is motivated by the need to establish a model covering innovative information systems (IS) adoption behaviours within small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Studies on adoption behaviour related to innovative IS are devoting increasing attention to SMEs. Most prior studies, however, have still relied on models developed from studies of large firms. The applicability to SMEs of findings and models developed from large firm studies is not without question as SMEs are not miniature versions of large firms. SMEs face different challenges and opportunities from large firms. This thesis empirically examined issues on the adoption behaviours of innovative IS by SMEs. In line with this objective, two research questions were established. First, what are the critical determinants that allow SMEs to overcome inhibiting factors and adopt an innovative IS? Second, what are the critical determinants that ultimately activate and stimulate them to become enabled and actively utilise an innovative IS? The conceptualisation of enacted capabilities, adapted from the resource-based view of the firm is introduced. This thesis postulates that appropriate enacted capabilities facilitate SMEs to become enabled and actively utilise an innovative IS. These enacted capabilities include the level of IT skills and knowledge of the enterprises&#146; members, trust in technology, trust in trading partners, external experts&#146; support, and organisational culture Models incorporating aspects of the theory underlying the technology acceptance model (Davis, 1989), the diffusion of innovation theory (Rogers, 1995), and the resource-based view of the firm (Barney, 1991) were developed to describe the causal linkages between the determinants that activate and stimulate innovative IS adoption behaviour (i.e., from adopting to enabling to utilising innovative IS). One model was developed for the adoption stage and a second for the enablement and utilisation stages. The adoption stage model contains three main hypotheses. The first two hypotheses propose that enacted capabilities have a positive direct effect on both perceived net benefits and attitude towards adoption from a competitive advantage perspective. The third hypothesis proposes that perceived net benefits have a positive effect on attitude towards adoption form a competitive advantage perspective. The enablement and utilisation stages model contains four main hypotheses. The first two hypotheses propose that enacted capabilities and attitude have positive effects on perceived net benefits. The last two hypotheses propose that perceived net benefits and attitude towards adoption from a competitive advantage perspective have positive effects on the extent of enablement and usage of innovative IS. The hypotheses are tested using data obtained via a survey and follow-up interview. Responses were received from 206 SMEs of varying industries and sizes from the survey. Out of these 206 SMEs, follow-up interviews were conducted with twenty-one SMEs. The interviews utilise a combination of both open and closed questions. The questions for the follow-up interviews were based on findings derived from the survey. The innovative IS examined was the Malaysian government&#146;s electronic procurement system, known as ePerolehan. All government suppliers must register for the system and become enabled for use before they can start utilising the system. The results indicate that enacted capabilities possessed by SMEs affect perceived net benefits at all stages of adoption behaviours of SMEs (i.e., adoption, enablement and utilisation). More significantly, two aspects of enacted capabilities, top management IS skills and knowledge and trust in trading partners dominate the effect on perceived net benefits. Support from external experts dominates the effect on attitude at the adoption stage. Top management IS skills and knowledge and trust in technology have a negative effect on attitude at the time of adoption. Enacted capabilities also contribute to the extent of enablement and usage within SMEs. Furthermore, different categories of adopters differ in the set of enacted capabilities underlying their innovative IS adoption behaviour. Results also indicate that when SMEs perceived higher net benefits in adopting innovative IS, they have a positive attitude. The positive attitude generated at the time of adoption has a direct effect on the extent of enablement and usage. The influence of perceived net benefits differs at the different stages of adoption behaviour. At the utilisation stage, usage is affected by perceived net benefits, however, perceived net benefits do not affect the extent of enablement at the enablement stage. In conclusion, this thesis found that enacted capabilities display important roles as antecedents to perceived net benefits, and that perceived net benefits act as a mediator from enacted capabilities to attitude at the adoption stage. Enacted capabilities also display important roles as stimulators of the extent of enablement and usage. Thus, apart from requiring good ideas and financial resources, SMEs also require appropriate enacted capabilities when adopting, enabling and utilising innovative IS.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">350213 Electronic Commerce</field><field name="subject">700299 Information services not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">small business</field><field name="subject">medium business</field><field name="subject">technological innovation</field><field name="subject">organizational behavior</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158058</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterization of a Newly Identified Human Rhinovirus: HRV-QPM</field><field name="creator">Mr Peter Mcerlean</field><field name="description" /><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Rhinovirus,&#160;respiratory&#160;illness,&#160;picornavirus,&#160;in&#160;silico&#160;analysis.&#160;</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159338</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Courting Controversies: Salman Rushdie, the Novelist and Intellectual Complicities</field><field name="creator">Sui-sum-grace Wong</field><field name="description">Salman Rushdie is one of the world&#8217;s most pre-eminent writers of contemporary literature. He is best known as a literary author who has written the controversial religious satire in The Satanic Verses, which brought him a prolonged death threat imposed by Islamic authorities. The novel Midnight&#8217;s Children won the prestigious Booker of Bookers prize in 1993 and the Best of the Booker award in 2008. Throughout his writing career, however, he has exceeded his role as a novelist and shown his commitment to using his fame and cultural authority to open debates and publicize his opinions on social and religious issues and world politics. This thesis analyses the various aspects of controversies surrounding Rushdie, as an elite transnational author, a literary celebrity, a public intellectual and an outspoken critic on sensitive topics. It comes to examine the social significance of public personas and the nature of complexity embedded in their career. Rushdie&#8217;s presence draws the media&#8217;s attention, and more often than not, instigates international disputes and contentions. By looking at different aspects of Rushdie&#8217;s identity, the thesis addresses controversies raised by his diverse roles and his traversing of spaces in the cultural industry &#8211; in academia, the book market, public forums, talk shows, celebrity jamborees and even fashion magazine dinner parties. As an elite postcolonial writer, does his iconic status &#8220;compromise&#8221; him in the literary field by the generation of exotic cultural stereotypes and the exploitation of his Indian upbringing? What can literary and cultural critics do to work beyond condemning this trend? As a literary celebrity and public intellectual, do his involvements in publicity activities and New York&#8217;s celebrity circuit make him abandon the professional integrity and the time-honored &#8220;disinterested&#8221; position of the writer? How should the reader understand the connections between the media and the author, and the novel and popular culture? In addition, given his deeply skeptical position on religious matters, how does the writer understand the world of Islam, and how does this understanding underpin his antagonistic relationship with the fundamentalists? Addressing these questions, the thesis is by no means an account of a single writer&#8217;s life and career, but suggests that the complexity of intellectual life in general is made necessary in a cultural landscape saturated with media hype, publicity maneuvers and commoditization. In such contexts, writers exploring their time must, in different degrees, participate actively in what they write against, and be implicated in these processes. Under the influence of the market, the change in social trends and with their aspired career in mind, it seems that there can be no non-involvement for these individuals. Yet, by taking the case of Rushdie, I also argue that implicit in the novelist&#8217;s self-conscious manipulation of his diverse roles and the parodic metafiction in his work are important indications about the image construction of controversial public personas, the cultural meaning of the novelist as a public intellectual, and the implicated career that a writer may have at the turn of the century.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">420000 Language and Culture</field><field name="subject">Controversies</field><field name="subject">Salman Rushdie</field><field name="subject">Novelist</field><field name="subject">Intellectual Complicities</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:177662</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Article Omission and Overuse: Syntax and Semantics of the English Article System in Interlanguage Grammar</field><field name="creator">Jun Matoba</field><field name="description">This thesis examines ungrammatical article omission, and overuse of the definite article 'the' in indefinite specific context by Japanese learners of English. This is an area of English grammar that has been considered a major problem for L2 learners (e.g. Ionin, Ko &amp; Wexler, 2004; R. Hawkins et al., 2005, 2006; Trenkic, 2007). The thesis extends the analysis of Japanese learners' interlanguage to the overuse of 'a' in indefinite specific mass contexts by these learners. A detailed analysis of DP structures in Japanese and English leads to the conclusion that Japanese learners, through their L1, are equipped with the linguistic features which map onto articles in English, even though Japanese lacks articles. The thesis examines the syntactic role of articles in rendering predicative nouns argumental (e.g. Chierchia, 1998; Longobardi, 1994) and explores the definiteness contrast marked by 'the' as opposed to 'a/&#248;' with singular count nouns and mass nouns (e.g. J. Hawkins, 1978) at the semantic level. Count/mass distinctions are also examined in detail (e.g. Doetjes, 1997; Jackendoff, 1992) because the 'a' versus '&#216;' contrast clearly relates this distinction. This thesis argues that, despite its lack of articles, the Japanese grammar expresses definiteness and count/mass distinctions through its classifier system. For example, different orderings of the constituents in a classifier phrase induce different interpretations as to definiteness (e.g. Kakegawa, 2004). Further, the thesis shows that some classifiers are incompatible with mass nouns, thus argue that in Japanese, as in English, nouns are associated with the features which underlie the count/mass distinction. Thus, the difficulty that Japanese learners display in mastering the grammar of articles in English is attributed to difficulties in the mapping between their syntactic and semantic underlying knowledge and the surface forms (e.g. Lardiere, 1998) rather than to the need to acquire new features or categories of syntactic or semantic knowledge as the Representational Deficit Hypothesis (R. Hawkins, 2005) claims. This proposal differs from the previous studies that assume that the relevant syntactic category is not present in the learners&#8217; L1 thus not acquirable in the L2 (R. Hawkins et al., 2005; Trenkic, 2007). It also differs from those that suggest that, even when the learners&#8217; L1 does not overtly realize these features (Ionin et al., 2004), the semantic features are available through universal grammar (UG). In order to examine how Japanese learners map syntactic and semantic knowledge onto the surface forms of articles in their English, data were collected via an oral production task and two types of grammaticality judgment tasks. An online judgment task was used to gather evidence for an intuitive type of knowledge of the constraints on article use, while an offline judgment task examined conscious metalinguistic knowledge of articles. Because L2 learners tend to construct and apply various metalinguistic rules as to the use of articles (Goto-Butler, 2002), the examination of both intuitive and conscious knowledge is essential for a comprehensive understanding of the development of the article system in interlanguage grammar. For the mapping of the syntactic knowledge of articles, the omission of articles by Japanese participants is investigated. The investigation focused on singular count nouns because the omission of articles with these nouns is ungrammatical in any context. It was observed that several of the Japanese participants indeed disallowed article omission for these nouns, suggesting that they had acquired the English system of mapping relevant syntactic knowledge onto the surface forms of articles. The thesis also explores the mapping of the semantic knowledge of articles by focusing on the overuse of 'the' in indefinite specific contexts. Previous studies have claimed that the overuse of 'the' is governed by the Article Choice Parameter (Ionin et al., 2004). The findings reported here confirm the tendency to overuse 'the' in indefinite specific (i.e. noteworthy (Ionin et al., 2004)) contexts. However, it was also observed that 'a' was judged acceptable in the same context. The offline grammaticality judgment task revealed that the choice of 'the' in this context may have been affected by metalinguistic knowledge. Thus, the findings are not in agreement with the hypothesis that a parameter governs the overuse of 'the' in indefinite specific contexts. Additionally, the thesis examines the overuse of 'a' in mass contexts. Though small in number, the participants who make inconsistent judgments for the same noun showed a tendency to accept the use of 'a' in specific contexts (i.e. de re specific) and reject it in non-specific contexts. It is argued that the feature [+specific] may be mapped onto 'a' in mass contexts in these learners&#8217; grammar. Based on these findings, the thesis explores how the syntactic module and the semantic module interact with each other in L2 grammar when mapping linguistic knowledge onto surface forms. The thesis also explores the effect of metalinguistic knowledge on L2 learners&#8217; grammaticality judgments in order to demonstrate a more comprehensive picture of article systems in interlanguage grammar.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English articles, definiteness, count/mass distinctions, interlanguage grammar, metalinguistic</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178731</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Response of Helicoverpa armigera to agricultural environments diversified through companion planting.</field><field name="creator">Renee Herde</field><field name="description">This study investigated the potential of companion planting as a strategy to aid in the management of Helicoverpa armigera in tomato and capsicum cropping systems. The investigaitons showed that a companion planting type system is unlikely to confer any benefits to the management of H. armigera in these crops. The project has contributed to the understanding of H. armigera host selection and how the pest responds to a diversified environment. Companion planting and vegetational diversity are strategies for reducing pest incidence on crops. Many theories have been devised to explain how introducing more than one plant species to a cropping space may reduce the incidence of a pest. Five ecological theories formed the basis of experiments in this study: The resource concentration hypothesis - Herbivores are more likely to find and remain on hosts that are growing in dense or nearly pure stands (Root, 1973). Associational resistance/Plant apparency - Crop plants grown as monocultures are more apparent to herbivorous insects than plants in diverse natural systems (Tahvanainen and Root, 1972). Trap cropping &#8211; the use of plants within a cropping area to attract oviposition away from the main crop (Banks and Ekbom, 1999).

The natural enemies hypothesis - generalist and specialist natural enemies are expected to be more abundant in diverse rather than simple systems (Root, 1973) A tall variety of sorghum (the forage variety Chopper) was tested for its ability to disrupt host location. Sorghum was planted around plots of tomatoes to act as a screen to disrupt visual cues for host location by Helicoverpa spp. No difference was found in egg numbers on tomatoes with or without sorghum companions. However, significantly higher numbers of Helicoverpa spp. larvae were found in the sorghum at flowering than in the tomatoes. This suggested the sorghum was acting as a trap crop, diverting oviposition away from the tomato crop. However, due to a short period of flowering and therefore peak attractiveness to H. armigera, sorghum was not considered to be a suitable companion plant for inclusion in commercial tomato production systems. A host preference study was conducted to determine the preferences of H. armigera for crop plants and possible companions in the hope of finding a suitable trap crop species. Tomatoes were shown to be a highly preferred plant making it difficult to find a compatible trap crop species that would be more attractive than the main crop. However, capsicums were less prefered and therefore more suitable for this type of experimentation. Marigolds were also found to be a highly preferred plant and formed the basis for further investigations into trap cropping systems. Field experiments were conducted in successive years in two geographical locations to assess the suitability of marigolds as a trap crop for capsicums in a field situation. However, in both years H. armigera incidence was extremely and unusually low leading to inconclusive results. A glasshouse experiment was performed to assess if the ratio of capsicum plants to marigolds plants had an effect on which species H. armigera would choose for oviposition. It was found that as more capsicum plants were introduced, moths became less likely to oviposit on the supposedly more preferred marigold plant. The diminishing attractiveness of a more preferred host in the presence of other hosts is a new observation of H. armigera behaviour. This result suggests that marigolds would be unlikely to be a successful trap crop in a field situation. The ability of H. armigera to learn in regard to host selection and the influence of this on host selection in the field was investigated. No evidence of learning was found. This was the first study investigating the effect of learning in a field situation; previously the behaviour had only been investigated in a laboratory situation (Cunningham, et al. 1998a). The ability of the Australian assassin bug, Pristhesancus plagipennis (Walker) (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) to predate H. armigera larvae on capsicum plants was investigated. This predator has been sucessfully been used for H. armigera management in cotton (Grundy, 2000b), but had not been investigated in horticultural crops. Significant reductions in larvae were achieved in treatments where assassin bugs were introduced. This predator warrants further investigation for inclusion in commercial integrated pest managment programs for capsicums. Pest repellent plants were also considered. Previous to this study, very little research work had been conducted on repellent plants for H. armigera. The herbs investigated were catnip (Nepta cataria), tansy (Tanacetum vulgare), basil (Ocium basilicum) and coriander (Coriander sativum). An olfactometer system was designed and built to test H. armigera moths&#8217; responses to odours from the herbs. Glasshouse experiments were also conducted. No repellent activity was recorded with any of the herbs tested. The results of this study support the theory that Helicoverpa spp. employ a strategy of passive host selection as suggested by Firempong (1986). This means that all available plants in an area may be oviposited on with successful ovipostion and larval development leading to the future utilisation of a species as a host plant. The implication of this finding is that in-field trap cropping is unlikely to be a successful strategy for reducing H. armigera oviposition in tomato or capsicum production systems in Australia. In cotton crops in Australia, trap cropping is used as part of an area wide management strategy and aims to reduce the total Helicoverpa spp. population of a region. Such a strategy may also be successful in horticultural crops but only with the full participation of the growers of all crops that are attractive to H. armigera in a horticultural growing region. Due to the diverse nature of horticultural production this may be a difficult task.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences</field><field name="subject">Helicoverpa armigera, companion planting, trap cropping, learning, marigold, host selection, repellent plants, Pristhesancus plagipennis</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:183732</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of 129Xe NMR to the Study of the behaviour of Polymers in Supercritical Carbon Dioxide</field><field name="creator">Kylie Varcoe</field><field name="description" /><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">09 Engineering</field><field name="subject">xenon, nuclear magnetic resonance, NMR, supercritical carbon dioxide, polymers, Kalrez, interaction parameters</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184958</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Flue Gas Desulphurisation System Utilising Alumina Causticiser Residue</field><field name="creator">Leon Munro</field><field name="description">The ever increasing global demand for materials has placed aluminium as the world&#8217;s second most used metal, with world annual production currently &gt;24 million tons. Consequently, the global alumina industry is perpetually striving to meet demands in conjunction with research, development and implementation of more efficient and sustainable processes and practises. Of specific concern for many proponents within the industry is that increased alumina production inadvertently results in increased Bayer Process-derived alkaline solid and liquid waste loads. Furthermore, in-house power generation at all Australian alumina refineries contributes to acid gas emissions, particularly SOx and NOx, both of which have environmental and anthropogenic impacts of global concern. The focus of this work is SO2 emission. SOx emission control measures can be achieved before, during or after combustion; the latter is termed flue gas desulphurisation (FGD). Commercially available FGD systems are dominated by once-through wet processes whereby the flue gas passes up through an absorbtion tower. The most favourable medium for industrial use is seawater, followed by limestone, and in some cases, a combination of both. However, the ever-increasing stringency of environmental emission legislation continues to inflict tighter controls on power production and is forcing industry to investigate alternative cost-effective FGD mediums. Therefore much research is currently dedicated to the utilisation of high volume, alkaline waste streams over manufactured sorbents. Modern environmental engineering approaches to waste product minimisation, neutralisation and/or reuse have lead to many new processes which change the view of many materials from waste product to environmental resource. Subsequently, this work examines the application of an isolated Bayer Process waste product, tricalcium aluminate hexahydrate (TCA6), as a FGD medium. Initial research assessed the dissolution behaviour and performance of the proposed medium with sulphuric acid, followed by batch reactor trials with a simulated flue gas. Data derived from this research indicated the suitability of TCA6 as a FGD medium and was subsequently applied to a preliminary model and proposed design parameters required for further pilot scale investigations. This work provides strong support for an economically viable and more sustainable approach to FGD for the alumina industry.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bayer Process</field><field name="subject">calcination</field><field name="subject">reduction</field><field name="subject">sulphur dioxide</field><field name="subject">tricalcium aluminate hexahydrate</field><field name="subject">flue gas desulphurisation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185167</field></doc><doc><field name="title">AN ETHNOGRAPHIC ACCOUNT OF A CONTEMPORARY REMOTE URBAN INDIGENOUS ETHNOMEDICAL SYSTEM AND THE SOCIO-CLINICAL REALITY SHAPED BY THE RESERVE DWELLERS AND THE HOSPITAL RESIDENTS IN THE 1980s</field><field name="creator">Robyn Mobbs</field><field name="description">This ethnographic study in medical anthropology is a critically interpretative analysis of fieldwork documentation I recorded during field research conducted in the mining city of Mount Isa in the far northwest of Queensland during the 1980s. Eighteen months of participant observation research was undertaken over four fieldtrips (1981-82, 1983, 1985 and 1988) at inter-connected locations: two urban reserves for Aborigines and the people I refer to as the Reserve Dwellers, as well as the local hospital and a group of hospital resident medical officers who I refer to as the Residents. During the field research I found that both Reserve Dwellers and the Residents experienced a difficult relationship during their interactions in medical consultations in the hospital clinics. Now in this dissertation I ask an overarching question of my time-lag field data. It is How can we understand the problematic relationship between indigenous reserve-dwelling help-seekers and biomedical practitioners at their local hospital clinics in the 1980s. To describe this problematic relationship I analyse time-lag data from my diaried participant observation at both the reserves and the hospital; semi-structured interviews with the hospital Residents; case studies and case histories of consenting help-seekers from the Reserves; and illustrative transcriptions of consultations between Residents and Reserve Dwellers that were tape recorded by the Residents during hospital clinics. The contemporary ethnomedical system of the Reserve Dwellers was inclusive of biomedicalized clinics and the Residents as clinicians at this remote hospital in the 1980s. I provide an ethnographic account of a changing contemporary indigenous ethnomedical system and describe the lifeways of the Reserve Dwellers in the 1980s; their pattern of help-seeking at their local hospital including grievous happenings; and their experiences in outpatients clinics and the emergency section of the local non-indigenous hospital. Their lifeways and help-seeking were in many ways defined by the collective sociality of Kalkadunga and other regional indigenous cultures as impoverished, very sick survivors of a genocidal contact history less than 100 years before. This local history is also reconstructed. The Residents view of local indigenous illness, help-seeking, and experiences of biomedicalised hospital clinics further describe the socio-cultural reality of the time. I found that the Residents had an insightful, even predictive assessment of local illness burden. At the same time, they held strong views about a pattern of help-seeking in the outpatients and emergency clinics that was considered disruptive of hospital routines. I also describe how they expressed their difficulties interacting with Aboriginal help-seekers including the taking of biomedical histories. My thesis is that a localized socio-clinical reality was shaped by a synchronic, coeval relationship between Reserve Dwellers enculturated within a changing, contemporary ethnomedical belief system that incorporated biomedicalized hospital clinics, and the Residents as clinicians enculturated within a culture of biomedical science at a remote hospital. I argue that the lifeways and pattern of help-seeking of the Reserve Dwellers, as well as the Residents&#8217; views about sick indigenous help-seekers, formed this particular socio-clinical reality. It was then consistently replicated by problematic socio-clinical interaction and biomedicalized praxis that inhibited investigation and curative outcomes for the Reserve Dwellers and other indigenous help-seekers.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aboriginal health and hospitals, indigenous lifeways, indigenous help-seeking, socio-clinical reality</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:187678</field></doc><doc><field name="title">APPLICATION AND APPRAISAL OF A MULTI-OBJECTIVE DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM FOR THE EVALUATION OF FARM FORESTRY VIABILITY</field><field name="creator">David Ian Jeffreys</field><field name="description">Abstract This thesis presents innovative applications of Multi-Objective Decision Support Systems (MODSS) to forestry decision support. New MODSS methodologies were developed to assess and evaluate forestry practices and finance regimes. The assessment of forestry investments draw on case studies conducted in the Hodgson Creek catchment on the Darling Downs in south Queensland and on the Atherton Tablelands in north Queensland, Australia. MODSS are systems that aid decision-making, in which a set of alternative management options are evaluated against a set of decision criteria. The criteria, that represent the stakeholders&#8217; goals and objectives, are weighted to reflect stakeholder preferences regarding their relative importance. The weighted criteria scores are then aggregated to create an overall measure of option performance. In the first case study, MODSS procedures identified from the literature as being most suitable to forestry and the MODSS software package DEFINITE was used. After a critical review of the first study, a new MODSS was developed to address the particular needs of forestry evaluations and the weaknesses of current MODSS for addressing these needs. Limitations of the Hodgson Creek MODSS included lack of stakeholder engagement in the MODSS development process, inefficient use of the stakeholder time and an excessive work load on the experts in the scoring process. The new MODSS development process included the combined use of weighted sum and Electr&#233; aggregation methods, these being compensatory and non-compensatory aggregation methods. This combination of aggregation methods provided a measure of overall option performance and identified the presence of fatal flaws in the options. Various criteria weighting methods were trialled &#8211; including rank order methods, the analytical hierarchy process and direct assessments &#8211; to assess their utility for defining weights that reflected stakeholder priorities. A new hybrid weighting technique was developed using a combination of rank order methods and direct assessments. A new and innovative process for scoring options and criteria was developed, using an adaption of the Nominal Group Technique (NGT) in conjunction with a new computer-based Group Decision Support System (GDSS). This iterative process involved repeated rounds of individual scoring and group discussions. In the workshop conducted to elicit scores from experts, the GDSS was used to identify criteria where the elicited scores differed and discussions were focused on these criteria. After the discussions the options were rescored against the criteria and discussed further. This analysis was innovative in that uncertainty around the individual option scores was addressed for the first time using MODSS. This new application was developed in a spreadsheet using the risk analysis package @RISK. Evaluations of forestry options were undertaken at various time scales to address the long delay between incurring costs of tree planting and receiving returns from harvest. The various time scales identify the periods in which environmental and social benefits occurred as the trees grow and the economic benefits occurred at clearfell (or selective) harvest. This thesis specifically focuses on situations where measured and modelled data is not available, and seeks to increase the scientific rigour of the use of expert and stakeholder opinion in MODSS. The MODSS analyses revealed that forestry in the case study areas had the potential to offer considerable economic, environmental and social benefits to both landholders and the wider community. However, these benefits (and the associated costs) were not viewed as equally important. The MODSS developed in this study addressed these concerns. The benefits and costs of an option were reflected in its performance against the criteria. The degree of importance of the individual criteria varied from minor to high and overriding all other considerations. Criteria against which an option performed highly (the option&#8217;s strengths) were identified, as were criteria against which an option performed poorly (the option&#8217;s weaknesses). When these weaknesses occurred in highly important criteria, these were identified as fatal flaws in the option. The first case study in the Hodgson Creek catchment considered eight forestry options against 17 economic criteria, 12 environmental criteria and 12 social criteria. The second case study on the Atherton Tablelands considered 16 forestry options against eight economic criteria, six environmental criteria and five social criteria. The MODSS analysis identified the most preferred forestry options and the strengths and weaknesses of the options. In both case studies the most preferred options were large or medium-sized plantations with monoculture plantings with an element of non-landholder funding, in the form of government funding, joint ventures or land leasing agreements. These options had the highest performance against the economic criteria at all time scales and satisfactory environmental and social performance. Other forestry options that performed well included plantings focused on under-utilised land areas and salinity prevention areas, agroforestry, and selective harvesting of private native forest. These options generally had a higher level of performance against the social and environmental criteria, but lower levels of performance against economic criteria. These plantings would be undertaken for environmental and social reasons and not for financial returns. The application of MODSS developed in this thesis presents a significant scientific contribution to MODSS methodology. This thesis includes: the use of multiple time-periods to address the temporal differences in the delivery of benefits and costs, the use of NGT and a GDSS to provide a process for rapidly eliciting expert opinion, and the use of the combination of Electr&#233; and weighted sum aggregation methods to provide an overall measure of option performance and to identify fatal flaws in the options.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">MODSS</field><field name="subject">forestry</field><field name="subject">stakeholder engagement</field><field name="subject">social</field><field name="subject">economic</field><field name="subject">environment</field><field name="subject">risk analysis</field><field name="subject">weighting techniques</field><field name="subject">aggregation techniques</field><field name="subject">decision support</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:189046</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hartz revisited: German liberalism and the fragment cultures of 19th century Wisconsin and Queensland</field><field name="creator">Christopher Herde</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the nature of the relationship between migrants&#8217; ideology and the dominant political culture in their host country, exploring what happened to German liberal migrant politicians in 19th century Wisconsin and Queensland. It does this by using Louis Hartz&#8217;s fragment theory which he developed in The Liberal Tradition in America and The Founding of New Societies. Hartz argues that the crucial factor in the political development of the new settler new societies was the migration of a fragment of European society bound by a common Weltanschauung or world view. In the United States, Hartz identifies the relevant group as the Puritans who fled Britain in the 17th century, and whose Calvinism he links to Lockean liberalism. Hartz and his collaborator Richard Rosecrance, who wrote the Australian section of New Societies, argue Australia was shaped by the lower-middle and working-class migrant fragment, inspired by political reform movement in England, and who arrived in the first half of the 19th century armed with a utilitarian-radical ideology. With no strong opposition these fragments congeal without reference to Europe and stagnate into monolithic political cultures where all the disparate elements merge into a broad - although at times quarrelsome &#8211; national consensus. According to Hartz, this consensus is re-enforced by the individualist capitalism of The American Dream or the radical collectivism of The Australian Legend &#8211; which become the foundation of the two nations&#8217; respective national character. Hartz acknowledges that the new migrant from Europe is a constant threat to this political-cultural status quo. However, he says by &#8220;consciously articulating the fragment ethic&#8221;, the new migrant is absorbed, keeping in check the ideological challenges inherent in migration. This thesis argues that, in the case of the German liberals, who left their homeland in the 1840s and 1850s, the process was more complex than the one Hartz describes. In Wisconsin, German liberalism was most aligned to Jeffersonian democracy and the Germans either rejected outright or never fully embraced other strands within the political consensus such as Puritan moralism, Jacksonian democracy and Hamiltonian federalism. In Queensland their German liberalism was most compatible with utilitarianism and the Germans rejected most elements of classical liberalism, the evangelical element within social liberalism and the working-class radicalism of the Labor Party. They accepted Jeffersonian democracy and utilitarianism in their respective new homes because they were closest to their core German liberal principles of secularism, the primacy of the rule of law, romanticism, opposition to the aristocracy, and an aversion to rampant capitalism. Most important, however, were their attitudes towards the Staat and Volk. The Staat was both as a potential enemy and also a vital ally in liberal reform and the Volk were seen as potential colleagues in a liberal state but also as a danger to stability. Over the course of their careers they ideologically realigned, leaving parties and factions whenever challenged and using their German liberal ideals as their political reference point.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">16 Studies in Human Society</field><field name="subject">Louis Hartz, Queensland, Wisconsin, 19th century, US political culture, Australian political culture, fragment, German liberalism, migration, political history</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:189764</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A NOVEL AND COST-EFFECTIVE UNDERWATER WIRELESS COMMUNICATION TECHNIQUE FOR SENSOR NETWORKS.</field><field name="creator">Umberto Cella</field><field name="description">abstract: This thesis presents a novel, thorough approach to the application of low frequency electromagnetic (EM) wave wireless communication in marine environment. This investigation is both theoretical and experimental, and is oriented towards marine sensor network applications. Different solutions within the underwater low frequency EM communication area are compared on the basis of their feasibility and practicality, especially in relation to scientific environmental monitoring applications. As a result, this thesis gathers a coordinated series of application oriented analyses of devices, such as antennas, transmitters, receivers, and of propagation issues, like signal attenuation and antenna positioning. The concluding step in this analysis is constituted by experimental field tests. As a final outcome, this works provides facts, guidelines and prototype designs related to the application of EM communication in shallow water environment, and demonstrates this communication technique is convenient for shallow water sensor networks implementation. The process followed in this analysis starts from practical considerations regarding the characteristics required by scientific equipment used in environmental monitoring. A case study is presented where a hybrid (partially wired) marine sensor network is deployed in Moreton Bay, Queensland. Strengths and weaknesses of this system are analysed, and, based on this experience, new requirements and constraints are set for a prospective improved fully wireless sensor network. In particular, the shallow water marine environment is recognized as the most likely target for scientific investigation because of its biological, economical and social importance. Firstly, various underwater communication techniques are analysed and compared. This is done on the basis of two factors: the first one is the final use of the sensor network, and the second one is the peculiar nature of the shallow water marine environment. From this analysis, it emerges that EM communication may be, in the shallow water environment, a viable and good alternative to acoustic- and optical-based techniques. From this point on, this work is aimed to prove this possibility. The next step undertaken is the theoretical analysis of EM propagation in the shallow water environment, which is modelled as a stratified lossy dielectric. The outcome of theoretical calculations is that, within a certain distance, and for a given transmitter power, low frequency EM waves are a communication channel exploitable by underwater wireless sensor networks. This is particularly true when the required data rate is low, as it is in the case of monitoring variables such as temperatures or concentrations of dissolved substances in the sea. Following this, the electric dipole and the loop antenna are studied and compared when immersed in a lossy medium such as seawater. In particular, the comparison is drawn in terms of antenna size, with absorbed power and radiated field level held equal. This, together with other practical considerations, allows the choice of the electric dipole &#8211; with some variations with respect to free space applications &#8211; as the preferred transmitting and receiving antenna. Theoretical results are verified and completed by simulations, and final prototype design guidelines are presented, together with best deployment practice suggestions. Finally, measurements are conducted in order to verify the previous calculations and considerations. In addition to them, a sensor network prototype that uses EM underwater communication is presented and tested. The field tests verify, in a real situation and at several frequencies, the maximum distance coverable with a 100 mW power source. Moreover, the same test is also conducted in fresh water, and results are compared. The instruments used for the measurements are thoroughly described, as it is the wireless sensor prototype presented. The main feature of this design is its simplicity, demonstrating that shallow water EM communication is easily achievable and that it meets the standards required by a local area marine sensor network. It can be concluded that this work offers a thorough theoretical analysis of EM propagation in shallow water environment: in parallel with this, a synthesis of practical issues that are encountered in the design of EM communication devices for underwater sensor networks is also presented. In particular, EM underwater propagation, antennas, transmitters and receiver circuits and deployment issues are thoroughly covered. Aspects such as the application of advanced signal modulations and communication protocols, however, are intentionally left open to further investigation. In fact, the range of research topics opened by this work is very wide, and they could not be all covered within this work: they span from energy harvesting to communication protocols, from antenna design to power management. All these areas are well covered by literature for terrestrial sensor networks, but they are not covered for underwater sensor networks that use EM communication: these latter are, in fact, a novelty by themselves. The problems related to this particular application have been, therefore, thoroughly exposed and opened to future research.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">07 Agricultural and Veterinary Sciences</field><field name="subject">underwater communication</field><field name="subject">electromagnetic</field><field name="subject">underwater sensor networks</field><field name="subject">experimental</field><field name="subject">environmental monitoring</field><field name="subject">prototype</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:195885</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A framing analysis of the British news media&#8217;s coverage of the Maldives during the tsunami: Towards a crisis communications model</field><field name="creator">Aminath Ahmed Shihab</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the diversity of print news media frames during different stages of a crisis to enhance a model of media crisis communication, based on a framing analysis of the British print news media&#8217;s coverage of the Maldives after the Indian Ocean tsunami disaster of 2004. The tourism sector is vulnerable to disasters and crises with a series of recent events ranging from natural disasters and epidemics to terrorists attacks, many of which have had devastating impacts on the economy of destinations. In 2004, one such event of significance for the tourism industry was the 9.2 magnitude earthquake that hit the coast of northwest Sumatra, unleashing a tsunami that destroyed coastal areas in the Indian Ocean region including the Maldives. This disaster led to extensive media coverage, and has highlighted the importance of immediate and strategic communications after a crisis such as this tsunami. This research adopts the theory of framing and applies it during a tourism crisis situation. There is a lack of knowledge about the process of framing in crisis communications in the tourism literature, especially as it relates to the implications for planning and managing a tourism destination during and after a crisis situation. Previous literature on the framing by the media of tourism events and issues has focused on travel articles, advertising and promotion messages. This thesis finds that framing theory is also useful to identify how the news media responds during a crisis and how that knowledge could help improve tourism crisis management. This study analyzes the print news media regarding Maldives tourism in the aftermath of the tsunami crisis, and evaluates the diversity of frames used by the British news media in different stages of a crisis to enable the enhancement of a media crisis communications model in a tourism related context. This research is underpinned by constructivism with an interpretive orientation with the strategy of inquiry based on a qualitative case study method, and aims to understand aspects of the social and cultural contexts interrelating media and tourism. The framing analysis uses newspaper articles from the British press between December 26, 2004 and December 31, 2005 inclusive. The research uses content analysis of the news stories within a framing analysis paradigm, identifying both the diversity of frames used at different times after a disaster or crisis and the media phases that correspond to the last four stages of Faulkner&#8217;s (2001) tourism disaster management framework. The framing analysis reveals how the frames change during the different stages of the crisis and contributes to theory development in the areas of media effects, news discourse and crisis management as well as offering practical advice on tourism destination marketing during a crisis situation. The findings from this research contribute to the theory of framing by finding that during the coverage of crises where events are changing rapidly the media frames also change and different frames become predominant during the stages of a crisis. The findings also contribute to the literature on news discourse by providing evidence on the evolution of news discourse concerning a crisis situation over an extended period. By examining the news media crisis communication language as used at various stages of a crisis, the findings reveal that the media&#8217;s response and the frames they use differ over time as a crisis evolves, and that this enables the identification of different media roles during a crisis and crisis communication action stages. The result is a model that contributes to theoretical knowledge in media effects research, news discourse and crisis communications.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">crisis, crisis communications, framing, tourism management, tsunami, Maldives</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:196047</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exception Management in Logistics: An Intelligent Decision-Making Approach</field><field name="creator">Shi-jia Gao</field><field name="description">In recent years businesses around the world have been facing the challenges of a rapidly changing business and technology environment. As a result, organisations are paying more attention to supporting business process management by adapting to the dynamic environment. With the increased complexity and uncertainty in business operations, adaptive and collaborative business process and exception management (EM) are gaining attention. In the logistics industry, the growing importance of logistics worldwide as well as the increasing complexity of logistics networks and the service requirement of customers has become a challenge. The current logistics exceptions are managed using human brain power together with the traditional workflow technology-based supply-chain management or other logistics tools. The traditional workflow technology models and manages business processes and anticipated exceptions based on predefined logical procedures of activities from a centralised perspective. This situation offers inadequate decision support for flexibility and adaptability in logistics EM. The traditional workflow technology is also limited to monitoring the logistics activities in real-time to detect and resolve exceptions in a timely manner. To mitigate these problems, an intelligent agent incorporating business activity monitoring (BAM) decision support approach in logistics EM has been proposed and investigated in this research. This research creates and evaluates two IT designed artefacts (conceptual framework and prototype) intended to efficiently and automatically monitor and handle logistics exceptions. It follows a design science research strategy. The design, development, and evaluation adhere to the principles enunciated in the design science literature. The aim of this research is to solve the important logistics EM problem in a more effective and efficient manner. Two designed artefacts were strictly informed by, and incorporated with, three different theories. An exploratory case study and a later confirmatory case study assisted in the rigorous derivation of the design and framework. The results of the confirmatory case study were used in particular to refine the designed artefacts. Such a build-and-evaluate loop iterated several times before the final designed artefacts were generated. The designed artefacts were then evaluated empirically via a field experiment. The research included both a technical presentation and a practical framing in terms of application in the logistics exception monitoring and handling domain. In this study, there were three interrelated research phases. In the first research phase, a decision-making conceptual framework (an artefact) for design and development of real-time logistics EM system was developed. To enable more efficient decision support practices for logistics EM, the characteristics of logistics exceptions were first examined and identified. The logistics exception analysis was conducted through a comprehensive literature review and an exploratory case study conducted in a major logistics company in Australia. The logistics exceptions were then classified into known and knowable categories, based on the Cynefin sense-making framework (Snowden, 2002). On the basis of the logistics analysis, informed by Gartner&#8217;s three-layer BAM architecture (Dresner, 2003), the Cynefin sense-making framework decision models (Snowden, 2002), and Simon&#8217;s (1977) decision-making/problem-solving process, the real-time logistics EM conceptual framework was depicted. The BAM architecture provided the real-time decision support. Based on Cynefin&#8217;s decision model, adaptive business process flow was chosen for known and knowable logistics exceptions to speed up the decision-making process. In addition, Simon&#8217;s process theory was deployed to model the diagnosing process for known and knowable logistics exceptions. This conceptual model guided the analysis, design, and development for real-time logistics EM systems. In the second research phase, based on the logistics EM conceptual framework, a Web-service-multi-agent-based real-time logistics EM system (an artefact) was designed and developed. Intelligent agent technology was applied to deal with the complex, dynamic, and distributed logistics EM processes. Web-services techniques were proposed for more interoperability and scalability in network-based business environment. By integrating agent technology with Web-services to make use of the advantages from both, this approach provided a more intelligent, flexible, autonomous, and comprehensive solution to real-time logistics EM. In the third research phase, two designed artefacts were evaluated via a confirmatory case study and a field experiment. The confirmatory case study was conducted to collect feedback on the two designed artefacts (i.e., conceptual framework and prototype system) to refine them. The field experiment was then conducted to investigate the proposed logistics EM prototype system decision support effectiveness and efficiency by comparing the human decision-making performance with/without the logistics EM decision support facility. The evaluation results indicated that the proposed logistics EM prototype outperformed the one without logistics EM decision support in terms of more efficient decision process, higher decision outcome quality, and better user perception. The two designed artefacts were the major contributions of this research. They add knowledge to decision theory and practice. The artefacts are the real-time extension for Simon&#8217;s (1977) classic decision-making/problem-solving process model in logistics EM by incorporating BAM (Dresner, 2003). In addition, by adding the Cynefin sense-making framework (Snowden, 2002), the artefacts provide a more efficient decision-making routine for logistics EM. This research provides the first attempt (to the best of the researcher&#8217;s knowledge) to design a real-time logistics EM decision support mechanism based on decision science theories. To demonstrate the usability of the proposed conceptual framework, a logistics EM decision support prototype was designed, developed, and evaluated. For practice, the logistics exceptions classification, logistics EM conceptual framework, and incorporating agent technologies into logistics EM all will assist logistics companies to develop their logistics exception handling decision-making strategies and solutions.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">15 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="subject">decision science</field><field name="subject">design science</field><field name="subject">exception management</field><field name="subject">Business activity monitoring</field><field name="subject">Logistics</field><field name="subject">decision support system</field><field name="subject">business intelligence application</field><field name="subject">Intelligent agents</field><field name="subject">business process management</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:201459</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE ROLE OF HABITAT STRUCTURE AND COMPETITION IN THE ECOLOGY OF LISTERIA SPECIES IN FOOD-RELATED AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTS</field><field name="creator">Sally Chiu</field><field name="description">Listeria monocytogenes is a foodborne pathogen with a high mortality rate in susceptible populations and is of great public health concern with regard to food safety. The ability to grow at refrigeration temperatures during storage and at low pH levels during food processing has enabled the species to establish and sustain growth on processed food. Some food products particularly at risk of contamination by L. monocytogenes are deli or processed meat products, seafood, processed vegetables, dairy products and other food that do not require heating or reheating before consumption. The aims of this study are therefore to investigate firstly the prevalence rates of the species in high risk food products and a food processing plant in Brisbane. Secondly, to determine whether food isolates are better than environmental isolates at surviving the stress factors in food processing environments, or if their lineage groupings are a better indicator of their survival. Thirdly, to compare the survival of food and environmental isolates under temperature stress in co-cultures. A survey of more than 100 high-risk food products at supermarkets was carried out to investigate the prevalence of L. monocytogenes and other Listeria species in food. Isolates were also obtained from a food processing plant during routine tests. This study has found a low prevalence rate (under 10%) of L. monocytogenes in the processed vegetables and meat products tested. Other products tested included processed and raw seafood and processed fresh fruit. More L. monocytogenes isolates were isolated from the food processing plant (101) than from the food survey (25). Listeria grayi (73 isolates), a non-pathogenic species, was more frequently isolated from the food survey. The characterisation of those isolates has revealed their lineage groupings and REP-PCR profiles, which did not appear to be related to their sources. A selected group of 25 isolates were also serotyped for further identification. A larger number of lineage II isolates (70) were found compared to lineage I isolates (25), and were more common in food than the environments; while some (7) produced inconclusive results in the lineage PCR. The REP-PCR did not separate isolates of different sources, lineages or serotypes. In order to investigate the survival fitness of L. monocytogenes isolates whilst under environmental stress relevant to food safety, ten isolates from the food survey and food processing plant were chosen. Five isolates each from lineages I and II were subjected to temperatures ranging from 4&#186;C to 30&#186;C and pH levels from 4.0 to 6.0 for two weeks continuously, with their growth monitored by either optical density or plate counts. It was found that the isolates were most susceptible at the combination of pH 4.0 and 4&#186;C, where the growth of the isolates was completely inhibited. Again no relationship was observed between the lineage or the sources and the survival fitness of the chosen isolates. Due to the frequency of L. monocytogenes being co-isolated with other Listeria species as well as other food-borne pathogens, the relative competitive fitness of four of the isolates from the survival fitness experiment were compared in co-cultures at 4&#186;C and 30&#186;C at pH 7.4 in a small-scale preliminary study. The four isolates from food and environments were grown in broth cultures in pairs with the plate counts performed on antibiotic-supplemented selective TSA agar. The isolates were distinguished on agar supplemented with tetracycline which the isolates had acquired resistance to for this purpose. No significant difference (P&gt;0.05) was observed between the lineages or the sources and the competitive fitness of the isolates in this study. The isolates always produced slightly more colonies in the antibioticresistant form compared to the wildtype form but did not seem to relate to the competitive fitness of the isolates. It would seemed that within the scope of this study, neither the lineage, serotype nor source of the isolates indicated any isolate with a better ability of survival while at low temperatures and low pH levels in pure and mixed cultures. However, other classifying groups such as serotypes, RAPD profiles may reveal possible co-relations, as well as a wider isolate pool. Furthermore, different stress factors could be included as part of an investigation on the survival of L. monocytogenes, as this study focused on food safety during processing.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Listeria species</field><field name="subject">Listeria monocytogenes</field><field name="subject">processed meat</field><field name="subject">food survey</field><field name="subject">growth</field><field name="subject">cold temperature</field><field name="subject">low pH</field><field name="subject">mixed cultures</field><field name="subject">tetracycline</field><field name="subject">lineage</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206368</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CD4+ T cells provide help to CD8+ T cells in immune recall responses in skin.</field><field name="creator">Jennifer Broom</field><field name="description">Immune responses to antigens presented at skin, or other epithelial surfaces such as the cervix, are important for the clearance of viral infections, such as human papillomavirus (HPV) that infect epithelial cells [13]. Elucidation of the components of an effective immune response to antigens presented in this manner will potentially aid in design of immune modulatory techniques or therapeutic vaccine strategies to treat conditions such as cervical cancer. This thesis addresses the role of CD4+ T lymphocytes in immune responses to antigens presented in skin. CD4+ T cells have a well established role in the priming of CD8+ T cells, such that priming without help results in defective CD8+ T cell memory response [15]. The role of CD4+ T cells in the immune response subsequent to priming is less well delineated [15, 16]. Murine skin grafting is a model of antigen presented at an epithelial surface. The model used in this thesis utilises grafts transgenically expressing neo-antigens (human growth hormone=hGH, ovalbumin=OVA) under the control of a keratin promoter (K14 or K5) in the graft. The corresponding mice are termed K14hGH and K5mOVA. With hGH as the antigen, rejection of such skin grafts were shown to require CD4+ T cells [1]. The most surprising finding was that this requirement for CD4+ T cells was maintained even in an antigen-experienced host (in the recall immune response to hGH). CD4+ T cells are required by graft-primed recipients to reject hGH-expressing grafts, but are not required to reject grafts expressing alternative antigens such as OVA. In an adoptive transfer model into lymphopaenic hosts, when high numbers of CD8+ T cells were transferred, any addition of CD4+ T cells was superfluous. However, with low numbers of OVA-specific CD8+ T cells, the addition of CD4+ T cells resulted in a significantly faster rate of K5mOVA skin graft rejection. This helper enhancement of K5mOVA skin graft rejection is maintained, even 7 when CD8+ T cells were previously activated to a memory phenotype prior to transfer, indicating that CD4+ T cells do have effects after CTL priming in vivo. The requirement for CD4+ T cells in the rejection of C57.K14hGH grafts is abrogated by the addition of a local inflammatory stimulus (TLR7 agonist, imiquimod). This is a local rather than systemic effect, suggesting an influence on trafficking or local effector function. Administration of agonist anti-CD40 antibody also partially abrogates the need for CD4+ T cells in rejection of C57.K14hGH grafts by primed hosts. Although CD40 has a well established role in priming of na&#239;ve CTL responses, our findings indicate that CD40 can alter events after priming, and suggests a possible mechanism for the role of CD4+ T cells in this system. With these data, we speculate that CD4+ T cells may provide help by altering the state of APC cross-presenting antigen to experienced CD8+ T cells, and that this can be substituted by TLR or CD40 mediated activation of APC. The result may be an increased number of effector CD8+ T cells, as we demonstrate that high numbers of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells can abrogate this effect.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">11 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="subject">Cd4 T Cells</field><field name="subject">secondary immune response</field><field name="subject">Skin Graft</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206479</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Clinical and Virological Characteristics of Human metapneumovirus</field><field name="creator">Kevin Jacob</field><field name="description">HMPV was first reported in Australia by Nissen et al in 2002 from a group of 200 nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) specimens collected throughout 2001 from children presenting to the Royal Children&#8217;s Hospital, Brisbane. These specimens, previously negative for all common viral pathogens, were screened for hMPV by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay based on known sequences. Molecular diagnostic assays including conventional reverse transcriptase PCR assay (RT-PCR) and real-time RT-PCR assays were subsequently developed, and molecular characterisation studies in our laboratory identified four genetic groups of hMPV. At the start of this project, little information were available regarding the virological characteristics of hMPV such as the isolation and replication kinetics of the virus in eukaryotic cells, molecular assays capable of detecting all virus subtypes, quantitation of viral load, genotyping and molecular epidemiology, correlation between virus subtypes and disease severity, and clinical spectrum of the infection. This project was designed to elucidate the virological features of hMPV that had not been explained by earlier studies on this virus. The project was limited to retrospective studies utilising the sera and nucleic acids obtained from positive subjects presenting to our hospital. The project provided relevant data in these areas, which helped in the early detection of infection and treatment, and also provided information for future research on antibody profiles and vaccine development. The study examined specific areas related to clinical and virological characteristics of hMPV with the aim of applying the results in patient management. During the project, five areas of hMPV research were undertaken, addressing each through detailed studies. An outline of the project aims and the conclusions derived from those experimental chapters is described below: 1. Isolation of the virus from clinical specimens obtained from infected subjects An optimised tissue culture protocol was successfully developed for isolating hMPV from positive nasopharyngeal aspirates, using LLC-MK2 cell lines. Viral stocks were prepared and maintained at stable conditions for future experiments. The demonstration of virus infection in the eukaryotic cells and titration of the infectious virions were performed using immunological assays developed and optimised in our laboratory, during the course of this study. 2. The complete genome sequence of an Australian hMPV isolate In this study, we described the &#8216;13,333 base pair&#8217; complete genome sequence of the Queensland hMPV type-A strain, designated as AUS-001. Phylogenetic analyses of individual genes were used to generate &#8216;topological trees&#8217; for systematic comparison of our local hMPV strain to that of international sequences. 3. A quantitative PCR assay (q.PCR) for hMPV A quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR assay (qrt.RT-PCR) was developed for the simultaneous detection and quantification of hMPV in clinical samples. Serial dilutions of a synthetic RNA control were amplified after determining the absolute RNA copy numbers, and a standard curve was derived based on the cycle thresholds (Ct) values of the respective dilutions. Quantification of the hMPV RNA in clinical specimens was performed by extrapolating this data with Ct values of specimen dilutions obtained from the real-time assay. The dynamic range of the assay for hMPV genotypes A and B was determined. Validation of the inter- and intra- assay variations was completed using negative and positive controls along with a second assay targeting a different gene. 4. Determine the molecular epidemiology of hMPV genotypes This component of the project was designed to determine the molecular epidemiology of Queensland hMPV strains, using a selected &#8216;specimen population of hMPV positives&#8217; representing the period 2001 to 2004. An RT-PCR assay based on P gene regions of hMPV was developed for the molecular typing of the above panel. Analyses of nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences confirmed the heterogeneity of hMPV strains. In our study group, two genotypes (A and B) further classified into four subtypes (A1, A2, B1 and B2), were found to co-circulate during this period. General epidemiological features of the hMPV infections including seasonality, co-infections, incidence and prevalence in different age groups and in general population were described. 5. Clinical characteristics of hMPV infections The aim of this analysis was to illustrate the clinical spectrum of hMPV infections in a Queensland study population. We described the hMPV incidence pattern in different age groups and investigated the clinical severity scores of hMPV genotypes based on reported clinical features. We also undertook to identify any correlations between disease severity and other factors, including genotype, co-infections and viral load. Summary On completion, this PhD study provided valuable data on the isolation, molecular detection, epidemiological pattern and clinical severity of hMPV infections in Queensland. Overall hMPV was determined to be a serious respiratory pathogen in Queensland children. Data from this thesis will contribute to improved patient management and reduce the burden of hMPV-related disease in Queensland. These studies also formed the basis of further research involving respiratory viral pathogens in our laboratory and nationally.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">HMPV, virus isolation, in-vitro culture, real-time RT-PCR, genome sequencing, qrt.RT-PCR, RNA standards, semi-quantification of RNA, molecular epidemiology, phylogenetic analysis, clinical characteristics.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:209913</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Floral induction and initiation in Ptilotus nobilis: The effect of light intensity, temperature and daylength on floral evocation and development.</field><field name="creator">Sybille Orzek</field><field name="description">Ptilotus nobilis is a short-lived perennial wildflower, native to semi-arid and arid areas of Australia. Propagation by vegetative means is constrained by the early onset and a continuous flowering habit. Despite being defined as the main barrier for vegetative propagation no published research on floral induction and initiation was found. The aim of this study is to provide the first insights into floral evocation in P. nobilis, with the general objectives being to investigate floral induction and initiation, find the means to maintain plants in the vegetative phase, enhance leaf initiation and to gain knowledge of growth and development with an emphasis on light intensity, temperature and daylength. Early experiments aimed to increase the understanding of growth and development. The main cardinal events were identified including the onset of branching (axillary stem growth), visible bud stage, first floret opening and maturity of the inflorescence. To aid future cultivation schedules, four growing degree days (GDD) and one chronological model, using days after sowing (DAS), were established and validated. All GDD models were accurate in predicting first floret opening and maturity, but not in predicting visible bud stage. Best prediction was achieved by using an upper temperature threshold of 18.2 &#186;C and an own base temperature of 5.0 &#186;C. Days after sowing were an accurate means of prediction, indicating that temperature and other variables such as light intensity regulate development. A series of defoliation treatments investigated the maintenance of P. nobilis plants in the vegetative phase. Within all treatments, reproductive structures were observed and all plants with more than two true leaves entered the reproductive phase. Plants with less than two true leaves showed a delayed floral bud appearance by up to 20 days. Floral development was affected by most defoliation treatments resulting in vegetative growth within the inflorescences. It is hypothesized that plants have a very short juvenile phase and that a constant floral stimulus may be needed for floral evocation. Using scanning electron and light microscopy a template for the transition from vegetative to reproductive phase was developed. Bract initiation was accompanied by a significant increase in meristem area and diameter, and was defined as the onset of flowering. The established template was used in a subsequent glasshouse trial, which revealed that floral initiation occurred very early and at 25 DAS all plants had entered the reproductive phase. Branching and leaf area expansion were identified as post- initiation processes. Plants were exposed to different light intensities (229.3, 398.6 and 909.3 &#181;mol m-2 s-1) in a glasshouse. Under low light, final leaf number increased by up to three leaves, indicating that the vegetative phase was prolonged. Cardinal events were delayed but all plants reached maturity. It was concluded that a light intensity of 229.3 &#181;mol m-2 s-1 was not low enough to prevent floral initiation and that a further decrease of light intensity in combination with temperature could be more effective. Interactions of light intensity, temperature and daylength were investigated. Plants were grown under high light and low light (&lt; 1.2 MJ m-2) intensities, 25/10 &#186;C and 35/20 &#186;C and daylengths of 11 h and 16 h. During the trial period (42 days), low light intensity suppressed floral initiation and high temperatures maintained more plants (70%) in the vegetative phase. However daylength treatments had no effect on the time of bract initiation or the percentage of vegetative plants. After 83 days floral buds and axillary stems were observed on some plants under low light intensity, indicating the onset of the reproductive phase and showing that P. nobilis could not be maintained in the vegetative phase indefinitely. Plants under high light were harvested at maturity and effects of temperature and daylength were analysed. Final leaf number increased under 35/20 &#186;C supporting the previously established results that floral initiation was delayed and leaf production enhanced by high temperature. Morphological data was collected to classify the photoperiodic response of P. nobilis. Plants under 25/10 &#186;C and 11 h had the longest inflorescences and greatest number of buds and flowers, which was also reflected in the buds and flowers dry weight, with an increase of up to 3.4 fold under these conditions. The difficulty of classifying some plants accordingly to their photoperiodic response and the proposal that P. nobilis may be a facultative short day plant under 25/10 &#186;C is discussed. In summary, this study presents the first evidence that P. nobilis has a very short juvenile phase and that growth and development are mainly driven by light intensity and temperature. It was possible to enhance vegetative growth by defoliation, low light intensity and high temperatures, however this did not fully prevent flowering, which indicates that P. nobilis has a very strong flowering response or signal.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">07 Agricultural and Veterinary Sciences</field><field name="subject">Ptilotus nobilis</field><field name="subject">Floral Induction</field><field name="subject">Floral initiation</field><field name="subject">floral evocation</field><field name="subject">light intensity</field><field name="subject">temperature</field><field name="subject">daylength</field><field name="subject">photoperiod</field><field name="subject">defoliation</field><field name="subject">growing degree days</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:211556</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cytogenetics and speciation in Drosophila tetrachaeta Angus.</field><field name="creator">Angus, Donald Scott.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cytogenetics.</field><field name="subject">Drosophila.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:215431</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The nucleation and growth of gas bubbles in irradiated materials</field><field name="creator">Vela, Petar.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gases in metals.</field><field name="subject">Helium.</field><field name="subject">Bubbles.</field><field name="subject">Copper alloys.</field><field name="subject">Metals -- Effect of radiation on.</field><field name="subject">Boron.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:215510</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The tripartite model of anxiety and depression : a new look at theory and measurement</field><field name="creator">Boschen, Mark Justin.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences</field><field name="subject">780108 Behavioural and cognitive sciences</field><field name="subject">Anxiety -- Classification.</field><field name="subject">Depression, Mental -- Classification.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:216680</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An examination of how John Wesley's theological methodology functions in pastoral practice, illustrated by his doctrine of Christian perfection</field><field name="creator">McEwan, D.

H.</field><field name="description">Research on helping and altruism has been revitalized by the shift in focus from individual and interpersonal processed to group processed in the last decade. In particular, the social identity approach (Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1979; Turner, 1985; Turner, Hogg, Oakes, Reicher, &amp; Wetherell, 1987), which ahs been increasingly applied to helping situations, has provided a valuable group perspective on helping behaviour. The significance of social groups and shared identity for altruism has also been suggested (e.g., Monroe, 1996; Sober &amp; Wilson, 1998). Although helping and altruism are typically undifferentiated, central to altruism is the issue of motivation, which as additional theoretical and applied implications. The eight studies reported in this thesis aimed to build upon current social identity research on helping behaviour and to extend the social identity approach to altruism. In line with the social identity perspective, factors associated with group membership were expected to have important implication for individual helping decisions, especially among high identifying group members. Studies 1 to 3 tested the combined effects of target group membership and group identification on individual helping intentions. In all three studies, participant completed an ingroup identification scale and reported their intentions to help the target, who was either an ingroup or an outgroup member. Consistent with expectations, high identifiers were willing to offer more help to a more ingroup-like target in study 1 (N = 141). However, in Study 2 (N = 93). High identifiers offered more help to an outgroup than to an ingroup target. In an attempt to clarify these conflicting finding, Study 3 (N = 138) examined group members&#8217; helping responses in a group-relevant and a group-irrelevant helping situation. Results indicated that high identifiers were more willing to help an outgroup target when the helping situation was group-irrelevant rather than group-relevant. The helping intentions of low identifiers were largely unaffected by the group membership of the target or the group-relevance of the helping dimension. In a further analysis of the impact of target group membership on helping behaviour, Study 4 considered the moderating effects of perceived need on intergroup helping decisions. Using a realistic helping paradigm, participants (N = 94) heard a voice recording of a request for help from either an ingroup or an outgroup target, who expressed either a high or a low need for help. Where as people were more likely to help the ingroup than the outgroup target when there was a high need for help, the group membership of the target did not affect helping decisions when the need for help was low. While Studies 1 to 4 elaborated on the role of social identity factors in intergroup helping contexts, Studies 5 and 6 Focused on helping with intragroup contexts by considering how the intragroup position of the target can also influence people&#8217;s helping intentions. In Study 5 (N = 166), social identity salience was manipulated, whereas ingroup identification was measured in Study 6 (N = 118). Participants in both studies were then presented with a profile of either a prototypical or a non-prototypical target and were asked to indicate their helping intentions. As predicted, people who perceived their ingroup identity to be more salient (Study 5) or identified more highly with the ingroup (Study 6) were willing to offer more help to the prototypical than to the non-prototypical target. In addition, concern for the target was found to be a mediator in predicting individual helping intentions. The final two studies investigated social identity processed in field settings. Study 7 (N =618) assessed both helping intentions and behaviour in the context of a charity door-knock appeal. Respondents in both studies completed a survey, which included measures of group identification, concern, and helping intentions. Greater identification with the group was associated with increased willingness to contribute to the community (Study 7) and intentions to donate more money to the door-knock appeal (Study 8). Further more, the relationship between group identification and individual helping intentions was mediated by concern. Together, these eight studies highlighted the complexities of social identity influences on helping behavior as well as the contributions that the social identity approach can make to the study of helping and altruism.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:119790</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cognitive and Affective Learning: Feeling What We Know</field><field name="creator">Libera, Marilia</field><field name="description">The dual process theory proposes that evaluative conditioning is a form of learning distinct from Pavlovian conditioning and that it displays different functional characteristics such as not being subject to modulation. However, when assessed online as opposed to post-experimentally, modulation of evaluative conditioning by context change has been found in a contingency reversal procedure. Reversal of evaluative learning was found to be faster when trained in a different context rather than in the original training context. The present study addressed the question whether context change or instructions would affect the rate of reversal of evaluative learning and whether reversal learning would accelerate across repetitions. A picture-picture paradigm was used to expose participants to CS-US pairs and contingency was reversed three times during the experiment. Participants were required to provide online causal judgements and valence ratings after each set of 10 training trials. Context change, but not instructions, displayed a trend in affecting reversal of evaluative learning with participants displaying faster learning on trials immediately subsequent to contingency reversal. Instructions affected the reversal of contingency judgements. There was no evidence of acceleration across repetitions for either measure or manipulation.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">380102 Learning, Memory, Cognition and Language</field><field name="subject">cognitive, affective, learning, classic conditioning, dual process theory, context</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:138888</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of the taxonomy and ecology of the oscillatoriales (Cyanoprokaryota) of north-eastern Australia</field><field name="creator">MacGregor, G.

A specific interest considers ideas of embodied vision with an aim at generating events that vacillate in the bodies of the audience. A primary focus is on the arena of encounter as a multi-sensory experiential event, and within this context this project proposes a temporal and spatial framework for exploration. Studio methods develop a cinematic-body of video work negotiating performative practice involving video projection and temporality. Pivotal goals are to explore the significance of the &#8216;chiasm&#8217; between seeing and knowing, raising questions about how humans see, and how humans make how they see matter. Therefore, this thesis project progresses along experimental approaches to video installation, particularly in relation to the phenomena of encounter, the viewer, and film experience. The central motivation of this video practice is aimed at corporeal affect in the body/s of the audience. This thesis project is constituted as 80% practice-based work accompanied by a 20% exegesis.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en_NZ</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Embodiment</field><field name="subject">Haptic cinema</field><field name="subject">Sensory experience</field><field name="subject">Encounter</field><field name="subject">Event</field><field name="subject">Bodies of the audience</field><field name="subject">Experimental video</field><field name="subject">Sensate experience of the viewer</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/1006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A complex systems approach to important biological problems.</field><field name="creator">Berryman, Matthew John</field><field name="description">Complex systems are those which exhibit one or more of the following inter-related behaviours: 1. Nonlinear behaviour: the component parts do not act in linear ways, that is the superposition of the actions of the parts is not the output of the system. 2. Emergent behaviour: the output of the system may be inexpressible in terms of the rules or equations of the component parts. 3. Self-organisation: order appears from the chaotic interactions of individuals and the rules they obey. 4. Layers of description: in which a rule may apply at some higher levels of description but not at lower layers. 5. Adaptation: in which the environment becomes encoded in the rules governing the structure and/or behaviour of the parts (in this case strictly agents) that undergo selection in which those that are by some measure better become more numerous than those that are not as &#8220;fit&#8221;. A single cell is a complex system: we cannot explain all of its behaviour as simply the sum of its parts. Similarly, DNA structures, social networks, cancers, the brain, and living beings are intricate complex systems. This thesis tackles all of these topics from a complex systems approach. I have skirted some of the philosophical issues of complex systems and mainly focussed on appropriate tools to analyse these systems, addressing important questions such as: &#8226; What is the best way to extract information from DNA? &#8226; How can we model and analyse mutations in DNA?  &#8226; Can we determine the likely spread of both viruses and ideas in social networks? &#8226; How can we model the growth of cancer? &#8226; How can we model and analyse interactions between genes in such living systems as the fruit fly, cancers, and humans? &#8226; Can complex systems techniques give us some insight into the human brain?</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">complex systems; cancer; signal processing; metabolomics, gene regulatory networks, nonlinear dynamics, EEG, mutation</field><field name="subject">Signal processing</field><field name="subject">System analysis.</field><field name="subject">DNA--Analysis.</field><field name="subject">Mutation (Biology)</field><field name="subject">Genetic regulation.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/40682</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Family ties: molecular phylogenetics, evolution and radiation of flatworm parasites (Monogenea: capsalidae).</field><field name="creator">Perkins, Elizabeth</field><field name="description">The Capsalidae is a diverse family of ectoparasites of marine fish (Platyhelminthes: Monogenea). It is a large family with approximately 180 described species and many more yet to be discovered. Capsalids have a global distribution and parasitise a diversity of hosts from the Chondrichthyes to bony fishes. A morphological classification exists for the family based on a few key characters such as testes number, their arrangement and morphology of the posterior attachment organ (haptor). Phylogenetic relationships within the family and its position within the Monogenea are largely unexplored. I have used various molecular phylogenetic techniques to resolve relationships and explore the evolution and radiation of this family. Specimens from the Capsalidae and other monogenean families (outgroups) were obtained through fresh collections and generous donations by other parasitologists. Specimens were stored in 95% undenatured ethanol. Three unlinked nuclear genes (28S ribosomal RNA, Histone 3 and Elongation Factor 1 &#945;) and two mitochondrial genes (Cytochrome Oxidase 3 and Cytochrome B) were amplified for 78 capsalid taxa in 28 genera representing all nine subfamilies and 30 outgroup taxa (eight Polyopisthocotylea and 22 Monopisthocotylea). Analyses showed the Capsalidae is monophyletic, with the sister group remaining unresolved. Some analyses supported Gyrodactylidae and Udonellidae as the sister group but in other analyses, it was unresolved with the Monocotylidae and Microbothriidae also possible sister groups. The Capsalinae, Encotyllabinae and Nitzschiinae are monophyletic, but analyses did not support monophyly for the Benedeniinae, Entobdellinae and Trochopodinae. Monophyly was supported for Capsala, Capsaloides, Encotyllabe, Entobdella, Listrocephalos, Neobenedenia, Nitzschia and Tristoma, but Metabenedeniella is paraphyletic and Benedenia and Neoentobdella are polyphyletic. Comparisons of the distribution of character states for the small number of morphological characters on a molecular phylogeny show a high frequency of apparent homoplasy. Consequently the current morphological classification for the Capsalidae shows little correspondence with the phylogenetic hypotheses I present. I also sequenced the first complete mitochondrial (mt) genome for a capsalid species, Benedenia seriolae. The mt genome of B. seriolae shows some tRNA rearrangements in comparison to three Gyrodactylus spp. (Gyrodactylidae), the only other complete monopisthocotylean mt genomes sequenced. It also lacks the duplicated, conserved non-coding regions present in Gyrodactylus spp. making the genome smaller in size. I combined this genome with other available platyhelminth mt genomes to investigate the monophyly of Monogenea and the evolution of diet across the Neodermata. Results confirm paraphyly for the Monogenea and also suggest paraphyly for the epidermal feeding Monopisthocotylea. I hypothesise that the Monopisthocotylea represent the first shift to parasitism in the Neodermata from a free living ancestor and following this, there was a dietary shift to blood feeding (Polyopisthocotylea). The Digenea and Cestoda independently evolved dietary specialisations to suit their diverse microhabitats and broad range of vertebrate final hosts. Using Elongation Factor 1 &#945; I have estimated molecular divergence dates for the Neodermata, Monogenea and Capsalidae. Molecular clock analyses estimate the Neodermata diverged from the free living platyhelminths 513 million years ago (mya) (95% HPD [highest posterior density]: 473&#8211;605) before the appearance of vertebrates in the fossil record. The Monogenea diverged from the other neodermatan classes 441 mya (95% HPD: 420&#8211;547) coinciding with the appearance of fish in the fossil record. The most recent common ancestor of the Capsalidae arose approximately 235 million years ago (95% HPD: 200&#8211;274) following the Permian/Triassic extinction event and coinciding with the diversification of bony fishes in the marine environment. I compared the capsalid phylogeny to a phylogeny of fishes that I generated using eight nuclear and three mt genes to explore the evolution and the radiation of the Capsalidae across fishes. There is no significant global signal of coevolution with only five parasite-host associations that may be a result of coevolution. Estimated molecular divergence dates are also compared and do not reveal temporal congruence. Radiation of the family may have been driven by host switching constrained by shared host ecology, biology, behaviour and plasticity in morphological adaptations by the parasites. This study advances our understanding of the evolution of this monogenean family and provides insights into the evolution of the Neodermata and the complicated realities of reconstructing the evolutionary history of parasitic groups.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Platyhelminthes; Monogenea; Capsalidae; molecular phylogenetics; coevolution; fish; molecular dating</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60948</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mineral composition of hypothermally induced ankylosis in rat molars.</field><field name="creator">Leung, Albert</field><field name="description">This study used Backscattered electron imaging (BSE) and X-ray Microanalysis to qualitatively and quantitatively investigate morphology and elemental composition of ankylotic adaptation in the periodontium following hypothermic insult to their maxillary first molars. This method has been shown in previous studies to induce aseptic root resorption along with ankylotic changes within the periodontal ligament (PDL). A secondary objective was to assess the pulpal changes that occurred concurrent with the changes in the periodontium. Twenty-eight eight week old Sprague Dawley rats were divided into four groups of seven animals corresponding to one of four observation periods i.e.: t&#8321;= 7 days, t&#8322;= 14 days, t&#8323;= 21 days, t&#8324; = 28 days. At t=0 days, six animals in each group received a thermal insult as a continuous 20 minute application of dry ice (CO&#8322; at -81&#8304;C) to the crowns of their upper right maxillary molar. The untreated left molars were used as controls. The remaining rat within each group did not receive the dry ice. All rats were given two sequential bone labels, calcein 5mg/kg and alizarin red 30mg/kg, administered intraperitoneally 8 days apart. The timing of the labels was such that all rats were euthanased 2 days after the last label. Following sacrifice, the maxillae were dissected out, fixed in ethanol and embedded in methylmethacrylate. Ten microns thick, undecalcified maxillary first molar coronal sections through the furcation were obtained. For every 3 out of 10 sections: the first was left unstained and undecalcified; the second stained with Von Kossa/haematoxylin &amp; eosin; and the third decalcified and stained with haematoxylin &amp; eosin. Unstained sections were viewed under fluorescence, while transmitted light microscopy was used for the other sections. Following initial analysis, the unstained, undecalcified sections were de-coverslipped and carbon coated. These sections were investigated with scanning electron microscopy and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectrometry (EDS). Quantitative spot analysis and element mapping was performed on alveolar bone, ankylotic areas, cementum and dentine. A linear mixed effects model was employed to investigate any interaction between the four tissues of interest. A focal pattern of ankylosis was observed at days 14 and 21 in three rats. No ankylosis was observed in the control teeth. SEM revealed a focal type of ankylosis with central nodules of mineralized tissue forming within the PDL. Bridging between bone and dentine occurred with fine trabeculae which extended from the central mineralized nodule. Bridging was progressive and was more extensive at day 21 compared to day 14. At day 28, no ankylosis was observed. EDS analysis revealed that the ankylotic tissue was composed of major constituents Calcium and Phosphorous along with trace elements of Mg and Na. This was comparable to the surrounding alveolar bone, cementum and dentine. There was no statistically significant difference in the Ca/P ratios, Mg when ankylotic material was compared to bone. There was a trend towards elevated Na levels in ankylosis but this was not statistically significant relative to bone. Mg in dentine was lower than for all the other tissues and Na was higher in dentine when compared to bone and cementum. In the pulp, hypothermic injury demonstrated alteration of the odontoblast layer, reduction in cellularity, vascular alterations and tertiary dentin formation. At the 28 day observation period, the cellular and vascular changes had returned to levels comparable to the control teeth, indicating successful pulpal healing and regeneration. Marked tertiary dentine deposition was also observed at days 14, 21 and 28. Pulp chambers were visibly smaller due to tertiary dentine formation, however no pulp necrosis was observed. Thus the aseptic root resorption model, using a continuous 20 minute application of dry ice, suggested the occurrence of reversible pulpal tissue alterations compatible with an inflammatory repair process. The observation of ankylosis initiating as centralised nodules within the PDL suggest that the origins may be a consequence of osteogenic potential from PDL stem cells. The null hypothesis that a single, prolonged thermal insult on a rat molar does not have an effect on mineralized tissue formation and that ankylotic tissue is similar to bone was rejected. ABSTRACT There is a presumption that the ankylotic region formed after periodontal ligament (PDL) injury represents an unremarkable bony repair process. Essentially, the injury triggers an osteogenic repair response and the ankylotic tissue merely represents alveolar bone. There is uncertainty whether the oestogenic event is predominantly osteoblast driven, cementoblast directed, or a consequence of osteogenic potential from PDL stem cells. In this study, twenty-eight Sprague Dawley rats were divided into four groups of six animals, corresponding to one of four observation periods, and received a thermal insult as a continuous 20 minute application of dry ice to the crowns of their upper right maxillary molar. The appearance of ankylotic tissues was examined using backscattered electron images using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with an Energy Dispersive X-ray Analyser (EDS). The Ca, P, and trace elements contents were determined by EDS from four different hard tissue regions: ankylosis; bone; dentine and cementum, and the Ca/P ratios were calculated. Ankylosis was observed at days 14 and 21 in 3 rats and was not seen at day 28. No ankylosis was observed in the control teeth. BSE imaging revealed a focal type of ankylosis with central nodules of mineralized tissue forming within the PDL. The morphological features of ankylotic tissue differed to that of alveolar bone and dentine. Bridging between bone and dentine occurred with fine trabeculae which extended from the central mineralized nodule. EDS analysis showed that the ankylotic tissue was composed of major constituents Ca and P along with trace elements of Mg and Na. This was comparable to the surrounding alveolar bone, cementum and dentine. There was no statistically significant difference in the Ca/P ratios, Mg, and Na between ankylotic material and bone. Statistically significant differences was evident in Mg content between ankylotic material compared to dentine and cementum. Na content was higher in dentine than in ankylotic material. The results of this study indicate that, histochemically, ankylotic material is similar to bone. However, the appearance of ankylotic material as centralised foci with a morphology different from bone suggest that ankylosis may originate from an osteoblastic phenotype originating within PDL.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ankylosis; alveolar bone; cementum; dentine; rat; EDS-analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60949</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation into aspects of the biology of tubular black thrips, Haplothrips victoriensis Bagnall (Thysanoptera: Phlaeothripidae) in South Australia.</field><field name="creator">Le, Luong Cao</field><field name="description">Haplothrips victoriensis Bagnall (Thysanoptera: Phlaeothripidae) is an indigenous thrips of southern Australia. It is known as a predator of two-spotted mite. This project investigated various biological characteristics of H. victoriensis as a precursor to its potential use in biological control. In addition, H. victoriensis is very difficult to distinguish from other Haplothrips species in terms of morphology, especially as there are no keys to larvae. DNA barcoding and morphology of the larval stages are used to address these issues. The thesis is divided into seven chapters comprising an introduction, four main research chapters, conclusion and reference chapters. Chapter 2 covers the culturing techniques for H. victoriensis. Some new cases and rearing processes were designed to culture H. victoriensis and its prey. These were following series of rearing techniques investigated including rearing H. victoriensis for egg collection, H. victoriensis larvae and adults for biological and morphological observations, mass rearing of H. victoriensis, WFT and Tyrophagus mites, and rearing WFT for egg collection. Predatory H. victoriensis was reared in the laboratory with various diets of honey, pollen, Tyrophagus mites and western flower thrips (WFT). Chapter 3 investigates the biological development of H. victoriensis, including egg, larva, prepupa, pupa and adult stages. Haplothrips victoriensis fed with 10% honey solution, mixed pollen and Tyrophagus eggs took about 16-22 days to develop from eggs to adults at 25 oC. Developmental times of immature H. victoriensis varied when fed on different food sources. The longevity of H. victoriensis was significantly different with different diets. Chapter 4 examines predatory and cannibalistic characteristics and consumption of H. victoriensis on various prey. Haplothrips victoriensis was found to feed on many kinds of common prey; Two spotted mite (TSM), Tyrophagus mite, WFT, spotted alfalfa aphid, greenhouse whitefly and diamond back moth but not on ash whitefly. Importantly, H. victoriensis was also found to be cannibalistic which might affect population fluctuations in the laboratory and in the field. Chapter 5 examines the ecology and hosts of H. victoriensis in South Australia and taxonomy of H. victoriensis and some other Haplothrips species being similar to H. victoriensis. Haplothrips victoriensis was found to live on flowers from a range of different plant families. Morphological characteristics of the immature stages of H. victoriensis and a key developed to separate common Haplothrips in S.A. As well, COI was used to possibly identify H. victoriensis and its morphologically similar taxa and investigate whether H. victoriensis is a single species or perhaps contains cryptic species. None of the specimens of H. victoriensis included in the analyses showed any variation in COI indicating a single species for horticultural areas in S.A. Chapter 6 provides an overall discussion of the main results and indicates areas of future research.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Haplothrips victoriensis; tubular black thrips; thrips rearing; thrips biology; phylogenetics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60950</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling cardiac activation from cell to body surface</field><field name="creator">Buist, Martin L.</field><field name="description">In this thesis, the forward problem of electrocardiography is investigated from a cellular level through to potentials on the surface of the torso. This integrated modelling framework is based on three spatial scales. At the smallest spatial resolution, several cardiac cellular models are implemented that are used to represent the underlying cellular electrophysiology. A bidomain framework is used to couple multiple individual cells together and this provides a mathematical model of the myocardial tissue. The cardiac geometry is described using finite elements with high order cubic Hermite basis function interpolation. An anatomically based description of the fibrous laminar cardiac microstructure is then defined relative to the geometric mesh. Within the local element space of the cardiac finite elements, a fine collocation mesh is created on which the bidomain equations are solved. Each collocation point represents a continuum cell and contains a cellular model to describe the local active processes. This bidomain implementation works in multiple coordinate systems and over deforming domains, in addition to having the ability to spatially vary any parameter throughout the myocardium. On the largest spatial scale the passive torso regions surrounding the myocardium are modelled using a generalised Laplace equation to describe the potential field and current flows. The torso regions are discretised using either finite elements or boundary elements depending on the electrical properties of each region. The cardiac region is coupled to the surrounding torso through several methods. A traditional dipole source approach is implemented that creates equivalent cardiac sources through the summation of cellular dipoles. These dipoles are then placed within a homogeneous cardiac region and the resulting potential field is calculated throughout the torso. Two new coupling techniques are developed that provide a more direct path from cellular activation to body surface potentials. One approach assembles all of the equations from the passive torso regions and the equations from the extracellular bidomain region into a single matrix system. Coupling conditions based on the continuity of potential and current flow across the myocardial surfaces are used to couple the regions and therefore solving the matrix system yields a solution that is continuous across all of the solution points within the torso. The second approach breaks the large system into smaller subproblems and the continuity conditions are iii iv imposed through an iterative approach. Across each of the myocardial surfaces, a fixed point iteration is set up with the goal of converging towards zero potential and current flow differences between adjacent regions. All of the numerical methods used within the integrated modelling framework are rigorously tested individually before extensive tests are performed on the coupling techniques. Large scale simulations are run to test the dipole source approach against the new coupling techniques. Several sets of simulations are run to investigate the effects of using different ionic current models, using different bidomain model simplifications, and the role that the torso inhomogeneities play in generating body surface potentials. The main question to be answered by this study is whether or not the traditional approach of combining a monodomain heart with an equivalent cardiac source in a two step approach is adequate when generating body surface potentials. Comparisons between the fully coupled framework developed here and several dipole based approaches demonstrate that the resulting sets of signals have different magnitudes and different waveform shapes on both the torso and epicardial surface, clearly illustrating the inadequacy of the equivalent cardiac source models. It has been found that altering the modelling assumptions on each spatial scale produces noticeable effects. At the smallest scale, the use of different cell models leads to significantly different body surface potential traces. At the next scale the monodomain approach is unable to accurately reproduce the results from a full bidomain framework, and at the largest level the inclusion of different torso inhomogeneities has a large effect on the magnitude of the torso and epicardial potentials. Adding a pair of lungs to the torso model changes the epicardial potentials by an average of 16% which is consistent with the experimental range of between 8 and 20%. This provides evidence that only a complex, coupled, biophysically based model will be able to properly reproduce clinical ECGs.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291500 Biomedical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2133</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of Ligand Selectivity, Receptor Trafficking and Novel Cell Models for the Cannabinoid CB2 Receptor</field><field name="creator">Goodfellow, Catherine</field><field name="description">A participation of the cannabinoid system in many pathological processes has been defined. More recently the importance of the Cannabinoid Receptor 2 (CB2) in inflammatory reactions of the central and peripheral nervous systems has drawn interest. In vivo evidence suggests targeting the CB2 receptor therapeutically could aid in prevention of inflammatory mediated neurodegeneration and pain management. Thorough pharmacological characterisation of the CB2 receptor is necessary for our understanding of the specific role this target plays in both the periphery and the central nervous system. Therefore, this thesis is concerned with the investigation of the activation, regulation and expression pattern of human CB2 receptors. Activation of the CB2 receptor was investigated through the search for potent, CB2 selective agonists. A series of compounds, based on the previously reported HU-308 structure, were screened for binding and activity at human CB2 receptors through radioligand binding displacement and cAMP assays. Only one of these compounds, HU-910, exhibited a higher efficacy than HU-308 and no compounds matched the potency of the lead drug although several CB2 selective partial agonists were identified. These compounds may prove useful for future in vivo assessment of the therapeutic potential of CB2 agonism. Receptor desensitisation by internalisation is a problem encountered with chronic drug treatment both in vivo and in vitro. However, the agonist induced regulation of the CB2 receptor has been poorly explored in the literature, prompting characterisation of the fundamental properties of the CB2 receptor trafficking with direct evidence of agonist induced internalisation and receptor recycling demonstrated here for the first time. Association of the trafficking Rabs 5 and 11 but not 4 were implicated in this process. Rab5 appears to be involved in the sequestering of CB2 receptors from the cell surface and Rab11 in their re-delivery after agonist induced internalisation. This is the first comprehensive investigation of CB2 receptor trafficking. Finally, a model of the expression of these receptors was pursued using human derived Ntera2/D1 (NT2) cells. NT2 cells were differentiated into neurons and astrocytes and evaluated for their potential to act as a model of human cannabinoid receptor functioning in the central nervous system. In particular, we wished to determine if these cells could provide a model system for the investigation of CB2 function on astrocytes. While functional expression of CB1 receptors by neuronal cells was detected, the presence of either cannabinoid receptor could only be detected at the mRNA level in astrocytes. This agrees with recent in vivo expression profiles of these receptors in the normal human brain. The ability of NT2 derived cells to model neuronal cell types was validated here but their astrocytic properties were questioned and an immature phenotype is suggested due to their expression of several markers of neural precursors. This thesis has therefore characterised fundamental properties of the CB2 receptor in order to advance the search for CB2 selective ligands, understand the trafficking of the receptor and develop appropriate human cell models with the intention of informing future research and the development of CB2 targeted therapeutics.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5841</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Totara Valley micro-hydro development : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Applied Science in Renewable Energy Engineering, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Donnelly, David Ronald</field><field name="description">This study focuses on the design, construction and operation of a distributed generation system based on micro-hydro technology. The project is sited in the Totara Valley, a small rural community approximately 70km from the Massey University, Turitea campus, Palmerston North. The Massey University Centre for Energy Research (MUCER) has a long history of renewable energy research within the Totara Valley community. This project complements these existing schemes and provides a foundation for future research into distributed generation technologies. The project encompasses the following objectives: - to gain practical experience in the design, engineering and implementation of a distributed generation system in rural New Zealand; - to evaluate contemporary micro-hydro technology and compare the performance of this equipment in a theoretical and practical context; - to identify barriers that hinder the widespread adoption of micro-hydro systems in rural New Zealand; - to develop a spreadsheet based life cycle costing tool. The results from this study demonstrate that economic considerations are the fundamental aspect to be considered when assessing the long-term viability of these projects. The viability of micro-hydro projects are primarily determined by four factors: - the volume and head (height) of water available above the turbine site; - the length and therefore the cost of the pipeline required for transporting water to the turbine; - the legal and administrative costs involved in obtaining a resource consent to maintain access to the water resources; - the prices received and paid for electricity. Considerable charges were payable to the local authority to secure and maintain the right to harness the water resources at this site. This cost contributed considerable risk to the project and creates a significant barrier to establishing similar systems at other sites. The reduction of resource consent charges to levels that fairly reflect the negligible environmental impacts of these projects would encourage the adoption of this technology and deliver benefits to rural New Zealand communities.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">micro-hydro technology</field><field name="subject">distributed generation system</field><field name="subject">renewable energy</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">construction</field><field name="subject">viability</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291100 Environmental Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/695</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The electronic, structural, and magnetic properties of the chromium dihalides - from the gas-phase to the solid-state : a thesis submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements of the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Theoretical Chemistry at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Vest, Brian Michael</field><field name="description">Unrestricted Kohn-Sham (broken symmetry) density functional calculations have been used to determine the low-energy geometries of the chromium dihalide molecules (CrX2) and their clusters, Cr2X4, Cr3X6, and Cr4X8. The monomers are also investigated at a higher level, including coupled-cluster and state-average CASSCF computations. Our calculations show that the monomers have a 5B2 ground state arising from the Renner-Teller distorted 5IIg transition state, leading to a bent geometry. The global minima of the gas-phase clusters of CrF2 and CrCl2 consist of two-dimensional, anti-ferromagnetically coupled chains of CrX2 units forming four-membered, doubly bridged Cr2X2 rings, closely resembling their solid-state structures. The global minima of the CrBr2 and CrI2 clusters consist of the same two-dimensional chain-like structures for their dimers, but their trimers and tetramers consist of three-dimensional &#8217;triangular&#8217; structures which contain two capping ligands bound to three chromium atoms along with a Cr-Cr bond. Each Cr atom within these clusters has spin quantum number S=2. There is approximately a constant change in energy, between 45-55 kcal/mol, with every new CrX2 unit during cluster formation. Information about the structure of the CrCl2 clusters is used in the reanalysis of high-temperature electron diffraction data. The vapor at 1170 K contains about 77% monomeric molecules, 19% dimers, and a small amount of trimers. Monomeric CrCl2 is found to be bent with a bond angle of 149(10)degrees, in good agreement with our computations. Solid-state DFT calculations are performed on alpha-CrCl2 to determine the lattice structure and spin-coupling constants for the Cr atoms within the crystals. The GGA (PW91) method produces a structure in good agreement with the literature. In the lowest energy structure, the spins of the Cr atoms within the chains along the crystallographic c-axis are anti-ferromagnetically coupled with four parallel spins situated almost exclusively in the d-bands of Cr along these chains. This anti-ferromagnetic coupling is also seen in the CrX2 clusters.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chromium dihalides</field><field name="subject">Properties</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences::250600 Theoretical and Computational Chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/744</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Lady, is this civilisation?' : a case study of community participation in a health development programme in Aotearoa New Zealand : a thesis presented in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Development Studies at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Batten, Lesley Susan</field><field name="description">Community participation is a key feature of major global health declarations and a fundamental principle of health strategies in Aotearoa New Zealand. However, the frequency with which it is espoused belies the complexities associated with its practical application. Engaging communities in primary health care programmes designed to improve their health has been identified as a major challenge. This study&#8217;s objective was to explore community members&#8217; perspectives of participation within a health development programme. The programme chosen aimed to increase the fruit and vegetable intake of targeted population groups, including M ori, Pacific peoples, and low income earners. A qualitative instrumental case study approach was adopted to examine the programme and investigate what influenced, constrained, and sustained community participation. Data collection included fieldwork over an eighteen-month period. Two programme projects were selected as the study foci: a communityled project involving distributions of thousands of free heritage variety plants; and, instigated by health services, a project establishing community gardens. These projects provided markedly different pictures of participation occurring within the same programme. The plant distributions had widespread appeal, while the community garden faltered. Community participation fitted within a description of &#8216;focused social action&#8217;. Participation was motivated by needs, values, and interests. While some were personal and family based, the programme also became an imagined vehicle for addressing wider health, social justice, and environmental sustainability goals. Ongoing challenges related to defining targeted communities and groups, varying degrees and types of participation, and different perspectives of participation, especially as health sector staff worked from an equity mandate and community members spoke of equality. Programme groups established as mechanisms to foster community participation had contradictory effects, engaging some as advisors, while failing to reach communities targeted for the programme. The complexities of health sector bureaucracy both enabled and constrained the programme and community participation. This thesis provides an in-depth examination of the complexities of community participation in action, the contradictory effects of contexts enveloping programmes, and the resolve of community members. It increases our understandings of how community members perceive health programmes and community participation, which are critical factors in improving population health.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">community participation</field><field name="subject">primary health care programmes</field><field name="subject">disadvantaged communities</field><field name="subject">Maori and Pacific</field><field name="subject">health promotion</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">fruit and vegetable intake</field><field name="subject">community gardens</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321216 Health promotion</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/886</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Organicism, motivic parallelism, and performance in Beethoven's piano sonata Op. 2 No. 3 : a thesis submitted to the New Zealand School of Music in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master  of Music in Musicology</field><field name="creator">Robb, Hamish James Alexander</field><field name="description">This thesis summarises the important ideologies and concepts of musical organicism in the late eighteenth century and applies them to motivic analysis and performance. Much has been written about the organic nature of Beethoven&#8217;s later works, but less has been written about the organic coherence found in his earlier compositions. This study involves a motivic analysis of his Op. 2 No. 3 sonata (1795), for which little or no significant research has been carried out. This musical work is used as an illustration of ways in which musical organicism, motivic analysis, and performance can interrelate. The thesis is in three parts. Part one presents a review of late eighteenth-century ideologies of unity and their musical applications. In the search for an effective means of comparing motivic development with organicism, it is then argued that Schenker&#8217;s &#8216;motivic parallelism&#8217; or &#8216;concealed repetition&#8217; is considerably undervalued in his analytical framework. Drawing on the insights of Richard Cohn, I endorse a more autonomous treatment of the motivic parallelism in analysis, so that it is an independent unifying tool in its own right and not only a by-product of tonal analysis. Several approaches are applied to the motivic parallelism in order to illustrate how the parallelism can be used in ways normally only associated with the surface motif. Part two of the thesis consists of a detailed motivic analysis of Beethoven&#8217;s Op. 2 No. 3 sonata. It is argued that the motivic parallelisms contained in this sonata reflect late eighteenth-century ideals of organicism. I propose that there are several motivic cells found in the opening four bars of the sonata, which recur (or are &#8216;paralleled&#8217;) within all structural levels and over all four movements, unifying the sonata organically as one whole. In this way, I show that the Op. 2 No. 3 sonata can be seen to foreshadow the organic treatment of motifs by later composers, who were influenced by Goethe&#8217;s complex prototype (1802) as an organic model.(1) I also offer an &#8216;organic narrative&#8217; for the sonata, using motivic parallelisms as the guiding forces in the discourse. The third and final part relates the motivic parallelisms and other analytical findings to performance. Techniques of &#8216;performing&#8217; motivic parallelisms are discussed and applied to the Op. 2 No. 3 sonata. The organic perspective is proposed as one avenue through which to understand and enhance a performance of a work.  (1) The sonata can also be seen to foreshadow the highly seminal treatment of motifs that was to become more widely used in Beethoven&#8217;s later works (such as the Eroica Symphony).</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">motivic analysis</field><field name="subject">organic narrative</field><field name="subject">eighteenth-century music</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410100 Performing Arts Studies::410101 Music studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1000</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Enhancing the SME NPD process through customer focused design activities: a New Zealand case study</field><field name="creator">McIntyre, James</field><field name="description">Small to Medium Enterprises (SMEs) face enormous financial risk when embarking on a new product launch. SMEs are less likely to implement more formal risk minimization strategies for new product development (NPD) such as StageGate, often citing reasons of resource constraints or the more prevalent notion that &#8220;this stuff doesn&#8217;t apply to us&#8221;. Two key elements of any such risk minimization strategies are an early emphasis on benchmarking competitors and a thorough study of the attitudes and behaviours of potential customers. The SME&#8217;s investment of time and resource in early acquisition of this knowledge is a critical factor for success (Cooper 2001). Armed with this information, the SME is able to adopt a Customer Focused Design (CFD) strategy, whereby the product development effort is remains focused on the external customers wants and needs through all phases. SMEs that are able to satisfy these needs more effectively enjoy an obvious competitive advantage (Matzler and Hinterhuber 1998; L&#252;thje 2004). SMEs are often challenged by these tasks (Freel 2000; Larsen and Lewis 2007; Owens 2007). They may be overwhelmed by the prospect of expected costs, lack of expertise, and financial pressures to rush to market. Too often the more conventional path is chosen, whereby a solution is proposed, developed and tested in the market to &#8220;see if it sticks&#8221;. Such methodologies are less effective and subject the SME to increased financial risk. International studies of SMEs attitudes and behaviour towards NPD reveal common challenges of resource limitations, skills deficiencies and organizational issues (Xueli, Soutar et al. 2002; de Jong and Vermeulen 2006; Siu, Lin et al. 2006; Murphy and Ledwith 2007; Owens 2007). New Zealand firms are no exception, and are burdened with similar challenges as their international counterparts. This study aims to propose a simple framework for small firms who wish to acquire knowledge about their target markets and potential customers with limited time and resources. The framework enables SMEs to incorporate customer focused design principles into their product definition phase, and better orient themselves to the consumer marketplace. The study makes use of a New Zealand based case study to evaluate how the framework may be employed to identify quick and inexpensive efforts that can reproduce some elements of more sophisticated CFD and benchmarking methods. The obtained results are incorporated into a product design specification and embodied into a physical prototype to further illuminate the process. In addition to the primary area of study, prospects for new adjacent product lines and new potential markets for future development are also gained from the research.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">small business</field><field name="subject">new product development</field><field name="subject">market research</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1073</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the antioxidant activity of milk proteins in model oil-in-water emulsions : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Food Technology, Riddet Institute, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ries, Daniel</field><field name="description">The present study was aimed at extending our knowledge of the antioxidative properties of the milk protein products, whey protein isolate (WPI) and sodium caseinate (NaCas), in oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). In particular, the objective was to contribute to our understanding of the compositional and processing factors that influence the oxidative stability of protein-stabilised O/W emulsions. Linoleic acid (approximately 60 %) was used as the lipid for the oil phase (10.6 %). The emulsion samples were usually incubated at 50 &#176;C to accelerate lipid oxidation. Lipid oxidation indicators were lipid hydroperoxides and headspace hexanal, determined by solid phase microextraction (SPME) combined with gas chromatography (GC). WPI- or NaCas-stabilised emulsions were prepared using a wide range of protein concentrations (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 7.0 or 10.0 %) at two droplet sizes (d32 = 0.31 and 0.65 &#181;m). In general, higher lipid oxidation levels were found for the larger droplet size. Increasing protein concentration led to a decrease in the lipid oxidation rate. The greatest decrease in lipid hydroperoxide levels (values after 4 h) occurred at up to 4.0 % protein concentration. The greatest decrease in hexanal levels (values after 24 h) occurred at up to 4.0 % protein concentration in WPI emulsions (0.31 &#181;m). The hexanal levels were more independent of the protein concentration in the other emulsion types. The hexanal level decreased at protein concentrations &gt; 4.0 % in NaCas emulsions (0.31 and 0.65 &#181;m) and at protein concentrations &gt; 7.0 % in WPI emulsions (0.65 &#181;m). The difference between lipid hydroperoxide generation in emulsions with small and large droplet sizes decreased with increasing protein concentration. This effect was more pronounced in NaCas emulsions. In general, NaCas was a better inhibitor of lipid oxidation than WPI, but WPI appeared to be the better antioxidant at some droplet size/protein concentration combinations. The protein in the continuous phase, i.e. the unadsorbed protein, played an important role in lipid oxidation. In principal, the lipid hydroperoxide and hexanal levels showed the same development over the continuous phase protein concentration as over the protein concentration in WPI and NaCas emulsions (d32 = 0.31 &#181;m). A low NaCas level in the continuous phase already led to a relatively low hexanal level, whereas a higher WPI level was required. When NaCas solution was added to a WPI emulsion or WPI solution was added to a NaCas emulsion, a synergistic antioxidative effect was observed. The high molecular weight fractions (molecular weight = 12000-14000) of WPI and NaCas contained pro-oxidative metal ions that contributed to lipid oxidation in the emulsions. An enrichment of NaCas emulsions with the low molecular weight fraction of NaCas (with a molecular weight = 12000-14000) notably inhibited lipid oxidation. An enrichment of WPI emulsions with the low molecular weight fraction of WPI (with a molecular weight = 12000-14000) also seemed to inhibit lipid oxidation, but the effect was not significant. The protein solutions were enriched with these fractions before emulsion preparation. Pure WPI solution or mixed WPI/NaCas (1:1, weight/weight) solution with 1.12 or 2.24 % protein concentration was heated at 84 &#176;C for up to 40 min, cooled and then used to prepare emulsions. Lipid oxidation was generally not affected by the heat treatment or the degree of whey protein denaturation. However, at the lower WPI concentration, more hexanal was produced for the longer heating times (20, 30 and 40 min) and this appeared to be connected with the physical instability of the emulsions. Greater oxidative stability was found at the higher protein concentration and when the proteins were mixed, pointing to a possible synergistic antioxidative effect of WPI and NaCas. The addition of the free radical source 2,2&#8217;-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH) greatly increased the oxygen uptake and the generation of lipid hydroperoxides in the emulsions. The oxidative stability increased with increasing protein concentration (1.0, 4.0 and 7.0 %). NaCas had a greater antioxidative effect than WPI. The inhibition of oxygen uptake appeared to be largely influenced by the free-radical-scavenging activity of the system, determined by the protein type and the protein concentration, as the radicals were produced linearly over time and oxygen was consumed linearly over time. It can therefore be concluded that free-radical-scavenging activity represents a major antioxidative mechanism of the milk proteins. Oxygen was consumed much faster in emulsions than in protein solutions when the same level of AAPH was incorporated. In a WPI (1.0 % protein) emulsion, much lower levels of protein hydroperoxides than of lipid hydroperoxides developed. This pointed to a much greater reactivity of linoleic acid than of the milk proteins with oxygen. In contrast, the exposure of WPI to oxidising linoleic acid in an emulsion (1.0 % protein) or to AAPH in aqueous solution led to oxidative damage of the whey proteins, indicated by the loss of amino acids. The loss of specific amino acids was different for proteins in the continuous phase or cream phase of an emulsion or in WPI solution. The present study confirms the antioxidative potential of WPI and NaCas and gives new insights into their functionality as oxidative stabilisers in O/W emulsions.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">whey protein isolate</field><field name="subject">sodium caseinate</field><field name="subject">lipid oxidation</field><field name="subject">oxidative stabilisers</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290101 Fermentation, biotechnology and industrial microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1084</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Behaviour of milk protein-stabilized oil-in-water emulsions in simulated physiological fluids : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Food Technology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Sarkar, Anwesha</field><field name="description">Emulsions form a major part of processed food formulations, either being the end products in themselves or as parts of a more complex food system. For the past few decades, colloid scientists have focussed mainly on the effects of processing conditions (e.g. heat, high pressure, and shear) on the physicochemical properties of emulsions (e.g. viscosity, droplet size distribution and phase stability). However, the information about the behaviour of food structures post consumption is very limited. Fundamental knowledge of how the food structures behave in the mouth is critical, as these oral interactions of food components influence the common sensorial perceptions (e.g. creaminess, smoothness) and the release of fat-soluble flavours. Initial studies also suggest that the breakdown of emulsions in the gastrointestinal tract and the generated interfacial structures impact lipid digestion, which can consequently influence post-prandial metabolic responses. This area of research needs to be intensively investigated before the knowledge can be applied to rational design of healthier food structures that could modulate the rate of lipid metabolism, bioavailability of nutrients, and also help in providing targeted delivery of flavour molecules and/or bioactive components. Hence, the objective of this research was to gain understanding of how emulsions behave during their passage through the gastrointestinal tract. In vitro digestion models that mimic the physicochemical processes and biological conditions in the mouth and gastrointestinal tract were successfully employed. Behaviour of model protein-stabilized emulsions (both positively charged (lactoferrin) as well as negatively charged [&#946;-lactoglobulin (&#946;-lg)] oil-in-water emulsions) at each step of simulated physiological processing (using model oral, gastric and duodenal fluids individually) were investigated. In simulated mouth conditions, oil-in-water emulsions stabilized by lactoferrin or &#946;-lg at the interfacial layers were mixed with artificial saliva at neutral pH that contained a range of mucin concentrations and salts. The &#946;-lg emulsions did not interact with the artificial saliva due to the dominant repulsion between mutually opposite charges of anionic mucin and anionic &#946;-lg interfacial layer at neutral pH. However, &#946;-lg emulsions underwent some depletion flocculation on addition of higher concentrations of mucin due to the presence of unadsorbed mucin molecules in the continuous phase. In contrast, positively charged lactoferrin emulsions showed considerable salt-induced aggregation in the presence of salts (from the saliva) alone. Furthermore, lactoferrin emulsions underwent bridging flocculation because of electrostatic binding of anionic mucin to the positively charged lactoferrin-stabilized emulsion droplets. In acidic pH conditions (pH 1.2) of the simulated gastric fluid (SGF), both protein-stabilized emulsions were positively charged. Addition of pepsin resulted in extensive droplet flocculation in both emulsions with a greater extent of droplet instability in lactoferrin emulsions. Coalescence of the droplets was observed as a result of peptic hydrolysis of the interfacial protein layers. Conditions such as ionic strength, pH and exposure to mucin were shown to significantly influence the rate of hydrolysis of &#946;-lg-stabilized emulsion by pepsin. Addition of simulated intestinal fluid (SIF) containing physiological concentrations of bile salts to the emulsions showed competitive interfacial displacement of &#946;-lg by bile salts. In the case of lactoferrin-stabilized emulsion droplets, there was considerable aggregation in the presence of intestinal electrolytes alone (without added bile salts) at pH 7.5. Binding of anionic bile salts to cationic interfacial lactoferrin layer resulted in re-stabilization of salt-aggregated lactoferrin emulsions. On mixing with physiological concentrations of pancreatin (mixture of pancreatic lipase, amylase and protease), significant degree of coalescence and fatty acid release occurred for both the emulsions. This was attributed to the interfacial proteolysis by trypsin (proteolytic fractions of pancreatin) resulting in interfacial film rupturing. Exchange of initial interfacial materials by bile salts and trypsin-induced film breakage enhanced the potential for lipolytic fractions of pancreatin to act on the hydrophobic lipid core. The lipid digestion products (free fatty acids and mono and/or diglycerides) generated at the droplet surface further removed the residual intact protein layers from the interface by competitive displacement mechanisms. The sequential treatment of the cationic and anionic emulsions with artificial saliva, SGF and SIF, respectively, was determined to understand the impact of initial protein type during complete physiological processing from mouth to intestine. Broadly, both the protein-stabilized emulsions underwent charge reversals, extensive droplet flocculation, and significant coalescence as they passed through various stages of the in vitro digestion conditions. Except in the simulated mouth environment, the initial charge of the emulsifiers had relatively limited influence on droplet behaviour during the simulated digestion. The results contribute to the knowledge of how structure and charge of the emulsified lipid droplets impact digestion at various stages of physiology. This information might have important consequences for developing suitable microstructures that allow controlled breakdown of droplets in the mouth and predictable release of lipids in the gastrointestinal tract.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Milk protein</field><field name="subject">Emulsions</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290103 Food processing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1409</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Functional analysis of a thiamine biosynthetic gene in the interaction of Epichlo&#235; typhina with perennial ryegrass : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Molecular Genetics at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Xiuwen</field><field name="description">Appendix content (raw data and statistics; sequences) unavailable online, but available with print copy</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Endophytic fungi</field><field name="subject">Epichlo&#235;</field><field name="subject">Genetics</field><field name="subject">Perennial ryegrass</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270200 Genetics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1717</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of feeding willow upon the death of established parasites and upon parasite fecundity : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Animal Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Mupeyo, Bornwell</field><field name="description">Two indoor feeding experiments were conducted at the Animal Physiology Unit (APU) of Massey University, involving young sheep, to investigate the effect of feeding forage willow upon the death of established parasites and upon parasite fecundity, using chaffed lucerne as the control diet. Experiment 1: Twenty-four (24) parasite-free weaned hoggets weighing 29.9 &#177;1.2 kg (SD) were individually penned and fed chaffed lucerne ad libitum during a preexperimental adaption period of 5 weeks. They were then fed either lucerne chaff or chopped willow for a further 5 weeks (n = 12/group) and intakes were adjusted such that the DMI of the two groups was similar during weeks 9 &amp; 10. All lambs were infected with L3 larvae parasites comprising 20,650 Teladorsagia, 1,320 Trichostrongylus and 330 Cooperia through oral drenching 12 days before willow feeding started. This was done after confirmation that the sheep were free of nematodes through FEC analysis. Total faeces were collected for 3 day periods towards the end of weeks 9 &amp; 10, to measure diet digestibility and total faecal egg excretion. The sheep were slaughtered at the end of week 10. Voluntary feed intake (VFI), FEC and liveweight were measured weekly, whilst burdens of individual parasites and carcass characteristics were measured after slaughter. Duplicate samples of each feed offered and individual animal refusals were taken daily and pooled weekly per animal for chemical analysis. Female worm fecundity was calculated by two methods. Blood samples for immunological analysis were collected on days 20, 34, 51 and 70, and analysed for components of white blood cells (WBC) and for lymphocyte subsets. Experiment 2: A 2 x 2 changeover experiment was conducted, involving two time periods (Period 1 and Period 2 each of 14 days) with the same diets as used in Experiment 1, fed to 9 individually penned parasite-free young sheep randomly allocated to experimental diets. The parameters investigated were FEC and larvae hatching. Initially, a period of 7 days was allowed for acclimatisation in which both groups were fed on half willow and half lucerne chaff. This was followed by Period 1 with 4 lambs fed lucerne and 5 fed willow, after which the diets were changed over for Period 2. Total faeces produced were collected from all animals on the last day of each period using bagged sheep. A known number of Teladorsagia eggs (500 epg) was then added to faecal samples from these sheep and faeces-egg mixtures were made from which FEC was determined, to see if egg recovery was affected by these diets. Faecal samples for Period 2 with added eggs were also incubated for 10 days to measure hatchability. The recovery of added Teladorsagia eggs in Experiment 2 was 85% in lucerne-fed lambs and 53% willow-fed lambs (P&lt;0.001); these were used as correction factors for Experiment 1 data. Larvae that hatched per gram of wet faeces in Experiment 2 tended to be lower for sheep fed willow than lucerne chaff (71% vs 83% of eggs added; P=0.08). Willow feed offered had lower DM (P&lt;0.001) and CP (P&lt;0.05) content, but had a significantly higher OM content (P&lt;0.01) than lucerne chaff. Condensed tannin content of chopped willow was 27 g/kg DM, with only traces for lucerne. Apparent digestibility for DM (62.4% vs 59.5%; P&#8804;0.05), OM (64.8% vs 59.9%; P&#8804;0.001), DOMD (58.1% vs 55.0%; P&#8804;0.01) and calculated ME (9.48 MJ/kg vs 8.96 MJ/kg; P&#8804;0.01) were higher for the willow diet. VFI was similar for both groups during the adaption period (P&gt;0.05) but declined with the introduction of willow in week 6 (P&lt;0.001) and then progressively increased until it was similar to lucerne-fed sheep in weeks 9 &amp; 10 (P&gt;0.05). Calculated DM intake per head/day during the last two weeks of Experiment 1 was similar for the two groups (P&gt;0.05); while the willow group had higher ME (P&lt;0.01) and CP (P&lt;0.001) intake per animal/day. Liveweight increased for the two groups during the adaption period (P&gt;0.05), then declined for willow-fed lambs in week 6 (P&lt;0.001) but later increased and by week 10 was similar to that of lucerne-fed lambs. The willow-fed lambs had lower carcass GR than the lucerne-fed lambs (P&lt;0.01) when carcass weight was used as a covariate. Adjusted total daily egg production in Experiment 1 was lower in willow-fed sheep than lucerne-fed sheep, due to reductions for Haemonchus spp. (P&lt;0.05) and Teladorsagia spp. (P&lt;0.05). The per capita fecundity for Haemonchus worm spp. (P&lt;0.05) and the in utero fecundity in both abomasal Teladorsagia spp. and small intestinal Trichostrongylus spp. (P&lt;0.001) were lower for willow-fed sheep. There was reduced production of larvae for both Haemonchus spp. and Teladorsagia spp. (P&lt;0.05) in willow-fed sheep. Feeding willow reduced the burden of Haemonchus adult worms in the abomasum (P&lt;0.01) but reduced female worm burden only in Teladorsagia spp. (P&lt;0.05) and reduced Cooperia spp. in the small intestines (P&lt;0.01). Total WBC, total lymphocytes, subsets of lymphocytes and other white-cell groups were not affected by willow feeding (P&gt;0.1). It was concluded that feeding chopped willow to young sheep reduced nematode worm burdens in the abomasum, especially both male and female Haemonchus spp., and reduced female worm burdens of Teladorsagia spp. Female worm fecundity of both species was also reduced by willow feeding. These reductions have been associated with CT content in the willow feed and the reduced worm burdens have been attributed to the death of the established worms by CT, since there was no evidence of immune priming in willow-fed sheep. Compounds present in the faeces of willow-fed sheep have been found to mask some of the nematode eggs, making them invisible by microscopic examination while keeping their viability. It is postulated that this could be due to binding of nematode eggs to insoluble CT associated with indigestible fibre in the faeces of willow-fed sheep. Conventional methods of measuring FEC therefore underestimated nematode eggs present in the faeces of willow-fed sheep and this needs to be checked for other CT-containing forages.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sheep fodder</field><field name="subject">Lucerne</field><field name="subject">Teladorsagia</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300500 Veterinary Medicine::300508 Parasitology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1712</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Polycultural capital and the Pasifika second generation : negotiating identities in diasporic spaces : a thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Sociology at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Mila-Schaaf, Karlo</field><field name="description">This research examines the ways in which the Pasifika second generation who have grown up in Aotearoa are operating culturally and explores the conditions in which they construct identities. The study took a positive deviance approach focusing on existing strengths within the Pasifika generation and learning from success. Taking a sequential explanatory mixed-methods approach, the project analysed data from the Youth2000 Survey, which included over one thousand Pasifika participants (n=1114). This showed that pride in Pasifika identities, reporting that Pasifika values were still important, feeling accepted by other people within one&#8217;s own ethnic group and outside it, and continuing to speak Pasifika languages were all associated positively with advantageous health, educational or wellbeing variables. Individual interviews with fourteen high-achieving, second generation Pasifika professionals, further explored connections between identity, acceptance and belonging. Second generation participants talked about performing identities across many spaces of symbolic interaction where they were called into relation with multiple others. These were local, cross-cultural, national and transnational relational spaces made possible via migration, diaspora, and relocation resulting in complex negotiations of sameness and difference. In these spaces they encountered competing narratives about who Pasifika peoples ought to be. The diasporic second generation often had to negotiate belonging from beyond the limits of what was validated as having most symbolic authority. Symbolic struggle and the politics of cultural reproduction came to the fore, as did the contested nature of Pasifika imaginaries. Identifications were further complicated by demands for crosscultural coherence and legibility across spaces, and shifting politics of recognition. Polycultural capital was coined to describe the ability to accumulate culturally diverse symbolic resources, negotiate between them and strategically deploy different cultural resources in contextually specific and advantageous ways. Performing strategic essentialism, strategic ignorance, strategic hybridity, dialogic distance, and bridging, were just some of the patterns identified. Manulua describes an aesthetic of shifting multidimensional cultural resolutions across many spaces in-between.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pacific Islanders</field><field name="subject">Ethnic identity</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370100 Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1713</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Te whare-oohia : traditional Maaori education for a contemporary world : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of Education at Massey University, Palmerston North, Aotearoa New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Melbourne, Na Taiarahia</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1714</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An empirical study of important dimensions of new product development practices in small to medium enterprises in New Zealand : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Masters in Engineering in Product Development at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Metikurke, Sushrutha V.</field><field name="description">The New Zealand innovation sector is dominated by Small to Medium Enterprises (SMEs). SMEs make up more than 97% of all businesses and account for about 30% of total employment. There is, however, limited research available on the New Product Development practices of these companies. For New Zealand to compete with major economies of the world, investment in innovation is paramount. This can be achieved by effective management of New Product Development practices and systems. This report presents findings of the research based on the &#8220;Establishing an NPD best practices framework&#8221; survey which was designed to conduct similar studies in the US, UK and Ireland (Kahn, Barczak and Moss 2006). The study identified seven dimensions of New Product Development practices &#8211; strategy, process, research, project climate, company culture, metrics &amp; performance measurement and commercialisation. The survey was designed to measure the relative importance of each of the seven dimensions. The survey further listed various characteristics under each of the seven dimensions and respondents were asked to identify which of these constituted poor, good, better and best practices. Strategy was ranked the highest among the seven dimensions followed by commercialisation, research, company culture, process, project climate and metrics. The results were broadly consistent with those from the US, UK and Ireland which ranked strategy the highest and metrics the lowest. Commercialisation was ranked the second most important dimension where as in the US, UK and Ireland studies, research was ranked above commercialisation. Respondents indicated that a formal strategy helped reduce processing time. Decisions were taken quickly because the head of the firm was directly involved in the product development process. A vision statement for the company which incorporates NPD was also cited as an important part of the overall NPD strategy. This includes &#8220;well-defined NPD goals and long-term strategic support for NPD projects&#8221;. The study also considered the characteristics of the seven dimensions of NPD. Respondents were asked to review those characteristics and indicate whether they reflected a Poor, Good, Better or Best NPD practice. The US, UK and Ireland samples indicated that poor practices were more well-known than best practices were each of the seven dimensions. There was one significant difference between NZ results and those from the US, UK and Ireland. NZ professionals identified best practices for the Metrics dimension. This indicated that even though Metrics as a dimension ranked the lowest among the seven for NZ professionals, there was a general awareness of the characteristics that constitute best and poor practices for this dimension.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Small business innovation</field><field name="subject">Research and development</field><field name="subject">Strategic planning</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1715</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Accurate thermal sensing with modern CMOS integrated circuits : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Engineering at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Fisk, Robert Patrick</field><field name="description">Content removed due to copyright Conference Proceedings I R.

Therefore, the thesis titled, &#8220;Real-time adaptive beamformer for Automatic speech Recognition in a car environment&#8221; presents an application technique of a beamforming method and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) method. In this thesis, a novel solution is presented to the question as below, namely: How can the driver&#8217;s voice control the car using ASR? The solution in this thesis is an ASR using a hybrid system with acoustic beamforming Voice Activity Detector (VAD) and an Adaptive Wiener Filter. The beamforming approach is based on a fundamental theory of normalized least-mean squares (NLMS) to improve Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). The microphone has been implemented with a Voice Activity Detector (VAD) which uses time-delay estimation together with magnitude-squared coherence (MSC). An experiment clearly shows the ability of the composite system to reduce noise outside of a defined active zone. In real-time environments a speech recognition system in a car has to receive the driver&#8217;s voice only whilst suppressing background noise e.g. voice from radio. Therefore, this research presents a hybrid real-time adaptive filter which operates within a geometrical zone defined around the head of the desired speaker. Any sound outside of this zone is considered to be noise and suppressed. As this defined geometrical zone is small, it is assumed that only driver's speech is incoming from this zone. The technique uses three microphones to define a geometric based voice-activity detector (VAD) to cancel the unwanted speech coming from outside of the zone. In the case of a sole unwanted speech incoming from outside of a desired zone, this speech is muted at the output of the hybrid noise canceller. In case of an unwanted speech and a desired speech are incoming at the same time, the proposed VAD fails to identify the unwanted speech or desired speech. In such a situation an adaptive Wiener filter is switched on for noise reduction, where the SNR is improved by as much as 28dB. In order to identify the signal quality of the filtered signal from Wiener filter, a template matching speech recognition system that uses a Wiener filter is designed for testing. In this thesis, a commercial speech recognition system is also applied to test the proposed beamforming based noise cancellation and the adaptive Wiener filter.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Automatic speech recognition</field><field name="subject">Beamforming</field><field name="subject">Adaptive filters</field><field name="subject">Automobiles</field><field name="subject">Electronic equipment</field><field name="subject">Computer engineering</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280200 Artificial Intelligence and Signal and Image Processing::280206 Speech recognition</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1719</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The search for a robust measure of road safety advertising effectiveness : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Marketing at Massey University, Palmerston North</field><field name="creator">Macpherson, Terry Alan</field><field name="description">Loss of life resulting from road accidents incurs an immeasurable social and financial cost on society every year. Fortunately, the number of road injuries and fatalities has been reducing in most industralised countries for the past three decades due to the ongoing improvement of the engineering of roadways, the safety of vehicles and the changing attitudes and behaviour of drivers. Governments are constantly developing innovative tactics to further reduce the number of road accidents. One such initiative has been the adoption of marketing theory and specifically, advertising, by transport agencies in Australia and New Zealand into their road safety strategies. The Governments of both countries have proclaimed the campaigns to have been a success. However, the two road safety advertising campaigns have been studied by a number of researchers with conflicting results and conclusions about their efficacy. The studies have varied in form, estimation, outcomes, and data, making the comparison of their claims often very difficult. Policymakers and the public rely on the research of road safety experts when deciding on the best actions to undertake. However, the experts have each in turn argued that their approach was the most appropriate and that other researchers had done something wrong to reach their conclusions. The objective of this research was to identify a robust measure of road safety advertising effectiveness to take the confusion out of the ongoing debate. Using a single set of data and a range of advertising forms and road safety outcomes, previous evaluations of the New Zealand campaign were replicated and extended to discover which approach provided the best explanation of the value of road safety advertising. A further refinement was then made that addressed a potential problem with the original methods. Therefore, the research exhausted all the appropriate single and multiple equation approaches to the econometric evaluation of the effectiveness on road safety advertising using non-experimental data. The research shows that using one data source and a range of road safety outcomes, a robust and consistent measure of advertising effectiveness could not be identified among the approaches investigated. Furthermore, there is no objective way of knowing which of the models tested best reflects the actual situation. Therefore, it is claimed that a viable solution to this dilemma is to implement an experimental approach to identify the true effect of road safety advertising on driver behaviour.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mass media in traffic safety</field><field name="subject">Advertising</field><field name="subject">Road safety</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1720</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biochemical characterisation of dairy yeasts and their application in cheese as anaerobic adjunct cultures : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Food Technology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Das, Shantanu</field><field name="description">Yeasts are traditionally used as part of the surface microflora in surface-ripened cheeses, where they contribute positively to the flavour of the cheese. The primary objective of this study was to investigate the potential of three dairy yeasts to provide attributes as adjuncts in anaerobically ripened cheeses. Geotrichum candidum (B9001), Yarrowia lipolytica (B9014) and Candida kefyr (B9006), obtained from the Fonterra Co-operative Group Ltd, Palmerston North, New Zealand, were studied. They showed diverse metabolic activities in laboratory media, which were influenced by the growth conditions. The metabolic activities of special interest were the lipase and proteinase activities and the production of volatile compounds, as these are important for cheese ripening and flavour development. Lipase activity (p-nitrophenyl butyrate assay) and proteinase activity (fluorescein isothiocyanate &#946;-casein assay) were determined in three fractions prepared from yeast cultures and designated as extracellular fraction, washed-cell fraction and intracellular fraction. Lipase activity of G. candidum was detected only in the extracellular fraction and increased five fold when induced by safflower oil in a shake culture (0.16 &#181;M/min/mL supernatant at 24 h). Lipase expression was delayed in static cultures. Y. lipolytica showed lipase activity in extracellular, washed-cell and intracellular fractions under all conditions. Static cultures in both glucose and safflower oil media showed higher lipase activity than shake cultures. The lipase activity of Y. lipolytica was higher in the late stationary phase than in the log phase under all conditions tested. The highest lipase activity was detected in a 192 h static culture grown in safflower oil medium (0.13 &#181;M/min/mg dry cell weight, 0.3 &#181;M/min/mg dry cell weight and 4.29 &#181;M/min/mL supernatant in the intracellular, washed-cell and extracellular fractions respectively). C. kefyr did not show any lipase activity (&lt; 0.03 &#181;M/min/mL culture) under any of the growth conditions tested. Proteinase activity was detected in the intracellular fraction of 72 h shake cultures of G. candidum grown in both glucose medium and safflower oil medium (154 and 122 RFU/min/mg dry cell weight respectively) but was not detected in static cultures. Proteinase activity was absent in the Y. lipolytica cultures under all conditions tested (&lt; 10 RFU/min/mL culture). C kefyr showed low proteinase activity (12-74 RFU/min/mL supernatant) in the extracellular fraction only in shake cultures grown in glucose medium. Volatile compounds of the headspace were sampled and analysed using solid phase microextraction (SPME) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The concentrations of volatile compounds were highest in shake cultures grown in glucose medium for all three yeasts. All yeasts produced several alcohols. Several esters were also detected in the G. candidum and C. kefyr cultures whereas aldehydes were detected only in the G. candidum cultures. G. candidum and Y. lipolytica were selected for cheese production trials because of their active cheese ripening enzymes. These yeasts, grown under different conditions, were added to Cheddar cheese (10 L vat). The yeast adjuncts influenced the cheese ripening by lipolysis [in terms of the production of free fatty acids (FFAs) analysed by gas chromatography-flame ionisation detector (GC-FID)] and the production of volatile compounds (SPME-GC-MS), whereas proteolysis (analysed by size-exclusion high performance liquid chromatography) by yeast enzymes was not obvious. The influence of Y. lipolytica as an anaerobic adjunct to cheese ripening was dependent on the growth conditions used during its propagation in laboratory media. The concentration of total FFAs was very high (37.1 mg/g cheese at 6 months) when a 192 h Y. lipolytica culture grown in safflower oil medium was added to a cheese make, whereas the cultures grown in glucose medium did not have any detectable effect. Addition of G. candidum culture to the cheese curd was more effective than its addition to the cheese milk. Both G. candidum and Y. lipolytica lipase(s) selectively hydrolysed the long-chain unsaturated fatty acids from the milk triglyceride in the cheese environment. Also, Y. lipolytica lipase exhibited some selectivity towards hydrolysis of butyric acid from the milk fat in the cheese. 2-Heptanone, 3-methyl-2-butanone and 2-nonanone were detected (1-10 x 106 relative peak area) only in the cheeses with yeast adjuncts but not in the control cheese. Enhancement of the production of both conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and ethyl esters in a washed-curd, dry-salted cheese (375 L vat), made with G. candidum, Y. lipolytica, Propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii, Lactobacillus fermentum and Lb. rhamnosus, was only partially successful. Higher concentrations of ethyl esters (&gt; five fold; analysed by SPME-GC-MS) were produced in the cheeses made with yeast adjuncts. However, the concentration of total CLA (free plus esterified; analysed by GC-FID) did not increase although a higher concentration of free linoleic acid (&gt; 10 fold), the substrate for CLA synthesis, was produced in the cheeses made with yeast adjuncts. A study of the formation of aromatic volatile compounds by C. kefyr in a medium containing L-phenylalanine (L-phe) showed that the yeast's ability to produce phenyl ethanol, phenyl ethyl acetate and benzaldehydc (analysed by SPME-GC-MS) was enhanced with an increase in the initial L-phe concentration (in the experimental range; analysed by enzymatic assay using phenylalanine ammonia lyase), but the yield was very low (20-27%). The initial concentration of glucose (in the experimental range; analysed by enzymatic assay using Peridochrom glucose reagent) did not affect the production of these aromatic volatile compounds. This study successfully showed that the yeasts G. candidum and Y. lipolytica, when used as anaerobic adjuncts, can influence the ripening and flavour development in Cheddar and washed-curd, dry-salted cheeses. The study also showed the capability of C. kefyr to produce aromatic volatile compounds from amino acid fermentation but the yields need to be increased by further manipulation of the medium components and the culture conditions before this capability can be used commercially.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Geotrichum candidum</field><field name="subject">Yarrowia lipolytica</field><field name="subject">Candida kefyr</field><field name="subject">Lipase activity</field><field name="subject">Proteinase activity</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290101 Fermentation, biotechnology and industrial microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1721</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of camellia flower blight (Ciborinia camelliae Kohn) : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Plant Science (Plant Pathology) at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Taylor, Christine Helen</field><field name="description">Content removed due to copyright restrictions: Taylor, C.

The M&#257;ori Asthma Review was undertaken because of concern regarding the excessive number of deaths and hospitalisations from asthma among M&#257;ori people, even though evidence at that time, was that asthma prevalence was similar between M&#257;ori and non-M&#257;ori children. One of the key findings from the review was that there were a combination of barriers for M&#257;ori when accessing asthma services, which were almost certainly reflected in more severe asthma and higher hospital admission rates. This thesis has involved conducting three pieces of new research: (i) a series of reviews and analyses of descriptive data on asthma prevalence, hospitalisations and mortality in M&#257;ori and non-M&#257;ori; (ii) analyses of the ethnicity data from the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) Phase III Wellington survey; and (iii) a follow-up study of M&#257;ori adolescents with asthma examining factors affecting asthma severity, access to health care and asthma quality of life in this adolescent population. The mortality analyses showed that M&#257;ori were disproportionately affected by the asthma epidemics during the 1960s and 1970s and that while the asthma mortality rates have declined now, they remain higher in M&#257;ori than in non-M&#257;ori. Asthma hospitalisation rates continue to be higher in M&#257;ori compared to non-M&#257;ori across all age groups. Hospital admission rates are generally higher in rural areas for M&#257;ori whereas those for non-M&#257;ori are higher in urban areas. Analyses of the ISAAC Phase III data show that M&#257;ori children are experiencing both greater asthma symptom prevalence and increased asthma severity compared with non-M&#257;ori children and that this is not explained by risk factors such as smoking. In the follow-up study of M&#257;ori adolescents, baseline asthma severity and frequency of wheeze were important determinants of subsequent morbidity. Having an asthma action plan, a peak flow meter and having routine visits to the general practitioner were all associated with small improvements in asthma quality of life during the one year follow-up. The only significant predictor of access problems during the one year follow-up was having had access problems at baseline. Cost was the most significant barrier to accessing care for these families. Asthma continues to be a significant health problem for M&#257;ori. The research conducted for this thesis supports and extends previous research indicating that asthma is more severe in M&#257;ori, because of problems of access to health care. It also indicates that differences in asthma prevalence between M&#257;ori and non-M&#257;ori are now being seen in children as well as adults, and that management and treatment issues underlie the emerging increase in asthma prevalence among M&#257;ori. Attention to access issues across mainstream health structures along with support for M&#257;ori provider organisations should continue. Additonally, active approaches to monitor differential treatment and barriers to effective interventions are needed.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Asthma</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321202 Epidemiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1723</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterization of ACC oxidase during leaf ontogeny in white clover (Trifolium repens L.) and Trifolium occidentale : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Du, Zhen-Ning</field><field name="description">To produce plant material for this thesis, Trifolium repens (white clover) (genotype 10F) and Trifolium occidentale (genotype 18Z) were propagated to produce individual stolons trained over a plastic matrix to inhibit nodal root formation. These stolons comprised leaf tissue representative of all developmental stages, from leaf initiation, maturation through to senescence. The developmental pattern for both species in terms of leaf ontogeny was generally reproducible between vegetatively propagated clones. Three distinct 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylatc (ACC) oxidase genes expressed during leaf ontogeny in white clover (Trifolium repens L.) have been identified (Hunter et al., 1999). Of the three ACC oxidase genes identified, one designated TR-ACO2 is expressed in newly initiated and mature green leaves while TR-ACO3 is expressed predominantly in the senescent leaf tissue. In order to further characterize the protein products of these genes, a series of FPLC columns was used to partially purify isoforms of ACC oxidase from leaf tissue of white clover at different developmental stages, followed by 2D gel electrophoresis to obtain further purification. Two distinct isoforms of ACC oxidase were identified and partially purified from newly initiated green (designated the NIGI isoform) and senescent (designated the SEI isoform) leaf tissue. Both purified NIGI and SEI proteins were recognized by western analysis using an anti-(Trifolium repens) TR-ACO2 antibody after SDS-PAGE or 2D gel electrophoresis. To determine whether NIGI is coded for by TR-ACO2 and SEI is coded for by gene TR-ACO3, protein spots (after 2D gel electrophoresis) were digested with trypsin and the masses of the peptide determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-timc of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometric analysis. For NIGI, the coverage of the putative protein sequence (TR-ACO2) by tryptic digestion ranged from 24.5% to 37.6%, while the observed pI (5.1) and molecular mass (37 kDa) were close to the theoretical pI (5.3) and computed mass (35.7 kDa). For SEI, the percentage coverage of the putative protein sequence (TR-ACO3) from the peptides identified ranged from 13.4% to 18.0%, while the observed pI (5.2) and molecular masses (35.0-35.5 kDa) were also close to the theoretical pI (5.5) and computed mass (35.2 kDa). These data suggest that the NIGI isoform is encoded by TR-ACO2, while the SEI isoform is encoded by TR-ACO3. ACC oxidase activity in vitro and ACC oxidase protein accumulation over 24 h in mature green leaf tissue extracts during both short and long days has been shown to be under circadian control. There are two ACC oxidase activity peaks observed, in which the pattern of fluctuation in ACC oxidase activity resulted in a high level of enzyme activity at 12:00 am (0.18-0.27 nmol ethylene/h/mg), and maximum activity at 12:00 pm (0.24-031 nmol ethylene/h/mg). Lowest activity was observed in both long and short days at 9:00 pm (0.09-0.10 nmol ethylene/h/mg). In addition, northern analysis indicated that the TR-ACO2 mRNA level also displayed a circadian pattern of expression. Investigation of the effect of protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation on ACC oxidase activity indicated that ACC oxidase activity in vitro during the periods of maximum activity increased 36% (at 12:00 am) and 56% (at 12:00 pm) after dephosphorylation, respectively. However, there was only 21% increase in enzyme activity at the time point with lowest activity (9:00 pm) in the dephosphorylated extracts. SDS-PAGE using a mini-protein gel system or a gradient gel system showed that the molecular mass of ACC oxidase decreased after dephosphorylation when compared with phosphorylation of the enzyme. These results suggest that the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the ACC oxidase proteins occurs in vitro and the state does affect enzyme activity. In the second part of this thesis, the coding regions of putative ACC oxidase gene transcripts were generated from leaf tissue of genotype 18Z of T. occidentale using RT-PCR. Sequence alignments indicated that the sequences could be grouped into two distinct classes, and these coding regions were designated TO-ACO2 (Trifolium occidentale ACC oxidase 2) and TO-ACO3 (Trifolium occidentale ACC oxidase 3). TO-ACO2 and TO-ACO3 share 82% similarity in nucleotide sequence and 84% similarity in amino acid sequence. The TO-ACO2 and TO-ACO3 sequences were validated as encoding ACC oxidases by comparison with other ACC oxidases in the GenBank database and both TO-ACO2 and TO-ACO3 deduced amino acid sequences contain all the residues hitherto shown to be important for maximal activity of the enzyme. Further, TO-ACO2 had 97% identity with TR-ACO2 at the nucleotide level, and 98% identity at the amino acid level. TO-ACO3 had 97% identity with TR-ACO3 at the nucleotide level, and 96% identity at the amino acid level. Genomic Southern analysis, using 3'-UTRs of TR-ACO2 and TR-ACO3 as probes, could not confirm that TO-ACO2 and TO-ACO3 arc encoded for by distinct genes. Expression studies of TO-ACO2 and TO-ACO3 genes during leaf maturation and senescence of T. occidentale were examined using northern analysis. TO-ACO2 is expressed predominantly in newly initiated and at the onset of the mature-green leaf stage, while TO-ACO3 shows maximal expression in senescent leaf tissue. The changes of ACC oxidase activity during leaf ontogeny of T. occidentale coincided with the pattern observed for ACC oxidase protein accumulation using western analysis and image analysis.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Leaf growth</field><field name="subject">Oxidase genes</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300300 Horticulture::300302 Plant growth and development</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1724</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hokia ki te whenua : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Soil Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Roskruge, Nick</field><field name="description">This thesis aIms to produce a distinctive model for the sustainable horticultural development of Maori resources, primarily land. It is inclusive of tikanga Maori and indigenous production systems based on the unique body of knowledge aligned to Maori. The integration of this knowledge with western science is both argued and applied through the model itself. The hypothesis applied was that matauranga Maori relevant to horticulture and pedology can inform and add value to the future development of Maori land resources. The thesis is bui lt on a unique set of contributing knowledge bases aligned to soils and horticultural management supported by three case studies, identified through their common association i.e. whakapapa links. The format of the thesis intentionally follows science principles in structure and presentation and some assumptions are made regarding base knowledge surrounding Maori cultural factors and the science disciplines relative to soils and horticul ture. The indigenous element, including Maori knowledge, is incorporated into the model using a triadic kosmos/corpus/praxis approach. Where kosmos is applied as Te A o Miiori, corpus as miitauranga Miiori and praxis as tikanga Miiori, the relationship between each element is clear and the interpretation of the associated knowledge becomes more apparent and can be applied to cultural assessments of resources, i ncluding land. The crux of the cultural assessment model is the quality of information used to assess Maori resources, especially from the cultural perspective. The Maori cultural paradigm, traditional horticulture and pedology, and various decision systems are purposefully accessed to act as contributors to the assessment model and to highlight the diversity and quality of information land managers have at their disposal. The ability to apply a cultural layer drawn from a body of knowledge not previously included in decision models relative to land utility in New Zealand is the key point. of difference of the model. The model is discussed from the perspective of its beneficial role for future use by Maori and how it can be continuously refined to meet the needs of Maori land owners and thus contribute to the rangatiratanga of Maori.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Horticulture</field><field name="subject">Land tenure</field><field name="subject">Rural development</field><field name="subject">Rural land use</field><field name="subject">Indigenous crops</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Soil Science</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300100 Soil and Water Sciences::300104 Land capability and soil degradation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1725</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparison of two approaches to predicting blood donation behaviour : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Marketing at Massey University, Palmerston North</field><field name="creator">Holdershaw, Judith Louise</field><field name="description">Understanding and predicting human behaviour has been of particular interest to marketers for many years. The predominant approach to predicting behaviour has relied on attitude-based models; in particular, Ajzen's (1985) theory of planned behaviour is considered the most sophisticated methodology available to researchers for behavioural prediction. However, despite much study and refinement, the predictive ability of such models remains relatively poor. Rather than continuing to rely on cognitive models, it is time to consider alternative approaches to predicting behaviour. Labaw (1980) offers one such alternative approach based on information about respondents' environment, knowledge and past behaviour. However, unlike Ajzen's theory of planned behaviour, Labaw's approach to predicting behaviour has not been widely operationalised or tested. Therefore, it is not known whether her approach, using questions that, at least theoretically, have verifiable answers, has greater predictive ability than Ajzen's theory of planned behaviour, based on attitudinal questions. This study compared the predictive ability of Ajzen's attitudinal-based theory of planned behaviour with Labaw's behavioural approach, in the context of blood donation behaviour. In absolute terms, the predictive ability of the two approaches was equivalent; however, Labaw's approach was superior to the theory of planned behaviour from a survey research perspective. Thus, Labaw's approach presents a feasible alternative to attitudinal-based approaches to predicting behaviour. This study also found that behavioural intention to donate blood was a poor predictor of actual (self-reported) donation behaviour. This finding is important given the widely-accepted assumption that the best prediction of behaviour is provided by measures of behavioural intention. In addition, the study suggests that researchers need to carefully consider the time interval selected to test the predictive ability of a model if the results are to have any practical relevance. Variables that help explain the decision to donate blood were also identified. These findings offer blood collection agencies guidance with formulating specific strategies to address blood donor shortages. However, accurately predicting who is most likely to donate blood remains problematic, and further research is needed to extend the results reported in this study.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Behavioural prediction</field><field name="subject">Planned behaviour</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::359900 Other Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1726</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Origins and dispersal of the sweet potato and bottle gourd in Oceania : implications for prehistoric human mobility : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Plant Biology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Clarke, Andrew Christopher</field><field name="description">Origins and dispersal of the sweet potato and bottle gourd in Oceania :|bimplications for prehistoric human mobility : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Plant Biology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lagenaria siceraria</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270200 Genetics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1727</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Isolation and characterisation of bacterial exopolysaccharides produced by Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus NCFB 2483 and Sphingomonas elodea ATCC 31461 : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Food Technology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Goh, Kelvin Kim Tha</field><field name="description">The aim of this study was to explore the characteristics of a non-gelling exopolysaccharide (EPS) obtained from Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus NCFB 2483 and a gelling EPS obtained from Sphingomonas elodea ATCC 31461 (31461). The EPSs were isolated from the two bacterial strains grown in milk permeate-based media. They were purified and then characterised using light scattering and viscometric techniques. A greater emphasis of this research was placed on 2483 EPS since its physical characteristics have not been reported to date. In the case of 31461 EPS. a model for gelation of the sodium gellan was proposed based on rheological and light scattering measurements. The rheological properties of the two EPSs were also compared with several commercial polysaccharides. Microscopy examination of 2483 EPS was carried out using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In CLSM, the lectin SBA (from Glycine max) Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate was used to stain the EPS since it has affinity for galactopyranosyl residues present in 2483 EPS. The CLSM micrographs showed a random distribution of EPS aggregates in the culture medium. At high magnification, the SEM micrographs showed web-like EPS structures. These structures were formed during the critical point drying process, when the EPS, which filled the interstices and channels of the protein aggregates, dehydrated. The 2483 EPS aggregates were found to be stable at neutral or low pH (~3.9) but were disrupted at high pH (pH 8-10). Procedures commonly used to quantify EPS from culture medium were found to be unreliable. In the development of an improved EPS assay, each of the processing steps was examined. Key improvements included the use of Flavourzyme for protein hydrolysis; optimising ethanol concentration to prevent lactose crystallisation yet allowing complete EPS precipitation; and a suitable centrifugation regime to minimise EPS loss. The improved EPS assay gave reproducible results (5% coefficient of variation). The isolation of 2483 EPS from milk media proved to be a difficult task because of interference from non-EPS components. An effective and simple approach allowing maximum EPS recovery involved the use of a hydrolysed milk medium which was ultrafiltered (UF) to remove molecular species larger than 2.5 x 105 Da. The UF permeate was suitable for the growth of 2483 with an EPS yield of ~400mg/L. Two EPS fractions (namely a soluble and an insoluble fraction) were isolated by ethanol precipitation and the soluble 'ropy' fraction was further purified to achieve ~98% purity. The elemental analysis of the purified fraction revealed the presence of nitrogen (~2.7% w/w). This could be due to the interaction of some peptides (from the growth medium) with the EPS. The polysaccharide composition of the soluble EPS fraction comprised of galactose, glucose, rhamnose and mannose residues (5:1:0.6:0.5). Traces of glucosamine were also found in the fraction. The purified fraction of 2483 EPS was characterised. Using a capillary viscometer, an intrinsic viscosity of ~2013mL/g was determined. The flow curves of the 2483 EPS solutions obtained using a rotational viscometer showed shear-thinning behaviour and an exponent value of ~0.76 (based on the Cross-type model) is typical of random coil polymers. The concentration dependence of the viscosity plot produced gradients of ~1.1 in the dilute domain and ~3.3 in the semi-dilute to concentrated domain. The coil overlap parameters at three concentration domains (c*[&#331;],ccr[&#331;] and c**[&#331;]) were 0.55, 2.86 and 5.67 respectively. The molecular parameters of the 2483 EPS were found via static light scattering measurements to have a weight-average molar mass (Mw.) of ~2 x 106 Da, a z-average root-mean-square radius ((r2g)z1/2) of ~165nm and a low polydispersity index (Mw/Mn ~1.15). The plot of Mw versus (r2g)z1/2 gave a gradient of approximately 0.5, which also suggested that the EPS polymer adopted a random coil conformation. The second part of the research involved gellan gum. Two gellan samples were studied. The first gellan sample was obtained from the fermentation of Sphingomonas elodea ATCC 31461 using milk permeate-based medium (31461). The second sample was a commercial high acyl gellan (LT100). Both gellan samples were converted to their sodium forms (Na-31461 and Na-LT100 gellan) using cation exchange resin and purified. The Na-gellan samples were highly sensitive to changes in Na+ concentrations. From oscillatory measurements, it was found that the complex moduli of the two Na-gellan samples superimposed closely at a specific Na+ concentration. The model for the conformational changes of Na-gellan molecules from a solution to a gel was proposed based on rheological and light scattering data. At very low Na+ concentrations (&lt;19mM, in the case of Na-LT100). Na-gellan molecules were single-stranded (Mw ~2.5 x 10 5 Da) and adopted random coil conformation (exponent value based on the Cross-type model of ~0.76). At a slightly higher Na+ concentration (~19-24mM), Na-gellan molecules formed double-helices which led to a two-fold increase in molecular weight (M w ~5.2 x 105 Da). The double-stranded molecule appeared to be stiffer (exponent value of the Cross-type model ~0.82) and the mechanical spectra (G',G&#8221;) demonstrated 'weak ge' characteristics. A further increase in the Na+ concentration (&gt;24mM) resulted in the formation of a gel network. The study also found that at low Na+concentration, both single-stranded and double-stranded Na-gellan molecules had a tendency to form aggregates under zero-shear conditions. The interactions involved in these aggregates were considered weak and transient, according to the Cox-Merz plot and light scattering data.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Polysaccharides</field><field name="subject">Exopolysaccharide analysis</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290101 Fermentation, biotechnology and industrial microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1728</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Handwriting in healthy people aged 65 years and over</field><field name="creator">van Drempt, Nadege Andree</field><field name="description">Master of Applied Science (Occupational Therapy)</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">error corrections</field><field name="subject">handwriting style</field><field name="subject">pen grip</field><field name="subject">posture</field><field name="subject">pressure</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/6623</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Restorative benefits of the natural environment : enhancing restoration of directed attention &amp; stress reduction through raising levels of cognitive awareness &amp; physical encounter</field><field name="creator">Lalak, Nadia</field><field name="description">Philosophy(PhD)</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Environmental psychology</field><field name="subject">Architecture -- Psychological aspects.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/6622</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Urban Aboriginal identity construction in Australia: an Aboriginal perspective utilising multi-method qualitative analysis</field><field name="creator">Bolt, Reuben</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Urban Aboriginal identity</field><field name="subject">Narrative identity</field><field name="subject">Qualitative methods</field><field name="subject">Identity construction</field><field name="subject">Symbolic interactionism</field><field name="subject">Microsociology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/6626</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thoroughly modern theses: exploring the phenomenon of theses with multiple forms of media.</field><field name="creator">Somerset, Bronte Jean</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dissertations, Academic.</field><field name="subject">Media theses.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/636</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Discourse, dogma, and domination: knowledge work as art and politics.</field><field name="creator">Adelstein, Jennifer</field><field name="description">University of Technology Sydney.

Two approaches to resource mobilisation that are promoted within Australia are social enterprise and partnering with business. Both of these approaches involve a re-orientation toward business, either in management practices or through an enduring relationship. Despite an increased interest in business-focused resource mobilisation strategies there are few successful examples of social enterprise and partnering with business emerging across the nonprofit sector. There is also scant empirically based research to understand what it takes to adopt these practices, what the consequences of adoption might be and how governments, nonprofits and business stakeholders might support their emergence. This research aims to build an evidence base to provide greater understanding of these issues. The thesis analyses data from fourteen organisational case studies of nonprofit social service organisations located across Australia. Seven of these organisations were selected because they had adopted an enterprising form of resource mobilisation and had been recognised for their achievements in this area. The other seven organisations matched these adopters in terms of mission, location, size and stage of organisational development, though had less diversified resource streams and had not attempted or successfully managed to develop a social enterprise or business partnership. Case-orientated research and qualitative comparative analysis was used in order to achieve causal complexity and a 'configurational' view of the cases (Ragin 1999). The thesis details the conditions that are both necessary and sufficient for business-focused resource mobilisation .processes to be adopted. Organisational capacity and self-efficacy are critical conditions that open up resource innovation possibilities; there is a range of other sufficient conditions that work in combination with these. There are value and ideological challenges to be negotiated by nonprofit social service organisations as they are called upon, both internally and from without, to reinvent the means with which they achieving organisational sustainability. This tension creates the need for new thinking atthe level  of policy and practice - across all sectors - in order that these critical organisations that bear responsibility for the social good can successful organise within the contemporary context.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nonprofit organizations.</field><field name="subject">Social service organizations.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/845</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New team identification: Sydney FC, a case study.</field><field name="creator">Lock, Daniel John</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the team identification of fans of a new sport team, using social identity theory. As there is limited research on fans of new sport teams, this study sought to redress this situation by seeking to explain and measure new team identification. Through investigating new team identification, this study extends current applications of social identity theory and understanding of fans of a new sport team. Additionally, by measuring new team identification, this thesis contributes a valid and reliable measure of the construct, and discovery of key themes driving the formation and development of new team identification. A mixed-method research design was used to investigate the central thesis topic. A case study of members of a new sport team, Sydney FC, provided the sample population. The research design included two surveys, administered at the end of the new team&#8217;s first and second seasons, respectively, in addition to twenty-one interviews undertaken to deepen understanding of new team identification. The Sports Spectator Identity Scale (SSIS) was used to measure new team identification and test for differences in identity strength based on participant characteristics. Results indicated that three defining behaviours provided the basis for the formation of new team identification. These were termed: Football first, Origin and Occasion. Measurement of new team identification using the SSIS validated the model in a new team context; however, the value of victory and the identification of rival groupings did not relate strongly to the construct. Member identity strength was significantly influenced by age, salary, membership category and games attended. Five behaviours underpinned the development of new team identification; these were termed: Searching, Expression, Eagerness, Names and Faces, and Spruiking. Social identity theory provided a useful framework to explore the formation and extent of new team identification. The formation of new team identification was strongly influenced by support of football, in this case. The implementation of the SSIS to measure new team identification extended its previous applications. Participant characteristics exerted a clear influence on the strength of new team identification. Members engaged in additional teamrelated behaviours as their new team identification increased and they developed multi-faceted and socially important bonds. Stemming from the key thesis findings, the conceptual outcomes provided a significant contribution to current literature exploring members of new sport teams. Furthermore, the nuanced differences between identification with new and established teams provide a distinct agenda for future research into new sport teams.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Group identity.</field><field name="subject">Soccer.</field><field name="subject">Football fans.</field><field name="subject">Sydney Football Club (N.S.W.)</field><field name="subject">Sports teams.</field><field name="subject">Sports fans.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/848</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The multi-attribute elimination by aspects (MEBA) model.</field><field name="creator">Pihlens, David A.</field><field name="description">Our research proposes a new, multi-attribute, parameterisation of Tversky&#8217;s Elimination- By-Aspects (EBA) model. The EBA model conceptualises choice as a covert sequential elimination process with choice probabilities formulated over all consideration sets of the choice set. This specification attempts to capture the effect of context on choice behaviour. However, the EBA model has seen limited usage due to the large number of required parameters given the set of items under study. For a set of items T, it has 2|T| - 3 free parameters, which is infeasible for all but the simplest of contexts. To provide a practical operationalisation, we impose a set of a priori constraints on the parameter space. We define a generic multi-attribute structure to the set of aspects. This restricts the cardinality of the set of unknown scale values while retaining the functional (recursive) form of the model. The EBA hypothesis of a population of lexicographic decision-makers can therefore be tested in more market-realistic contexts, and inferences made over a large universal set of items described by the complete factorial. We call this model the Multi-attribute Elimination-By-Aspects (MEBA) model. The MEBA model reduces the set of unknown free parameters to a maximum of |T|-1. We develop a general algebraic expression for the MEBA choice probabilities as a function of the attributes of the options in the choice set. This enables the derivation of a likelihood function, and consequently maximum likelihood estimation. We also consider the form of optimal MEBA paired comparison designs. Using Monte Carlo simulation and a discrete choice experiment with consumers, we conduct an initial empirical test of the model against the special case of the MNL model (that assumes no context effects) and find the MEBA model to be a better approximation of observed choice behaviour. This is achieved on a common set of parameters, and so it is due solely to the difference in functional form of the two models. We conclude with a discussion on future research directions, in particular the introduction of heterogeneity into the model, and the description of optimal choice experiments for larger choice set sizes.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Choice modelling.</field><field name="subject">Decision making.</field><field name="subject">Multiattribute decisions.</field><field name="subject">Consumers' preferences.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/884</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The determination of equivanlent value in life-cost studies: An intergrated approach.</field><field name="creator">Langston, Craig Ashley</field><field name="description">University of Technology, Sydney.

Power converters are often standardised, so that they can be replaced with a model from another manufacturer without an expensive system redesign. For this reason, the power converter market is highly competitive and relies on cutting-edge technology, which increases power conversion efficiency and power density. High power density and conversion efficiency reduce the system cost, and thus make the power converter more attractive to the customer. Current sensing is a vital task in power converters, where the current information is required for monitoring and control purposes. In order to achieve the above-mentioned goals, existing current sensing techniques have to be improved in terms of cost, power loss and size. Simultaneously, current information needs to be increasingly available in digital form to enable digital control, and to allow the digital transmission of the current information to a centralised monitoring and control unit. All this requires the output signal of a particular current sensing technique to be acquired by an analogue-to-digital converter, and thus the output voltage of the current sensor has to be sufficiently large. This thesis thoroughly reviews contemporary current sensing techniques and identifies suitable techniques that have the potential to meet the performance requirements of the next-generation of power converters. After the review chapter, three novel current sensing techniques are proposed and investigated: 1) The usefulness of the resistive voltage drop across a copper trace, which carries the current to be measured, to detect electrical current is evaluated. Simulations and experiments confirm that this inherently lossless technique can measure high currents at reasonable measurement bandwidth, good accuracy and low cost if the sense wires are connected properly. 2) Based on the mutual inductance theory found during the investigation of the copper trace current sense method, a modification of the well-known lossless inductor current sense method is proposed and analysed. This modification involves the use of a coupled sense winding that significantly improves the frequency response. Hence, it becomes possible to accurately monitor the output current of a power converter with the benefits of being lossless, exhibiting good sensitivity and having small size. 3) A transformer based DC current sense method is developed especially for digitally controlled power converters. This method provides high accuracy, large bandwidth, electrical isolation and very low thermal drift. Overall, it achieves better performance than many contemporary available Hall Effect sensors. At the same time, the cost of this current sensor is significantly lower than that of Hall Effect current sensors. A patent application has been submitted. .... The current sensing techniques have been studied by theory, hardware experiments and simulations. In addition, the suitability of the detection techniques for mass production has been considered in order to access the ability to provide systems at low-cost.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Digital control systems</field><field name="subject">Electric current converters</field><field name="subject">Electric power systems -- Control</field><field name="subject">Mutual inductance</field><field name="subject">Power electronics</field><field name="subject">Current sensing</field><field name="subject">Dc current transformer</field><field name="subject">Power converter</field><field name="subject">Mutual inductance</field><field name="subject">Temperature compensation</field><field name="subject">Digital control</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0077</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Picturing Afghanistan: the role of photo-texts in framing conflict, identity and the nation</field><field name="creator">Verschueren, Paul</field><field name="description" /><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">400000 Journalism, Librarianship and Curatorial Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:136528</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intuitionism and its Implications for the Theory of Communication</field><field name="creator">Wolfgang Baumgartner</field><field name="description" /><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:139093</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physiology of the PNSB Genus Rhodobacter: Volatile Fatty Acid Metabolism and Global Metabolic Regulation</field><field name="creator">Miss Jessica Welch</field><field name="description" /><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159346</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Expression and promoter analysis of Glycine max nodule autoregulation receptor kinase gene</field><field name="creator">Nontachaiyapoom, Sureeporn</field><field name="description">Legume-rhizobia symbioses contribute at least 20% of the biosphere's supply of reactive nitrogen. These unique associations rely on the exchange of specific molecular signals between nitrogen-fixing soil bacteria, collectively called rhizobia, and their host plants and, with few exceptions, result in the formation of root nodules, which provide an environment suitable for nitrogen fixation. However, nitrogen fixation is energetically expensive and nodule proliferation, in much the same manner as the proliferation of other meristems in plants, must be controlled in order to attain equilibrium between cell proliferation and differentiation. Nodule proliferation is controlled primarily and systemically by autoregulation of nodulation (AON). A gene central to this process was first isolated by map-based cloning from soybean (Glycine max) and was named G. max Nodule Autoregulation Receptor Kinase (GmNARK) in accordance with its biochemical and physiological functions. Expression patterns of GmNARK have been described by several investigators; however, these reports were based on either non-quantitative methods or a limited number of tissue types. More importantly, the expression domains of GmNARK were completely unknown. The study described in this thesis utilised techniques such as quantitative RT-PCR (QRTPCR), transcription start site mapping, promoter-reporter gene fusion, and promoter deletion, to analyse the expression levels and domains of GmNARK across a variety of tissues as well as identify the promoter elements that are responsible for the basal and tissue-specific expression of GmNARK. In addition, the promoter activity of GmNARK was also compared with that of Lotus japonicus HAR1, the GmNARK orthologue, in both homologous and heterologous transformation systems. Based on QRT-PCR, GmNARK was expressed to varying levels throughout the plant; the transcript was detected at high levels in mature leaves and roots but to a lesser extent in young leaves, shoot tips and nodules. The transcript level was not significantly affected by Bradyrhizobium japonicum during the first week following inoculation. Histochemical analysis of L. japonicus plants carrying either a 1.7 kb GmNARK promoter or 2.0 kb LjHAR1 promoter fused to a beta-glucuronidase reporter gene localised GUS activity to living cells within vascular bundles, especially phloem cells in leaves, stems, roots, and nodules. Phloem-specific expression was also detected in soybean hairy roots carrying these constructs. These results suggested that both cis- and trans-acting elements required for the transcriptional regulation of these orthologous genes are likely to be conserved. In contrast, 1.7 kb of the GmNARK promoter did not drive phloem-specific expression in Arabidopsis thaliana, indicating the absence of the trans-acting elements required for the tissue-specificity of GmNARK in this distantly related species. The comparison of 2.0 kb of promoter sequences of GmNARK, LjHAR1 and Medicago truncatula SUNN, another GmNARK orthologue, using bioinformatics and computational approaches indicated several highly conserved motifs including a putative negative regulatory region (NRR), which was previously reported to repress gene expression in non-phloem cell types. Deletion analysis of the GmNARK promoter, however, ruled out the possibility that this motif, found at -308 bp with respect to the translation start site, was truly functional and located the region controlling phloem-specific expression to DNA sequence between 908 bp and 1.7 kb upstream of the start codon. Two other candidate regions were identified by Multiple EM for Motif Elicitation (MEME). These regions, namely MEME3 and MEME4 showed strong sequence similarity to the corresponding regions of the LjHAR1 promoter. Interestingly, the MEME3 motif was also found in the MtSUNN promoter at a similar location to that of LjHAR1. Potential NRRs in the LjHAR1 and MtSUNN promoters were found in the MEME3 motifs, whereas only a variant form of a NRR in the GmNARK promoter was found in this region. Additionally, an identical semi-palindromic sequence was also observed in the MEME3 motifs of the three orthologous promoters. Based on these findings, the semi-palindromic sequence and the variant form of the NRR are proposed to be positive and negative regulatory elements for the phloem-specific expression of GmNARK, respectively. The computational approaches also identified two potential TATA elements in the GmNARK promoter. Rapid amplification of 5' cDNA ends and promoter deletion analysis have confirmed that they were functional. The two TATA elements in GmNARK promoter appeared to cooperatively direct transcription of GmNARK, but either was adequate for basal transcription. The finding that the expression of AON receptor-like kinase genes is phloem-specific has contributed to a better understanding of AON signalling pathways. The QRT-PCR study and the discovery of cis-acting regulatory regions have also provided crucial information on the transcriptional regulation of GmNARK as well as plant genes in general. Additionally, the promoters of GmNARK and LjHAR1 could potentially be used to drive phloem-specific expression in legume biotechnology research.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300203 Plant Improvement (Selection, Breeding and Genetic Engineering)</field><field name="subject">legumes</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158587</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing Healthier Banana roots with mycorrhizae and rhizobacteria</field><field name="creator">Smith, Linda Jane</field><field name="description">Fusarium wilt of banana, also known as Panama disease, is one of the most destructive diseases of banana (Musa spp.) and is regarded as one of the most significant threats to banana production not only in Australia, but worldwide. The causative agent is the soilborne fungus, Fusarium oxysporum Schlechtend.: Fr. forma specialis (f. sp.) cubense (E.F. Smith) Snyder and Hansen (Foc) for which options of control are limited, with no commercially viable means of chemical control. Micropropagated bananas are increasingly being used by the Queensland banana industry. This is because they are the best source of disease and pest-free planting material and productivity on the farm can be greatly improved with their use. However, when planting into soils heavily infested with Foc, these plants have been found to be more susceptible than conventional planting material. It is believed that microorganisms such as bacteria and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), which are not available to micropropagated plants raised in a sterile environment, may protect vegetative planting material dug from the field. Adding beneficial microorganisms to micropropagated plants in the nursery before planting in the field may provide some protection from soilborne diseases such as fusarium wilt and lead to improved performance. This research was undertaken to identify endophytic and rhizosphere inhabiting bacteria (including fluorescent Pseudomonas spp., Plant Growth Promoting Rhizobacteria (PGPR), spore-forming and chitinolytic bacteria) and fungal endophytes such as AMF that enhance plant growth and inhibit or reduce the infection of Foc in micropropagated banana plants. It is widely known that suppressive soils exist where fusarium wilt does not reach epidemic proportions. Laboratory results to date support a microbial basis for this suppressiveness. Wilt suppressive sites were located in Queensland and northern New South Wales and roots of banana plants were collected. Rhizosphere root washings and surface sterilised root segments were plated onto solid growth media to isolate both rhizosphere and endophytic bacteria. Bacterial isolates were initially evaluated using various in vitro tests including antagonism on agar, chitinolytic ability, production of fluorescent siderophores when grown on Kings B media, spore production and ability to lyse Foc mycelia using Foc as a sole carbon source. This process assisted with selection of isolates that may have the most biological control potential. Based on these tests 41 isolates were chosen for further investigation. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi were isolated from banana roots growing in disease suppressive soils and were also obtained from a culture collection at the Gatton Campus of The University of Queensland. A total of 10 pot cultures were prepared using sunflower as a host plant. Mycorrhizal fungi produced typical intraradical structures (arbuscules, vesicles, hyphae) when banana plants were inoculated with AMF. To assess the biological control potential of bacteria and AMF against Foc, a reliable small plant bioassay system was required. Attempts by various researchers to develop a reliable bioassay have been made in the past however infection of banana plants by the pathogen was inconsistent. The inconsistencies of previous work may microorganisms in the growth of micropropagated banana plants and protection of young plants from disease. However, ability to reduce disease assessed by internal rating of vascular discolouration appears to be influenced by host genotype. While reduction in disease severity and promotion of plant growth was observed in glasshouse trials, this was not observed in field trials at harvest. If plants had been assessed for differences in growth and susceptibility to disease plus nutrient uptake at the early stages of growth following transplanting into the field rather than at harvest, differences between microbial treated and untreated plants may have been determined. In the field, environmental factors such as drought influenced disease development and plant growth of inoculated plants at the race 1 field site at Terranora in NSW, which was not irrigated. Six of the bacterial isolates tested (25, 26, 2bb, 3b-1, 48 and S-5) and two soilborne isolates of Fusarium oxysporum (Calcutta-1 and K17pi) significantly reduced plant height of cv Lady finger at harvest. Six bacterial isolates (4a, 4b, 84, 8-7, 92 and S-24) and AMF isolate LJS1 had no effect on plant growth. A reduction in plant growth following application of micropropagated banana with microbial inoculants was not observed at the &#145;subtropical&#146; race 4 field testing site that was irrigated. Further research is required to understand the influence of microorganisms applied to nursery grown plants on growth under different environmental and soil conditions when transplanted. The results of this investigation illustrate how selected rhizobacterial and arbuscular mycorrhizal amendments applied to micropropagated banana as a pre-plant treatment in the nursery could be used to enhance plant growth and vigour and reduce disease caused by the fusarium wilt pathogen, thereby improving root health in young plants following transplanting. However, further trials are necessary to determine if these microbial inoculants can be practically produced and applied to commercial operations in field soil conditions to improve root health.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300303 Plant Protection (Pests, Diseases and Weeds)</field><field name="subject">620205 Tropical fruit</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158367</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Expression of hnRNPs A/B in cancer cells and their roles in carcinogenesis</field><field name="creator">He, Yaowu</field><field name="description">The identification of specific and reproducible biomarkers is critical for the early diagnosis of cancer, which has a profound effect the survival rate of patients.

Later studies established a correlation between the expression levels of these hnRNPs and other cancers, such as breast, pancreatic, and lymphatic tumours. In this study, the expression of hnRNPs A1, A2, A3, and B1 has been investigated in various cancer cell lines. hnRNPs A1 and A3, in addition to A2 and B1, were found to be overexpressed in some cancer types. However, the overexpression of none of the hnRNP A/B proteins was universal, and their upregulation may be limited to a few cell types, suggesting they may be effective biomarkers for a subset of cancers. The upregulation of hnRNP A/B proteins in tumours and cancer cell lines led to the hypothesis that they are involved in the uncontrolled cell growth in cancer. According to our Western blot analysis, expression of the hnRNP proteins, A1, A2, and B1, is dependent on the cell cycle whereas no significant change was detected for hnRNP A3, implying that the former three are needed during certain cell cycle stages. The results, together with the transcription factor analysis of the promoter regions of the HNRPA1, HNRPA2, and HNRPA3 genes, suggest that hnRNPs A1, A2, and A3 may have distinct regulatory machineries and cellular functions although they have high amino acid sequence identity. However, their mRNA levels were unchanged across the cell cycle, suggesting the cell-cycle-dependent expression of hnRNPs A1, A2, and B1 is modulated at the translational level. Previous studies showed higher expression of hnRNPs A1 and A2 in rapidly proliferating cells than in quiescent cells, suggesting a role of these proteins in cell proliferation. Though interruption of hnRNP A1 expression did not result in significant change in the viability of murine CB3 cells, simultaneous suppression of hnRNPs A1 and A2 caused apoptosis in a few cell lines. Consistent with this, suppression of hnRNP A1 or A3 expression in our study in Colo16 squamous cells using RNA interference did not affect cell proliferation, but simultaneous suppression of both caused slow cell proliferation. By contrast, reduction of the hnRNP A2 level alone slowed the proliferation of Colo16 cells. These results suggest that although hnRNPs A1, A2, and A3 share some roles in cell proliferation, each of them may have distinct tasks. This conclusion is supported by the data from the comparative analysis of the downstream targets of hnRNPs A1, A2, and A3, which has shown that these three proteins share a limited number of common downstream proteins. The observed impact on cell proliferation of suppressing hnRNP A2 subfamily proteins is in accord with our finding that the downstream targets of hnRNP A2 are overrepresented by genes involved in proliferation regulation, as shown in microarray and real-time PCR analysis. These include cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors, p21 and p27, and their regulatory proteins, such as Skp2 and Rpn10. Skp2 controls the ubiquitination of p21 and p27, and Rpn10 links them to the 26S proteasome, the complex that degrades these two CDK inhibitors. hnRNP A2 also regulates the transcription of securin and separin, which are essential for sister chromatid separation during late anaphase. In addition, hnRNP A2 can also influence cell proliferation through cell growth factors, including fibroblast, vascular endothelial, transforming, and insulin growth factors. Our gene array and real-time PCR analysis have shown that hnRNP A2 regulates the expression of these factors, their receptors, or associated proteins such as IGFBP7 and TGFBR2. The data presented in this thesis link the overexpression of hnRNP A/B proteins, in particular the A2/B1 subfamily, in cancer with their regulatory roles in cell division and cell proliferation. Our findings provide mechanistic evidence that these proteins may be a driving force for the uncontrolled cell growth in cancer, suggesting that some of hnRNP A/B proteins may be potential therapeutic targets for cancer. However, further studies are needed to obtain a global view of the roles of these proteins in cancer.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270201 Gene Expression</field><field name="subject">780105 Biological sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158357</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Selective transport of attached particles across the froth phase</field><field name="creator">Seaman, David Richard</field><field name="description">Over many years, researchers in the field of flotation have developed an in-depth understanding of processes occurring in the pulp phase of flotation machines. Until recently, however, the froth phase has received little attention. The froth phase serves to separate bubble-particle aggregates from suspended slurry in a flotation cell. The mechanism of recovery by entrainment, its relationship to water recovery and particle size dependency is well understood. Froth recovery, (the fraction of particles entering the concentrate launder that entered the froth phase attached to air bubbles), is not well understood. Up until now, there has been doubt over whether this property is dependent on particle size and hydrophobicity. Difficulties in measuring froth recovery had previously prevented researchers from gaining a deeper understanding of the transport of attached particles across the froth phase. A novel device was designed and tested to measure froth recovery by isolating bubble-particle aggregates in the pulp-phase of flotation machines through the determination of the bubble loading in the pulp phase (mass of particles attached per unit volume of air bubbles). This technique can be used with other measurements to investigate froth selectivity by directly comparing these captured particles to those found in the froth phase. Evidence was collected at Red Dog Mine, Alaska and Newmont Golden Grove Operations, Western Australia which showed that the froth phase selectively transported more hydrophobic and smaller sized particles across the froth than less hydrophobic and larger particles. Particles collected in the device were compared to those found in the concentrate stream on a size by mineral by liberation class. Froth recovery was also calculated on a size by mineral by liberation class for two valuable sulphide minerals in a continuous 3m&#179; flotation cell. These results show that the froth phase is responsible for the upgrading of attached particles across the froth phase as well as for the separation of bubble-particle aggregates from suspended slurry. The pulp phase is responsible for creating bubble-particle aggregates through the attachment of hdyrophobic mineral particles to air bubbles. Many complex factors affect the extent to which this occurs including the size and hdyrophobicity of the particles, the size and number of air bubbles produced by the flotation machine, the rate of collisions between particles and bubbles and the overall chemistry of the system. This measurement of bubble loading presents an opportunity to measure the impact of all these factors on the successful creation of bubble-particle aggregates. Based on a literature review suggesting that there was a high probability of particles being detached at the pulp-froth interface due to the aggregates change in momentum, a three phase description of a flotation cell was proposed. The three phases were: pulp, pulp-froth interface and upper froth zones. A second froth recovery measurement technique (changing froth depth) was used in combination with the bubble load technique to determine the recovery across each of the two froth zones. It was found that the pulp-froth interface appears to be responsible for the selectivity observed across the froth phase as a whole. These findings will enable more in-depth research into the sub-process of the froth phase as well as assisting flotation cell design through a better understanding of the roles of the pulp-froth interface and the upper froth region.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">290702 Mineral Processing</field><field name="subject">640300 First Stage Treatment of Ores and Minerals</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158293</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bivalves and the Bucephalidae: A parasitic system on the Great Barrier Reef</field><field name="creator">Bott, Nathan James</field><field name="description">This study set out to examine, for the first time, both the molluscan intermediate and the teleost definitive hosts of a major assemblage of trematode parasites present on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). The parasite taxon was the Bucephalidae which occur in piscivorous fishes as sexually reproducing adults and in bivalves as asexually reproducing stages. The goal was to characterise the overall richness of the system and to explore patterns of host-specificity. Because of the size of this fauna it was not possible to incorporate all the taxa found in this study. This thesis reports the results of a survey of bivalves from this region, taxonomic studies on several elements of the fauna of fishes, and efforts to link life-cycles between bivalves and fishes. I surveyed 2256 bivalve individuals (47 species, 17 families) from South-east Queensland, Heron Island (southern GBR) and Lizard Island (northern GBR). Infections of trematode species from three families, Bucephalidae, Gorgoderidae and Monorchiidae, were found. Overall prevalence of infection was 2.3%. The Bucephalidae (11 species) was the most commonly found family. A single gorgoderid infection was found from a venerid, Lioconcha castrensis. This is the first report of a gorgoderid from a marine bivalve and phylogenetic analysis suggests that the species belongs to the Gorgoderinae. Monorchiids (5 species) were found from Tellinidae and Lucinidae. All infections are new host/parasite records. I deduce that this study produced lifecycle information, but no actual identifications, for 10% of the species of trematodes that infect bivalves of Queensland marine waters. Prosorhynchoides apogonis n. sp. is described from the intestine of the apogonid Cheilodipterus macrodon from the southern GBR. This is the first bucephalid to be described from the teleost family Apogonidae. Prosorhynchoides lamprelli n. sp. is described from the intestine of the carangid Caranx papuensis from off Lizard Island, GBR. This is the first bucephalid to be described from Caranx papuensis. A new trematode genus, Grammatorcynicola n. g. (Dolichoenterinae), and two new species, G. brayi n. sp. and G. nolani n. sp., are described from the intestines of the scombrids, Grammatorcynus bicarinatus and Gr. bilineatus respectively. Grammatorcynicola n. g. differs from other dolichoenterine genera in having a simple sucker-like rhynchus, the ovary anterior to the testes and by not having a particularly thick cirrus-sac wall. Six new species of bucephalid trematodes from the prosorhynchine bucephalid genera Prosorhynchus Odhner, 1905 and Neidhartia Nagaty, 1937 are reported from the epinepheline serranid genera Cephalopholis, Cromileptes, Epinephelus and Variola from the GBR. Two species of Prosorhynchus and one Neidhartia are reported from Epinephelus spp., P. jexi n. sp. from E. quoyanus, P. lafii n. sp. from E. fuscoguttatus, and N. epinepheli n. sp. from E. maculatus. The other species are P. robertsthomsoni n. sp. from several species of Cephalopholis, P. conorjonesi n. sp. from Cromileptes altivelis, and P. milleri n. sp. from Variola louti. I examined three species of Plectropomus (Serranidae: Epinephelinae), Pl. laevis, Pl. leopardus and Pl. maculatus from off Heron Island and Lizard Island on the GBR. Nine bucephalid species from the Prosorhynchinae were found, three species of Neidhartia and six species of Prosorhynchus. The three species of Neidhartia, N. haywardi n. sp., N. plectropomi n. sp. and N. tyleri n. sp., are readily distinguishable by morphology. Two of the six species of Prosorhynchus (P. lesteri n. sp. and P. wrightae n. sp.) are easily distinguished from their other congeners by morphology but the other four species (P. adlardi n. sp., P. heronensis n. sp., P. munozae n. sp. and P. plectropomi n. sp.) are highly similar in morphology and were only distinguished convincingly by comparing their ITS2 rDNA sequences. Both P. adlardi n. sp. and P. wrightae n. sp. have also been found once in V. louti at Lizard Island. This is also the first study to identify life-cycle matches of the Bucephalidae using molecular techniques. I found two perfect life-cycle matches (identical sequences). The bivalve host of Prosorhynchoides lamprelli is a tellinid, Exotica clathrata; Rhipidocotyle sp. from the sphyraenid Sphyraena jello also has E. clathrata as its first intermediate host. Bayesian Inference Analysis shows that all seven species from bivalves that were sequenced belong to the Bucephalinae. Perhaps the most striking finding of the study was that one bivalve species, E. clathrata, was shown to harbour four separate species. Matching of ITS2 rDNA sequences between life-cycle stages is highly effective in circumstances of great richness such as the Great Barrier Reef. Based on my data collected, the total bucephalid species in the system is estimated to be 84.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300508 Parasitology</field><field name="subject">780105 Biological sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158287</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chinese EFL Learners' Pragmatic Competence in Requests</field><field name="creator">Wang, Xian</field><field name="description">This study examines the development of pragmatic competence in requests in two groups of Chinese EFL learners (advanced and intermediate) in a tertiary institute in Macau, China. The learners answer a written discourse completion test that contains ten scenarios where they request common services or ask for favours. The request behaviours are examined in terms of utterance length, strategy types, formulaic expressions, and modifications (internal and external). It is found that, compared with a group of native speakers of English, the learners have not developed native-like pragmatic behaviours. Although the advanced and the intermediate learner groups reach native-like distribution in STRATEGY TYPE for the scenarios taken together, statistically significant differences from the native group are observed in several individual scenarios (particularly with the intermediate learners). In addition, the two groups of learners employ formulaic expressions sharply differently from the native group in types and according to scenario. The learners do not use internal modifiers as frequently or situation-differentially as the native group: they do not show a strong preference for bi-clausal structures and conditionals in the scenarios of substantial favour asking. The learners employ elaborated external modifications and are verbose in requests. According to Bialystok&#146;s (1993, 1994) two-dimensional model of pragmatic competence, the learners are missing analytical knowledge of the scenario-specific behaviours, and their control ability is not fully developed. This study examines adult Chinese learners of English in a foreign language environment, and extends our knowledge of the development of request behaviours in children in second language environments (Achiba, 2003; Ellis, 1992). It also relates to the research on formulae in SLA (Wray, 2000, 2002; Kecskes, 2002) by providing empirical data on formulaic expressions in learners&#146; requests. It is further argued that further examination of interlanguage pragmatics should be (a) scenario-based, and (b) formulae-based.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">751000 Communication</field><field name="subject">380201 Applied Linguistics and Educational Linguistics</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158270</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sensitivity of bovine morulae and blastocysts to heat shock in vitro</field><field name="creator">Naik, Veena</field><field name="description">Bovine pre-implantation embryos are sensitive to high temperatures. The hyperthermia resulting from maternal heat stress leads to an increased loss of early stage embryos. The effects of hyperthermia appear to be more pronounced in the zygote than blastocyst stages. There is also evidence to suggest that B. indicus embryos show better resistance to heat shock as compared to B. taurus embryos. The mechanism of thermotolerance in B. indicus embryos is unknown and it is also unclear if the thermotolerance of these embryos is a result of maternal or paternal contributions. There is also evidence to suggest that male embryos survive heat shock better than female embryos. This research therefore aimed 1. To examine the effect of heat shock on day-7 bovine embryos 2. To study the influence of maternal and paternal genotype on the embryo's ability to survive up to 48 hours post heat shock treatment 3. To study the expression of HSP70 in heat-shocked and non-heat shocked embryos and compare B. indicus and B. taurus embryos. 4. To compare the effects of heat shock on rapidly developing (day-6 morulae) and slowly developing (day-7 morulae) embryos to heat shock treatments 5. To determine the effect of heat shock on the sex ratio of the surviving embryos The work described in this thesis used an in vitro protocol for heat shock studies on embryos, based on observed in vivo rectal temperature fluctuations in heat stressed cows. The first study examined the effects of heat shock on embryos at the morula or blastocyst stage on day 7 of in vitro culture. The embryos were produced in vitro from oocytes collected from ovaries of either pure breed B. indicus or B. taurus and fertilised by frozen semen straws of either B. indicus or B. taurus bulls. Day-7 morulae or blastocysts were used for the study. The embryos were subjected to heat shock (HS) (41.5&amp;degC) or non-heat shock (NHS) (39&amp;degC) temperatures. Embryo survival and development 48 hours (48 h) post treatment were recorded. The data were analysed using binary logistic regression using logit link function to determine the Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence limits for individual factors. The variables used as factors in the analysis were replicate, heat shock, maternal genotype (B. indicus vs B. taurus), paternal genotype (B. indicus vs B. taurus) and stage at which heat shock was applied (morula or blastocyst). The outcome variables used for analysis were the number of viable embryos from the total treated and the proportion reaching expanded or hatched blastocyst stage, and the proportion of male embryos. Heat shock significantly reduced the probability of embryo survival by more than half (OR = 0.47; P &#8804; 0.001) and reduced the probability of the embryo's progression to the expanded or hatched blastocyst stage by almost half (OR = 0.58; P = 0.005) as compared to NHS embryos. The probability of survival of embryos with B. indicus paternal genotype (confounded by the use of a single sire) was double (OR = 2.00; P = 0.002) that of embryos with B. taurus paternal genotype. The heat shock x paternal B. indicus genotype interaction was found to be non-significant. Maternal B. indicus genotype showed no influence on thermotolerance. Nevertheless, the probability of progression to expanded blastocysts for embryos with maternal B. indicus genotypes was double (OR = 2.05; P = 0.030) that of embryos with maternal B. taurus genotype. Comparison of day-7 morulae with day-7 blastocysts showed that the probability of day-7 blastocysts surviving until 48 h after treatment was almost two and half times greater (OR = 2.39; P &#8804; 0.001). The probability of survival of a blastocyst with paternal B. indicus genotype was almost twice (OR = 1.95; P = 0.041) when compared to a blastocyst with B. taurus paternal genotype. The interaction term of heat shock &#215; blastocyst stage was found to be significant (OR = 2.70; P = 0.038) indicating that blastocyst stage embryos were resistant to heat shock. The study showed a trend towards survival of more male embryos (61% males vs 39% females) under heat shock conditions (OR = 1.64; P = 0.070) indicating that male embryos may be resistant to heat shock. The second study was designed to detect the induced form of HSP70 in heat shocked and non-heat shocked day-7 bovine embryos and to compare the patterns between B. indicus embryos and B. taurus embryos. Comparison of confocal images showed that staining for HSP70 was present in most embryos whether heat shocked or not and found to be concentrated in the nuclei and cytoplasm. Heat shock appears to have increased HSP70 staining intensity in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, suggesting increased expression of HSP70 after heat shock. The same general staining patterns were seen in heat shocked and non-heat shocked embryos of B. indicus and B. taurus embryos. In the third experiment, embryos were examined for the effects of heat shock on day-7 or on day-6 of their in vitro culture. The data were analysed to study the effects of heat shock, stage at heat shock (day-7 blastocysts vs day-7 morulae) and day of heat shock (day-7 vs day-6) on embryo survival and progression to expanded or hatched blastocysts 48 h post treatment. We found that heat shock reduced the probability of survival by more than half (OR = 0.40; P = 0.004). Probability of survival of day-7 embryos (confounded by rapidly developing blastocysts and slow developing morulae) was less than half (OR = 0.36; P = 0.008), that of day-6 embryos. The data were then analysed to study the effects of heat shock on day-7 blastocysts and day-7 morulae for embryo survival post treatment. Heat shock negatively affected embryo survival (OR = 0.35; P = 0.007). The probability of day-7 blastocysts surviving HS and NHS was more than two and a half times greater (OR = 2.71; P = 0.008) than that of day-7 morulae. No interaction of heat shock and blastocyst stage was noticed. Subsequently the effects of heat shock and the effects of the day of heat shock on morula stage embryos were examined. Overall, heat shock reduced the probability of survival (OR = 0.35; P = 0.009) and the probability of embryo development to the expanded or hatched blastocysts (OR = 0.35; P &#8804; 0.001), 48 h post treatment. The probability of day-6 morulae surviving HS and NHS was almost three times higher (OR = 2.81; P = 0.007) than that of day-7 morulae. The interaction of stage of development with heat shock was not significant. We concluded that an embryo that was capable of developing to the blastocyst stage by day-7 or morula stage by day-6 had better survival and higher probability of progressing to expanded or hatched stage when compared to an embryo that had slow development (day-7 morulae). The study showed a significantly different effect of heat shock on the survival of male and female embryos (63% males vs 36% females, OR = 1.79; P = 0.014). In our final study, embryos were produced from three different bulls each of B. indicus or B. taurus genotype. Heat shock effects consistently and negatively affected survival of embryos (OR = 0.29; P &#8804; 0.001) and their ability to progress to the expanded or hatched blastocysts (OR = 0.42; P &#8804; 0.001). Embryos with paternal B. indicus genotype showed no advantage of survival over embryos with paternal B. taurus genotype embryos. When the day-7 blastocysts were compared with the day-7 morulae, the probability of day-7 blastocysts surviving HS or NHS was more than double (OR = 2.23; P = 0.009) that of day-7 morulae. In this study the effect of survival of the interaction term of heat shock treatment with the blastocyst stage was significant and negative (OR = 0.49; P = 0.040). However the interaction term of blastocyst stage x HS for an embryo&#146;s ability to progress to expanded or hatched blastocyst stage was positive (OR = 2.00; P = 0.052), indicating that the embryos that did survive heat shock were capable of continuing their developmental progress. Although more male embryos (55% male vs 45% female) survived heat shock, the effect for this study was non-significant. In summary, the studies described in this thesis successfully tested a new in vitro heat shock protocol based on in vivo temperature changes experienced by heat stressed cows. Heat shock was consistent in negatively affecting embryo survival. Heat shock also negatively affected the embryo's progression to the expanded or hatched blastocyst stage by 48 h post treatment. We observed variable cytoplasmic and nuclear staining for HSP70 in day-7 blastocysts of both B. indicus and B. taurus. This distribution did not change dramatically after heat shock, but staining appeared to be more intense in heat shocked embryos, suggesting that there was increased expression of HSP70 after heat shock. No difference in this pattern was observed between B. indicus and B. taurus embryos. The speed of development of an embryo until being subjected to either heat shock or non heat shock temperatures affected the probability of survival and further development. However, the interaction term of day-7 blastocyst stage and heat shock was inconsistent, meaning that the rate of development appeared to specifically protect against heat shock in some studies while in the other studies, the apparent protective effect extended to control as well as heat shocked embryos. Our study found no significant influence of B. indicus paternal genotype on embryo survival. Our study showed evidence of B. indicus maternal genotype influence on the embryo's ability to progress to expanded blastocysts but not on embryo survival. The study found a clear trend towards an increased proportion of male embryos surviving heat shock conditions. In some studies this was significant, and in others it was not, but the trend was always in the same direction. This suggests that male embryos are more resistant to the effects of heat shock in vitro.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300402 Animal Reproduction</field><field name="subject">630103 Beef cattle</field><field name="subject">Sensitivity</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158248</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Outside Orders : Religious Faith and Practice of the Laity in Twelfth and Thirteenth-Century France Based on Chansons de Geste of the Charlemagne Cycle</field><field name="creator">Smith, Kay Lynette</field><field name="description">The centuries under discussion in this thesis, the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, were a time of great change in practice of the rituals of the Christian church in Europe as well as in the development of their underlying theology. And the society that this thesis will investigate, the French speaking people of north western Europe, was the theatre in which much of that debate and change took place. The opinions and arguments of the erudite from that time and place are well known. Studies of their interactions illustrate the existence of many schools and individuals whose deliberations were written down, and which supply ample material to modern scholars who research the theological development of the time. However, what is not so abundantly documented is the impact that religion had on the lay and sometimes illiterate Christians of the day. If, in fact, they did debate their religious beliefs and practices, their debates were not written down for posterity to read. Their opinions can only be accessed obliquely. This thesis takes the form of small social history, history from the lower echelons of society rather than the higher, that plumbs the experiences of ordinary people whose opinions were not important enough to occupy the scholars and administrators of the day. In this case a branch of their literature in the vernacular will be used as source material. I propose drawing out a picture of what the people of the time believed, and how they expressed that belief in action, through a close reading of the popular medieval genre of the chanson de geste. The subject has been broached before, by Carl Josef Merk in 1914, Adolphe Jacques Dickman in 1926, Marianna Gildea in 1943 and J-L. Roland B&#233;langer in 1975. This study will differ from previous studies in its concentration on only one cycle of poems and the depth of examination of those poems. Where Merk, Gildea and Dickman used many poems, almost the entire available corpus, and B&#233;langer used a mixture of the poems of the Loherain Cycle and other earlier chansons, this study will be confined to the poems of the Charlemagne Cycle. The poems of one cycle grew out of a common store of subject matter, in this case stories surrounding the great eighth and ninth century king, Charlemagne. By the time of the production and recording of chansons, Charlemagne had acquired legendary status and been credited with conquests and journeys that he never made in his lifetime. He represented an ideal of kingship and his actions were the actions of the ideal Christian conqueror, a monarch who, with his people, was loved by God and guided and assisted by God in all he undertook. For the most part the stories about him involved the conquest and conversion of non-Christian people. Consequently, although the poems are not overtly concerned with religious teaching or religious practice, their subject matter is imbued with religious language and significance. It is the religious significance of the language and subject matter of these poems and the similarity of the hierarchical structure of the society described to the conjectured celestial structure that makes these poems suitable as subject matter for this study. Eleven poems have been chosen for study, nine concerned with conquest of non- Christian people and two with the existence of traitors among the followers of the king. These two poems add the dimension of loyalty to one&#146;s monarch and preservation of the status quo to that of warfare against non-Christians. The findings are set out in two sections, one concerned with rituals that mark the milestones in the protagonists&#146; lives and the other with more spontaneous expressions of faith. Conclusions are drawn from each section and then melded to give an overall picture of the faith of the laity of the time. Where parallels or contrasts with the practice accepted and prescribed by the ecclesiastical establishment are detected, these are examined in the relevant chapters.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">780199 Other</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158226</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Emperor and the Roman Elite from Commodus to Maximinus (A.D. 180-238)</field><field name="creator">Davenport, Caillan James Roderick</field><field name="description">Rome had twelve masters between the years A.D. 180-238, eleven of whom were murdered or killed in battle. The age of the Antonines came to an end with the death of Commodus and four years of divisive civil war. The eventual victor, Septimius Severus, established a new dynasty, but it was short-lived, coming to an ignominious end in a camp on the Rhine. Thus began the era of the soldier emperors. This thesis will argue that the rapid turnover of emperors in these fifty-eight years precipitated a crisis among the Roman elite. Senators and equestrians competed with each other, and with less exalted members of society, such as freedmen, to become members of the emperor&#146;s inner circle. Dio Cassius, a senator who began his Roman History during the reign of Septimius Severus, serves as an effective contemporary witness to the upheavals taking place at court and within society at large. Contrary to the views of scholars such as Crook and Syme, who place great emphasis on the continuity of policy provided by the emperor&#146;s amici, this thesis will demonstrate that there was significant discontinuity at the imperial court. Imperial advisers were not a fixed group retained from reign to reign &#150; instead, each new emperor chose to install his own supporters in key positions in order to put his own stamp on the administration of the empire. This has given rise to a tendency to label some rulers as &#145;anti-senatorial&#146; and others as &#145;pro-senatorial&#146;. Even those emperors who executed large numbers of senators, such as Commodus and Septimius Severus, had amici from within the senate whom they trusted and relied upon. The favour bestowed on such senators who formed part of the emperors&#146; exclusive cabal was a source of continual tension among the Roman elite. The amici formed a heterogeneous group, whose only common link was that they had earned the favour of the emperor of the day.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">430110 History - Classical Greek and Roman</field><field name="subject">780199 Other</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158140</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transformative Power in Motherwork: A Study of Mothering in the 1950s and 1960s</field><field name="creator">Porter, Marie</field><field name="description">In this thesis I explore the experiences of a group of Australian women who became first-time mothers between 1950 and 1965.

I argue that despite being constrained by the gender bias in the patriarchal context, these mothers were agents who developed skills that enabled them to resist or creatively deal with the constraints they faced. Their emphasis was on their agency and the power to nurture their children into responsible adults. Their awareness of the importance of their motherwork acted as a motivator in this development. My thesis is that the relationship between each mother and each of her children is a transformative power relationship in which both mother and child are transformedthe child into an independent adult and the mother into a skilled self-motivated agent through her mothenvork. Any threat to this process resulted in the mother doing all she could to resist or counteract the constraintls she was encountering. Transformative power expressed in motherwork can be recognised analytically by several characteristics. It empowers both parties in the motherlchild duality. Complexity, diversity, fluidity, and responsiveness to the physical, intellectual, and emotional aspects of the relationship are all evident in transformative power relationships. Through their own transformation, the mothers saw the falsity of the master narratives of motherhood, prevalent in society in the 1950s and 1960s, which they had believed as inexperienced girls. From their stories about motherwork, I reveal a counter narrative that was portrayed not only in their telling of their stories: but in their discursivelreflexive practices as mothers.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">370104 Urban Sociology and Community Studies</field><field name="subject">440207 Religion and Society</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158105</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Service recovery: A re-conceptualisation</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Doan Thuy Thi</field><field name="description">Despite considerable effort by organisations to provide excellent service, service failures occur. Increasingly, as the business environment becomes more dynamic and complex, it is unrealistic to expect service delivery to be completely error free (Bansal and Taylor 1999; Keaveney 1995a). When service failure occurs, firms are advised to put in effort to recover customers, because lost customers typically result in substantial financial and reputational loss (Hogan, Lemon and Libai 2003). Moreover, building relationships with customers is always considered as an ideal approach to avoid customers&#146; dissatisfaction with the recovery attempt. However, it appears that the majority (81%) of customers who complain are not happy with the complaint handling process (TARP 2001). The high percentage of dissatisfied customers suggests that current approaches to recovery are largely ineffective (Davidow 2003). In searching for explanations for the ineffectiveness of service recovery strategies, a programmatic research study was conducted. Study 1 is a qualitative study, including Study 1A and Study 1B. Study 1A was conducted on 199 consumer complaint letters, and Study 1B was conducted using 22 in-depth interviews. Study 2 is a quantitative study conducted on a consumer sample of 431 respondents. Study 2A is a scale development study and Study 2B is a structural equation modelling study. The research program is reported in seven chapters. Chapter 1 provides an overview of the thesis. Chapter 2 reviews service recovery literature. Chapter 3 outlines the methodology. Chapter 4 reports the results of Study 1. Chapters 5 and 6 report results of Study 2. Finally, Chapter 7 presents the conclusions, key theoretical and managerial implications, limitations, and suggestions for future research. In sum, the thesis proposes a conceptualisation of service recovery by providing a model that highlights the different aspects of the relationships between the following constructs: (1) Customer Recovery Expectations; (2) Purchase Deliberation Recollection; (3) Customer Emotional Attachment; and (4) customer&#146;s Recovery Expectation Disconfirmation. Customer Recovery Expectations concept reflects the customer&#146;s perception of an appropriate recovery attempt that they prefer in a particular service recovery context. Purchase Deliberation Recollection reflects the customer&#146;s recalled time and effort invested in the purchase deliberation process. Customer Emotional Attachment captures the emotional connection between the customer and the service provider that motivates the customer to act in the provider&#146;s interest. Lastly, the customer&#146;s Recovery Expectation Disconfirmation describes the customer&#146;s comparison between their preferred recovery solution and their received recovery solution. The relationships between these constructs significantly influence the two dependent variables: the customer&#146;s satisfaction with recovery and their repurchase intention. The findings highlight that, in service recovery, creating a customer&#146;s positive perception of recovery expectation matching attempt is the key. To affect this, employees should understand that the customer has a recovery expectation which the organisation should attempt to match. In addition, customers with a good and long term relationship with the organisation tend to have more sympathy when service failure occurs. However, long term customers may also be more demanding and have higher expectations than short term customers. When the organisation fails to recover the service failure for a long term customer, the negative effect of not appropriately recovering may outweigh the positive benefits of having a relationship. Therefore, once a good relationship has been built, organisations should be prepared to invest more resources to maintain it through time. That is, a relationship should be maintained in normal as well as in service failure situations. The findings thus have significant theoretical and managerial implications.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">350204 Marketing and Market Research</field><field name="subject">720401 Marketing</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158081</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Planctomycete diversity and cell biology: perspectives from the molecular, cellular and organism levels</field><field name="creator">Butler, Margaret Kay</field><field name="description">The Planctomycetes are a deep branching phylum of the domain Bacteria that incorporate a diverse group of organisms possessing a number of unusual and distinct characteristics. These features include budding reproduction, the planctomycetecharacteristic crateriform structures on their cell surface, a cell wall that lacks peptidoglycan, internal compartmentalisation and unique molecular features of their rRNA genes. This study chose to investigate a number of aspects of planctomycete cell biology and diversity to further our knowledge of this unique group. In a study of the diversity of ribonuclease P (RNase P) RNA, one molecule of relevance to cell biology and compartmentalisation in planctomycetes, RNase P RNA genes were sequenced for species from all genera of planctomycetes for which a pure culture exists. Secondary structures for RNase P RNA of these strains were deduced, taking to 26 the number of planctomycete RNase P RNA structures. Nucleotide positions were identified in which some planctomycetes possess a less common form, including one thought to be otherwise conserved within all Bacteria and Archaea. Phylogenetic analysis of RNase P RNA genes was relatively consistent with that of 16S rRNA genes with the exception that clustering of Gemmata and anammox sequences occurred, possibly due to either long-branch attraction or lateral gene transfer. Analysis of RNase P RNA secondary structures revealed unusual features of planctomycetes relative to all other bacteria, including an additional helix within the P13 helix of &#145;Candidatus Brocadia anammoxidans&#146;, &#145;Candidatus Kuenenia stuttgartiensis&#146; and all Gemmata sequences. The longest P12 helix of any bacteria type A RNase P RNA was found in a Gemmatalike isolate. The short tandem repeats in P12 helices of two Gemmata-like isolates are possibly analogous to short tandem repetitive repeat sequences of some cyanobacteria RNase P RNA. In experiments using Gemmata obscuriglobus as a model for planctomycete cell biology and compartmentalisation functions, electron microscope-level in situ hybridisation (EMISH), and subsequent statistical analysis, was developed to localise 16S rRNA, 23S rRNA and RNase P RNA to particular regions within Gemmata obscuriglobus, the first instance of EMISH being applied in this way to bacteria. Statistical analysis localised 16S rRNA to both nuclear body and to riboplasm outside this region but it was absent from paryphoplasm. While co-localisation of both 16S rRNA and 23S rRNA molecules, which might indicate assembled ribosomes, was rarely observed, 23S rRNA, like 16S rRNA, was distributed in both riboplasm-containing areas of the cell. While statistical analysis revealed minor DNA within riboplasm outside the nuclear body, the majority was localised to that body. These results suggest at least some uncoupling of translation from transcription involving ribosomes in the riboplasm. RNase P RNA was localised both to the nuclear body and to the riboplasm outside this region, suggesting that pre-tRNA processing occurs both within nuclear body, where RNA transcripts are presumably generated, and outside nuclear body, separated from the origin of these transcripts. This is also consistent with the hypothesis that processed tRNA is required in the riboplasm outside the nuclear body, due to occurrence of some uncoupled translation. In research on planctomycetes not yet examined with respect to cell plan or structure, 16S rRNA gene sequencing of isolate ATCC 35122 confirmed its very close relationship to the type strain of Pirellula staleyi and its membership of the phylum Planctomycetes. Morphological characteristics, including polar crateriform structures and the occurrence of a unique internal, single membrane-bounded compartment enclosing nucleoid and ribosome-like particles, the pirellulosome, and a polar cap region, are also consistent with its membership of the planctomycetes and of genus Pirellula. Cells often displayed pointed, hump-like protrusions opposite each other on the cell, constituting prosthecae. Also re-examined using a number of methods were uncultured species Planctomyces bekefii and Pl. guttaeformis. Samples could be enriched for Pl. bekefii via either addition of ferric citrate or ampicillin. An application of a novel approach, laser microdissection and pressure catapulting, was also used physically to enrich P. bekefii rosettes. Fluorescent in situ hybridisation provided the first molecular evidence of Pl. bekefii and Pl. guttaeformis as Planctomycetes. Also confirming Planctomycetes membership of Pl. bekefii was the presence of a cytoplasm divided into two regions by an intracytoplasmic membrane, consistent with membership to the genus Planctomyces. Two new planctomycete-like organisms, MBLW1 and MBLW2, were isolated in this study and possessed a Gemmata-like cell plan. 16S rRNA gene sequencing confirmed these isolates belonged to the Gemmata clade within phylum Planctomycetes, though they may comprise a separate but closely related genus. Via EMISH, both ATCC 35122 and MBLW1 were hybridised with a planctomycete-specific probe, consistent with membership to the planctomycetes. Statistical analysis showed that 16S rRNA was present in both regions of the riboplasm of MBLW1, identical to the distribution observed G. obscuriglobus. This is another example of possible uncoupled translation within a member of the planctomycetes and within organisms in the Gemmata clade of planctomycetes.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270399 Microbiology not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158079</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Handwriting of eight year old children with and without autistic spectrum disorder</field><field name="creator">Cartmill, Linda Joan</field><field name="description">Anecdotally it was found that Queensland occupational therapists reported a surprisingly high referral rate for handwriting problems amongst school aged children with Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD). A subsequent review of the literature revealed a number of anecdotal reports of disordered handwriting in this population but limited research in the area. This thesis presents a descriptive and exploratory study of the nature of handwriting in eight year old children with and without ASD. Issues of handwriting development and motor learning are canvassed followed by an examination of concepts of motor control. Next follows a review of current handwriting models. The Systems Model of Handwriting was proposed as a response to the evidence for both dynamic and motor programme aspects of handwriting. Using this model as an organizing structure, the literature on ASD and handwriting was then examined which led to the framing of three research questions: 1. Is the handwriting speed of children with ASD significantly different from that of children without ASD? 2. Is the handwriting legibility of children with ASD significantly different from that of children without ASD? 3. At what stage/s of the Sequential Handwriting Process, is the handwriting of children with ASD different from that of children without ASD? Twenty-eight eight year old children with ASD and a matched control group of twentyeight comparison children were recruited from state primary schools in Brisbane and surrounding areas. These fifty-six children were assessed on thirteen handwriting process variables and two handwriting outcome variables in order to answer the research questions. Data produced were analyzed primarily with t-tests for between group differences and by examination of correlations between process and outcome variables. Small but measurable differences were found in both speed and legibility between the two groups, with the handwriting of the children with ASD being both less legible (t=- 2.47, df=54, p=0.02) and slower (t=-2.47, df=54, p=0.02). Accuracy of letter formation was also found to be significantly worse for the children with ASD compared to children in the control group (t=3.53, df=54, p=0.001). Further, the two groups were found to differ in some aspects of the Sequential Handwriting Process. Specifically, the children with ASD showed significant correlations between legibility and Perceiving, Conceptualizing and Planning stages, while the comparison children showed significant correlations between legibility and Interpreting, Conceptualizing, Planning and Activating stages. Only one process variable (consistency of letter formation) showed a moderate correlation with handwriting speed &#150; all other variables were of only slight to fair strength. Finally, the implications of the research findings are discussed, limitations described and directions for future research canvassed. As a result of the present study, a revised Systems Model of Handwriting is proposed. Several recommendations for occupational therapy intervention in handwriting practices in the classroom are made, notably: clear and focussed initial tuition of letter formation and secondly, the development of automaticity of the handwriting skill.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158068</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating re-purchase intention in an experiential context using operations and marketing perspectives</field><field name="creator">Hume, Margee</field><field name="description">Abstract The purpose of this thesis is to undertake theory development and testing particular to re-purchase intention in an experiential service context, specifically the cultural performing arts. Services researchers suggest implementing a multi-disciplinary approach to research that uses theories and methods from several of the management fields will advance the domain of services research. This thesis aims to contribute to the field of service research by drawing from methods and theories offered in both service operations and services marketing fields. To date, service research has been preoccupied primarily with consumer behaviour aspects of services marketing such as satisfaction but underestimates the importance of constructs such as re-purchase intention and the subsequent implications for strategy formulation and implementation. Further to this, the current approach to services research has overlooked the nexus between marketing and operations and the importance of the implementation of strategy to achieve objectives. It is argued that failing to integrate service operations both practically and theoretically into the re-purchase intentions research framework confines its potential effectiveness. In addition, the lack of specific service context application has been identified as a significant oversight in previous services research. Construct measurements and findings have been difficult to replicate across contexts and contextual examination of constructs and relationships has been suggested as a solution. One such context deserving of attention is that of the experiential services, specifically the performing arts. Therefore, using measures and theories developed specifically for this context, this thesis will offer a more comprehensive approach to re-purchase intention research in a performing arts setting. This thesis adopts a mixed method approach by implementing a series of three integrated studies, which amalgamates both operations and marketing fields. This thesis aims to identify the aspects of a performing arts encounter that are relevant to the customer by conducting a two-staged set of qualitative interviews. This process is based on the operations technique Service Transaction Analysis (STA). First, consultant consumers and organisational personnel were used to formulate a consensus definition of a typical performing arts experience and, second, 26 in-depth interviews were conducted with potential future consumers of the performing arts based on this description of the offering. These two studies, coupled with extant literature, informed the research instrument designed for the main survey. This instrument was conducted on 273 potential future consumers of the performing arts. Qualitative work undertaken in Study 1 identifies the service experience description. Study 2 highlights the service management and marketing issues relating to re-purchase intention especially focusing on value, customer satisfaction, show experience and service quality and discloses a set of specific issues incorporated into the wording of the survey instrument. Study 3 measures and tests the key constructs of service quality, show experience, value, satisfaction and the significance of the hypothesised pathways to re-purchase intention. The proposed model is then analysed using the AMOS 5.0 Structural Equation Modelling package. This thesis is structured in the journal paper format with each of the chapters representing each of the five journal papers. In addition, an introductory and concluding chapter are appended with the concluding chapter providing an in-depth discussion of the contributions of this thesis. The papers are based on the progressive results of the research program and offer an integrated set of findings and discussions. The papers are not mutually exclusive but interrelated to comprehensively illuminate the central research theme of the thesis and discuss many aspects of marketing and operations significant to re-purchase intention. The entire thesis is drawn from the data set generated from the three integrated studies developed to address the overall research theme. The central research theme is to investigate the nature of re-purchase intention in an experiential setting using marketing and operations theories as platforms of analysis. Interestingly, the tested model of this thesis found empirically that the subjective and experiential aspects of the service, such as the emotional and artistic quality of the show, did not have a significant and direct relationship with re-purchase intention. This finding is of interest, in particular, to scholars of experiential consumption and marketing practitioners offering these types of services. Previous research has supported the desire to fulfil experiential needs as driving the initial purchase. Conversely, this finding suggests that the desire to visit again is driven by utility and value. As customer maintenance and repeat patronage are of utmost importance to practice, this is an exciting development. Offering further support, the tested model found service quality and show experience were mediated by value to satisfaction, with satisfaction inturn mediating the relationship between value and re-purchase intention. Collectively, these findings have lead to several developments and contributions for both scholarship and practice. The contributions to knowledge of this thesis highlight five main theoretical contributions and four main managerial implications. These encompass: &#183; Advancing the &#145;service management trinity&#146;, specifically strengthening the importance of the relationship between service marketing and service operations. &#183; Advancing service management theory by understanding the service offering more intricately and the importance of service description. &#183; Clarifying the roles of experiential and utilitarian attributes of the service experience in an experiential setting extending knowledge related to re-purchase intention. &#183; Particularizing and measuring the construct of re-purchase intention to the performing arts and clarifying the predictors of this construct in the context of experiential performing arts. . &#183; Testing and clarifying the relationships of value and satisfaction to re-purchase intention extending the understanding of re-purchase intention in this field and elaborating the approach and understanding of this construct for future research. This thesis further contributes to knowledge by offering several managerial contributions. These incorporate: &#183; Market segmentation and targeting strategies as critical for performing arts management. &#183; Operations service design and creation strategies in the performing arts by including important aspects of the service experience as highlighted by customer driven research. &#183; Specific recommendation for streamlining delivery through standardised mass customisation. &#183; Offering value frameworks for creating value in service delivery and targeting customer perceptions of superior value. This extending the understanding of the customer perceived value equation. By contributing to the field of service management and advancing enquiry in the field of services marketing and service operations, this thesis offers a new perspective and practical approach to service marketing context analysis making a valuable contribution to scholarship. This approach is based on improving organisational performance in experiential services specifically by applying operations and marketing theory from a customer-perspective. By doing this, findings inform organisations of ways to better meet the needs and wants of consumers through design, delivery and marketing. Moreover, the findings assist researchers in further advancing the field of services research. This research positions the future research program to focus on continuing the advancement of service management by examining the higher order constructs of service quality and show experience and examining the impact of additional customer motivations such as emotional goal attainment and involvement in experiential settings.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">720401 Marketing</field><field name="subject">350204 Marketing and Market Research</field><field name="subject">services marketing</field><field name="subject">services operations</field><field name="subject">performing arts</field><field name="subject">service quality</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158043</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Late Silurian to Middle Devonian acanthodians of eastern Australia</field><field name="creator">Burrow, Carole J</field><field name="description">The acanthodians were a common and widespread group of fishes throughout the world during the mid-Palaeozoic. In this study, a full-scale systematic analysis of Silurian to Middle Devonian acanthodian taxa of eastern Australia was undertaken, incorporating a review and updating of historical records and descriptions of taxa. Phylogenetic relationships within the group and with other early gnathostomes are uncertain. The structure, function and modes of growth of acanthodian scales were described and investigated, and these features were used for comparisons between different taxa within the group, and between acanthodians and other early vertebrates. Histological and morphological characters of the scales were incorporated in a cladistic analysis of genera erected for articulated fish. This analysis did not support the traditional ordinal level groups, the Climatiida, Ischnacanthida and Acanthodida. Therefore, the highest taxonomic level used in the study was the family. Rarely were acanthodians preserved as articulated fossils. The only examples known from the Silurian-Middle Devonian of Australia are one specimen of the putative acanthodian Yealepis douglasi Burrow &amp; Young 1999 from the Ludlow of Victoria, five specimens of an indeterminate ?ischnacanthidid from the late Givetian of New South Wales and a rich assemblage from the Givetian lacustrine shales of Mt Howitt, Victoria. The latter fauna (originally dated as Late Devonian) includes six incomplete specimens of the culmacanthidid Culmacanthus stewarti Long 1983 and about 60 specimens of acanthodidid Howittacanthus kentoni Long 1986. In contrast, disassociated remains of the group are ubiquitous in microvertebrate faunas from the mid-Palaeozoic of eastern Australia. Although scales of other fish groups are sometimes more common in particular facies, acanthodian elements are found in all depositional environments, from deep shelf marine to transitional to freshwater. Most of the taxa, particularly those only preserved as isolated scales, had not been systematically described by other workers. This thesis incorporates descriptions of new taxa, and revision and updating of other taxa. Several overseas studies have produced biostratigraphic charts based on acanthodian scales. A similar biostratigraphic overview was undertaken based on a systematic analysis of the Early Devonian acanthodians of eastern Australia, permitting comparisons with acanthodian faunas of other regions. Acanthodian scales and fin spines are the most common elements in the few vertebrate faunas that are known from the Silurian of Australia. Diversity and geographic distribution of the acanthodian faunas peaked during the Early Devonian. This study has been hampered by the low numbers of scales in many samples, and by uncertainty over their dating (particularly for the faunas from non-limestone deposits). Nevertheless, the work shows that changes in the marine assemblages are broadly correlated with the pattern of marine transgressions and regressions. Composition of the acanthodian faunas, and their abundance relative to other vertebrates in the assemblages, depend on the depositional environment. This correlation is best illustrated in Lower Devonian deposits, in which acanthodians are the most prolific and diverse. In transitional and marginal marine deposits, thelodonts are dominant, and acanthodians a minor element of the fauna. In off-shore assemblages, acanthodians and placoderms are dominant, and thelodonts are rare or absent. Vertebrate faunas are poor in the earliest Devonian deposits, but become more common by the late Lochkovian, with near-shore assemblages characterized by Trundlelepis cervicostulata and ANostolepis@ guangxiensis, and deeper shelf assemblages by a new genus, possibly assignable to the Ischnacanthidae. The vertebrate record is sparse through the middle Pragian, though AN.@ guangxiensis is present low in the Coopers Creek Limestone (upper sulcatus-pireneae zones), being replaced by Nostolepoides platymarginata, Gomphonchus? bogongensis, and Radioporacanthodes sp. aff. R. (Gomphonchus) liujingensis by the kindlei Zone. Microvertebrate assemblages are more common by the late Pragian (pireneae Zone), with Radioporacanthodes sp. aff. R. liujingensis in deeper shelf deposits, and N. platymarginata and G.? bogongensis dominating near-shore assemblages. The earliest Emsian (dehiscens Zone) is marked by the incoming Cheiracanthoides wangi. Middle Emsian (perbonus-serotinus zones) assemblages are characterized by two new species, possibly assignable to Gomphonchus.The Middle Devonian cosmopolitan association of Cheiracanthoides comptus and AAcanthoides@ dublinensis, which characterizes early Middle Devonian faunas from North America, Europe and China, appears first in the latest Emsian at the serotinus-patulus zone boundary. As well as showing the value of acanthodians in biostratigraphy and as indicators of environmental settings, their use in biogeography was demonstrated. Although many of the acanthodian taxa are endemic, several are also found in other regions. The Silurian to earliest Devonian faunas of eastern Australia are most closely related to coeval Chinese assemblages. Several latest Silurian-earliest Devonian taxa are also recorded from the circum-Arctic region. The late Lochkovian to early Emsian assemblages, particularly from south-eastern Australia, have many taxa in common with Chinese faunas. The mid-Emsian taxa show highest endemicity; and the latest Emsian-Eifelian assemblages have the most cosmopolitan aspect. Acanthodian faunas become rarer and depauperate in the Middle Devonian, particularly in the south-eastern corner, and are mostly in poorly dated, ?fluviatile/marginal marine deposits. This study of acanthodian faunas has encompassed a full scale systematic review of the group in this region, an appraisal of phylogenetic relationships within the group and with other early vertebrates, their palaeoecology, and their use in biostratigraphy and biogeography.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">260112 Palaeontology</field><field name="subject">780105 Biological sciences</field><field name="subject">Acanthodii</field><field name="subject">Devonian</field><field name="subject">Silurian</field><field name="subject">bistratigraphy</field><field name="subject">biogeography</field><field name="subject">eastern Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157975</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study on diffusion and flow of sub-critical hydrocarbons in activated carbon</field><field name="creator">BAE, Jun-Seok</field><field name="description">This thesis deals with diffusion and flow of sub-critical hydrocarbons in activated carbon by using a differential permeation method. The hydrocarbons are selected according to the effect on environmental concerns and their unique characteristics such as polarity and affinity towards activated carbon. Although it has been known that transport processes in activated carbon consist of Knudsen diffusion, gaseous viscous flow, adsorbed phase diffusion (so called, surface diffusion) and condensate flow, there have been no rigorous models to describe the transport processes in activated carbon with a full range of pressures. In particular among the four processes, the mechanism of adsorbed phase diffusion in activated carbon is still far from complete understanding. Also due to the dispersion interactions between adsorbing molecules and the solid surface, one would expect that Knudsen diffusion is influenced by the dispersive forces. From intensive experimental observations with a great care over a full range of pressures, conventional methods (for example, direct estimation from inert gas experiments) to determine adsorbed phase diffusion are found to be inadequate for strongly adsorbing vapors in activated carbon. By incorporating the effect of adsorbate-adsorbent interactions into Knudsen diffusivity, the general behavior of adsorbed phase diffusion in terms of pressure (or surface loading) can be obtained, showing a significant role in transport at low pressures. For non-polar hydrocarbons such as benzene, carbon tetrachloride and n-hexane, a mathematical model, which accounts for the effects of adsorbate-adsorbent interactions and pore size distribution, is formulated and validated, resulting in a good agreement with experimental data. Moreover, the adsorption and dynamic behaviors of alcohol molecules (which are polar compounds) are investigated with an aim to compare their behaviors against those of non-polar compounds.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">670700 Industrial Chemicals and Related Products</field><field name="subject">surface diffusion</field><field name="subject">hydrocarbons</field><field name="subject">activated carbon</field><field name="subject">transport phenomena</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157965</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Establishing the efficacy of telemedicine as a clinical tool for physiotherapists: From systems design to a randomised controlled trial</field><field name="creator">Russell, Trevor Glen</field><field name="description">High quality health services are often difficult to access in rural and remote areas of Australia. This is due to a shortage of health care professionals and specialists, inadequate and poorly distributed resources, and the tyranny of distance. The result is a reduced level of health and a higher mortality rate than seen in urban communities. Telemedicine, which is the use of various technologies to deliver a range of health care services over a distance, has the potential to increase equity and access to health care in rural and remote areas. To date there has been a poor uptake of telemedicine technology within the profession of physiotherapy. This undoubtedly stems from the perceived, and indeed, real difficulty of performing what is traditionally &#145;hands on&#146; therapy, via an electronic medium. Added to this is a paucity of rigorous clinical outcome studies to demonstrate the efficacy of performing successful treatment via this delivery method. The aim of this thesis was to establish the efficacy of telemedicine as a clinical tool for physiotherapists. To achieve this, the first major undertaking was the development of a telemedicine system to meet the unique needs of clinical physiotherapists and their patients. A series of studies was then performed to calibrate the system and establish its validity and reliability as a clinical assessment tool. Finally, a randomised controlled trial was conducted to assess the treatment efficacy of the telemedicine system. The telemedicine system was constructed using a human systems development approach, with close consultation with senior clinical physiotherapists and potential users of the system. The personal computer-based system was designed to connect patients in their home with physiotherapists in the hospital, via low-speed and low-cost communications. The system incorporated real-time videoconferencing and physical measurement tools to enable the remote assessment of patients. The validity and reliability of the telemedicine physical measurement tools were established through a series of five studies. The results demonstrated these measurements to be accurate and reliable, under various measurement conditions, when compared to reference instruments. A prospective randomised controlled trial was conducted to assess the treatment efficacy of the telemedicine system. The research model chosen for this study was the rehabilitation of subjects who had undergone total knee replacement surgery. Block randomisation was used to assign 65 participants to either a traditional face-to-face therapy group or a telemedicine rehabilitation group. Participants in both groups received treatment over a six week period. Data analysis focussed on comparing physical and functional rehabilitation outcomes achieved in each treatment group. The results of this study demonstrated that the rehabilitation outcomes produced via the telemedicine system were similar to those achieved in the traditional manner. Additionally, the telemedicine therapy was found to produce greater improvements in a number of functional outcome measurements. A high level of satisfaction was expressed by participants who received treatment via the telemedicine method. This thesis provides evidence of the efficacy of telemedicine as a clinical tool for physiotherapists. Furthermore, the work detailed in this thesis represents one of the first randomised control trials in telerehabilitation and makes a significant contribution towards the knowledge of low-bandwidth telemedicine in general.

The current industry is based on broad diameter wools harvested from sheep grazing poor quality native pastures, and sheep suffer low growth rates, poor productivity and high mortality, and farmers rely on small flocks to produce a single commodity for their total income. The dramatic collapse of wool markets in the 1980&#146;s crippled the Falklands&#146; wool industry and farmers have relied heavily on subsidies for more than 12 years. The studies in this thesis were initiated to support the efforts to reinvigorate Falklands&#146; agriculture, and they examined basic aspects of the nutrition provided to sheep by native pastures and evaluated practical methods to improve the survival of sheep, their subsequent rate of growth and productive value to the economy. Five studies examined specific hypotheses posed at the outset of the research programme and they were broadly supported by the data presented in the thesis: &#183; A wether trial was used to benchmark the productivity of wool sheep in the Islands, and the trial demonstrated that substantial genetic variation exists within the national flock that may be exploited in the future to improve the productivity of the wool industry, &#183; Microhistological techniques were used in conjunction with n-alkane marker technology to investigate the diets consumed by sheep grazing native pastures. The diet studies concluded that the low quality of native pasture in the Falklands during autumn, winter and spring restricts growth and productivity of young sheep, &#183; Studies with weaner sheep treated with controlled release anthelmintics established that infection with gastrointestinal nematodes exacerbates poor nutrition of young sheep consuming native pastures, &#183; A short-term metabolism study demonstrated that native pasture hay fortified with molasses and urea, or winter forage crops may be used as supplements to enhance sheep productivity, and &#183; Forage crops were grown and evaluated under Falklands&#146; conditions, and when lambs were fed the resulting highly productive and nutritious forages, the study demonstrated that lamb growth can be increased significantly, and lamb carcasses offer local farmers the potential to diversify farm income by using existing Falklands&#146;-bred lambs to develop an export meat industry The data presented in this thesis demonstrate that the potential to improve the productive and financial position of Falklands&#146; farmers is substantial. If both the local Industry and Government maintain their joint commitment to industry-restructure, pastoral development and enterprise diversification, the Falklands&#146; agricultural economy stands to benefit considerably by adopting low risk solutions to address widespread problems.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">630102 Sheep-wool</field><field name="subject">native pasture</field><field name="subject">alkanes</field><field name="subject">wool quality</field><field name="subject">sheep diets</field><field name="subject">gastrointestinal parasitism</field><field name="subject">urea-molasses treatment</field><field name="subject">brassicas</field><field name="subject">carcass quality</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157933</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Viable Software: the Intelligent Control Paradigm for Adaptable and Adaptive Architecture</field><field name="creator">Herring, Charles Edward</field><field name="description">The Intelligent Control Paradigm for software architecture is the result of this work. The Viable Software Approach is developed as an instance of the paradigm. The approach uses the Viable System Model as the basis for software system architecture. The result is a model-based architecture and approach for developing software systems by piecemeal adaptation with the goal that they become adaptive systems at runtime. Software built in this manner is called Viable Software. Viable Software represents a unifying class of self-controlling software that is an &#147;intelligent&#148; control system. Cybernetics, Control Theory, and Complexity Theory are the background for this work, and aspects relevant to this work are presented. These results are related to software architecture and software engineering. Rationale for the selection of the Viable System Model as a basis for software systems is given. The Viable System Model is described. The model is restated as an Alexanderian &#147;pattern language&#148; to make it more accessible to software engineering. A Viable Software Approach is proposed and expressed in the form of a Product Line Architecture that arranges the Viable System Model, the Viable Software Architecture, a Viable Component Framework, and a Component Transfer Protocol into a system for generative programming. An important result is the formalisation of the pattern of the Viable System into the interface specifications of the Viable Component. Three case studies illustrate the approach. The first is an analysis and extension of the Groove collaboration system. This study shows how the approach is used to map an existing system into the Viable Software Architecture and add fuzzy-adaptive user interface controllers. The second study presents the design and detailed software construction of an adaptive camera controller as part of a smart environment. The final study shows how a Business-to-Business e-Commerce system can be evolved and an expert system-based controller developed to implement business contracts.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">L</field><field name="subject">280302 Software Engineering</field><field name="subject">700199 Computer software and services not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">Software Architecture</field><field name="subject">Viable System Model</field><field name="subject">Intelligent Control</field><field name="subject">Adaptive Control</field><field name="subject">Adaptable Software</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157886</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reading Authority and Subjectivity Cross-Culturally: Some Women&#8217;s Fiction and Autobiography Since the 1950s</field><field name="creator">Ms Leili Golafshani</field><field name="description" /><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">420000 Language and Culture</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159361</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of enacted capabilities on adoption and utilisation of innovative information systems : a study of small- and medium-sized enterprises.</field><field name="creator">Salleh, Noor Akma Mohd</field><field name="description">This thesis is motivated by the need to establish a model covering innovative information systems (IS) adoption behaviours within small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Studies on adoption behaviour related to innovative IS are devoting increasing attention to SMEs. Most prior studies, however, have still relied on models developed from studies of large firms. The applicability to SMEs of findings and models developed from large firm studies is not without question as SMEs are not miniature versions of large firms. SMEs face different challenges and opportunities from large firms. This thesis empirically examined issues on the adoption behaviours of innovative IS by SMEs. In line with this objective, two research questions were established. First, what are the critical determinants that allow SMEs to overcome inhibiting factors and adopt an innovative IS? Second, what are the critical determinants that ultimately activate and stimulate them to become enabled and actively utilise an innovative IS? The conceptualisation of enacted capabilities, adapted from the resource-based view of the firm is introduced. This thesis postulates that appropriate enacted capabilities facilitate SMEs to become enabled and actively utilise an innovative IS. These enacted capabilities include the level of IT skills and knowledge of the enterprises&#146; members, trust in technology, trust in trading partners, external experts&#146; support, and organisational culture Models incorporating aspects of the theory underlying the technology acceptance model (Davis, 1989), the diffusion of innovation theory (Rogers, 1995), and the resource-based view of the firm (Barney, 1991) were developed to describe the causal linkages between the determinants that activate and stimulate innovative IS adoption behaviour (i.e., from adopting to enabling to utilising innovative IS). One model was developed for the adoption stage and a second for the enablement and utilisation stages. The adoption stage model contains three main hypotheses. The first two hypotheses propose that enacted capabilities have a positive direct effect on both perceived net benefits and attitude towards adoption from a competitive advantage perspective. The third hypothesis proposes that perceived net benefits have a positive effect on attitude towards adoption form a competitive advantage perspective. The enablement and utilisation stages model contains four main hypotheses. The first two hypotheses propose that enacted capabilities and attitude have positive effects on perceived net benefits. The last two hypotheses propose that perceived net benefits and attitude towards adoption from a competitive advantage perspective have positive effects on the extent of enablement and usage of innovative IS. The hypotheses are tested using data obtained via a survey and follow-up interview. Responses were received from 206 SMEs of varying industries and sizes from the survey. Out of these 206 SMEs, follow-up interviews were conducted with twenty-one SMEs. The interviews utilise a combination of both open and closed questions. The questions for the follow-up interviews were based on findings derived from the survey. The innovative IS examined was the Malaysian government&#146;s electronic procurement system, known as ePerolehan. All government suppliers must register for the system and become enabled for use before they can start utilising the system. The results indicate that enacted capabilities possessed by SMEs affect perceived net benefits at all stages of adoption behaviours of SMEs (i.e., adoption, enablement and utilisation). More significantly, two aspects of enacted capabilities, top management IS skills and knowledge and trust in trading partners dominate the effect on perceived net benefits. Support from external experts dominates the effect on attitude at the adoption stage. Top management IS skills and knowledge and trust in technology have a negative effect on attitude at the time of adoption. Enacted capabilities also contribute to the extent of enablement and usage within SMEs. Furthermore, different categories of adopters differ in the set of enacted capabilities underlying their innovative IS adoption behaviour. Results also indicate that when SMEs perceived higher net benefits in adopting innovative IS, they have a positive attitude. The positive attitude generated at the time of adoption has a direct effect on the extent of enablement and usage. The influence of perceived net benefits differs at the different stages of adoption behaviour. At the utilisation stage, usage is affected by perceived net benefits, however, perceived net benefits do not affect the extent of enablement at the enablement stage. In conclusion, this thesis found that enacted capabilities display important roles as antecedents to perceived net benefits, and that perceived net benefits act as a mediator from enacted capabilities to attitude at the adoption stage. Enacted capabilities also display important roles as stimulators of the extent of enablement and usage. Thus, apart from requiring good ideas and financial resources, SMEs also require appropriate enacted capabilities when adopting, enabling and utilising innovative IS.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">350213 Electronic Commerce</field><field name="subject">700299 Information services not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">small business</field><field name="subject">medium business</field><field name="subject">technological innovation</field><field name="subject">organizational behavior</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158058</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Validation of a CFD Solver for Hypersonic Flows</field><field name="creator">Elford, Michael Charles</field><field name="description">In this thesis the validation of a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code against published experimental data and alternative CFD results is explored. Six case studies are presented with flow speeds ranging from mid supersonic to hypersonic. The studies include complex compressible flow phenomena such as the interaction of shockwaves with boundary layers, vortices and other shockwaves. Two of the six validation cases also consider complex thermodynamic behaviour such as vibrational and chemical nonequilibrium. The problems chosen are limited in scope to flows which are planar or axisymmetric and remain laminar throughout the region of flow studied. This allows the studies to focus on simulating the fundamental behaviour of the flow without the added complication of turbulence or the need for large scale computing facilities. The problems which arose during the validation studies and a background to why they occurred and, wherever possible, strategies to avoid their occurrence are discussed. General modelling strategies in compressible CFD are also discussed. In this thesis the software suite CFD-FASTRAN is used to construct and analyse the CFD models. The material presented in this thesis is however general such that users of similar packages should find the thesis beneficial.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">290299 Aerospace Engineering not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">780102 Physical sciences</field><field name="subject">Hypersonics</field><field name="subject">CFD</field><field name="subject">CFD-FASTRAN</field><field name="subject">validation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158026</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling of Sulphate Reduction in Anaerobic Wastewater Treatment Systems</field><field name="creator">Haris, Abdul</field><field name="description">Municipal wastewater and industrial wastewaters like those effluents from brewery, citric acid production, tannery, pulp and paper industry, and mussel processing contain sulphate ranging from 20 mg.L-1 to 11400 mg.L-1. When these wastewaters are treated in an anaerobic system like prefermentors or anaerobic digesters the sulphate is reduced to sulphide by sulphate reducing bacteria (SRB). The presence of sulphate reduction is not desirable as it may reduce methane yield due to partial substrate utilisation by SRB, causes system toxicity and the production of malodor H2S in the gas phase. In this thesis, the effects of operational conditions on sulphate transformation and assimilation was studied in a laboratory scale anaerobic wastewater treatment system. The laboratory scale system consisted of two reactors the first one a well-mixed fermentor (referred to as an acidogenic reactor) and the second an expanded granular sludge blanket reactor (referred to as a methanogenic reactor) with pH and temperature control. Two sets of studies were performed; in the first set both reactors were connected serially to represent a two-stage high-rate anaerobic treatment system. The system was fed molasses and operated at temperature of 35oC. The acidogenic reactor was controlled at pH of 6 while the methanogenic reactor was controlled at pH of 7.2 by automatic addition of caustic. In the second set of experiments only the first reactor was used to represent a prefermentor and the first stage of the two stage. The reactor was fed with glucose at various concentrations, operated at pH of 6 and temperature of 35oC. Information gained from these studies was encapsulated in a mathematical model to describe sulphate reduction in anaerobic treatment systems. This model was also validated using data generated from the experiments. The experimental study showed that &#183; At low sulphate concentrations of about 250 mg.L-1 and COD concentration of 10,000 mg.L-1 in feed, relatively high percentage (up to 35 %) of produced sulphide was assimilated by biomass, while the rest of the sulphur was distributed as unconverted sulphate, dissolved sulphide, H2S gas and to a lesser extent as metallic sulphide precipitates. &#183; The major electron donor for sulphate reduction in both the acidogenic and the methanogenic reactor was hydrogen gas. Therefore, sulphate reduction not only competed with hydrogen utilising methanogens for the available hydrogen, but also changed the distributions of organic acids, which were directly or indirectly influenced by the H2 partial pressure. &#183; Sulphide concentrations of up to 6.5 mM free hydrogen sulphide) at pH of 7.2 was not inhibitory to methanogens &#183; Sulphate reducing bacteria were able to grow even at a low hydraulic retention time of 1.2 hours in the well-mixed acidogenic reactor. It was estimated that the maximum specific growth rate (m) and half saturation constant (ks) of SRB was 1.31 h-1 and 3.8 mg S.L-1, respectively. These values were higher than those reported in literature. &#183; Sulphate reduction was suppressed at high concentration of carbon in the feed. Accumulation of high concentration of volatile organic acids at high feed-carbon concentrations had little effect on sulphate reduction. However, extent of sulphate reduction had a negative correlation with total concentration of biomass. A non-competitive biomass inhibition function was proposed to model the correlation. From this fit it was estimated that a biomass concentration of about 3300 mg-COD.L-1 will completely inhibit sulphate reduction. &#183; Sulphate reduction was affected by redox potential control and pH in the acidogenic reactor. High pH and low redox potential values were essential for sulphate reduction to proceed. At redox potential control of -300 mV, sulphate reduction was inhibited more at pH of 6 than it was at pH of 7. At redox potential values of -250 mV or higher, about 90 % inhibition of sulphate reduction was observed at both pH of 6 and 7. An existing model describing carbohydrate degradation was extended to include sulphate reduction processes. Despite experimentally observing that sulphate reduction only took place from hydrogen, all possible substrates for sulphate reducion was considered. These included: lactic acid, butyric acid, propionic acid, acetic acid and hydrogen. Kinetic parameters for sulphate reduction processes were obtained from documented literature. Inhibition of sulphate reduction by biomass and sulphur assimilation by biomass were included in the model. A new approach to calculate caustic consumption at given pH values was also included. A modification to hydrogen regulation function was also made to better predict product distributions as a function of gas-phase hydrogen concentration. Model validation was performed using data from dynamic experiments. Comparison to actual data was undertaken on several key variables in the acidogenic and methanogenic reactors such as: organic acid concentrations, gas compositions, gas production rates, sulphate and sulphide concentrations and caustic consumption rates. The model satisfactorily predicted sulphate and sulphide concentrations in both reactors. However, discrepancy between predicted and experimental data on organic carbon concentrations was seen, especially during organic carbon concentration step changes.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">L</field><field name="subject">290700 Resources Engineering</field><field name="subject">760200 Environmental and Resource Evaluation</field><field name="subject">sulphate reduction</field><field name="subject">anaerobic digestion</field><field name="subject">high-rate reactor</field><field name="subject">acidification</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157916</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The choice between rural living and agriculture: Implications for land use and subdivision policy</field><field name="creator">Anstey, Geoff</field><field name="description">In much of Australia and the United States, the almost universal right to have a house on rural allotments has resulted in rural living settlement in areas intended, by land use planning policy, to be used for agriculture. Such &#145;unplanned&#146; rural living has a range of potential adverse impacts, including, among other things, loss of agricultural production, land use conflicts with agriculture, land value constraints on farm restructuring, and changes to the rural landscape character. Given the strongly held community perception of a house as a development right, this research was motivated by the need to understand the effects of that right, in order to assess the potential value of any change in policy. An integral consideration was the influence of the size of allotments with any such right. The research was also driven by an interest in explaining the pattern of unplanned rural living settlement, i.e. why are particular allotments converted and others not? Largely in the absence of previous studies of unplanned rural living as a distinct phenomenon, there was scope for this thesis to make a contribution to knowledge in these respects. The research involved three stages of empirical analysis. Firstly, a Queensland-wide survey of land use conversion from sugarcane production supported the choice of the Bundaberg region as the study area. Contingency table analyses were then conducted into the current land use and other attributes of land in the study area that, in 1980, was used for sugarcane. Those analyses identified distinguishing attributes of the different land use sub-sets of allotments, and informed the selection of observation units for the third stage. The third stage provided the principal basis for fulfilling the research objectives. It focused on logit models of the choice, at the time of sale, between using a particular allotment for unplanned rural living or sugarcane production. Those analyses provided an indication of the role of individual land attributes while controlling for the effects of other attributes. It was found there had been limited conversion of suitable, productive sugarcane land to unplanned rural living. Compared to those allotments that remained in sugarcane production, allotments converted to rural living were, on average, much smaller, of less value, had lower agricultural production potential, and were situated in more undulating and forested landscapes further from Bundaberg. These clear distinctions between rural living and sugarcane allotments contributed to logit models with high explanatory power. The expected productive income of allotments had overwhelming weight and was highly statistically significant in explaining the land use choice between unplanned rural living and sugarcane. This is a notable finding, because some other studies have not shown such a strong relationship between land use and measures such as soil productivity. There was a degree of natural coincidence between more undulating and forested landscapes and lower productive potential. Notably, landscape attributes appeared to be of secondary importance in determining land use. The presence of a house at the time of sale was not a statistically significant explanatory factor for land use. This finding, together with that of limited conversion of suitable, productive land to unplanned rural living, meant there was a lack of evidence to support a change to the right to have a house on rural allotments. The findings did indicate that the allotment area required to avoid conversion to unplanned rural living was different to the area required for agricultural viability. In the circumstances of this study area and period, 20 ha would have been an acceptable minimum to retain suitable cropping land in productive use. This is compared to the 60 ha suggested as necessary for farm viability. However, the potential for changed economic conditions to reduce the productive value of agricultural land, and increase demand for rural living, makes it appropriate to be cautious about permitted allotment sizes. A detailed conceptual framework informed the selection of observation units and variables for the third stage of analyses. The framework helped to confirm allotment sales as the observation units, and provided the rationale for excluding the difficult to measure influences of a landowner&#146;s attachment to the land, and inertia, as explanatory variables. The high explanatory power of the logit models provides support for the approach, which may be useful in future studies.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300804 Environmental Impact Assessment</field><field name="subject">770905 Integrated (ecosystem) assessment and management</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158323</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Numerical Methods in Reaction Rate Theory</field><field name="creator">Frankcombe, Terry James</field><field name="description">Numerical methods are often required to solve chemical problems, either to verify theoretical models or to access information that is not readily available experimentally.

Advantages of using BEV as a vector are that it both elicits mucosal immunity and has naturally occurring temperature stable isolates so that a BEV vector could be administered orally to elicit a protective immune response in the host and should not require cold storage to maintain vaccine efficacy. Furthermore, wildtype BEV causes no or only mild clinical symptoms in its host and if BEV is used as a vaccine vector, reversion to wildtype phenotype would not cause deleterious effects in vaccinated cattle. To date many of the viruses used as vaccine vectors are produced by modifying the structural proteins of the virion so that they contain heterologous sequences. However, each of the four BEV structural proteins are essential and it is not possible to insert large sequences without disrupting the virion. While this study looks at potential insertion sites within the BEV virion, the main focus for the development of BEV as a vaccine vector is through using a replication-limited BEV vector. The development of a replication-limited vector requires the deletion of an essential viral gene that is then replaced in vitro using an expression vector. When the replication-limited vector and its complementing expression cassette are co-transfected into a permissive cell line all the proteins required for viral assembly are produced but only replication deficient genomes are available to be encapsidated. The physically intact but replication deficient viral particles produced in vitro can then infect permissive cells in vivo, resulting in the production of all but the deleted viral protein. Moreover, the deleted portion of the viral genome can be replaced with heterologous sequences within the replication-limited BEV vector. These heterologous sequences can then be expressed in vivo where they can be recognised by the host immune system. Three BEV isolates representing the Australian subserotypes were used in this study: K2577, SL305 and 66/27. The full-length sequences of K2577 and SL305 were obtained as well as partial sequence from the third isolate, 66/27. Sequence homology and phylogenetic analysis showed all three isolates were more closely related to BEV-1 subserotypes than BEV-2. This is the first report to indicate that Australian BEV isolates can be classified as BEV-1. Analysis of the 5&#146;-untranslated region (5&#146;-UTR) indicated that BEV isolates were recombinants with each other and that these recombinant regions correspond to the duplicated cloverleaf structure which is present in BEV 5&#146;-UTR but absent from other enteroviruses. While BEV was initially reported to be stable at higher temperatures, later studies showed that this property varied between isolates and this is also true of the three isolates used in this study. Since it is important not only to ensure that the isolate used as a vaccine vector is temperature stable but also the resulting vaccine vector, the molecular basis of BEV temperature stability was also studied. Using sequence data from the Australian isolates, regions of variation were located and hybrid BEV created. Unfortunately, all of the hybrid BEV produced in this study were non-infectious and could not be used to for further characterisation of BEV temperature stability. Preparatory to constructing replication-limited BEV, a system for full-length amplification of BEV was developed. By including sequences for the bacterial promoter T7 on the positive sense primer used for full-length amplification of BEV, it was possible to prepare full-length transcripts of the amplified product and these were shown to produce infectious BEV particles when transfected into to cell lines that supported BEV growth. Subsequent cloning of the K2577 amplification product resulted in infectious clones for this BEV isolate and these clones were used to prepare replication-limited BEV constructs. To test the replication-limited system BEV structural genes were replaced with a reporter gene to produce replication deficient infectious clones. Complementary constructs containing only the deleted structural genes were also prepared to express the deleted genes. While it was expected that these expression vector would be able to complement the replication deficient BEV in vivo, co-transfection of the replication-limited construct with its complementing expression vector did not produce viable BEV.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270303 Virology</field><field name="subject">780105 Biological sciences</field><field name="subject">Bovine enterovirus</field><field name="subject">BEV</field><field name="subject">vaccine vector</field><field name="subject">phylogenetic analysis</field><field name="subject">virology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157925</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Courting Controversies: Salman Rushdie, the Novelist and Intellectual Complicities</field><field name="creator">Sui-sum-grace Wong</field><field name="description">Salman Rushdie is one of the world&#8217;s most pre-eminent writers of contemporary literature. He is best known as a literary author who has written the controversial religious satire in The Satanic Verses, which brought him a prolonged death threat imposed by Islamic authorities. The novel Midnight&#8217;s Children won the prestigious Booker of Bookers prize in 1993 and the Best of the Booker award in 2008. Throughout his writing career, however, he has exceeded his role as a novelist and shown his commitment to using his fame and cultural authority to open debates and publicize his opinions on social and religious issues and world politics. This thesis analyses the various aspects of controversies surrounding Rushdie, as an elite transnational author, a literary celebrity, a public intellectual and an outspoken critic on sensitive topics. It comes to examine the social significance of public personas and the nature of complexity embedded in their career. Rushdie&#8217;s presence draws the media&#8217;s attention, and more often than not, instigates international disputes and contentions. By looking at different aspects of Rushdie&#8217;s identity, the thesis addresses controversies raised by his diverse roles and his traversing of spaces in the cultural industry &#8211; in academia, the book market, public forums, talk shows, celebrity jamborees and even fashion magazine dinner parties. As an elite postcolonial writer, does his iconic status &#8220;compromise&#8221; him in the literary field by the generation of exotic cultural stereotypes and the exploitation of his Indian upbringing? What can literary and cultural critics do to work beyond condemning this trend? As a literary celebrity and public intellectual, do his involvements in publicity activities and New York&#8217;s celebrity circuit make him abandon the professional integrity and the time-honored &#8220;disinterested&#8221; position of the writer? How should the reader understand the connections between the media and the author, and the novel and popular culture? In addition, given his deeply skeptical position on religious matters, how does the writer understand the world of Islam, and how does this understanding underpin his antagonistic relationship with the fundamentalists? Addressing these questions, the thesis is by no means an account of a single writer&#8217;s life and career, but suggests that the complexity of intellectual life in general is made necessary in a cultural landscape saturated with media hype, publicity maneuvers and commoditization. In such contexts, writers exploring their time must, in different degrees, participate actively in what they write against, and be implicated in these processes. Under the influence of the market, the change in social trends and with their aspired career in mind, it seems that there can be no non-involvement for these individuals. Yet, by taking the case of Rushdie, I also argue that implicit in the novelist&#8217;s self-conscious manipulation of his diverse roles and the parodic metafiction in his work are important indications about the image construction of controversial public personas, the cultural meaning of the novelist as a public intellectual, and the implicated career that a writer may have at the turn of the century.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">420000 Language and Culture</field><field name="subject">Controversies</field><field name="subject">Salman Rushdie</field><field name="subject">Novelist</field><field name="subject">Intellectual Complicities</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:177662</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Article Omission and Overuse: Syntax and Semantics of the English Article System in Interlanguage Grammar</field><field name="creator">Jun Matoba</field><field name="description">This thesis examines ungrammatical article omission, and overuse of the definite article 'the' in indefinite specific context by Japanese learners of English. This is an area of English grammar that has been considered a major problem for L2 learners (e.g. Ionin, Ko &amp; Wexler, 2004; R. Hawkins et al., 2005, 2006; Trenkic, 2007). The thesis extends the analysis of Japanese learners' interlanguage to the overuse of 'a' in indefinite specific mass contexts by these learners. A detailed analysis of DP structures in Japanese and English leads to the conclusion that Japanese learners, through their L1, are equipped with the linguistic features which map onto articles in English, even though Japanese lacks articles. The thesis examines the syntactic role of articles in rendering predicative nouns argumental (e.g. Chierchia, 1998; Longobardi, 1994) and explores the definiteness contrast marked by 'the' as opposed to 'a/&#248;' with singular count nouns and mass nouns (e.g. J. Hawkins, 1978) at the semantic level. Count/mass distinctions are also examined in detail (e.g. Doetjes, 1997; Jackendoff, 1992) because the 'a' versus '&#216;' contrast clearly relates this distinction. This thesis argues that, despite its lack of articles, the Japanese grammar expresses definiteness and count/mass distinctions through its classifier system. For example, different orderings of the constituents in a classifier phrase induce different interpretations as to definiteness (e.g. Kakegawa, 2004). Further, the thesis shows that some classifiers are incompatible with mass nouns, thus argue that in Japanese, as in English, nouns are associated with the features which underlie the count/mass distinction. Thus, the difficulty that Japanese learners display in mastering the grammar of articles in English is attributed to difficulties in the mapping between their syntactic and semantic underlying knowledge and the surface forms (e.g. Lardiere, 1998) rather than to the need to acquire new features or categories of syntactic or semantic knowledge as the Representational Deficit Hypothesis (R. Hawkins, 2005) claims. This proposal differs from the previous studies that assume that the relevant syntactic category is not present in the learners&#8217; L1 thus not acquirable in the L2 (R. Hawkins et al., 2005; Trenkic, 2007). It also differs from those that suggest that, even when the learners&#8217; L1 does not overtly realize these features (Ionin et al., 2004), the semantic features are available through universal grammar (UG). In order to examine how Japanese learners map syntactic and semantic knowledge onto the surface forms of articles in their English, data were collected via an oral production task and two types of grammaticality judgment tasks. An online judgment task was used to gather evidence for an intuitive type of knowledge of the constraints on article use, while an offline judgment task examined conscious metalinguistic knowledge of articles. Because L2 learners tend to construct and apply various metalinguistic rules as to the use of articles (Goto-Butler, 2002), the examination of both intuitive and conscious knowledge is essential for a comprehensive understanding of the development of the article system in interlanguage grammar. For the mapping of the syntactic knowledge of articles, the omission of articles by Japanese participants is investigated. The investigation focused on singular count nouns because the omission of articles with these nouns is ungrammatical in any context. It was observed that several of the Japanese participants indeed disallowed article omission for these nouns, suggesting that they had acquired the English system of mapping relevant syntactic knowledge onto the surface forms of articles. The thesis also explores the mapping of the semantic knowledge of articles by focusing on the overuse of 'the' in indefinite specific contexts. Previous studies have claimed that the overuse of 'the' is governed by the Article Choice Parameter (Ionin et al., 2004). The findings reported here confirm the tendency to overuse 'the' in indefinite specific (i.e. noteworthy (Ionin et al., 2004)) contexts. However, it was also observed that 'a' was judged acceptable in the same context. The offline grammaticality judgment task revealed that the choice of 'the' in this context may have been affected by metalinguistic knowledge. Thus, the findings are not in agreement with the hypothesis that a parameter governs the overuse of 'the' in indefinite specific contexts. Additionally, the thesis examines the overuse of 'a' in mass contexts. Though small in number, the participants who make inconsistent judgments for the same noun showed a tendency to accept the use of 'a' in specific contexts (i.e. de re specific) and reject it in non-specific contexts. It is argued that the feature [+specific] may be mapped onto 'a' in mass contexts in these learners&#8217; grammar. Based on these findings, the thesis explores how the syntactic module and the semantic module interact with each other in L2 grammar when mapping linguistic knowledge onto surface forms. The thesis also explores the effect of metalinguistic knowledge on L2 learners&#8217; grammaticality judgments in order to demonstrate a more comprehensive picture of article systems in interlanguage grammar.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English articles, definiteness, count/mass distinctions, interlanguage grammar, metalinguistic</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178731</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cytotoxic Alkaloids from Australian Marine Sponges</field><field name="creator">Mohamed El-naggar</field><field name="description">Australia's marine environment covers extended areas, from the warm northern tropical, to the sub tropical central water, the cool temperate water of the south and the cold sub-Antarctic and Antarctic water. Australia has rich area of coral reefs. The marine biodiversity in Australia is enormous. Despite incredible biodiversity, Australian research in the marine anticancer drug discoveries is low in comparison with other countries. In this research we investigated a collection of marine sponges as a source for new anticancer leads. This thesis comprises six chapters. Chapter 1 covers the importance of natural products as a source of new drugs, and an introduction to cancer as a disease, chemotherapy in cancer treatments, and the natural products as a source for anticancer drugs. Also, the basic anticancer drug development process is highlighted. Finally, a thorough review of anticancer alkaloids isolated from marine sponges is presented. Chapter 2 presents the chemical investigation into a southern Australian marine sponge Stelletta sp., which led to the isolation and structure elucidation of bistellettazines A-C the first reported examples of terpenyl-pyrrolizidines conjugate, and bistellettazole A, a unique cyclic terpenyl-imidazole conjugate. Bistellettazines A-C and bistellettazole A feature unprecedented carbon skeletons that are proposed to share a common convergent biosynthetic origin, arising via the biogenic equivalent of a Diels-Alder addition between two hypothetical polyenyl norsesquiterpene precursors. The cytotoxic activity (in vitro) for these new alkaloids is also discussed. Chapter 3 discusses the isolation and structure elucidation of four new discorhabdins analogues namely, dihydrodiscorhabdin A, debromodiscorhabdin A, discorhabdin X and dihydrodiscorhabdin L. In addition, the known compounds discorhabdin A and discorhabdin D, were isolated from two southern Australian marine sponge specimens of the genera Higginsia and Spongosorites. The cytotoxic activity (in vitro) for these new alkaloids was also discussed. Chapter 4 discloses chemical investigation into two southern Australian marine sponge specimens of the genera Clathria and Ptilocaulis. Four new mirabilin analogues (mirabilins H-K) were isolated and characterized along with known mirabilin C, F (for the first time as TFA salt) and mirabilin G. The cytotoxic activity (in vitro) for these new alkaloids was also discussed. Chapter 5 presents the 1H NMR data for the known compounds isolated during this study, and Chapter 6 is covering the experimental part.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">06 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">sponge, marine, secondary metabolites, anticancer, alkaloids, bistellettazine, bistellettazole, discorhabdin, mirabilin.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184065</field></doc><doc><field name="title">BIOELECTRICAL IMPEDANCE ANALYSIS OF MUSCLE FUNCTION AND ACTIVITY: (BIODYNAMIC ANALYSIS)</field><field name="creator">William Mccullagh</field><field name="description">Abstract There is a need in medicine and research for noninvasive, painless, safe and simple bed-side techniques to measure physiological processes associated with muscle function and activity. Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA) is a widely used, noninvasive, painless, safe and simple procedure for the measurement of body composition. However, although capable of producing accurate and reproducible data, it is known to be prone to movement artifacts. This poses the interesting question &#8220;Could impedance changes be used to monitor movement and, consequently, be related to muscle function or activity?&#8221; This project investigated the utility of impedance change as a monitoring technique for physiological processes that involve movement such as muscular contraction, the calf muscle pump, and swallowing. The impedance of leg muscle segments during locomotion, whilst riding a stationary exercise cycle, was measured at discrete frequencies and by bioimpedance spectroscopy to monitor muscle function or activity. Impedance traces were compared to information obtained by electromyography (EMG). Impedance, at a discrete frequency, was able to measure the cadence of cycling and its magnitude was related to the position of the pedal during the pedal cycle. When the cycling action was measured by bioimpedance spectroscopy, R0 and Zc showed a statistically significant difference, (p&lt;0.05), between all angles of the pedal crank cycle while R&#8734; showed a statistically significant difference between angles in the lower hemisphere of the pedal crank cycle. The cyclical changes in impedance during cycling may be attributed to changes in shape and volume of the muscle during contraction as well as a volume change due to blood and lymph being pumped from the limb by the action of the calf muscle pump. Based on procedures used in the cycling studies, an impedance-based method for the measurement of calf muscle pump function during an exercise protocol, originally designed for use with air plethysmography, was developed. It was shown that impedance measured at 5 kHz provides a simple, non-invasive method for the measurement of the ejection fraction and ejection volume of the calf muscle pump as well as other haemodynamic variables. The impedance-based method was less technically challenging than accepted volumetric methods, such as air plethysmography and strain gauge plethysmography, and non-invasive c.f. ambulatory venous pressure, enabling it to be used repeatedly. Muscle function and activity is not confined to the legs so impedance changes in the arm and forearm during exercise were measured. Impedance measurements, at discrete frequencies and using bioimpedance spectroscopy, of the forearm during contractions of the hand were able to distinguish the difference between a ramp and a pulse contraction. When the impedance of the arm and forearm were plotted against the angle of the forearm to the horizontal during a bicep curl, there was an hysteresis effect. Impedance traces of a bicep curl were compared to an EMG trace of the same action. The larynx is a hollow muscular organ situated in the front of the neck above the trachea consisting of a framework of cartilages bound together by muscles and ligaments. The two major functions of the larynx are deglutition and phonation. Dysphagia, which is becoming more prevalent as the population ages, is defined as difficulty in swallowing thin liquids such as water or juices which splash into the trachea because the patient is unable to control the thin liquid bolus. Aspiration pneumonia and dehydration can be prevented by using thickened liquids which allow patients to achieve a safer swallowing response, but it is difficult to assess this response without interfering with the swallowing process. Impedance pharynography (IPG) is a technique using BIA to monitor an impedance waveform of the swallowing process that presents no radiation hazard to the patient, is non-invasive and does not require specialist trained personnel to operate it. Resistance changes across the neck were measured while subjects swallowed solutions of different viscosities. The resistance changes were distinctive and reproducible for each of the solutions of different viscosities which were swallowed. Measuring the function of the larynx by this method could be useful in the diagnosis and treatment of dysphagia. In conclusion, the studies described in this thesis demonstrate the potential usefulness of the measurement of change in impedance as a measure of muscle activity. Impedance-based methods can measure volume changes associated with changes in cross-sectional area of the muscles involved in contraction as well as compartmental fluid changes caused by the force of the contraction on the surrounding tissues including the vasculature. In particular, measuring the ejection fraction and other haemodynamic variables of the calf muscle pump by impedance has the potential to become the method of choice in the future because it is easy to use, inexpensive, non-invasive, safe, and hygenic. Measuring resistance changes across the neck during swallowing yields distinctive waveforms with features corresponding to the physiological phases of the swallowing process as well as identifying distinctive swallowing patterns associated with the different viscosities of liquids swallowed. Function of the larynx and the associated diseases of the larynx will potentially be easier to diagnose and treat with a safe, non-invasive, inexpensive, portable bed-side method of assessment such as BIA.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">impedance, calf muscle pump, dysphonia, dysphagia, bioelectrical impedance analysis, hysteresis</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185201</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Emergency Control Power System Separation</field><field name="creator">Victer Chin</field><field name="description">Power systems in many countries are stressed towards their stability limit. If these stable systems experience any unexpected contingencies, or disturbances, there is a significant risk of instability, which may lead to wide-spread blackout. Existing methods to minimize the risk of stability and excessive frequency decline; need to be redeveloped to address these new challenges. This research project will develop a new emergency control methodology, which can more effectively prevent power system frequency and voltage instability under emergency conditions. Frequency and voltage instability are two major concerns in power system operation. The primary aim of this project is to develop new optimal load shedding techniques, which are able to better address various voltage and frequency instability issues for power systems emergency control purpose. In this thesis, new approach of load shedding for frequency and voltage stability are presented. For the load shedding to prevent frequency collapse, System Frequency Respond &#8211; Under Frequency Load Shedding (SFR-UFLS) from the previous approach has been redeveloped to compute an optimal load shedding scheme. The limitation of previous optimal load shed method is that they only shed load following one particular contingency event. As an improvement of this method, we developed a technique that protects against a range of contingencies. For the load shedding to prevent voltage collapse, The proposed method is then tested on the 39-bus New England test system. Generators are of different importance to the system in terms of voltage stability. It is essential to investigate generators&#8217; impact on system voltage stability. The theory of the normal forms of diffeomorphism is used to analyze the power flow equations, and then nonlinear active participation factor is obtained and is used to determine the influence of generators on voltage stability. By using this method, the nonlinearity of power systems can be taken into consideration while the computational efficiency is maintained. Therefore, the impact of generators can be measured with more accuracy even for the cases in which the system is characterized with strong nonlinearity. In order to show the validity of the proposed method, the IEEE 14-bus test system and the New England 39-bus power system are used as case studies. The steady-state voltage stability index verifies the proposed method. The results show that nonlinear active participation factor can describe the characteristics even when power systems are operating at a highly stressed condition.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">09 Engineering</field><field name="subject">optimisation</field><field name="subject">Under Frequency Load Sheeding (UFLS)</field><field name="subject">Systerm Frequency Response (SFR) model</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:188137</field></doc><doc><field name="title">DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION OF HOT STABILISED NEURAL NETWORK VEHICLE EMISSION MODELS USING AUSTRALIAN DRIVING CYCLE DATA</field><field name="creator">Noppakun Boongrapue</field><field name="description">Evaluation of the environmental impacts of Intelligent Transport Systems and transport infrastructure management schemes relies heavily on the development of accurate and reliable environmental emissions models. Existing state-of-the-art models estimate pollutants based on a typical urban driving cycle using an aggregate modelling approach where a 'characteristic' vehicle is used to represent dissimilar vehicle populations. While this approach has been accepted by transport planners for strategic level studies, it can be argued that modelling individual vehicle emissions based on vehicle dynamics would result in more reliable evaluations of operational-level project impacts. The primary objective of this thesis is to develop vehicle emissions and fuel consumption models under hot stabilised settings and various traffic conditions using Australian fleet data collected from laboratory tests. The models use second-by-second vehicle real-time data to predict fuel consumption (FC) and pollutant emissions (HC, CO, NOx) at different levels of speed, acceleration, air-to-fuel ratio and torque. The data required for model development, calibration and validation was collated from laboratory tests conducted by the Second National In-Service Emissions (NISE 2) project. A total of 27 vehicles (including small, medium and large passenger vehicles; four-wheel drive (small and large); and light commercial vehicles were used in model development. The laboratory data, which comprised more than 48,500 second-by-second observations, was then pre-processed and randomly assigned to calibration and validation data sets for model development. The thesis then adopted a rigorous approach to develop and evaluate a large number of neural network architectures to determine the most suitable modelling framework. First, a pilot test was conducted to test different model development scenarios and establish some guidelines on the general framework for model development. The results were used to determine some of the crucial neural network parameters (eg learning rule or optimisation technique and most appropriate architecture) for use in subsequent modelling. Selected models were then further refined using test data from individual and aggregate vehicle types. This resulted in further refinement of modelling inputs where, for example, sensitivity analysis showed that speed and acceleration were the two most crucial inputs and that including other input parameters did not improve the accuracy of the results. The performance of selected neural network models was then compared to a number of sophisticated and complex statistical techniques based on multiple and non-linear regression models. The results generally showed that ANN models are effective and suitable for modelling emissions and that they perform as well or even better than the complex regression models tested in this study. Another general finding across all vehicles and for all models (neural and statistical) is that predictions are more accurate for fuel consumption and CO emissions than for other vehicular emissions. The models were also found to under-predict the emissions values at the peaks of graphs, but were generally consistent in their outputs across all other driving conditions. In this study, it was also found that one of the main advantages of the neural network approach over regression is the ease of developing one model to accurately predict multiple outputs. This is in contrast to the regression modelling approach, where it was found that accurate results matching neural network performance can only be achieved using one distinct model for predicting each output. This would clearly undermine the statistical approach because a large number of models would then need to be developed for a road network where second-by-second data is available for hundreds of vehicle types. Hence, the benefits of using neural networks immediately become clear and more appealing. This thesis also identified a number of issues for future research directions. To increase the accuracy and overall quality of the models, future research needs to include further classifications of vehicle types and other pertinent variables such as manufacture year, odometer reading and making use of a larger sample of modern vehicles representing current vehicle fleet compositions. There is also scope to improve the testing procedures by including road grade and air condition use, which are important factors that impact on vehicle performance and emissions. Future research can also benefit from testing other drive cycles and cross validation of models across different driving cycles. Model performance can also be enhanced by collecting instantaneous data using instrumented vehicles where emissions can be collected under real-life conditions rather than from controlled laboratory environments. Finally, the real benefit from development of these models is the ability to interface them to micro-simulation models where instantaneous speed and acceleration data can be provided to the emissions model on a second-by-second basis. The neural network emissions model would then be used to evaluate the impacts of ITS and other traffic management strategies with the aim of identifying the best environment-friendly traffic management approaches. This thesis has successfully achieved its objectives by demonstrating the feasibility of using neural networks for modelling vehicle emissions. The thesis further demonstrated the superior quality and advantages of the neural network approach over the more established statistical regression methods. Finally, the models developed in this study will allow researcher and practitioners alike to develop a better understanding and appreciation of the environmental impacts resulting from transport schemes aimed at reducing traffic congestion and enhancing environmental quality.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Emission Modelling</field><field name="subject">Fuel Consumption Modelling</field><field name="subject">Neural Network</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:196368</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Advanced Methodologies for Power System Security and Vulnerability Analysis</field><field name="creator">Guo Chen</field><field name="description">Nowadays, with the rapid expansion of increasing utilization of renewable energy sources, power grid is evolving into a much complex man-made system in the technological age. Under the new circumstances, traditional methodologies for power system security analysis are facing a serious challenge. For the past decade, many countries have experienced large blackouts, which expose potential problems of current models and methodologies in power industry. On the other hand, since the 9.11 event and frequent suicide bombing attacks in some countries, terrorism has become a major threat for national security. With the extensive growth of terrorism activities, power system, the significant critical infrastructure, probably becomes the target of terrorists. If this happens, the impact is dramatically severe and may yield more frequent blackouts. This Ph.D. thesis aims at developing some advanced models and methodologies for exploring the vulnerability of power system and protecting it against potential terrorism threat. The dissertation mainly consists of the following four parts. (1)Complex network theory based power system security and vulnerability analysis methodologies are introduced. Mathematically, an interconnected complex power grid can be described as a complex network of nodes connected by edges. Generally speaking, topology parameters of network structure include important information of the structure. That is to say, some critical nodes and lines can have significant impact on large-scale blackouts. The thesis will present a new methodology to recognize those critical nodes and lines in power grids. (2)Complex system theory based power grid security and vulnerability analysis methodologies are presented. Power grid is a complex dynamic evolutionary system over years with continuous expansion so as to underpin the ongoing increase of power demand. Some properties of complex systems may have important relationship with large-scale blackouts. In other words, there may be some stages of evolutionary power systems that would be more likely to cause large blackouts. The thesis will investigate the relationship to identify those critical stages of power grids. (3)Game theory is applied to methodologies for power system security and vulnerability analysis. Terrorists are often considered as fully intelligent and strategic actors who can even hire scientists and power engineers to seek the vulnerability of power systems and then launch a vital attack. Game theory does treat actors as fully strategic players and has been successfully applied to many disciplines including economics, political science and military. The thesis will present new models and analysis methods for protecting power systems under terrorism attacks. (4)Cyber security technology is considered in power system security and vulnerability analysis. It is known that information technology plays an import role in today and next generation grid. In this situation, cyber security should be an important issue. If it is vulnerable to malicious threats such as hackers and cyber-terrorists, power grid will not reach its full capabilities. The thesis will present an initial framework to reduce the vulnerability of power grid against potential cyber attack.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">09 Engineering</field><field name="subject">Complex Networks, Complex Systems, Game Theory, Cyber Security, Vulnerability</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206641</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Processing of Virus-Like Particles</field><field name="creator">Daniel Lipin</field><field name="description">A virus-like particle (VLP) is a biological nanoparticle. It consists of the protective protein shell of a virus that is devoid of the nucleic acid required for viral replication. VLPs have two key uses: they can act as vaccines by inducing an immune response similar to their native virions, or they can facilitate gene therapy and drug delivery by encapsulating non-viral molecules and efficiently transporting them into cells. Manufacture of VLPs involves cell-based expression of virus-shell protein, with particle assembly and purification following one of two paradigms: (i) in vivo VLP assembly, followed by purification of full particles from cell lysate; (ii) partially assembled protein is recovered from cell lysate and assembled into VLPs in vitro. The flexibility and efficiency of both of these VLP manufacturing paradigms can be improved by first gaining a fundamental understanding of what is happening at key process steps. These improvements will lower the cost of VLP manufacture and enhance the viability of VLP products in the biopharmaceutical marketplace. The research reported here yielded positive outcomes for two key steps of the VLP manufacturing process, using murine polyomavirus VLPs for all experimentation. Firstly, enhanced understanding concerning the capture of virus shell protein in pentamer form (capsomeres) from cell lysate using glutathione-S-transferase (GST) affinity chromatography was obtained. It was discovered that prokaryotic expression of GST-tagged capsomeres yielded soluble aggregates having variable size distribution. Methods were developed to physically and chemically characterise these soluble aggregates, and the mechanism by which they adsorb to the chromatography resin was described using an established mathematical model. Secondly, particle characterisation of whole VLPs isolated from cell lysate was undertaken. Methods utilizing three orthogonal and quantitative techniques were developed to suggest that encapsulation of non-viral molecules (nucleic acids or proteins) during in vivo assembly causes distinct changes to the size distribution of isolated VLPs: transmission electron microscopy (TEM), asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation with multiple-angle light scattering (AFFFF-MALS) and electrospray differential mobility analysis (ES-DMA). The understanding gained from the research presented in this work enables the enhanced capture of partially assembled virus shell protein from cell lysate, as well as a method to efficiently and cost-effectively analyse VLP solutions for the presence of desirable or undesirable encapsulated material.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">virus-like particle</field><field name="subject">capsomere</field><field name="subject">polyomavirus</field><field name="subject">glutathione-s-transferase</field><field name="subject">affinity chromatography</field><field name="subject">soluble aggregate</field><field name="subject">modelling</field><field name="subject">asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation</field><field name="subject">transmission electron microscopy</field><field name="subject">electrospray differential mobility analysis</field><field name="subject">nuclear localisation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:209195</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bovine immune responses to cattle tick infestation</field><field name="creator">Emily Piper</field><field name="description">The cattle tick, Rhipicephalus Boophilus microplus (formerly Boophilus microplus), is the most significant parasite of cattle in Australia and threatens the improvement of cattle production in tropical and subtropical countries worldwide. Some cattle breeds of mainly Bos indicus origin develop a strong resistance to infestation with R. B. microplus, while other breeds of mainly Bos taurus origin will succumb to anaemia and &#8216;tick worry&#8217; in tick-infested pastures. Resistance to cattle tick infestation is primarily manifest against the larval stage and results in the immature tick failing to make a successful attachment and obtain a meal. It is widely accepted that resistance to tick infestation in cattle is immunologically mediated and involves both cell-mediated and humoral immune responses. Previous research has demonstrated a role for the hypersensitivity response in the rejection of larvae from resistant B. taurus cattle. The immune response to R. B. microplus infestation in B. indicus and B. indicus &#215; B. taurus cattle has not been studied in great detail and this thesis aimed to describe those responses of highly tick-resistant cattle that differ from those of tick-susceptible cattle. A pilot trial was conducted using six tick-resistant Brahman heifers (B. indicus) and six tick-susceptible Holstein-Friesian heifers (B. taurus). The animals were artificially infested for several weeks and blood samples obtained weekly for three weeks during the height of infestation, and on one occasion, skin biopsies obtained. It was found that significant differences existed between the two breeds with respect to the percentage of cellular subsets comprising the peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) population, cytokine expression by peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL), and levels of tick-specific immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) antibodies measured in the peripheral circulation. These results in combination with whole genome expression analysis of circulating PBL suggested that the B. indicus cattle had developed a stabilised T cell-mediated response to tick infestation evidenced by their cellular profile and leukocyte cytokine spectrum. The B. taurus cattle demonstrated cellular and gene expression profiles consistent with a sustained innate, inflammatory response to infestation, although high tick-specific IgG1 levels suggested that these animals had also developed a T cell response to infestation. Gene expression analyses using quantitative PCR (qPCR) and whole genome expression platforms indicated that the B. taurus cattle elicited an innate inflammatory response in the skin at the site of larval attachment. This was supported by histological examination of the tick-attachment sites. Conversely, the B. indicus cattle appeared to limit the inflammatory response and instead exhibited increased expression of genes involved in wound healing and the structural integrity of the skin. A second trial was conducted using a group of tick-na&#239;ve Santa-Gertrudis heifers to eliminate any innate breed differences that may have confounded the results obtained in the pilot trial. Thirty-five animals were obtained from a tick-free region of Australia; thirty animals were artificially infested weekly for thirteen weeks while five animals remained at a tick-free quarantine property to serve as a control group. Following thirteen weeks of tick infestation the animals in this trial exhibited divergent tick-resistance phenotypes and those carrying the lowest and highest numbers of ticks were classified into tick-resistant (n = 6 animals) and tick-susceptible (n = 6 animals) groups, respectively. The larger number of animals in this study and repeated measurements over the course of the trial enabled a detailed analysis of the effect of tick infestation across all animals, and also within the groups identified as highly resistant or highly susceptible. A cell-mediated response to tick-infestation was detected in all tick-infested animals by twenty-one days after the initial infestation, a response which waned towards the end of the trial when the antibody response became more dominant. Similar to the pilot trial, the tick-susceptible animals developed significantly higher levels of tick-specific IgG1 antibodies compared with the tick-resistant group. Some differences were observed between tick-resistant and tick-susceptible animals with respect to the percentage of cellular subsets comprising the PBMC population. Skin biopsies were taken from these animals prior to initial infestation and then at twenty-one days and ninety-one days after the initial infestation and whole genome expression profiles were produced and analysed. At twenty-one days post infestation both tick-resistant and tick-susceptible animals demonstrated an upregulation of genes involved in leukocyte migration and complement activation, suggestive of an inflammatory response. While this response persisted in the tick-susceptible group at ninety-one days post-infestation, it appeared to lessen in the tick-resistant group. A dominant interleukin-8 (IL-8) response was observed in the skin of the tick-susceptible animals at both time points post-infestation that was not observed in the tick-resistant animals. This thesis demonstrates that tick-susceptible animals respond to infestation with R. B. microplus with an apparently non-protective antibody response, and that tick-resistant animals demonstrate different structural responses in the skin at the tick-attachment site compared with the intense inflammatory response observed in tick-susceptible animals. The results presented here suggest that the extreme susceptibility of pure B. taurus and some B. taurus &#215; B. indicus individuals may be due to their heightened ability to recognise and respond to tick antigens introduced into the host via tick saliva during the blood feeding process.

For the study, forty in-depth interviews and four focus-group interviews were conducted with respondents who were either involved or not involved in the tourism industry. The two main issues considered were, firstly, the determination of the concepts used to perceive tourism development and its social impact among Thai people and, secondly, how social exchanges affected these perceptions. The research suggests that there are four clusters of respondents who share common perceptions and certain socio-economic characteristics. Cluster one: respondents in this cluster are highly involved in tourism and are mostly of high socio-economic status. They share perceptions of Thailand&#8217;s tourism development as moving slowly forward, but hampered by red-tape management and bureaucratic problems. This cluster views economic impact in a positive light, especially with regard to the country&#8217;s increased revenue, and they perceive of culture as a tourism product. This group viewed environmental impact as a global problem and they mostly expressed the view that the tourism industry has a social responsibility to reduce the causes of pollution. Cluster two: respondents in this cluster are not involved in tourism and have a high socio-economic status. They perceive tourism development as having both positive and negative aspects. Economic impacts were represented both positively, in terms of national revenues and job creation, and negatively, in terms of fostering a materialistic society. Generally, this cluster views the social impact of tourism more negatively. Cluster three: respondents in this cluster are in mid-level-management positions in industries both involved and not involved in the tourism industry. They perceive tourism development in both positive and negative terms. They have favourable views of the economic impact of tourism and view Thai culture as a tourism product. Some respondents in this cluster are concerned about the environmental impact of tourism. Cluster four: respondents in this cluster have a low socio-economic status and include those involved and not involved in the tourism industry. This cluster perceived tourism development in positive terms. They predominantly viewed tourism development as a way to modernise society. This study also found six factors that affect individuals&#8217; social representations of tourism development and social impact: personal benefits, socio-economic background, cultural values, personal traits, and socially derived and direct experiences. Of these, four were intrinsic factors&#8212;personal traits, direct experiences, individual benefits, and socio-economic backgrounds. The remaining two - socially derived and cultural values - were extrinsic factors. This study found that extrinsic factors are the main sources of individual representations and lead to hegemonic social representations. The significance and contribution of this research lies in two categories&#8212;theoretical and practical. From the theoretical angle, this research makes a number of contributions to the body of knowledge of social representation and social exchange. In terms of a practical contribution, these results can assist the Thai government to review the issues raised and ultimately provide more effective management.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Social exchange theory</field><field name="subject">social impact</field><field name="subject">social representations theory</field><field name="subject">Tourism development</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:212835</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mitochondrial and Autosomal Genetic Analyses in the Australian Population</field><field name="creator">Enda Byrne</field><field name="description">The central goal of human genetics is to understand genetic differences both within and between populations and how these differences contribute to phenotypic variation. Recent advances in genotyping technologies and statistical methodology mean that we can now examine population differences at high genetic resolution, and attempt to find common variants that underlie variation in complex traits in the population. In this thesis, differences in maternal genetic ancestry in Australia were examined and a number of genetic association studies were undertaken in an attempt to map genetic variants that underlie complex traits. Abstract Before presenting the results from the five main genetic analyses, an overview is given of the history of gene-mapping in humans, the challenges this has presented, and the major discoveries from both empirical and theoretical studies that have advanced the field of human genetics to the point where hypothesis-free association testing of common variants with complex traits is now possible. The reasons why mitochondrial DNA has proved so useful in examining the history of populations, and the major findings from the field of mitochondrial population genetics are summarised. In addition, some of the major evidence of a role for mitochondrial variants in complex trait variation is presented. For the first main paper, data from 69 mitochondrial variants that tag the majority of common mitochondrial SNPs in European populations was used to test whether there is evidence for population stratification (i.e. the presence of more than one randomly mating population) in the maternal genetic line of modern Australians. By combining the genetic data with self-reported maternal ancestry data, it was shown that there are significant differences in the patterns of mitochondrial variation between groups of individuals whose maternal ancestors came from different areas of the world. Specifically, it was shown that there are significant differences between groups from different regions of Europe, with those from Eastern Europe showing large differences in SNP and haplogroup frequencies compared to the other groups. A test for assortative mating was performed by comparing whether mates in our sample shared more mitochondrial variants in common when compared to randomly drawn pairs from the population. No evidence of increased sharing was found. The second study involved testing whether common mitochondrial variants are associated with a number of physiological and biochemical traits, the majority of which are risk factors for the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. Phenotypic and genotypic data was available for just over 2,000 adolescent twins measured at three different timepoints. This is the first known mitochondrial association study to use family data, and a methodology based on a linear model was presented for performing such an association. In spite of having power to detect variants of modest effect, only viii one significant association was found between mt14365 and triacyglycerol levels in twins measured at age 12. This association was not replicated across the other age groups. The third study used the methodology developed for family-based mitochondrial association studies to test for association between mitochondrial variants and a battery of cognitive tests in twins aged 16. A previous study with a small sample size had shown an association between mitochondria and IQ, but this had never been replicated or followed-up. A total of 1,385 individuals from 665 families were included, but no statistically significant associations were found. The most strongly associated SNP was found in a gene in which variants have been shown to influence cognition in mice with a homogeneous nuclear genetic background. For the fourth study, a genome-wide association analysis was carried out of 6 self-reported traits related to the menstrual cycle. Sample sizes ranged from 468 for age at menopause to 5,743 for age at menarche. No SNPs were found to be associated at a genome-wide significant level, however, the results from previous association analyses of age at menarche and age at menopause were replicated. A number of regions for each trait that show modest evidence of association have been identified, and these should be targeted for replication in another sample. In addition, a number of genes that show strong evidence for association with each trait were identified and using a multivariate approach, a SNP in the RNA polymerase III subunit B gene was shown to potentially have a pleiotropic effect on age at menarche and duration of menses. In the final study, a genome-wide association study data for self-reported caffeine consumption and caffeine-related sleep disturbance was performed. A number of loci that potentially influence each trait were identified. The association data was combined with gene expression data from three cell types that had been treated with caffeine. A gene-based test was performed to test whether genes that were found to be consistently up- or down-regulated by caffeine treatment show increased evidence of association. There was no evidence of increased association signals in these genes. A number of the caffeine-regulated genes show strong evidence for overall association and represent good candidate genes for targeted replication in a larger sample. Finally, a synthesis of the main results of each study is presented including potential limitations of this research. This discussion includes a critical assessment of the current findings in both mitochondrial genetics and genome-wide association studies, and potential future directions in the field of gene-mapping in humans.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mitochondria, stratification, assortative mating, GWAS, association, gene mapping</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:212831</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Emotion Expressing Idioms in English and Vietnamese: A Contrastive Analysis</field><field name="creator">Van-trao Nguyen</field><field name="description">Abstract Language is a repertoire of culture and a powerful and versatile medium in communication. Idioms mirror human wisdom in the process of conceptualization of the world. Idioms have interlocked and grown into records of a community&#8217;s past culture. Idioms therefore constitute a rich, but at the same time elusive, area of cross-cultural exchanges. Idioms reflect the colour and variety of human social activities, and so play an important role in the linguistic ontologization of emotions. The vocabulary of emotions has been the object of intensive investigations in many languages, but bibliographical exploration reveals that idioms as a component of the lexicon are not yet part of the main field of theoretical interest. In particular, while there have been studies of idioms of emotion in English, there have been few on emotion idioms in Vietnamese, and very few systematic investigations of emotion idioms (EIs) across English and Vietnamese. Hence, our linguistic study of the conceptualization of emotions in English and Vietnamese will significantly contribute to the development of this research domain with data from a language other than English. The study undertakes a contrastive investigation of idioms that express the seven basic emotional concepts of HAPPINESS, SADNESS, ANGER, DISGUST, LOVE, FEAR, and DESIRE in English and Vietnamese. There are three foci: (1) similarities and differences in formal structure between the EIs in English and Vietnamese; (2) similarities and differences in semantics between such idioms; and (3) an investigation of the patterning and regularities of the established similarities and differences between the EIs in the two languages. To the end, we have conducted a hand search approach of the dictionaries in both languages, which has enabled the establishing of a corpus of 1065 entries (603 for English and 462 for Vietnamese). As regards the formal structure, the study sets up the lexicogrammatical frames for the canonical forms and variation patterns of the idioms, and interrelates quantitatively and quantitatively the relationship of the idioms&#8217; variant form vis-&#224;-vis the canonical form. In light of the findings, the study has shown that a high level of canonicity is observed in the idioms in both English and Vietnamese. In general, they conform to a restricted number of construction types: verbal, nominal, adjectival, prepositional, and sentential. Nevertheless, many other idioms permit variable flexibility in their composition: the substitutability of their component parts, insertion of lexical items, and some variation in syntactic patterning. For the idioms which are logged as canonical and variant, we have suggested rules to cover the patterns. As regards the semantic features of the idioms, the study is substantially reliant on the theory of conceptual metaphor (CMT) and metonymy, as first developed by Lakoff &amp; Johnson (1980), to analyze the data. The data analysis leads to the discovery of conceptual mappings/correspondences from the various source domains on to the target domains of emotions, which are very productive of idioms. An in-depth analysis of cross-linguistic and cross-cultural aspects in the idioms is provided to determine similarities and differences in terms of conceptualization of the emotions between the two languages. The contrastive analysis of idioms reported in the traditional literature is usually the comparison of idioms with body-part terms: e.g., m&#225;t m&#7863;t (&#8216;cool face&#8217;) &#8216;HAPPINESS&#8217; in Vietnamese; lose one&#8217;s head in English, animals: e.g., g&#7847;m nh&#432; h&#7893; &#273;&#243;i (&#8216;roar like tiger hungry&#8217;); go ape &#8216;ANGER&#8217;, and colours: e.g., &#273;&#7887; m&#7863;t t&#237;a tai (&#8216;red face purple ear&#8217;); blue in the face &#8216;ANGER&#8217;. The present analysis seeks greater explanatory depth and theoretical grounding in the framework of cognitive linguistics. We present the semantic patterning of the idioms, and the patterning in turn reveals how English and Vietnamese people talk about and structure the abstract conceptual domains (i.e., emotions) (Gibbs &amp; Wilson, 2002). In light of the findings, this research has revealed both commonalities and differences in the conceptualization of the emotions in English and Vietnamese. The affinities are grounded in common bodily experiences. On the other hand, cross-cultural variations are also obvious. The most important conclusion that can be drawn for the study is that metaphors and metonymies involved in emotion-expressing idioms are not only heavily subject to physiological basis (Solomon, 1984), but also to cultural influences on the basis of the cultural image schemas (Dobrovol'skij &amp; Piirainen, 2006; Emanatian, 1995; Geeraerts &amp; Grondelaers, 1995; Ungerer, 1993). The thesis also presents implications concerning the linguistic ontologization of emotions, and their application to second language learning and the translation of idioms.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">idioms, idiomaticity, conventionality, English-Vietnamese contrastive idiom analysis, theory of conceptual metaphor and metonymy, conceptual domains, image schemas, folk theory, cultural models</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:212979</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cost-effectiveness of interventions to prevent lifestyle-related disease and injury in Australia</field><field name="creator">Linda Jane Cobiac</field><field name="description">Background The costs of healthcare are on the rise. With an ageing population, growing demand for health services and expensive new technologies, Australia&#8217;s annual health care bill has more than doubled in the last ten years, and is projected to increase a further 127% by 2033. As third-party provider of health care, the Government must make difficult decisions about how best to allocate limited resources to the many new and existing drugs, technologies and health services available for prevention and treatment of disease. Cost-effectiveness analysis of interventions can help identify those that should be given funding priority in order to maximise population health, but its use in allocating resources to prevention has been limited. There have been few cost-effectiveness analyses of preventive interventions, particularly for the potentially more effective strategies targeting the whole population, such as taxation, regulation and community campaigns. Current methods are poorly designed for capturing the change in population distribution of risk that can occur with these types of interventions. Use of cost-effectiveness analysis has also been limited by the use of many different (and often simplistic) modelling methods and assumptions that prevent league table comparison of results to help identify most cost-effective strategies. This thesis presents new methods for evaluating cost-effectiveness of preventive interventions, with application to interventions promoting physical activity, preventing alcohol misuse, reducing body mass, promoting fruits and vegetables and reducing dietary salt intake, from an Australian health sector perspective. Methods Proportional multi-state life table models were developed for each risk factor and for risk factor combinations, using population impact fraction (PIF) functions to quantify the potential intervention impact of a change in individual or population risk factor exposure on disease and injury. The models were used to simulate population health in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and costs of disease treatment, over the lifetime of the Australian population in 2003, for a range of individual- and populationtargeted interventions using intervention costs and effects derived from Australian cost data and published evaluation studies. Monte-Carlo analysis was used to derive uncertainty around all outcome measures, and sensitivity of results to key modelling choices and assumptions was also evaluated. Cost-effectiveness of six physical activity interventions, ten alcohol interventions, two body mass interventions, 23 fruit and vegetable interventions and four dietary salt interventions was evaluated in comparison to current Australian practice. In addition, where multiple mutually-exclusive interventions were evaluated, a partial null (&#8216;no current practice intervention&#8217;) scenario was calculated and cost-effectiveness of incrementally adding each intervention to a package was evaluated, to determine the optimal intervention mix and to compare optimal outcomes with the current practice. Findings For physical activity, a package of six individual- and population-targeted interventions is cost-effective and could avert a third of disease burden attributable to physical inactivity. For reducing alcohol misuse, a package of eight individual- and population-targeted interventions could avert a third of disease burden attributable to hazardous and heavy levels of drinking. Although the current practice of random breath testing is cost-effective, if the expenditure on random breath testing had been distributed to more cost-effective interventions, around ten times the improvement in population health could have been achieved. The individually-targeted interventions for body mass, fruits and vegetables and salt intake are not cost-effective. Providing incentives for food industry to reduce salt in processed foods, on the other hand, is far more effective in improving population health and can lead to cost-saving for the health sector in the long term. if (moderate) reductions in salt were made mandatory for food manufacturers, around 20 times the health gains achieved by the current voluntary program could be achieved. Overall, eight interventions are potentially cost-saving for the health sector: voluntary and mandatory limits on salt in processed foods; mass media- and pedometer-based community campaigns to promote physical activity; a community program to promote fruits and vegetables; and volumetric taxation, advertising bans and an increase of the minimum legal drinking age to 21 years to address alcohol misuse. A further 12 interventions for reducing alcohol misuse, and promoting physical activity and fruit and vegetable consumption, are under a $50,000 per DALY threshold of costeffectiveness, and are also recommended for health sector investment. Implications The integration of a proportional multi-state life table model with PIF function in this research has proved to have a number of advantages over previous modelling methods. The PIF function enables better simulation of the true continuous distribution of risk in the population, and facilitates analysis of population-targeted interventions that shift the whole distribution of risk. It also substantially simplifies the integration of multiple risk factors into the one model, which was previously constrained by the need to create separate states for every risk factor category (e.g. active and inactive) and risk factor categories in combination (e.g. obese and active, obese and inactive, etc.). This not only makes for easier and more accurate analyses of interventions targeting multiple risk factors, but enables evaluation of packages of many different risk factor interventions. Further investment in preventive interventions is highly recommended. The population-targeted approaches hold most promise for improving population health. Although there is potential for opposition from industry stakeholders and public concern around Government paternalism, these interventions have most potential to generate cost-savings for the health sector in the long-term. Given the weaker evidence around effectiveness of these interventions, however, it is recommended that programs are implemented with sufficient funding for monitoring and evaluation of outcomes.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Economic Evaluation</field><field name="subject">cost-effectiveness</field><field name="subject">weight</field><field name="subject">Exercise</field><field name="subject">Diet and disease</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:213020</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Performance characteristics of ammonium nitrate/fuel explosives</field><field name="creator">Hagan, T.

Players complete physically demanding activities such as running, tackling and passing which often result in musculoskeletal injuries. Injury rates increase as playing level increases. From 1999 to 2007 there were 42,754 rugby league claims costing Accident Compensation Corporation $48,704,704. Moderate to severe injury claims (MSC) represented 14% of these claims but 88% of costs. New Zealand Maori recorded significantly more injury claims and total injury entitlement costs than all other ethnic groups. Soft tissue MSC injuries were common (47%) for females. Concussions accounted for 70% of total rugby league injuries to the head while the knee represented 23% of total injury claims and 20% of injury costs. Neck and spine injuries accounted for 6% of total MSC injury claims but 16% of total MSC costs. In video analysis of 80 games at international, national and youth competition levels, 50% of tackles involved tacklers from behind the visual fields of the ball carrier, either two or three tacklers, and contact with the mid-torso or hip-thigh region. From the prospective injury analysis of one professional team over two consecutive years, tackle-related injuries occurred more to the ball carrier when tackled at shoulder or mid-torso height, in their blind vision, with two or more tacklers, and in the fourth quarter of matches. Tackle-related injury type and site varied by positional group. Hit-up forwards and outside backs recorded more tackle-related injuries as the ball carrier than the tackler. In the prospective study of 63 amateur rugby league players, 80% of players injured as a result of match or training activities saw a health professional as part of their rehabilitation. Team coaches asked players to return to rugby league activities in 28% of cases for training participation and 29% of cases for match participation. In the cross sectional study assessing 95 rugby league support personnel's first aid, injury prevention and concussion knowledge, only 2% achieved an 80% pass mark, 39% incorrectly stated loss of consciousness was required for concussion and only 24% of coaches had a rugby league coaching qualification. This PhD research has contributed knowledge regarding costs and characteristics of injuries to amateur rugby league participants analysed by ethnicity, gender, injury site and injury type. Changes in anthropometric characteristics and speed in regards to incidence of injury, characteristics of tackles in match situations and common tackling positions and positional groups where injuries occur, player perspectives on why they return from injury to participation in rugby league, and the lack of first aid knowledge for rugby league personnel, have all been described.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rugby League</field><field name="subject">Injury Incidence</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/1007</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Uptake and partitioning of cadmium in two cultivars of potato ( Solanum tuberosum L. )</field><field name="creator">Dunbar, Kelly R.</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the results of an investigation into the uptake and distribution of cadmium (Cd) in two cultivars of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) shown to contain different concentrations of Cd in the tuber at maturity. An initial glasshouse trial sought to determine whether differences in tuber Cd between these two cultivars resulted from differences in uptake from the soil, or were due to differences in the allocation of Cd to the various tissues within the plant. Total uptake of Cd from the soil did not differ between cultivars, nor did the yield of tubers. However, there were marked differences in Cd distribution within the plant. Most of the differences in tuber Cd concentration could be accounted for by a large (3-fold) retention of Cd in the roots of cultivar Wilwash. The concentration of Cd in the shoots of Wilwash was also higher than of Kennebec, although to a lesser extent than the roots. Further studies were conducted to trace the pathways of Cd uptake and movement within the plant. A split-pot trial, involving long-term growth of potatoes in 109Cd-labelled soil, was undertaken to determine the overall pattern of Cd distribution and the importance of the root system in supplying Cd to the tubers. The root system of the potato plant is different to many plants, in that the main root system (basal roots) is augmented after tuber initiation by roots extending from the stolon and from the tuber itself. The basal roots were found to be the dominant source of Cd to all tissues and accounted for approximately 85 % of tuber Cd. The remaining tuber Cd was sourced directly from the stolon and tuber roots. However, there was no evidence of a direct link between the main (basal) root system and the stolons. Although Cd was found to accumulate in the periderm of the tubers, there was no uptake into the tuber tissue itself. Isotopic studies were undertaken to investigate the short-term movement of newly absorbed Cd in the xylem and the phloem. Cadmium was found to be highly mobile in both the xylem and phloem, with added Cd being rapidly assimilated into all tissues following both root and foliar application. Newly absorbed Cd was rapidly sequestered by the stems when applied to either the soil or to a source leaf, suggesting that the stems may act as a transitional storage pool when rapid turnover of nutrients and other mineral elements is required during tuber bulking. Inhibition of Cd uptake by zinc (Zn), has been proposed as a method for reducing the concentration of Cd in various agricultural crops, including potatoes. The ability of Zn to reduce Cd uptake was found to be highly dependent upon cultivar and on the concentration of Cd in the external medium. Although competition between Zn and Cd was found for cultivar Wilwash when the external concentration of Cd was low, when the concentration of Cd in the external media was high, increasing Zn served to increase Cd uptake. Both synergistic and competitive responses were also noted for cultivar Kennebec. However, the patterns of response were opposite to those evident in Wilwash. The complexity of these interactions highlighted the possible shortcomings in using soil applied Zn to limit Cd uptake by potatoes.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cadmium, heavy metals, phloem translocation, potato tuber, xylem transport</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37973</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A complex systems approach to important biological problems.</field><field name="creator">Berryman, Matthew John</field><field name="description">Complex systems are those which exhibit one or more of the following inter-related behaviours: 1. Nonlinear behaviour: the component parts do not act in linear ways, that is the superposition of the actions of the parts is not the output of the system. 2. Emergent behaviour: the output of the system may be inexpressible in terms of the rules or equations of the component parts. 3. Self-organisation: order appears from the chaotic interactions of individuals and the rules they obey. 4. Layers of description: in which a rule may apply at some higher levels of description but not at lower layers. 5. Adaptation: in which the environment becomes encoded in the rules governing the structure and/or behaviour of the parts (in this case strictly agents) that undergo selection in which those that are by some measure better become more numerous than those that are not as &#8220;fit&#8221;. A single cell is a complex system: we cannot explain all of its behaviour as simply the sum of its parts. Similarly, DNA structures, social networks, cancers, the brain, and living beings are intricate complex systems. This thesis tackles all of these topics from a complex systems approach. I have skirted some of the philosophical issues of complex systems and mainly focussed on appropriate tools to analyse these systems, addressing important questions such as: &#8226; What is the best way to extract information from DNA? &#8226; How can we model and analyse mutations in DNA?  &#8226; Can we determine the likely spread of both viruses and ideas in social networks? &#8226; How can we model the growth of cancer? &#8226; How can we model and analyse interactions between genes in such living systems as the fruit fly, cancers, and humans? &#8226; Can complex systems techniques give us some insight into the human brain?</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">complex systems; cancer; signal processing; metabolomics, gene regulatory networks, nonlinear dynamics, EEG, mutation</field><field name="subject">Signal processing</field><field name="subject">System analysis.</field><field name="subject">DNA--Analysis.</field><field name="subject">Mutation (Biology)</field><field name="subject">Genetic regulation.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/40682</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chemical reactions of polyphosphate fertilisers in soils and solutions.</field><field name="creator">McBeath, Therese</field><field name="description">Polyphosphates have been shown to offer substantial agronomic benefits over traditional granular phosphorus (P) fertilisers in highly calcareous soils of southern Australia. With ongoing field investigations into the efficiency of polyphosphate fertilisers compared to fluid and granular orthophosphate (OP) fertiliser products, a need developed for detailed study of the mechanisms responsible for the enhanced efficiency of polyphosphate fertilisers in Australian soil types. Polyphosphates provide an analytical challenge as they contain chemically different forms of phosphate compared to most fertilisers, where P occurs entirely as OP. An investigation was conducted into the most suitable method for the speciation, quantification and separation of the P species supplied in polyphosphate fertilisers. While the conventionally used colorimetric technique was comparable to ion chromatography (IC) for quantification of OP, it did not provide the speciation and separation capabilities of IC. Polyphosphate fertilisers are thermodynamically unstable and hydrolyse to more simple forms of phosphate: this can be induced both chemically and biologically. A study was undertaken using IC to ascertain the effects of time, temperature and acidity on the stability of polyphosphate fertiliser formulations. All of these factors affected the stability of polyphosphate fertilisers and recommendations on storage of the product and mixtures with other fluid fertilisers can now be developed. Stability of PP in soils was assessed using solid-state speciation by solid-state &#179;&#185;P-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Hydrolysis of both solution and solid-phase PP could be quantified using the NMR technique, and results using this method were compared to conventional techniques, which extract OP and PP into aqueous phases and use IC to assess the extent of PP hydrolysis. The concentrations of OP and PP determined by the extraction technique were lower than those determined by NMR, and consequently the proportion of undetected P was greater for IC than for NMR. There is disagreement in the literature as to the differences in partitioning behaviour (sorption/precipitation) of OP and PP in soil. A partitioning study was undertaken using the IC technique for aqueous P speciation. Retention of PP to soil solid phases was much stronger than OP, and addition of PP to soil resulted in greater concentrations of OP in the equilibrating solutions, indicating a possible competition for P sorption sites between PP and OP. A double labelling technique was developed where OP was labelled with &#179;&#179;OP and PP was labelled with &#179;&#178;PP. This technique was used to investigate the effects of time and concentration on the lability and partitioning of OP and PP in soils. Using this dual labeling technique it was possible to determine the hydrolysis of added PP, and to distinguish OP derived from hydrolysis of PP from native OP in soil. The dissolution of dissolved organic carbon, iron and aluminium and the sorption/precipitation of calcium as a result of addition of PP were assessed and related to changes in the lability of P supplied as PP and OP. This double labelling technique was further developed to assess the possibility of mobilisation of native OP by addition of PP to soil. The findings of this thesis indicate that the hydrolysis reaction is pivotal to the behaviour of the P species that constitute a polyphosphate fertiliser in soils. Investigations of isotopic exchangeability showed that while native P mobilisation was not detected, slow reactions of PP in soil including sorption, potentially desorption, and hydrolysis underpin the potential availability of PP in soil.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">phosphatic fertilizers, polyposphates</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/59455</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mineral composition of hypothermally induced ankylosis in rat molars.</field><field name="creator">Leung, Albert</field><field name="description">This study used Backscattered electron imaging (BSE) and X-ray Microanalysis to qualitatively and quantitatively investigate morphology and elemental composition of ankylotic adaptation in the periodontium following hypothermic insult to their maxillary first molars. This method has been shown in previous studies to induce aseptic root resorption along with ankylotic changes within the periodontal ligament (PDL). A secondary objective was to assess the pulpal changes that occurred concurrent with the changes in the periodontium. Twenty-eight eight week old Sprague Dawley rats were divided into four groups of seven animals corresponding to one of four observation periods i.e.: t&#8321;= 7 days, t&#8322;= 14 days, t&#8323;= 21 days, t&#8324; = 28 days. At t=0 days, six animals in each group received a thermal insult as a continuous 20 minute application of dry ice (CO&#8322; at -81&#8304;C) to the crowns of their upper right maxillary molar. The untreated left molars were used as controls. The remaining rat within each group did not receive the dry ice. All rats were given two sequential bone labels, calcein 5mg/kg and alizarin red 30mg/kg, administered intraperitoneally 8 days apart. The timing of the labels was such that all rats were euthanased 2 days after the last label. Following sacrifice, the maxillae were dissected out, fixed in ethanol and embedded in methylmethacrylate. Ten microns thick, undecalcified maxillary first molar coronal sections through the furcation were obtained. For every 3 out of 10 sections: the first was left unstained and undecalcified; the second stained with Von Kossa/haematoxylin &amp; eosin; and the third decalcified and stained with haematoxylin &amp; eosin. Unstained sections were viewed under fluorescence, while transmitted light microscopy was used for the other sections. Following initial analysis, the unstained, undecalcified sections were de-coverslipped and carbon coated. These sections were investigated with scanning electron microscopy and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectrometry (EDS). Quantitative spot analysis and element mapping was performed on alveolar bone, ankylotic areas, cementum and dentine. A linear mixed effects model was employed to investigate any interaction between the four tissues of interest. A focal pattern of ankylosis was observed at days 14 and 21 in three rats. No ankylosis was observed in the control teeth. SEM revealed a focal type of ankylosis with central nodules of mineralized tissue forming within the PDL. Bridging between bone and dentine occurred with fine trabeculae which extended from the central mineralized nodule. Bridging was progressive and was more extensive at day 21 compared to day 14. At day 28, no ankylosis was observed. EDS analysis revealed that the ankylotic tissue was composed of major constituents Calcium and Phosphorous along with trace elements of Mg and Na. This was comparable to the surrounding alveolar bone, cementum and dentine. There was no statistically significant difference in the Ca/P ratios, Mg when ankylotic material was compared to bone. There was a trend towards elevated Na levels in ankylosis but this was not statistically significant relative to bone. Mg in dentine was lower than for all the other tissues and Na was higher in dentine when compared to bone and cementum. In the pulp, hypothermic injury demonstrated alteration of the odontoblast layer, reduction in cellularity, vascular alterations and tertiary dentin formation. At the 28 day observation period, the cellular and vascular changes had returned to levels comparable to the control teeth, indicating successful pulpal healing and regeneration. Marked tertiary dentine deposition was also observed at days 14, 21 and 28. Pulp chambers were visibly smaller due to tertiary dentine formation, however no pulp necrosis was observed. Thus the aseptic root resorption model, using a continuous 20 minute application of dry ice, suggested the occurrence of reversible pulpal tissue alterations compatible with an inflammatory repair process. The observation of ankylosis initiating as centralised nodules within the PDL suggest that the origins may be a consequence of osteogenic potential from PDL stem cells. The null hypothesis that a single, prolonged thermal insult on a rat molar does not have an effect on mineralized tissue formation and that ankylotic tissue is similar to bone was rejected. ABSTRACT There is a presumption that the ankylotic region formed after periodontal ligament (PDL) injury represents an unremarkable bony repair process. Essentially, the injury triggers an osteogenic repair response and the ankylotic tissue merely represents alveolar bone. There is uncertainty whether the oestogenic event is predominantly osteoblast driven, cementoblast directed, or a consequence of osteogenic potential from PDL stem cells. In this study, twenty-eight Sprague Dawley rats were divided into four groups of six animals, corresponding to one of four observation periods, and received a thermal insult as a continuous 20 minute application of dry ice to the crowns of their upper right maxillary molar. The appearance of ankylotic tissues was examined using backscattered electron images using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with an Energy Dispersive X-ray Analyser (EDS). The Ca, P, and trace elements contents were determined by EDS from four different hard tissue regions: ankylosis; bone; dentine and cementum, and the Ca/P ratios were calculated. Ankylosis was observed at days 14 and 21 in 3 rats and was not seen at day 28. No ankylosis was observed in the control teeth. BSE imaging revealed a focal type of ankylosis with central nodules of mineralized tissue forming within the PDL. The morphological features of ankylotic tissue differed to that of alveolar bone and dentine. Bridging between bone and dentine occurred with fine trabeculae which extended from the central mineralized nodule. EDS analysis showed that the ankylotic tissue was composed of major constituents Ca and P along with trace elements of Mg and Na. This was comparable to the surrounding alveolar bone, cementum and dentine. There was no statistically significant difference in the Ca/P ratios, Mg, and Na between ankylotic material and bone. Statistically significant differences was evident in Mg content between ankylotic material compared to dentine and cementum. Na content was higher in dentine than in ankylotic material. The results of this study indicate that, histochemically, ankylotic material is similar to bone. However, the appearance of ankylotic material as centralised foci with a morphology different from bone suggest that ankylosis may originate from an osteoblastic phenotype originating within PDL.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ankylosis; alveolar bone; cementum; dentine; rat; EDS-analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60949</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Oral treatments for monogenean parasites of farmed yellowtails, Seriola spp. (Carangidae).</field><field name="creator">Williams, Rissa E.</field><field name="description">Japanese yellowtail Seriola quinqueradiata has been commercially farmed in Japan since the 1940s. In comparison, sea-cage farming of yellowtail kingfish Seriola lalandi in Australia is still developing, with commercial production commencing in 1998. In Australia, S. lalandi is parasitised by Zeuxapta seriolae and Benedenia seriolae. In Japan, S. quinqueradiata is parasitised by Heteraxine heterocerca and B. seriolae. These monogeneans affect industries in both countries and management of these parasites is required to prevent impacts on fish health and commercial losses. I investigated efficacy (% reduction of mean parasite abundance) for orally administered praziquantel, fenbendzole and oxfendazole against Z. seriolae and B. seriolae on S. lalandi and the efficacy of orally administered praziquantel and febantel against H. heterocerca and B. seriolae on S. quinqueradiata. Medications were administered to fish by surface coating feed pellets or via direct intubation of the stomach. Seriola lalandi administered fenbendazole and oxfendazole by surface coating of feed had lower abundance of the gill parasite Z. seriolae. Seriola quinqueradiata intubated with febantel had lower abundance of the gill parasite H. heterocerca. Neither fenbendazole nor oxfendazole administered to S. lalandi in Australia, nor febantel administered to S. quinqueradiata in Japan resulted in a lower abundance of the skin parasite B. seriolae. Praziquantel was first administered to S. lalandi by surface coating of feed. Fish rejected medicated feed, suggesting praziquantel affected its palatability. Fish treated with feed medicated with praziquantel had fewer Z. seriolae and B. seriolae than untreated fish. Praziquantel administered to S. lalandi by intubation allowed a more accurate dose to be tested without differential feeding or reduced palatability obstructing results, and resulted in fewer Z. seriolae (99.5-100 % reduction) and B. seriolae (91 &#8211; 97.7 % reduction). Intubated praziquantel also led to fewer recruitment life stages of Z. seriolae and B. seriolae, even at low doses, but did not completely eliminate them from S. lalandi. Praziquantel administered to S. lalandi alone and combined with cimetidine had high efficacy (&gt;99%) against Z. seriolae. In comparison, praziquantel administered alone resulted in fewer B. seriolae (68.3 &#8211; 69.7 % reduction) than the same doses of praziquantel combined with cimetidine (36.9 &#8211; 40.9 % reduction). A 90.4 -100% reduction in H. heterocerca was achieved when praziquantel was administered by intubation to S. quinqueradiata in Japan but there was only a 22-77.8 % reduction in B. seriolae. The dose of PZQ (150 mg kg&#8315;&#185;  body weight day&#8315;&#185; for 3 days) on the label of a commercially available product used to treat B. seriolae in Japanese aquaculture resulted in a 50.9% reduction against B. seriolae, but completely eliminated H. heterocerca. In trials against Z. seriolae and B. seriolae on S. lalandi in South Australia, I also screened 27 other anthelmintics and antiparasitics from the chemical groups: amprolium derivatives, benzimidazoles, benzyl ureas, diphosphate salts, imidazothiazoles, macrocyclic lactones, nitromidazoles, organophosphates, piperazines, salicylanilides, substituted phenols and tetrahydropyrimidines. Of these, only the benzimidazole, albendazole, was effective against Z. seriolae and none appeared to have an effect against B. seriolae.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Monogenea; sea-cage aquaculture; praziquantel; anthelmintics; oral treatments; Carangidae; Seriola Ialandi; Seriola quinqueradiata; Platyhelminthes; Benedenia seriolae; Heteraxine heterocerca; Zeuxapta seriolae</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60980</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Weight management in young women.</field><field name="creator">Lim, Siew S.</field><field name="description">Context: Young women are at high risk of weight gain but there has been limited knowledge on weight management in this group. Hyperandrogenemia and menstrual abnormalities are common co-morbidities of obesity in young women but their associations with food cravings are not known. Metformin has been shown to reduce body weight and improve metabolic outcomes in older adults but its effects on healthy overweight and obese young women have not been investigated. Quantitative lifestyle advice has been shown to be effective in inducing weight loss but its psychological effects on young women have not been extensively studied. The overall objective of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of metformin, quantitative lifestyle advice and internet-based intervention on weight management in young. Methods: In the first 12-weeks, 203 overweight and obese young women (BMI 33.3&#177;0.3 kg/m&#178; , age 28&#177;0.3 years; age range:17-37) were randomized to one of three treatment arms to receive metformin (Diabex XR 1500mg a day) plus qualitative lifestyle advice (M-QL), placebo plus qualitative lifestyle advice (P-QL) or a structured lifestyle program (L-QT). L-QT consisted of an energy restricted diet with quantitative lifestyle advice (6000KJ; 40% protein, 40% carbohydrate, 30% fat), structured exercise program, and behavioural therapy. From weeks 13 to 48, all participants were placed on the structured lifestyle program conducted through a website. Outcome measures include body weight, fasting lipids, insulin, glucose, psychological distress, self-esteem, food cravings, energy intake and physical activity. Primary analyses were conducted using linear mixed models. Results: At baseline, psychological distress and hyperandrogenemia were associated with increased food cravings (P&lt;0.01). At 12-weeks, L-QT group had greater weight loss (-4.2&#177;0.4 kg) compared to M-QL (-1.0&#177;0.4 kg) and P-QL groups (-0.2&#177;0.3 kg) (P&lt;0.001). Attrition at week 12 was high particularly in L-QT group, ie 48% (28/59) for L-QT group, 34% (22/65) for M-QL group and 29% (23/79) for P-QL group (P=0.08). Baseline psychological distress and food cravings predicted attrition at week 12. At week 12, L-QT group had significantly greater improvements in psychological distress (-3.0+0.9 vs -0.84+0.52, P=0.013) and self-esteem (3.2&#177;0.8 vs -0.04&#177;0.4, P&lt;0.001) compared to the M-QL and P-QL groups. At 48 weeks, both QT and QL groups maintained significant weight loss (-4.8&#177;0.1 kg vs -1.3&#177;0.4 kg respectively, P=0.0005). Weight changes from week 13 to 48 were similar between the groups (P&gt;0.05). Attrition was similarly high in both groups by week 48 (78%; 159/203) (P=0.003). Being married or having children predicted attrition at week 48. Conclusions: A structured lifestyle intervention program was more effective than metformin in achieving weight loss in young women. Quantitative lifestyle advice produced greater improvements in psychological outcomes compared to qualitative lifestyle advice. Internet-based weight loss program was effective in maintaining weight loss in young women independent of initial weight loss. High attrition rates were seen throughout the study, particularly among those who had greater psychological distress or food cravings, and those who were married or had children. Strategies on managing issues relating to psychological distress, food cravings and family responsibilities may allow better tailoring of weight management programs for this group.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">obesity; weightloss; young women</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60981</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Insulin sensitivity and nutrient utilisation in skeletal muscle.</field><field name="creator">Lam, Yan Yan</field><field name="description">Obesity is a condition in which fat accumulation in adipose tissue is in excess to an extent that health may be impaired. Insulin resistance is integral to the pathophysiology of obesity-related metabolic complications. Central adiposity and skeletal muscle mass and function determine insulin sensitivity and metabolic risk. A high visceral fat-to-skeletal muscle mass-ratio contributes to an unfavourable metabolic profile. Epidemiological and experimental studies suggest that high dietary saturated fat intake is deleterious while polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), in particular n-3 PUFAs of marine origin, may be advantageous to metabolic health. The aim was to determine the effect of subcutaneous (SC) and visceral (IAB) fat, and long-chain saturated, n-3 and n-6 PUFAs, and the interactions between them, on insulin sensitivity and the pathways regulating energy metabolism in skeletal muscle. Thereby an adipose tissue-conditioned media-skeletal muscle myotube co-culture system was developed. Adipose tissue-conditioned medium (CM) was generated from SC and IAB fat biopsy of obese humans. Viability of the tissue explants was confirmed by the measurement of lactate dehydrogenase activity in the CM and nuclear DNA fragmentation of tissue explants. The concentrations of cytokines (leptin, adiponectin, interleukin (IL)-1&#946;, IL 6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor-&#945;, resistin and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1) and long-chain fatty acids were determined in CM. CM from IAB but not SC fat reduced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. The effect of IAB fat was predominantly mediated by IL-6 via the activation of a nuclear factor kappa B/mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (NF&#954;B/mTORC1)-dependent pathway. Palmitic acid (PA; 16:0) reduced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, an effect mediated by intramuscular accumulation of ceramide and the activation of NF&#954;B and mTORC1. The effects of fatty acids were similar in the presence of CM from either fat depot, where the effect of PA was partially reversed by docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3) and completely by linoleic acid (LA; 18:2n-6). The effect of each fatty acid in the presence or absence of CM from each fat depot on mRNA expression of key genes regulating muscle energy metabolism was determined. Protein phosphorylation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-&#945; and acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC)-&#946; were also determined. PA increased SCD1 mRNA. DHA and LA increased AMPK&#945;2 mRNA and AMPK&#945; and ACC&#946; protein phosphorylation. Microarray analysis was used to determine the global gene expression changes in PAand DHA-treated L6 myotubes. DHA down-regulated lipogenic genes and upregulated genes which were involved in &#946;-oxidation and mitochondrial function. When compared to PA, DHA down-regulated genes which were involved in lipid synthesis, endoplasmic reticulum metabolism and mitogen-activated protein kinase activity. Taken together, pro-inflammatory cytokines from IAB fat and PA induced insulin resistance in skeletal muscle and both were at least partly mediated by a NF&#954;B/mTORC1-dependent pathway. In contrast, DHA and LA may improve insulin sensitivity by diverting fatty acids towards oxidation and subsequently reducing substrate availability for the formation of lipid metabolites including ceramide. A reduction in PA intake and substitution (rather than addition) of DHA and LA, together with a reduction in overall energy intake and increase in physical activity, is optimal for metabolic health.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">skeletal muscle; insulin resistance</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60982</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Automatic underwater multiple objects detection and tracking using sonar imaging.</field><field name="creator">Zhao, Shi</field><field name="description">The exploration of oceans and sea beds is being made increasingly possible through the development of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). This is an activity that concerns the marine community and it must confront the existence of notable challenges. These include, for example, mining minerals, inspecting pipeline and mapping oceans, sampling in contaminated water. Also, there has been another growing interest for security forces in precluding submarines or intruders from a beach or harbour entrance as well as hunting shallow water mines. However, an automatic detecting and tracking system is the first and foremost element for an AUV or an aqueous surveillance network. Since accurate surrounding information is essential in order to manoeuvre the AUV efficiently and economically, while corrupt information can jeopardize an entire mission. By extracting the space information form sensors, an AUV can achieve the localisation and mapping which are currently two primary concerns in the robotics research. Meanwhile, such information will provide a fundament of protection for surface vessels or troops, harbour infrastructure and oil plant against the enemy and terrorism. Acoustic sensors are commonly used to detect and position underwater obstacles, suspicious objects or to map the surroundings because sound waves can propagate more appreciable distances than electromagnetic and optical energy in the water. The measurements from these sensors, however, are always bound up with noises and errors. Various underwater activities may further pollute sound signals and then threaten the AUV navigation process. To simplify the detection procedure, some researchers make use of acoustic beacons or apparent obstructions (such as rocks, concrete walls) because they have distinctive characteristics. Point or line features are extracted from the acoustic signals or images for localization and mapping purposes. The long propagation range of sound waves can present new problems when acoustic sensors operate in confined environments, such as water tanks, rivers and harbours. The multiple reflections will be recorded by the sensor and result in false alarms. Furthermore, with advances in manufacturing techniques, the downsizing in marine explosive ordnances is progressing significantly, making it more difficult to discriminate between surface reflections and explosive ordnances. Finally, under the consideration of cost effectiveness, a mechanically scanned sonar has been introduced for the AUV in this research. However, the sensor beam cannot cover a large region simultaneously and a moving object may be distorted in the acoustic image because of the relatively low scanning speed. Due to such distortions in the data flows, objects may be indistinguishable from random noise or reverberation in acoustic images. The research presented here addresses the afore-mentioned problems relating to the theme of automatic detection from acoustic images. It is concerned with the detection and tracking of small underwater objects in order to protect autonomous underwater vehicles using sonar (SOund Navigation and Range). In the present study, these vehicles operated in laboratory water tanks or natural river environments. This research made use of self provided analytical studies that differentiated between reverberation and real object echoes. Detections were achieved automatically by using signal and image processing techniques. This research consists of three important and linked strategies. Firstly, a simple and fast reverberation suppression filter was provided, based on the understanding of the mechanism of the sonar sensor. Secondly, a robust detection system was developed to perceive small suspended obstacles in the water. Thirdly and finally, arc features were successfully extracted from the acoustic images and mathematical maps were generated from those features. The majority of experiments were derived from the elliptical water tank and the River Torrens, Adelaide, South Australia. For this project, a sequence of sonar images was taken from the same sonar location in the elliptical water tank. Further, a sequence of sonar images was taken from a sequence of sonar locations in the natural river. They provided different data sets for the assessment and evaluation of self developed algorithms. Results shown in this thesis confirm the favourable outcomes of the investigation and applied methodology.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sonar imaging; image processing; target detection; AUV</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60983</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mulches in smallholder maize systems in the Limpopo Province of South Africa: untangling the effects of N through experimentation and simulation.</field><field name="creator">Sasa, Seshuhla Rebinah</field><field name="description">In Limpopo Province of South Africa, poor soil fertility and low crop yields are serious problems facing resource poor smallholder farmers. A survey of over 60 farmers in 2 villages (Gabaza and GaKgoroshi) found that most of the smallholder farmers were women (68%), elderly (50% above 68 years of age) and had not attended school or only attended up to the primary level (80%). Very few farmers kept livestock (usually in small numbers) and most grew cereal and legume crops (on 1ha of land) for home consumption and livestock feed, with legumes being planted on 13% of the land. The study showed that 80% of farmers were not fully aware of the benefits of legumes in fixing nitrogen (N) and improving yield. A field study at the survey village of Gabaza found that the application of fertiliser N and grass mulch combination and fertiliser N plus guarbean mulch significantly increased plant height and maize shoot growth at 4 and 8 weeks after planting. However, when grass mulch was without N fertiliser, there was no increase in maize growth relative to the control (0N). A farming systems simulation model (Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator - APSIM) was used to simulate this field study as well as over the long-term (1971 to 2008). Simulation analysis showed poor average maize yield (&lt;3000 kg ha&#8315; &#185;) with the application of grass residues even when used with 30 kg N fertiliser. However, the application of guarbean residues as mulch with or without N fertiliser and as green manure increased maize yields to &gt;4000 kg ha&#8315; &#185;. Simulation showed that the grass mulch with or without the addition of N fertiliser reduced water stress and soil water evaporation but increased N stress during the reproductive phase of the crop in most seasons. When guarbean mulch was used as green manure by itself, or mulch plus N fertiliser, N stress was reduced but water stress and soil water evaporation were increased which could have been due to faster decomposition of legume mulch as compared to grass mulch. Addition of N fertiliser reduced N stress to maize but increased water stress and soil water evaporation similar to the guarbean mulch because of high soil evaporation. APSIM analysis clearly showed the importance of N x soil water interactions in determining maize growth and yield at Gabaza. Therefore, two studies were undertaken in the laboratory in Australia to determine the dynamics of carbon (C) and N where residues of different qualities [canola (C:N 43), wheat (26), pea (9) and mucuna (14)] were applied to clay loam (Tarlee) or sandy (Waikerie) soils. In experiment 1, where residues were incorporated into the two soils, the cumulative CO&#8322;-C evolution for the wheat and canola treatments at the end of the incubation period were fairly similar but significantly higher than for pea, mucuna and the control. In general, the application of residues increased microbial biomass C more than the control, with highest increases up to 1.48 and 1.56 mg C g&#8315; &#185; soil for canola and wheat in Tarlee soil, respectively and 0.82 mg C g&#8315; &#185; soil for pea in Waikerie soil. Even though the Tarlee soil showed greater C release than Waikerie soil, the C turnover from the residues between the 2 soils was not significantly different except for pea residues. Canola and wheat residues were found to immobilise N whereas N content increased in both soils with the application of legumes (pea and mucuna). In experiment 2, mucuna, pea and wheat residues were either incorporated or applied as surface mulches on Waikerie soil. Initially the CO&#8322;-C release was higher for incorporated than mulched residues and CO&#8322;-C released was higher for pea residues. However, at the end of the incubation more CO&#8322;-C was released with the application of wheat residue indicating differences between residue types in the pattern of soil respiration. Microbial biomass C was higher for incorporated than mulched residue treatments; pea residue showed the highest biomass C for incorporated (0.78 mg C g&#8315; &#185; soil) whereas mucuna had the highest microbial biomass (0.11 mg C g&#8315; &#185; soil) treatments. The method of residue application resulted in a significant difference in C turnover between residues, with pea residue showing significant increase in C utilisation than mucuna and wheat. The pea residues, which had the lowest C:N, increased soil mineral N more than other treatments in both incorporated and mulched treatments. Lower mineralisation of N observed in residues of high C:N ratio compared to the control could be due to immobilisation of N. Therefore, understanding the nutrient dynamics of different crop residues could play an important role in the management of residues in different soil types. Based on these results it can be concluded that legume residues have the potential to improve soil fertility and crop yields in dryland farmers&#8217; fields in Limpopo. Extension programs aimed at increasing farmers&#8217; knowledge of the benefits of N fixation by legumes may increase their adoption and thereby improve soil fertility and maize yield.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">smallholder; maize; legume; mulch; grass mulch; N fertiliser; APSIM; N mineralization; carbon mineralization</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60984</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of signal pathway protein-protein interactions during biotic and abiotic stress.</field><field name="creator">Malone, Jenna Moira</field><field name="description">The overall objective of the work described in this thesis was to characterise the three genes Hv14.3.3c, HvMAPKK1 and HvFKBP41, in terms of a role in defence and stress response signalling. These genes had previously been found to be differentially expressed in compatible versus incompatible interactions of barley with the fungus Rhynchosporium secalis, suggesting a possible role in the plant defence response, while current literature suggests these genes may also play a role in signal transduction, possibly under a broad range of stresses, including abiotic as well as biotic. Two main approaches were undertaken to characterise gene function: expression analysis and the identification of protein-protein interactions. To facilitate expression analysis, full length cDNA fragments of each gene were first obtained using bioinformatics, RACE and genomic walking techniques. Expression was then investigated using quantitative real-time RT-PCR. The results of the expression analysis confirmed that the candidate genes were in fact differentially expressed during infection, suggesting a role in the defence response of barley against R. secalis. Analysing their expression in the context of other stresses and treatments, namely frost, drought and ABA, indicated their role may not be limited only to biotic stress, but include abiotic stress as well. To investigate the possibility that these genes are involved in signalling during the defence response, protein-protein interaction techniques such as yeast two-hybrid and affinity pulldowns were used to identify interacting proteins in an attempt to place the genes within a known signalling network and build and extend on these networks. Y2H screening was used successfully to identify two putative interactors of Hv14.3.3c; an EPSP (5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate) synthase and a putative wound-induced protein, and two interactors of HvFKBP41; a Rab-type GTPase and the same wound-induced protein. From what is known about the function of these genes in the literature, they fit well with a role in stress response signalling and the potential to be involved in signalling networks with the candidate gene products and also with each other. Through the trial of many different affinity pulldown techniques, a method for identifying interacting proteins from plant extracts was successfully established, however, issues with protein identification meant that interacting proteins were not identified using this technique. Steps were then made towards confirming the interactions identified using the Y2H system. Full length cDNA sequences of the identified interactors were obtained and expression analysis performed, in the aim of investigating co-expression patterns between the genes encoding the interacting proteins and the three candidate genes, to support a potential interaction. To confirm the Hv14.3.3c-HvEPSP interaction, co-immunoprecipitation and BRET were then used, however confirmation was unsuccessful due to issues with non-specific binding in co-immunoprecipitation and technical issues trying to establish the BRET analysis system in barley. In summary, the results of this study place the candidate genes Hv14.3.3c, HvMAPKK1 and HvFKBP41 as players in signal transduction during the plant defence/stress response. With the identification of previously uncharacterised protein interactions, some progress has also been made towards placing these genes within known signalling networks and identifying potential downstream genes that could possibly play a more specific role in defence response signalling and therefore be potential targets for the generation of resistant or stress tolerant plants.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">14.3.3; MAPKK; FKBP; barley; rhynchosporium; Y2H; protein pulldown</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60985</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular characterisation of primary wool follicle initiation in Merino sheep.</field><field name="creator">McGrice, Hayley Ann</field><field name="description">Primary wool follicles are initiated in the skin of sheep foetuses at approximately day 50 of gestation as the result of complex reciprocal molecular interactions between the mesenchyme and overlying epithelium. The lifetime wool production potential and fibre diameter of the Merino sheep is dependent on the total number of follicles initiated in utero. Understanding the molecular events that surround primary wool follicle initiation may provide approaches to enhance or manipulate this process in order to maximise the profitability of wool production enterprises. In order to study the morphological and molecular changes occurring during early wool follicle development, a foetal skin series spanning primary follicle initiation was generated. Foetal skin was sampled from the shoulder, midside and rump of four foetuses at 8 time points between day 43 and day 68 of gestation. Histological characterisation of the shoulder skin samples revealed that primary epidermal placodes emerged at around day 53, dermal condensates were visible from day 57 and downgrowth of the follicle began at day 68. An equation relating age of the foetus (day of gestation post AI) and crown-rump length, specific to Merino foetuses, was developed for use in future studies of this nature. Molecular markers of fibroblast migration, epidermal and dermal stem cells and cell proliferation were selected to test the hypothesis that dermal condensates are initiated at discrete sites beneath the epidermis as a result of a combination of migration and arrangement of multipotent pre-papilla cells. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis of RAC1 and RHOa (migration markers), &#946;1-integrin and alkaline phosphatase (stem cell markers), proliferative nuclear cell antigen and cyclinB1 (proliferation markers), patched-1, selected tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signalling molecules and eleven reference genes was conducted using midside and rump skin samples from each of four foetuses from the 8 time points. geNorm analysis of the reference and target genes revealed that the migration markers RAC1 and RHOa along with GAPDH were the most stably expressed genes in this sample series. Significant changes in mRNA expression were detected for &#946;1-integrin, alkaline phosphatase, patched-1 and the TNF members EDA, EDAR, TROY and TRAF6. Many of these significant differences in expression coincided with key morphological events. Significant differences in expression were also detected between the midside and rump samples for numerous transcripts. Laser capture microdissection (LCM) was implemented for analysis of the target transcripts within particular structures of foetal sheep skin. Frozen tissue sectioning, staining, LCM, RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis were optimised for qRT-PCR analysis of endogenous controls and selected TNF transcripts. Several RNA extraction methods and reverse transcription approaches were trialled to ensure optimum extraction and reverse transcription efficiency for this tissue type. Exogenous mRNA transcripts were also incorporated prior to RNA extraction and reverse transcription to track reaction efficiency between samples. A comparison of different slide types revealed that laser pressure catapulting from membrane slides was an absolute requirement for foetal skin tissue studies. Follicle regions (including the epidermal placode and dermal condensate) and the adjacent non-follicle regions were laser captured from foetal skin, and the mRNA expression levels of patched-1 and selected TNF members was compared. Preliminary qRT-PCR analysis using this technique revealed that EDAR, TROY and PTCH1 mRNA levels were higher in the follicle regions than the non-follicle regions. The TNF signalling pathway appears to play an important role in primary wool follicle initiation and patterning at different sites on the body. Spatial differences in expression of some of these regulators may be involved in initiating different types of follicles. The molecular events surrounding primary wool follicle initiation also show a high degree of conservation between sheep, humans, and mice. Considering the high degree of DNA sequence conservation as well as the histological, signalling and cycling similarities between sheep and humans, sheep may represent a better model for the study of human hair follicle initiation and disease than the currently used mice and rat models.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">wool follicle initiation; hair follicle initiation; laser capture microdissection; qRT-PCR</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60986</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of in vitro stress on pre-implantation embryo development, viability and mitochondrial homestasis.</field><field name="creator">Zander, Deirdre</field><field name="description">It is recognised that the environment to which the fetus is exposed in utero, after implantation, can program longer term health outcomes and alter the possibility of disease onset later in life. It is becoming evident that the environment, to which the pre-implantation embryo is exposed, can also affect the ability of the embryo to form a viable pregnancy as well as altering fetal growth. Despite this understanding, little is known about the mechanism by which the environment can &#8216;program&#8217; the pre-implantation embryo. Using model stress systems, either ammonium or DMO in the culture medium, this thesis addressed the hypothesis that suboptimal environmental conditions may alter mitochondrial homeostasis and function and/or epigenetic parameters and these are the possible mechanisms responsible for the altered fetal outcomes seen. While common measures of embryo quality such as on time blastocyst development were not affected by either stress, more in-depth investigations found several striking differences. Exposure to DMO significantly decreased blastocyst cell number and allocation to the inner cell mass and trophectoderm, as well as increased blastocyst apoptosis. After exposure to DMO, blastocysts were transferred to pseudopregnant recipients, and both the ability of the embryos to implant and develop into a fetus was impaired as well as fetal weights and crown rump length were significantly reduced indicative of altered growth. Similar results have also been demonstrated after pre-implantation embryos are exposed to ammonium in vitro. Exposure to ammonium during pre-implantation embryo development also altered placental gene expression and function, indicating a possible mechanism of the observed reduced fetal growth parameters. Interestingly, the pre-implantation embryo appears to be the most vulnerable to an environmental stress during the pre-compaction stage, in particular the zygote to 2-cell transition, as exposure to either stress during this stage alone shows similar perturbations to if the stress was present for the entire pre-implantation developmental period. At this early stage of embryo development, mitochondria are the sole energy generators and are therefore critical for embryo function. This study determined that either ammonium or DMO stress exposure, during the first cleavage division, significantly perturbed mitochondrial distribution, membrane potential and ATP/ADP levels. Removal of the stress did not allow these effects to be completely reversed, implicating mitochondrial perturbations as a possible mechanism behind altered embryo programming. During pre-implantation embryo development there are also significant epigenetic changes which are vital for re-programming the embryonic genome. Both in vitro stresses significantly altered DNA de-methylation at the 2-cell stage and reduced blastocyst gene expression levels of DNA methyltransferases (Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b), which are responsible for de novo methylation. Together these data highlight the importance of pre-implantation embryo development as a critical period of growth in which the presence of environmental stress can have an impact on metabolic homeostasis and critical epigenetic events that may be responsible for the downstream effects seen on fetal growth. These results are not only important for assisted reproductive therapy, where the presence of an in vitro laboratory stress can potentially alter embryo programming, but are also important for in vivo embryo development where the health and wellbeing of the mother can also potentially influence the in utero environment and thus the long-term health outcomes of her child.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">embryo culture; in-vitro stress; ammonium; PH; mitochondria; metabolism; IVF</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60987</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of selenomethionine and wheat biofortified with selenium on DNA damage and cell death in human lymphocytes.</field><field name="creator">Wu, Jing</field><field name="description">Selenium (Se) is an essential micronutrient, being a component of more than twenty seleno-proteins in humans. Previous studies suggested that increased intake of Se may reduce the risk of degenerative diseases including cancer; however, excessive intake can be toxic. Wheat is one of the major dietary sources of Se in humans, mainly in the form of L-selenomethionine (Se-met) but the impact of this source of Se on human health at the genome level was previously unexplored. This PhD project aimed to (a) determine the safe dose-range and bio-efficacy of Se-met in vitro; (b) identify the optimal concentration of Se-met for reduction of genome damage in vitro; (c) investigate the optimal concentration of Se-met for improving resistance to gamma radiation or hydrogen peroxide induced genome damage in vitro; d) determine the bioavailability and bioefficacy of Se in vivo, in the form of either Semet or wheat biofortified with Se; e) identify the nutrients and food groups that are correlated with Se intake/status and f) identify the nutrients, food groups and plasma mineral concentrations that are correlated to baseline lymphocyte DNA damage. The in vitro study was performed on the peripheral blood lymphocytes isolated from six males and cultured with media supplemented with Se-met in a series of Se concentrations from 3 to 3850 &#956;g Se/l while keeping the total methionine (i.e. Se-met + L-methionine) concentration constant. Baseline genome stability of lymphocytes and the extent of DNA damage induced by 1.5 Gy &#947;-ray or 7.5 &#956;M hydrogen peroxide (H&#8322;O&#8322;) were investigated using the Cytokinesis-block Micronucleus Cytome (CBMNCyt) assay and the alkaline Comet assay with and without glycosylase (Fpg or Endo III) treatment after 9 days of culture. Results showed that high Se concentrations (&#8805;1880 &#956;g Se/l) caused strong inhibition of cell division, extensive DNA damage and increased cell death indicating cytotoxicity and genotoxicity. Baseline frequency of nucleoplasmic bridges (NPBs) and nuclear buds (NBud) declined significantly as Se concentration increased from 3 &#956;g Se/l to 430 &#956;g Se/l (P trend = 0.03 and 0.008, respectively); however, a significant trend of increase in Comet DNA damage was also observed (P trend &lt;0.05) in lymphocytes. Selenium concentration (&#8804; 430 &#956;g Se/l) had no significant effect on baseline frequency of micronuclei (MN) or DNA oxidation and had no protective effect against &#947;-ray-induced or H&#8322;O&#8322;-induced genome damage in lymphocytes. A randomised double-blind placebo-controlled intervention trial was conducted on healthy South Australian males (n = 62, age (mean &#177; SD) 56 &#177; 7.0 years) with Se dosage increased every 8 weeks for a total duration of 24 weeks. This study compared the bioavailability, by using plasma Se concentration as the biomarker, and bioefficacy of Se, by using platelet glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity and lymphocyte DNA damage as biomarkers, from wheat process-fortified with Se-met (PROFORT) and high-Se wheat biofortified with Se (BIOFORT) compared to non-fortified normal (CONTROL) wheat. It was found that increased Se intake from BIOFORT wheat increased plasma Se concentration effectively in a dose-response manner from a baseline of 122 &#956;g/l up to 190 &#956;g/l (P&lt;0.001). Increased Se intake from PROFORT wheat also increased plasma Se with a plateau at 140 &#956;g/l, being therefore less effective than BIOFORT wheat (P&lt;0.001). There was no significant change in Se status in the CONTROL group. Improved plasma Se concentrations had no effect on platelet GPx activity or lymphocyte DNA damage in either of the intervention groups. Results from the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) survey (n = 173) and plasma Se concentration survey (n = 179) suggested that the study population screened for participation in the in vivo trial described above had a mean plasma Se concentration (&#177; SD) of 102 (&#177; 12) &#956;g/l and a mean (&#177; SD) estimated Se intake of 165 (&#177; 68) &#956;g/d. This is a higher estimated Se intake than found in previous Australian studies. The major dietary sources of Se were found to be bread/cereals, fish/seafood and meat. However, increased intake of nuts/seeds, which are rich in Se, may have undesirable effects on lymphocyte DNA oxidation in this Se-replete population. In conclusion, the in vitro studies suggest that (1) Se-met at higher concentrations at greater or equal to 1880 &#956;g Se/l is cytotoxic; (2) Se-met may improve specific genome stability biomarkers such as nucleoplasmic bridge and nuclear bud at concentrations up to 430 &#956;g Se/l, but further studies are needed to verify this effect. The in vivo studies in older men showed that Se from BIOFORT wheat is more effective in raising plasma Se concentration than Se from wheat process-fortified by the addition of Se-met, when both wheat products were subjected to strong heat. However, the platelet GPx activity and lymphocyte DNA damage appeared not to be modified by improved Se status.

This integrated modelling framework is based on three spatial scales. At the smallest spatial resolution, several cardiac cellular models are implemented that are used to represent the underlying cellular electrophysiology. A bidomain framework is used to couple multiple individual cells together and this provides a mathematical model of the myocardial tissue. The cardiac geometry is described using finite elements with high order cubic Hermite basis function interpolation. An anatomically based description of the fibrous laminar cardiac microstructure is then defined relative to the geometric mesh. Within the local element space of the cardiac finite elements, a fine collocation mesh is created on which the bidomain equations are solved. Each collocation point represents a continuum cell and contains a cellular model to describe the local active processes. This bidomain implementation works in multiple coordinate systems and over deforming domains, in addition to having the ability to spatially vary any parameter throughout the myocardium. On the largest spatial scale the passive torso regions surrounding the myocardium are modelled using a generalised Laplace equation to describe the potential field and current flows. The torso regions are discretised using either finite elements or boundary elements depending on the electrical properties of each region. The cardiac region is coupled to the surrounding torso through several methods. A traditional dipole source approach is implemented that creates equivalent cardiac sources through the summation of cellular dipoles. These dipoles are then placed within a homogeneous cardiac region and the resulting potential field is calculated throughout the torso. Two new coupling techniques are developed that provide a more direct path from cellular activation to body surface potentials. One approach assembles all of the equations from the passive torso regions and the equations from the extracellular bidomain region into a single matrix system. Coupling conditions based on the continuity of potential and current flow across the myocardial surfaces are used to couple the regions and therefore solving the matrix system yields a solution that is continuous across all of the solution points within the torso. The second approach breaks the large system into smaller subproblems and the continuity conditions are iii iv imposed through an iterative approach. Across each of the myocardial surfaces, a fixed point iteration is set up with the goal of converging towards zero potential and current flow differences between adjacent regions. All of the numerical methods used within the integrated modelling framework are rigorously tested individually before extensive tests are performed on the coupling techniques. Large scale simulations are run to test the dipole source approach against the new coupling techniques. Several sets of simulations are run to investigate the effects of using different ionic current models, using different bidomain model simplifications, and the role that the torso inhomogeneities play in generating body surface potentials. The main question to be answered by this study is whether or not the traditional approach of combining a monodomain heart with an equivalent cardiac source in a two step approach is adequate when generating body surface potentials. Comparisons between the fully coupled framework developed here and several dipole based approaches demonstrate that the resulting sets of signals have different magnitudes and different waveform shapes on both the torso and epicardial surface, clearly illustrating the inadequacy of the equivalent cardiac source models. It has been found that altering the modelling assumptions on each spatial scale produces noticeable effects. At the smallest scale, the use of different cell models leads to significantly different body surface potential traces. At the next scale the monodomain approach is unable to accurately reproduce the results from a full bidomain framework, and at the largest level the inclusion of different torso inhomogeneities has a large effect on the magnitude of the torso and epicardial potentials. Adding a pair of lungs to the torso model changes the epicardial potentials by an average of 16% which is consistent with the experimental range of between 8 and 20%. This provides evidence that only a complex, coupled, biophysically based model will be able to properly reproduce clinical ECGs.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291500 Biomedical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2133</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of the flow properties of New Zealand wood pulp suspensions</field><field name="creator">Duffy, Geoffrey G.</field><field name="description">One of the most important process operations in the pulp and paper industry is the transport of pulp in pipe lines. Because pipe friction losses are much higher than with water under comparable conditions, accurate design correlations for each pulp are important to the industry. The purpose of this investigation was to design and build a flow rig suitable for investigating a wide range of pulp conditions, to obtain pipe friction loss data for New Zealand pulps, and to produce design correlations and procedures for the industry. This thesis is therefore concerned primarily with describing the experimental equipment and procedures, presenting pipe friction loss data for a variety of New Zealand pulps, including a design correlation for them, and developing design methods for computing friction losses. It includes, in addition, data on drag reduction observed at high velocities of flow, and a discussion of flow mechanisms in each regime of flow. The equipment was designed to produce friction loss data from three pipe diameters simultaneously for each consistency of pulp. Flow rate was controlled without throttling the flow. Pipe friction loss data are presented for five Kraft pulps and one neutral sulphite semi-chemical pulp. Data were obtained from 1,2,3 and 4 in. diameter PVC pipes for a wide range of consistencies and flow rates up to 0.8 ft3/sec. Standard Lampen mill evaluations on hand sheets made from the pulps are presented, as well as data on the characteristics of the fibres. The Kraft pulps exhibited the characteristic maxima and minima but the semi-chemical pulp did not exhibit these turning points. For Kraft pulps head losses before the respective maxima were increased by refining the pulp and using rough pipe; and decreased by adding short-fibre Tawa and by drying and reslushing the pulp. In comparison with maxima for the unbeaten Kraft Pulp, the maxima of the head loss curves for all Kraft pulps were shifted to lower velocities by the above-mentioned operations. This would reduce the friction loss in many practical cases. In particular, rough pipe lowers the magnitude of friction loss in this regime, and can therefore yield a considerable economic advantage. A single design correlation for Kraft pulps is presented for the regime of flow before the maxima in the head loss curves. The limits of the correlation are given. Friction losses of New Zealand pulps were found to be lower than those previously reported in the literature. Two methods of design are presented for the regimes at velocities above the maxima in the head loss curves. A procedure is suggested for pulp and paper mills to obtain their own limits for the design correlation and to verify the correlation proposed in this investigation for their own pulps. A design correlation for the Tawa NSSC pulp is also presented. Mechanisms of flow are discussed for Kraft pulps and a semi-chemical pulp. Visual observations in an artificially roughened pipe for the regime of flow before the maxima of the head loss curves have confirmed fibre-wall contact in this regime. Data obtained at the first sign of permanent plug disruption have been correlated with data at the onset of drag reduction. Fully developed turbulence was found to occur at the maximum level of drag reduction. Some velocity profiles are reported for the transition regime using a modified annular-purge probe. In addition the disruptive shear stress of fibre networks has been correlated by three different methods. Data for the onset of drag reduction are presented and compared with data previously obtained from large diameter pipes from other investigations. This correlation is used as a method for designing piping systems at high flow rates.</field><field name="date">1972</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2532</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of UHF communications on overhead earth-wires in power transmission networks</field><field name="creator">Castle, N. J.</field><field name="description">The motivation for this research is a proposed UHF surface wave communication system in which the waveguides are the stranded, overhead earth wires of Power System transmission lines. Attention is confined largely to an investigation of certain aspects which affect the overall surfaces wave transmission loss, a full-scale system having been set up in the laboratory for experimental purposes. For the prediction of transmission loss the stranded conductor is assumed to be equivalent to a solid conductor of the same diameter but with surface anisotropy in the form of two mutually orthogonal surface impedances the major reactive component of which is attributed to the effects of the helical stranding. This reactance is determined from a consideration of the fields which are assumed to exist within the cavities between the strands, and externally. From a comparison between experimental and theoretical loss characteristics there is sufficient inducement to accept the anisotropic model of the stranded conductor for practical design purposes. Approximate equations are developed to simplify the calculation of transmission loss and the notion of &#8216;capture cross-section&#8217; is employed for the estimation of the efficiency of conical horn launchers. It is deduced from &#8216;sensitivity&#8217; relationships that the horn loss is relatively insensitive to small changes in the fictitious surface reactance representing the effects of helical stranding, which tends to justify the assumptions upon which the anisotropic model is based. On the other hand, variations in the helix angle are shown to have a marked effect upon the calculated horn loss. This influences the choice of the stranded conductor used as the waveguide for the experimental verification of the model. The Author&#8217;s experimental research is described at length, the principal objective being to establish the anisotropic model as an acceptable theoretical substitute for the stranded conductor. To reduce the horn loss, dielectric sheaths are ted to the waveguide in the vicinity of the horn apertures. The discrepancies which then appear between theory and experiment are attributed both to the scattering of the surface wave by the boundary discontinuities at the ends of the sheaths and to the anomalous behaviour of commercial-grade PVC dielectric. Considering the increase in the transmission efficiency which may be realised by fitting dielectric sheaths to the conductor near the horn apertures it is concluded that a theoretical investigation of the scattering properties of the discontinuities  s in order. Thus, the remainder of the Thesis is devoted, to this scattering effect as it may be encountered in the proposed scheme, the theoretical analysis following the lines of earlier documented research. A short-cut method is applied for the determination of certain &#8216;half-plane&#8217; functions which appear in the expressions for the scattered power. Theoretical results are presented together with a discussion of some experimental measurements and a brief theoretical examination of the effects on the horn loss of varying the thickness of the dielectric sheaths. It is argued that the horn loss may be reduced if the dielectric thickness is graded in steps to a value at the horn apertures consistent with the desired &#8216;power capture&#8217;. The Thesis is concluded with an Addendum which outlines a number of topics suggested by the Author for future research.</field><field name="date">1976</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290900 Electrical and Electronic Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2542</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The nature of the relationship of the Crown in New Zealand with iwi Maori</field><field name="creator">Healy, Susan</field><field name="description">This study investigates the nature of the relationship that the state in New Zealand, the Crown, has established with M&#257;ori as a tribally-based people. Despite the efforts of recent New Zealand Governments to address the history of Crown injustice to M&#257;ori, the relationship of the Crown with Iwi M&#257;ori continues to be fraught with contradictions and tension. It is the argument of the thesis that the tension exists because the Crown has imposed a social, political, and economic order that is inherently contradictory to the social, political, and economic order of the M&#257;ori tribal world. Overriding an order where relationships are negotiated and alliances built between autonomous groups, the Crown constituted itself as a government with single, undivided sovereignty, used its unilateral power to introduce policy and legislation that facilitated the dispossession of wh&#257;nau and hap&#363; of their resources and their authority in the land, and enshrined its own authority and capitalist social relations instead.

However its importance in biological systems altered dramatically with the discovery in 1987 that it was the 'endothelial-derived relaxing factor'. Since then there has been an explosion of research on NO demonstrating that this gaseous molecule was a widespread physiological mediator and was simultaneously recognised as a vital component of immune function contributing to macrophage-mediated cytotoxicity. NO was therefore a key molecule in modulating inflammation, including airway inflammation. The aim of this thesis was: 1. To adapt a NO chemiluminscence analyser from measuring airway pollution to measuring exhaled air in human subjects. 2. To measure NO levels in exhaled air in adult subjects. 3. To evaluate whether altering measurement parameters altered the levels of NO obtained. 4. To adapt this technique from adults to measure exhaled NO in children. 5. To compare levels of NO from healthy children to groups of asthmatic children on either bronchodilator therapy only, or on regular inhaled corticosteroids. 6. To compare the levels of NO in a pilot group of asthmatic children before and after commencement of inhaled corticosteroids. Methods A Dasibi Environmental Corporation Model 2107 chemiluminescence analyser was adapted specifically requiring a reduction in response time, which was achieved by modification of the circuitry and re-routing of the analogue signal directly to a chart recorder, achieving a reduction of the response time by 80%. Addition of a number of analysers allowed the measurement of exhaled NO, carbon dioxide (CO2), mouth pressure and flow for each exhalation from total lung capacity. Twenty adult subjects (in total) were then studied looking at direct (NO, CO2, mouth pressure) versus t-piece (with the addition of flow) measurements making five exhalations from total lung capacity, at 3-minute intervals (direct/t-piece/direct or t-piece/direct/t-piece in series). The area of NO under the curve versus the peak of the NO trace was compared and the exhalation pattern of NO versus CO2 was compared. Measurement conditions were altered to evaluate the effect of individual parameters on the exhaled NO result. This included separately assessing different expiratory flows, different expiratory mouth pressures, the effect of a high versus a low background NO level and the effect of drinking water (of varying temperatures) prior to exhalation. Healthy control children were then enrolled to the study from a local school (Park Walk Primary School) and compared with asthmatic children enrolled from outpatient clinics at the Royal Brompton Hospital. The asthmatic children were further divided into those on bronchodilator treatment only and those on regular inhaled corticosteroid therapy. NO was also measured before and two weeks after commencing inhaled corticosteroid therapy in previously steroid-naive asthmatics. Results It was possible to modify a chemiluminescence analyser to enable measurement of exhaled NO. In 12 healthy subjects (mean age 32 years, 6 males) peak direct NO levels were 84.8 parts per billion (ppb) (standard error of the mean (SEM) 14.0ppb), significantly higher than 41.2ppb (SEM 10.8ppb) measured via the t-piece system. The exhaled NO rose to an early peak and plateau while the CO2 levels continued to rise to peak late in the exhalation. The mean times to peak NO levels were 32.2 seconds (s) (direct) and 23.1s (t-piece), which was significantly different from the mean times to peak CO2 levels at 50.5s (direct) and 51.4s (t-piece, p&lt;0.001). At peak NO level, the simultaneous CO2 level of 4.9% (SEM 0.47%, direct) and 5.2% (SEM 0.18, t-piece) were significantly lower than the peak CO2 achieved of 5.8% (SEM 0.21%, direct, p&lt;0.001) and, 6.2% (SEM 0.28, t-piece, p&lt;0.001). There was no difference between repeat direct or t-piece measurements. With regard to varying measurement conditions, the mean peak concentrations of NO decreased by 35ppb (95% confidence intervals 25.7-43.4) from a mean of 79ppb (SEM 15.4ppb) at an expiratory flow rate of 250mls/min to 54.1ppb (SEM 10.7ppb) at 1100mls/min. The mean peak concentration of NO did not change significantly when mouth pressure was increased in eight of ten subjects, although in two it did decrease in the highest pressure. The mean NO concentration with machine and subjects sampling from a low NO reservoir was 123ppb (SEM 19.4), which was an increase from results obtained before at 81.9ppb, SEM 10.2ppb, p=0.001 95%, CI -19.9 to -62.7) and after at 94.2ppb(SEM 18.3ppb, p=0.017, 95% CI 6.0-5.18) sampling with high ambient NO levels. The mean peak NO concentration decreased from 94.4ppb (SEM 20.8) to 70.8ppb (SEM 16.5, p=0.002 95% CI 12.9 -33.1) with water consumption. In 39 healthy pre-pubertal children with a mean age of 9.9 years (range 9-11 years, 23 girls) the mean direct exhaled No level was 49.6ppb (SD 37.8ppb, range 11.5-197.2ppb) compared with mean exhaled No via t-piece sampling of 29.2ppb (SD 27.1ppb, range 5.1-141.2ppb). There was no significant difference between boys and girls for either the direct or the t-piece recordings. In comparison with normal children, 15 asthmatic children on bronchodilator therapy only had much higher levels of exhaled NO at 126.1ppb via the direct system (SD 77.1ppb, p&lt;0.001) and 109.5ppb via the t-piece system (SD 106.8ppb, p&lt;0.001). In 16 asthmatics on regular inhaled corticosteroids the mean peak exhaled levels were significantly lower at 48.7ppb via the direct method (SD 43.3ppb, p&lt;0.001) and via the t-piece system at 45.2ppb (SD 45.9ppb, p&lt;0.01). There was no difference between the normal children and the asthmatic children who were on regular inhaled corticosteroids (p=0.9 direct, p=0.2 t-piece).There was no significant difference in CO2, mouth pressure, duration of expiration and expiratory flows between the three groups or between the two methods (direct and t-piece). In six asthmatic children the mean peak exhaled NO levels fell from a medium peak level of 124.5ppb to 48.6ppb when measured before and two weeks after commencement of inhaled corticosteroids on treatment. Discussion This research showed it was possible to modify an NO chemiluminescence analyser to enable measurement of exhaled NO in adult and paediatric subjects. Furthermore, it was possible to measure both healthy and asthmatic children. There were significant differences between the exhalation pattern of NO and CO2 suggesting that NO was produced in the airways, not at alveolar level, unlike CO2. The measurement of exhaled NO required a standardised approach as exhaled NO levels decreased with increasing expiratory flow, when measuring at a time of high ambient NO concentration, and with consumption of either hot or cold water immediately preceding exhalation (such as might be given if a subject was coughing). The findings with expiratory mouth pressure were less certain, with a difference seen in only two of ten subjects. The levels of exhaled NO measured in children aged 9-11 years were lower than that measured in the adult subjects. There was no difference between boys and girls, or with other parameters such as having a personal history of atopy, a family history of atopy, or the presence of a smoker or furry pets within the house-hold. These findings may have altered with increased numbers in this group and could possibly be a type two statistical error. The results of exhaled NO in asthmatic children on bronchodilator therapy only were significantly elevated compared to both normal children and asthmatic children treated with regular inhaled corticosteroids. The exhaled NO level also fell significantly by two weeks following the commencement of inhaled corticosteroid treatment in steroid-naive asthmatic children. These results suggested that the methods of measuring exhaled NO required standardization and that it could potentially be a non-invasive measure of airway inflammation to follow - particularly in children with asthma who were commencing inhaled steroid treatment.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5558</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Organicism, motivic parallelism, and performance in Beethoven's piano sonata Op. 2 No. 3 : a thesis submitted to the New Zealand School of Music in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master  of Music in Musicology</field><field name="creator">Robb, Hamish James Alexander</field><field name="description">This thesis summarises the important ideologies and concepts of musical organicism in the late eighteenth century and applies them to motivic analysis and performance. Much has been written about the organic nature of Beethoven&#8217;s later works, but less has been written about the organic coherence found in his earlier compositions. This study involves a motivic analysis of his Op. 2 No. 3 sonata (1795), for which little or no significant research has been carried out. This musical work is used as an illustration of ways in which musical organicism, motivic analysis, and performance can interrelate. The thesis is in three parts. Part one presents a review of late eighteenth-century ideologies of unity and their musical applications. In the search for an effective means of comparing motivic development with organicism, it is then argued that Schenker&#8217;s &#8216;motivic parallelism&#8217; or &#8216;concealed repetition&#8217; is considerably undervalued in his analytical framework. Drawing on the insights of Richard Cohn, I endorse a more autonomous treatment of the motivic parallelism in analysis, so that it is an independent unifying tool in its own right and not only a by-product of tonal analysis. Several approaches are applied to the motivic parallelism in order to illustrate how the parallelism can be used in ways normally only associated with the surface motif. Part two of the thesis consists of a detailed motivic analysis of Beethoven&#8217;s Op. 2 No. 3 sonata. It is argued that the motivic parallelisms contained in this sonata reflect late eighteenth-century ideals of organicism. I propose that there are several motivic cells found in the opening four bars of the sonata, which recur (or are &#8216;paralleled&#8217;) within all structural levels and over all four movements, unifying the sonata organically as one whole. In this way, I show that the Op. 2 No. 3 sonata can be seen to foreshadow the organic treatment of motifs by later composers, who were influenced by Goethe&#8217;s complex prototype (1802) as an organic model.(1) I also offer an &#8216;organic narrative&#8217; for the sonata, using motivic parallelisms as the guiding forces in the discourse. The third and final part relates the motivic parallelisms and other analytical findings to performance. Techniques of &#8216;performing&#8217; motivic parallelisms are discussed and applied to the Op. 2 No. 3 sonata. The organic perspective is proposed as one avenue through which to understand and enhance a performance of a work.  (1) The sonata can also be seen to foreshadow the highly seminal treatment of motifs that was to become more widely used in Beethoven&#8217;s later works (such as the Eroica Symphony).</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">motivic analysis</field><field name="subject">organic narrative</field><field name="subject">eighteenth-century music</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410100 Performing Arts Studies::410101 Music studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1000</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Enhancing the SME NPD process through customer focused design activities: a New Zealand case study</field><field name="creator">McIntyre, James</field><field name="description">Small to Medium Enterprises (SMEs) face enormous financial risk when embarking on a new product launch. SMEs are less likely to implement more formal risk minimization strategies for new product development (NPD) such as StageGate, often citing reasons of resource constraints or the more prevalent notion that &#8220;this stuff doesn&#8217;t apply to us&#8221;. Two key elements of any such risk minimization strategies are an early emphasis on benchmarking competitors and a thorough study of the attitudes and behaviours of potential customers. The SME&#8217;s investment of time and resource in early acquisition of this knowledge is a critical factor for success (Cooper 2001). Armed with this information, the SME is able to adopt a Customer Focused Design (CFD) strategy, whereby the product development effort is remains focused on the external customers wants and needs through all phases. SMEs that are able to satisfy these needs more effectively enjoy an obvious competitive advantage (Matzler and Hinterhuber 1998; L&#252;thje 2004). SMEs are often challenged by these tasks (Freel 2000; Larsen and Lewis 2007; Owens 2007). They may be overwhelmed by the prospect of expected costs, lack of expertise, and financial pressures to rush to market. Too often the more conventional path is chosen, whereby a solution is proposed, developed and tested in the market to &#8220;see if it sticks&#8221;. Such methodologies are less effective and subject the SME to increased financial risk. International studies of SMEs attitudes and behaviour towards NPD reveal common challenges of resource limitations, skills deficiencies and organizational issues (Xueli, Soutar et al. 2002; de Jong and Vermeulen 2006; Siu, Lin et al. 2006; Murphy and Ledwith 2007; Owens 2007). New Zealand firms are no exception, and are burdened with similar challenges as their international counterparts. This study aims to propose a simple framework for small firms who wish to acquire knowledge about their target markets and potential customers with limited time and resources. The framework enables SMEs to incorporate customer focused design principles into their product definition phase, and better orient themselves to the consumer marketplace. The study makes use of a New Zealand based case study to evaluate how the framework may be employed to identify quick and inexpensive efforts that can reproduce some elements of more sophisticated CFD and benchmarking methods. The obtained results are incorporated into a product design specification and embodied into a physical prototype to further illuminate the process. In addition to the primary area of study, prospects for new adjacent product lines and new potential markets for future development are also gained from the research.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">small business</field><field name="subject">new product development</field><field name="subject">market research</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1073</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Switching costs in the New Zealand banking market : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Banking at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand / Claire Dianne Matthews</field><field name="creator">Matthews, Claire Dianne</field><field name="description">This thesis explores issues related to bank switching costs, in the context of the New Zealand banking market. Switching costs comprise the range of economic costs faced by customers changing bank, including monetary switching costs, the loss of the relationship with bank staff, and needing to learn new systems. An important effect of switching costs is customers become locked in to their bank, which has implications for market competition, and this raises questions about the need for a regulatory response. The study comprised a mail survey to 2983 people drawn from New Zealand electoral rolls, with a response rate of 34%. The survey instrument was a questionnaire of 70 questions in four sections: banking relationships, switching behaviour, switching costs, and demographic information. Nine categories of switching costs were used: Learning, Search, Monetary Loss, Benefit Loss, Personal Relationship, Brand Relationship, Service Disruption, Uncertainty, and Hassle. These categories are found to be appropriate. Furthermore, the three higher order categories of Procedural, Financial and Relational found by Burnham, Frels and Mahajan (2003) are confirmed. Although prior studies have recognised different switching costs, there has been limited work to understand whether they differ in their impact on attitudes and behaviour around switching. Different switching costs are found to have different effects. The study also examined whether the experience of switching matches the perception, and found switching is easier than expected. Furthermore, customers who have switched banks have different perceptions of switching costs to those who have not. Customers are different, and their attitudes and needs should therefore vary. Prior research has found differences in attitudes towards financial issues based on the family life cycle, but the relationship between switching costs and family life cycle has not been explored. This thesis finds perceptions of switching costs and switching behaviour vary significantly between life cycle groups, which appears in part to be related to associated changes in the complexity of the banking relationship. Four recommendations for regulators are generated from the results of the study. These include recommending greater acknowledgement of the existence and effect of switching costs, and investigation of bank account number portability.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">banking</field><field name="subject">switching costs</field><field name="subject">changing bank</field><field name="subject">market competition</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350300 Banking, Finance and Investment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1108</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigations of dothistromin gene expression in Dothistroma septosporum and the putative role of dothistromin toxin : a thesis presented in the partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Molecular Biology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand.</field><field name="creator">Schwelm, Arne</field><field name="description">Content removed from thesis due to copyright restrictions: Schwelm, A., Barron, N.

The tool is intended to create an informative hub that influences a travellers experience of a location. Ethnographic research as reflective sketching was conducted in the Tongariro National Park. Within this setting reflective sketching located the kitchen and common area of traveller specific accommodation as an ideal collaborative environment to conduct participatory design research. In this collaborative environment snowboarders and skiers who are aged between 20-30 years are identified as the target audience. This specific audience participated in co-creative sessions throughout the design process, resulting in the participatory design of the tool. The design aim of the visual communication tool was to promote the exchange of experience between snowboarders and skiers about a specific location. This was achieved by adapting generative tools made up of a visual language which supported the word of mouth exchange and individual expression. The exchange of experiences was facilitated by co-creative sketching with the visual language during a state of play. Playful co-creative sketching supported word of mouth dialogue between the snowboarders and skiers in a way that co-created an informative visual representation of the dialogue or contextmap. The resulting contextmap represented an image for experience which was beyond an individuals conception and made individuals tacit-knowledge accessible to audiences within and outside the moment of exchange, creating an informative hub which influenced the specific audiences view of experience for a location. An action research methodology is used during the course of this research, informed by the approaches of co-creation, context-mapping and generative tools. These approaches constructed a theoretical framework for the participatory development and co-creative sketching of the communication tool. This supportive thesis discusses the context, the theoretical concepts and provides an in depth account on the research through design process; the week-by-week participatory process undertaken to develop the visual communication tool.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Communication design</field><field name="subject">Co-creation</field><field name="subject">Visual communication</field><field name="subject">Snowboarding</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410300 Cinema, Electronic Arts and Media Studies::410306 Communications and media studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1340</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Behaviour of milk protein-stabilized oil-in-water emulsions in simulated physiological fluids : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Food Technology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Sarkar, Anwesha</field><field name="description">Emulsions form a major part of processed food formulations, either being the end products in themselves or as parts of a more complex food system. For the past few decades, colloid scientists have focussed mainly on the effects of processing conditions (e.g. heat, high pressure, and shear) on the physicochemical properties of emulsions (e.g. viscosity, droplet size distribution and phase stability). However, the information about the behaviour of food structures post consumption is very limited. Fundamental knowledge of how the food structures behave in the mouth is critical, as these oral interactions of food components influence the common sensorial perceptions (e.g. creaminess, smoothness) and the release of fat-soluble flavours. Initial studies also suggest that the breakdown of emulsions in the gastrointestinal tract and the generated interfacial structures impact lipid digestion, which can consequently influence post-prandial metabolic responses. This area of research needs to be intensively investigated before the knowledge can be applied to rational design of healthier food structures that could modulate the rate of lipid metabolism, bioavailability of nutrients, and also help in providing targeted delivery of flavour molecules and/or bioactive components. Hence, the objective of this research was to gain understanding of how emulsions behave during their passage through the gastrointestinal tract. In vitro digestion models that mimic the physicochemical processes and biological conditions in the mouth and gastrointestinal tract were successfully employed. Behaviour of model protein-stabilized emulsions (both positively charged (lactoferrin) as well as negatively charged [&#946;-lactoglobulin (&#946;-lg)] oil-in-water emulsions) at each step of simulated physiological processing (using model oral, gastric and duodenal fluids individually) were investigated. In simulated mouth conditions, oil-in-water emulsions stabilized by lactoferrin or &#946;-lg at the interfacial layers were mixed with artificial saliva at neutral pH that contained a range of mucin concentrations and salts. The &#946;-lg emulsions did not interact with the artificial saliva due to the dominant repulsion between mutually opposite charges of anionic mucin and anionic &#946;-lg interfacial layer at neutral pH. However, &#946;-lg emulsions underwent some depletion flocculation on addition of higher concentrations of mucin due to the presence of unadsorbed mucin molecules in the continuous phase. In contrast, positively charged lactoferrin emulsions showed considerable salt-induced aggregation in the presence of salts (from the saliva) alone. Furthermore, lactoferrin emulsions underwent bridging flocculation because of electrostatic binding of anionic mucin to the positively charged lactoferrin-stabilized emulsion droplets. In acidic pH conditions (pH 1.2) of the simulated gastric fluid (SGF), both protein-stabilized emulsions were positively charged. Addition of pepsin resulted in extensive droplet flocculation in both emulsions with a greater extent of droplet instability in lactoferrin emulsions. Coalescence of the droplets was observed as a result of peptic hydrolysis of the interfacial protein layers. Conditions such as ionic strength, pH and exposure to mucin were shown to significantly influence the rate of hydrolysis of &#946;-lg-stabilized emulsion by pepsin. Addition of simulated intestinal fluid (SIF) containing physiological concentrations of bile salts to the emulsions showed competitive interfacial displacement of &#946;-lg by bile salts. In the case of lactoferrin-stabilized emulsion droplets, there was considerable aggregation in the presence of intestinal electrolytes alone (without added bile salts) at pH 7.5. Binding of anionic bile salts to cationic interfacial lactoferrin layer resulted in re-stabilization of salt-aggregated lactoferrin emulsions. On mixing with physiological concentrations of pancreatin (mixture of pancreatic lipase, amylase and protease), significant degree of coalescence and fatty acid release occurred for both the emulsions. This was attributed to the interfacial proteolysis by trypsin (proteolytic fractions of pancreatin) resulting in interfacial film rupturing. Exchange of initial interfacial materials by bile salts and trypsin-induced film breakage enhanced the potential for lipolytic fractions of pancreatin to act on the hydrophobic lipid core. The lipid digestion products (free fatty acids and mono and/or diglycerides) generated at the droplet surface further removed the residual intact protein layers from the interface by competitive displacement mechanisms. The sequential treatment of the cationic and anionic emulsions with artificial saliva, SGF and SIF, respectively, was determined to understand the impact of initial protein type during complete physiological processing from mouth to intestine. Broadly, both the protein-stabilized emulsions underwent charge reversals, extensive droplet flocculation, and significant coalescence as they passed through various stages of the in vitro digestion conditions. Except in the simulated mouth environment, the initial charge of the emulsifiers had relatively limited influence on droplet behaviour during the simulated digestion. The results contribute to the knowledge of how structure and charge of the emulsified lipid droplets impact digestion at various stages of physiology. This information might have important consequences for developing suitable microstructures that allow controlled breakdown of droplets in the mouth and predictable release of lipids in the gastrointestinal tract.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Milk protein</field><field name="subject">Emulsions</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290103 Food processing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1409</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adaptation of colour perception through dynamic ICC profile modification : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Computer Science at Massey University, Albany (Auckland), New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Kloss, Guy Kristoffer</field><field name="description">Digital colour cameras are dramatically falling in price, making them a ordable for ubiquitous appliances in many applications. Change in colour perception with changing light conditions induce errors that may escape a user's awareness. Colour constancy algorithms are based on inferring light properties (usually the white point) to correct colour. Other attempts using more data for colour correction   such as (ICC based) colour management   characterise a capturing device under given conditions through an input device pro le. This pro le can be applied to correct for deviating colour perception. But this pro le is only valid for the speci c conditions at the time of the characterisation, but fails with changes in light. This research presents a solution to the problem of long time observations with changes in the scene's illumination for common natural (overcast or clear, blue sky) and arti cial sources (incandescent or  uorescent lamps). Colour measurements for colour based reasoning need to be represented in a robustly de ned way. One such suitable and well de ned description is given by the CIE LAB colour space, a device-independent, visually linearised colour description. Colour transformations using ICC pro le are also based on CIE colour descriptions. Therefore, also the corrective colour processing has been based on ICC based colour management. To verify the viability of CIE LAB based corrective colour processing colour constancy algorithms (White Patch Retinex and Grey World Assumption) have been modi ed to operate on L a b  colour tuples. Results were compared visually and numerically (using colour indexing) against those using the same algorithms operating on RGB colour tuples. We can take advantage of the fact that we are dealing with image streams over time, adding another dimension usable for analysis. A solution to the problem of slowly changing light conditions in scenes with a static camera perspective is presented. It takes advantage of the small (frame-to-frame) changes in appearance of colour within the scene over time. Reoccurring objects or (background) areas of the scene are tracked to gather data points for an analysis. As a result, a suitable colour space distortion model has been devised through a  rst order Taylor approximation (a ne transformation). By performing a multidimensional linear regression analysis on the tracked data points, parameterisations for the a ne transformations were derived. Finally, the device pro le is updated by amalgamating the corrections from the model into the ICC pro le for a single, comprehensive transformation. Following applications of the ICC based colour pro les are very fast and can be used in real-time with the camera's capturing frame rate (for current normal web cameras and low spec desktop computers). As light conditions usually change on a much slower time scale than the capturing rate of a camera, the computationally expensive pro le adaptation generally showed to be usable for many frames. The goal was to set out and  nd a solution for consistent colour capturing using digital cameras, which is capable of coping with changing light conditions. Theoretical backgrounds and strategies for such a system have been devised and implemented successfully.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer colour image processing</field><field name="subject">Colour perception</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280200 Artificial Intelligence and Signal and Image Processing::280208 Computer vision</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1683</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Memories are made of this : exploring argumentation in popular texts : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Psychology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Howard, Christina Mary</field><field name="description">The role of discourse in the construction of institutional and academic knowledge is now recognised within a wide variety of theoretical perspectives, including social constructionism, the sociology of scientific knowledge, the rhetoric of inquiry and discursive psychology. The purpose of this study was to examine the ways in which such discursive knowledge construction practices occur in relation to psychological phenomena. The site of this investigation was the highly contentious debate surrounding the reality of repressed/recovered memories of childhood sexual abuse. Ten 'popular' psychology texts (five supporting the concept of recovered memories and five questioning it) were discursively and rhetorically analysed in order to gain an understanding of how the authors of these texts deployed arguments to support their own positions and undermine those of their opponents. Five broad rhetorical resources were identified as being prominent in the texts, each of which was examined in detail to determine more specifically the source of their persuasive power. The five resources included authorial credibility, definitions, science, history and personal experience. Despite the meta-rhetoric surrounding the debate, which suggests that it is essentially an argument between researchers (drawing on scientific evidence) and clinicians (drawing on clinical experience), what was apparent was that all of these resources were utilised to varying degrees to support both pro- and anti- recovered memory positions. This analysis suggested that a reasonably structured set of discursive resources were available for making arguments about the nature of psychological phenomena. Furthermore, when given the opportunity, rhetors utilised as many of these resources as possible in order to produce a convincing argument, even when this resulted in inconsistencies within their texts. It was concluded that in the memory debate, the demands of the rhetorical imperative (to persuade the audience) often appear to be paramount, and should not be discounted by those seeking to understand this difficult and often distressing topic.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Repressed memory</field><field name="subject">False memory</field><field name="subject">Psychology texts</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380102 Learning, memory, cognition and language</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1729</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Steady size distributions in cell populations : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor Philosophy in Mathematics at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Hall, Alistair John</field><field name="description">In any population of cells, individual cells grow for some period of time and then divide into two or more parts, called daughters. To describe this process mathematically, we need to specify functions describing the growth rate, size at division, and proportions into which each cell divides. In this thesis, it is assumed that the growth rate of a cell can be determined precisely from its size, but that both its size at division and the proportions into which it divides may be described stochastically, by probability density functions whose parameters are dependent on cell size and age (or birth-size). Special cases are also considered where all cells with the same birth-size divide at the same size, or where all cells divide exactly in half. We consider a population of cells growing and dividing steadily, such that the total cell population is increasing, but the proportion of cells in any size class remains constant. In Chapter 1, equations are derived which need to be solved in order to deduce the shape of the steady size distribution (or steady size/age or size/birth-size distributions) from any given growth rate and probability distributions describing the division rate and division proportions. In the general case, a Fredholm-type integral equation is obtained, but if the probability of cell division depends on cell size only (i.e. not age or birth-size), and all cells divide into equal-sized daughters, then we obtain a functional differential equation. In two special cases, the resulting equations simplify considerably, and it is these cases which are explored further in this thesis. The first is where the probability of a cell dividing in any instant of time is a constant, independent of cell age or size. In Chapter 2, the functional differential equation resulting when cells divide into equal-sized daughters is solved for the special case where the growth rate is constant, and in an appendix the case where the growth rate is described by a power law is dealt with. The second case which simplifies is where the time-independent part of the growth rate of a cell is proportional to cell size. This case is particularly important, as it is a good first-order approximation to the real cell growth rate in some structured tissues, and in some bacteria. The special case in which this leads to a functional differential equation is discussed in Chapter 3, and the integral equation arising in the general case is dealt with in Chapter 4. Finally, the conditions under which the integral operator in Chapter 4 will be both square-integrable and non-factorable are discussed in Chapter 5. It is shown that if these conditions are satisfied then a unique, stable, steady size distribution will exist.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cell growth</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::239900 Other Mathematical Sciences::239901 Biological Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1730</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Crown development and related changes in morphology and physiology of asparagus plants associated with their productivity : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Plant Science, Institute of Natural Resources, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Daningsih, Entin</field><field name="description">The results are presented of eight experiments designed to investigate the influence of interrelationships between bud population dynamics and carbohydrate supply from root stores on spear production in asparagus (Asparagus officinalis L). These investigations involved studies in the field and the greenhouse, and using aeroponics and hydroponics techniques to facilitate non-destructive studies of plant development. The evidence indicated that spear yield was limited by the number of buds of adequate size for developing into marketable spears, rather than total bud number. It was shown that bud development continues throughout the harvest period. About 14% of these buds contributed to fern production after harvest, but the majority were involved, following a period of dormancy, in development of the next season's spears. Approximately 16% of the new buds contributed to spear yield in the current harvest, 68% were dormant until the following summer and contributed to 18% of total buds at that time. Spear production was most efficient in plants with large crowns, since the effects of correlative inhibition on spear development were greater in small than large crowns. Nevertheless, increase in crown size in terms of root mass is not necessarily accompanied by an equivalent increase in bud number or cluster number, and bud availability is potentially an important yield limiting factor. However, large crowns reduced the period of correlative inhibition within a bud cluster. Crown size and bud population were sensitive to nutrient supply, and it is suggested that control of nutrient supply over the harvest period may be best achieved by use of slow-release fertilizer or split application of nitrogen. Carbohydrate partitioning and possibly photosynthetic rate were also sensitive to daylength, and there was some evidence of genotypic variation in the response to daylength changes and contrasts. Principal component analysis indicated that numbers of buds and bud clusters, plant size and chlorophyll content were the main determinants of spear yield, and cluster analysis demonstrated potentially important genetic variation for these variables in potentially high yielding cultivars. Spear yield is the product of harvest intensity and harvest duration, and harvest duration itself was shown to be sensitive to genotype and management effects on bud initiation and development. A conceptual model is used to illustrate the influence of bud population and bud cluster characteristics on harvest intensity and duration, and on spear yield, and the relative importance of management manipulation of bud dynamics and carbohydrate supply to spear yield.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Asparagus growth</field><field name="subject">Plant physiology</field><field name="subject">Plant morphology</field><field name="subject">Productivity</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany::270402 Plant physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1731</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring the match between people and their guide dogs : a thesis presented in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Veterinary Science at Massey University, Turitea, Aotearoa/New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Lloyd, Janice Kathryn Foyer</field><field name="description">Practical aid to understanding vision impairment on page xxvii unable to be scanned.

SCM presents a business philosophy of improving the long-term performance of individual companies and the supply chain (SC) as a whole and, as a result, attains or sustains a company's competitive position. The practical implementation of SCM has a number of constraints. The basic problems facing SCM are difficulties in adopting a SCM philosophy, the lack of general theory, difficulties of system thinking, and the unique characteristics of agribusiness SCs. Contemporary SCM theory is mainly descriptive and modern SCM research is predominately deductive. Research on SC performance measurement systems (PMSs) has not provided co-ordinated measurement of the bi-directional system flows (material, financial and informational). Available systems do not provide quantifiable measures for the network optimisation decision-making process. In this study an alternative approach to SCM problem resolution was developed. The three SC flows were integrated through the evaluation of their normalised performance measurements (NPMs). The NPM system was developed based on the primary concept that the performance of each SC flow within a SC may be uniformly measured using comparable sets of characteristics. This primary concept was then used as a basis to evaluate higher levels of system performance such as two-party contractual performance and then the performance of the total SC. Special attention was paid to the strategic level of SC analysis and optimisation. The suggested methodology was used to demonstrate how performance improvement of the SC as a whole is interrelated to the performance improvement of individual companies. Case evaluation of the proposed methodology allowed identification of the supply chain wave effect. This effect quantifies how the performance of one chain member affects the performance levels of other system participants. The application of game theory to the methodology indicated that a stable optimum SC strategy might be reached when business performances are balanced along the chain. The case study suggested that chain participants tend to move toward a stable optimum strategy over time. This research may be used as a prescriptive tool for a range of agri-food chain studies. Extended case evaluation is required to test the robustness of the suggested methods.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Supply chain management</field><field name="subject">Agricultural industries</field><field name="subject">Business logistics</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1733</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nutritional studies on Lotus corniculatus containing condensed tannins to increase reproductive rate and lamb growth under commercial dryland farming conditions : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Animal Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ram&#237;rez-Restrepo, Carlos Alberto</field><field name="description">Five rotational grazing experiments were carried out at Massey University's Riverside farm, in the Wairarapa, on the East Coast of the Southern North Island, New Zealand, to compare the effects of feeding Lotus corniculatus L. (birdsfoot trefoil; cv. Grasslands Goldie) or perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne)/white clover (Trifolium repens) dominant pasture upon sheep year round productivity. These studies also investigated under grazing, seasonal and annual net herbage accumulation rate and seasonal dynamics of undisturbed (i.e. non-grazed) net herbage accumulation rate of L. corniculatus relative to that of grass-dominant pasture. Aspects of in vivo digestibility of dry matter (DMD), organic matter (OMD), digestible organic matter in the dry matter (DOMD) and metabolisable energy (ME) concentration of L. corniculatus at different stages of maturity over the spring, summer and autumn were investigated in three indoor digestion trials. 1. Two field experiments (Chapter 2) were conducted during spring to assess the effects of grazing mixed age undrenched ewes on L. corniculatus (n = 50) or pasture (n = 50) and their lambs (mainly twins) on live weight (LW), wool production, faecal nematode egg count (FEC) and dag score. In Experiment 1 (18 October 2000 to 21 January 2001) and Experiment 2 (3 October 2001 to 2 January 2002) both forages were fed ad libitum. Total condensed tannin (CT) concentration in the diet selected was 24 to 27 g CT/kg DM for L. corniculatus and 1.4 to 1.5 g CT/kg DM for pasture. The LW gain, weaning LW and wool production were consistently greater (P &lt; 0.001) for lambs grazing L. corniculatus, in either Experiment 1 (258 vs. 189 g/day; 36.1 vs. 30.1kg; 1.17 vs. 0.98 kg) and in Experiment 2 (247 vs. 162 g/day; 31.8 vs. 24.1kg; 1.17 vs. 0.81 kg), respectively. Ewe and lamb dag scores were strongly and positively correlated with dag weight (P &lt; 0.001) and generally increased with time in sheep grazing pasture, whilst grazing on L. corniculatus consistently reduced dag score. FEC in ewes grazing pasture showed a post-parturient rise (PPR) following lambing, whilst ewes grazing L. corniculatus had a reduced PPR in FEC. Up to day 70, FEC in lambs grazing L. corniculatus was lower than that for lambs grazing pasture, but between day 70 and the end of both experiments (approximately day 90), FEC in lambs grazing L. corniculatus increased to similar values as for pasture-fed lambs. FEC was not correlated with dag score or dag weight in ewes or lambs grazing pasture, but these indices were weakly and positively correlated in ewes and lambs grazing L. corniculatus, suggesting that lowering FEC on L. corniculatus also reduced dag formation. It was concluded that under dryland farming conditions, the use of L. corniculatus during the spring/early summer lactation period can increase lamb LW and wool production, whilst eliminating the need for pre-lambing anthelmintic drenching and probably reducing the amount of insecticide needed to control flystrike. These effects compared to pasture are probably due to higher digestibilty, higher ME concentration, higher voluntary feed intake (VFI), and to the effect of CT in reducing rumen protein degradability and controlling internal parasites in sheep grazing L. corniculatus. The absence of endophyte in L. corniculatus may have also have contributed to these effects. 2. During 2001 and 2002 (Chapter 3), grazing trials from February to November were conducted for 279 days (Experiments 1) and 285 days (Experiment 2), to compare the effects of grazing shorn mixed age Romney ewes in light condition on L. corniculatus versus pasture during the mating period (9 weeks, Experiment 1) and 11 weeks (Experiment 2). In Experiment 2, the length of time (days) that ewes need to graze L. corniculatus before mating to maximise reproductive performance was also investigated. Common objectives in both Experiments were to measure forage feeding effects on ewe wool production and LW of their lambs at weaning. In Experiment 1, groups of ewes (n = 100) were fed on either L. corniculatus or pasture at a herbage allowance of 1.8 kg green DM/ewe/day for the first three weeks of feeding and increased to ad libitum (2.3 kg green DM/ewe/day) during the mating period for two cycles. In Experiment 2, groups of 75 ewes grazed L. corniculatus for 42, 21, 10 and 0 days before a synchronised oestrus, with pasture being grazed for the balance of the 42 days. All L. corniculatus groups continued grazing L. corniculatus for a further 5 weeks. Feed allowance was initially 2.0 kg green DM/ewe/day, increased to 2.3 kg green DM/ewe/day during the mating period over the two cycles. At the end of L. corniculatus feeding in both experiments the groups were combined and grazed on pasture until weaning. Total CT concentration in the diet selected was 18 to 29 g CT/kg DM for L. corniculatus, with only trace amounts in pasture. In Experiment 1 mating ewes on L. corniculatus compared to pasture increased number of lambs born and lambs weaned per ewe lambing by 16 and 32% units respectively (P &lt; 0.05), due to more multiple and less single births (P = 0.06) and to reduced lamb mortality (P &lt; 0.05) between birth and weaning. In Experiment 2, increasing the numbers of days of grazing L. corniculatus before ovulation (0, 10, 21, 42 days) linearly increased ovulation rate (P &lt; 0.05), lambs born and lamb weaned by up to 16% units, but had no effect upon lamb mortality. Mating ewes on L. corniculatus increased wool production (P &lt; 0.01) and fibre length (P &lt; 0.05) in Experiment 1 but not in Experiment 2. Grazing L. corniculatus had no effect on lamb birth weight and only small positive effects on weaning LW. It was concluded that, under commercial dryland farming conditions, the use of L. corniculatus during the mating season in late summer/autumn can be used to increase reproductive efficiency and wool production, with the largest responses in years with exceptionally dry autumn periods. These effects are probably due to the higher digestibility and ME concentration of L. corniculatus than pasture and to the CT in L. corniculatus reducing rumen protein degradability and leading to greater essential amino acid (EAA) absorption from the small intestine. Effects of forage CT upon the uterine microenvironment at the time of conception, implantation and early foetal growth, need to be investigated in future studies. It is also suggested that effects of mating on L. corniculatus upon lamb mortality between birth and weaning should be further investigated with ewe numbers/treatment increased from 100 to 350. 3. During the summer of 2002/2003, another grazing trial (Chapter 4: 95 days) compared the effects of grazing L. corniculatus and pasture on LW and the dynamics of nematode parasite infection in Suffolk x Romney weaned lambs fed ad libitum. Half of the lambs (n = 30) grazing either L. corniculatus or pasture received oral anthelmintic at the start and at monthly intervals (regular-drenched groups), whilst the remaining 30 lambs in each treatment only received oral anthelmintic when mean faecal nematode egg counts (FECs) exceed 1,000 eggs/g wet faeces (trigger-drenched groups), which occurred on day 58 only for both groups. Trigger and regular-drench lambs grazed separate areas. Total CT concentration in the diet selected was 40 to 31 g CT/kg DM for L. corniculatus, with only trace amounts in pasture. Regular-drenched lambs grazing L. corniculatus had significantly higher LW gain (298 g/day) and carcass weight gain (133 g/day) than all the other groups, whilst trigger-drenched lambs grazing L. corniculatus had significantly greater LW gain (228 g/day) and carcass gain (99 g/day) than regular-drenched (200; 66 g/day) and trigger-drenched (187; 63 g/day) lambs grazing pasture. Carcass fatness was significantly lower for trigger-drenched lambs than for regular-drenched lambs, when fed either L. corniculatus or pasture. Dag score was consistently lower for regular-drenched lambs grazing L. corniculatus than pasture; trigger-drenched lambs showed similar effects up to day 48, with no differences between the two groups thereafter. Regular anthelmintic treatment maintained FECs at low values, while parasitised lambs on L. corniculatus tended to have higher FECs than pasture-fed lambs. Relative to trigger-drenched lambs that grazed pasture, grazing trigger-drenched lambs on L. corniculatus had significantly reduced worm burdens of Haemochus contortus, Teladosargia spp., Nematodirus spp. and Cooperia spp. at slaughter, but greater burdens of Trichostrongylus spp., Chabertia ovina, Oesophagostonum spp. and Trichuris ovis were present in L. corniculatus-fed lambs. It was concluded that grazing L. corniculatus under dryland farming conditions compared to pasture can increase LW gain of weaned lambs, whilst reducing reliance on anthelmintic drenches to control parasites. These effects are probably due to increased protein supply from the action of CT enabling the lambs to have a higher LW gain when carrying a parasite burden, and to L. corniculatus better maintaining its high ME value under drought conditions. Using L. corniculatus to finish weaned lambs without anthelmintic drenches for a seven-week period is proposed. 4. A three-year study (Chapter 5; November 2000 to October 2003) was conducted to compare, under grazing conditions, seasonal and annual grazed net herbage accumulation rate and seasonal dynamics of undisturbed (i.e. non-grazed) net herbage accumulation rate of L. corniculatus relative to grass-dominant pasture. Prediction equations to estimate standing DM in L. corniculatus and pasture from the rising plate meter (RPM) and sward surface height were also generated. L. corniculatus and pasture growing in a moderate fertility and low-pH soil (pH 5.35) accumulated similar total herbage masses (24.3 vs. 24.1 t DM/ha) over the 3-year period, with the DM production being greater for L. corniculatus than for pasture during 2000-2001, producing more DM during summer/autumn drought conditions. The net herbage accumulation rate from undisturbed areas of L. corniculatus and pasture were similar in spring, summer and autumn. Seasonal variation in the calibration regressions fitted to estimate herbage mass of L. corniculatus non-destructively, suggested a combination of destructive and nondestructive methods are needed to assess herbage mass. It was concluded that L. corniculatus has the potential to increase the performance of a pasture-based sheep dryland farming system due to its ability to grow in acidic soils, its tolerance of drought conditions during summer/autumn and its seasonality of feed supply. 5. Three digestion experiments involving cryptorchid weaned lambs were conducted for 14 days over the spring, summer and autumn to determine changes in in vivo digestibility of DM, OM, digestible OM in the DM and ME concentration of L. corniculatus at different stages of maturity. In vivo digestibility samples were then used as standards to investigate if the enzymatic in vitro system of Roughan and Holland (1977) could predict OMD and DOMD of CT-containing L. corniculatus. Digestibility of L. corniculatus declined as it matured, but the rate of decline was much less than occurs for temperate grasses and for white clover. It was concluded that the in vitro enzymatic system of Roughan and Holland (1977) can be used to predict OMD and DOMD of L. corniculatus, provided a standard curve involving in vivo data generated with L. corniculatus is used. Using a standard curve with in vivo data from pasture led to bias which increased at lower OMD values. Reasons for the consistent differences between L. corniculatus and pasture standard curves are discussed, including possible effects of residual bound CT in lowering in vitro digestibility. From this series of experiments, this study is the first to report that relative to conventional perennial ryegrass/white clover, mating ewes on L. corniculatus under grazing conditions may reduce post-natal lamb mortality. It is also the first study to show that grazing sheep on L. corniculatus can maintain productivity during spring and summer with reduced dependence on anthelmintic drench input. It is concluded that whole farm modelling, mechanical harvesting and conservation strategies, selection of L. corniculatus germplasm for creeping-type plants more suited to grazing and the integration of new crops containing secondary compounds, such as chicory, should be considered to support major advances in sustainable dryland sheep farming systems.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lotus corniculatus</field><field name="subject">Sheep</field><field name="subject">Lambs</field><field name="subject">Feeding and feeds</field><field name="subject">Feed utilization efficiency</field><field name="subject">Reproduction</field><field name="subject">Growth</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300400 Animal Production::300403 Animal nutrition</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1734</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Simulation of cow-calf systems in the Salado Region of Argentina : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Animal Science, Institute of Veterinary, Animal and Biomedical Sciences, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Romera, Alvaro Jorge</field><field name="description">The Salado region of Argentina covers 9.5 million ha, is located in the centre-East of the Buenos Aires Province, and concentrates about 6.9 million cattle. Cow-calf systems are predominant in the area. A simulation model was developed with the purpose of assisting in the design and evaluation of cow-calf systems in the Salado Region. The model was designed to produce long term simulations of the dynamic interactions between herd structure, climatic variation and farm management over periods of several decades using daily weather data, real or simulated. Existing models were used to describe soil, pasture and animal components of the farm, linked with management actions in a dynamic framework. The model was driven by decision rules entered by the user, which allowed the representation of management options that respond to changing farm conditions according to a predetermined policy. An object-oriented approach (OOA) was used in the design and implementation of the model. In the OOA, objects in the real world (e.g. cows, paddocks) are represented as objects in the computer program. The simulation of individual cows and individual paddocks made it possible to distribute feed resources flexibly among animals and provided many other points of flexibility in management strategies. The management strategies simulated in trying to improve cow-calf systems in the Salado region were based on Reserva 6, an experimental cow-calf farm located at the INTA-Balcarce Experimental Station. Every spring-summer, 30% of the area is devoted to make low quality hay (by cutting at high herbage mass), most of which is destined to provide maintenance feed for pregnant adult cows in winter. Cows are kept on a small paddock from weaning (March) to calving (August-September), during which time they receive 6-9kg DM of hay per day. A set of decision rules was developed to represent (on a 100ha farm) the management applied in Reserva 6 and, using this as a base system, a series of simulation experiments was conducted. Firstly, three preliminary experiments, aimed at gaining insight into the system and testing the model, were carried out. In the first of these, the effect of delaying the breeding season 15 and 30 days was analysed. The model was run over 30 consecutive years using a real weather sequence, 1970-2000, from INTA-Balcarce, for each scenario. It was found that, when the appropriate management variables (i.e. weaning and sale dates) were adjusted accordingly, changing the calving period had little effect on the productivity of a cow-calf system. In the second experiment, the dynamic consequences of three different heifer replacement policies on the production outcomes of the system were explored. The policies produced different patterns of oscillations in key farm outputs as a result of periodic behaviour in the age structure of the herd, and the differences between strategies were shown to be dependent on the environmental variability being simulated. The third experiment analysed different policies for hay use during the autumn-winter period, including a control strategy in which no hay was harvested or used. The results suggested that, provided hay was utilized on the farm, the pattern of use did not make much difference to liveweight production. Secondly, the long term performance, in terms of annual liveweight sold, of a range of hay quantity-quality combinations was compared. Each policy was simulated across a range of cow numbers (170 to 350, cows plus heifers in a 100ha farm) and was replicated 20 times. Each replication consisted of 50 years of random weather sampled from the real sequence (1970-2000). The benefit of using hay and the contrasts between the effects of different haymaking strategies on animal outputs increased as the cow numbers increased. The long term analysis suggested that the liveweight production of cow-calf farms, under a calendar-based haymaking policy like that followed in Reserva 6, would be maximized by harvesting 40-50% (but not more) of the total farm area and aiming to harvest hay at medium herbage mass (therefore medium quality). Therefore, the policy currently followed in Reserva 6 of allocating 30% of the farm to haymaking could be considered as conservative, and its productivity might be increased by making hay at lower herbage mass. Thirdly, the possible advantages of incorporating flexibility into the haymaking policy used in Reserva 6 were evaluated using the same experimental design. The results indicated that controlling haymaking in a flexible fashion, basing the decisions of closing, releasing and cutting paddocks on a simple pasture budget, would give the system productive advantages (i.e. increases in productivity and reductions in variability) in relation to a calendar-based approach. Using a flexible haymaking policy allows the manager to make more hay than required for the next winter, providing a buffer for the system. A flexible haymaking policy permitted significantly greater levels of herbage utilization by making large amounts of hay without negative effects on the carrying capacity of the system. A preliminary analysis of risk and costs highlighted major advantages in using hay in cow-calf systems, especially when a flexible approach to haymaking is implemented.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cow-calf system</field><field name="subject">Beef cattle</field><field name="subject">Hay</field><field name="subject">Buenos Aires</field><field name="subject">Argentina</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300400 Animal Production::300404 Animal husbandry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1736</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The pilot implementation of inclusive education in Malaysia : a review : a thesis presented in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in education at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Bosi, Winny</field><field name="description">Inclusive education was introduced into the Malaysian school system as a pilot scheme in 1994, involving a small number of elementary schools throughout the country. This study examines teachers' and principals' conceptions of inclusive education, their understanding of the Inclusive Education Policy and their attitudes towards the pilot implementation of inclusive education. Using individual interviews and surveys, the researcher explored the views of regular and special education teachers from pilot and non-pilot elementary schools. A total of 36 special and regular classroom teachers and six principals from six geographically representative pilot schools and 18 traditional classroom teachers from six matching non-pilot schools participated in this study. Data examination showed that differences existed in the teachers' conceptions of inclusive education. Seven hierarchically ordered conceptions of inclusive education were identified. They ranged from the provision of educational opportunities in the traditional classroom for all students regardless of disability to the provision of enrichment for students with special abilities. Teachers were found to have limited understanding of the educational policies related to inclusive education. Many principals and teachers, nevertheless, favoured inclusive education but the teachers were concerned about an increase in workload as a result of the inclusion of children with special needs in their classes. Class size was also seen as a barrier to implementing inclusive education. It was concluded that principals and teachers were concerned about the inadequate professional preparation of teachers for inclusive education and the difficulties of coping with children with special needs when placed in the traditional classroom settings. These findings have serious educational implications and support the need for comprehensive inservice training programmes that are designed to meet the needs of teachers during pre-service programmes and in in-service training. The researcher also gave some attention to the process of change as it occurred during the pilot implementation of inclusive education while her discussion of theoretical issues, related to the implementation, led to the development of an explanatory model to assist understanding of an approach to the further implementation of inclusive education in Malaysia.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Elementary schools</field><field name="subject">Educational policy</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330104 Educational policy, administration and management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1735</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The production of audit services in the New Zealand public sector : an investigation into the effects of political risk and corporate governance on audit effort : a thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in the School of Accountancy, College of Business, Massey University</field><field name="creator">Botica Redmayne, Nives</field><field name="description">This study examine the effects of political risk and corporate governance on the production of audit services in the New Zealand public sector. It represents one of several studies that are classified as recent extensions of the research in the economics of auditing. While the economics of auditing literature is extensive, most studies have focussed on audit fees as a means of explaining audit markets and audit services rather than audit production Early audit production studies, however, found that audit fees are a noisy proxy for audit production as they are used by audit firms as a strategic tool for achieving a competitive position in an audit market. This study extends the existing body of knowledge on audit production in two way Firstly, this study examines the determinants of audit effect for public sector corporate entities audits in New Zealand over a period of three year (1998-2000) Therefore, it follows the recommendation of previous audit production studies for research in audit production across auditors. additional industries, different auditing settings and time periods. Secondly, this study extends the existing body of knowledge in audit production by using two previously unused determinants of audit effort It considers the effect of political risk and corporate governance on audit production/effort. Whether political risks and political costs will affect the audit production in any setting has not been examined yet In this Study, it is expected that auditors will expend more audit effort in auditing public sector entities that have high levels of political risk. The effect of corporate governance mechanisms (such as boards of directors) on audit effort has also received very little attention in professional standard or in the academic literature. The strength of corporate governance is expected to effect the audit risk of a current or potential audit client and to influence the auditors' risk assessments and audit production/effort To test the hypotheses in this study, I use a sample of 275 entity/year observations related to public sector companies in New Zealand for the years 1998-2000. After controlling for other factors affecting audit effort, this study finds strong evidence supporting the political risk hypothesis as applied to the audit environment This finding supports evidence from the empirical financial accounting research of political risk/cost and suggests that the implications of the political cost hypothesis are more widespread than previously believed. This study also provides evidence that board effectiveness when measured by board size can have an impact on audit effort. However, there is no evidence of a consistent, relationship between other measures of board effectiveness -specifically, the presence of busy directors, the presence of the CEO on the board and the existence of an audit committee - and audit production While the evidence related to board effectiveness it mixed, this study is the first to link the corporate governance literature and the audit production research. This type of research is particularly important given that some recently enacted law and regulatory requirement (e.g.. the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in the US and new NZX listing requirement regarding audit committees in New Zealand are based on the assumption that a more rigorous audit function is needed in the post-Enron environment.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Auditing</field><field name="subject">Public finance</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350100 Accounting, Auditing and Accountability</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1737</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A kepstrum approach to real-time speech enhancement : thesis for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, Information Engineering, Institute of Technology and Engineering, Massey University at Albany</field><field name="creator">Jeong, Jinsoo</field><field name="description">Content removed due to copyright: Conference proceedings (I) J.

Lam.) : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Plant Science at Massey University, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Lewthwaite, Stephen L</field><field name="description">Sweetpotato (Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam.) is a root crop well established throughout the world's tropical and sub-tropical regions. Despite sweepotato's importance, it has been under-researched relative to many other major crops. The main objective of this thesis is to contribute to a fuller understanding of the genetic and physiological factors underlying the production of sweetpotato storage roots for human consumption. The sweetpotato genome is diverse and subject to high levels of natural somatic mutation. Applying the AFLP (amplified fragment length polymorphism) technique allowed a direct comparison of inter and intra-cultivar DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) base sequence variation. Analysis of the variation indicated that although sweetpotatoes are clonally propagated, clones show a lack of genetic fidelity to their source. Further, the level of genetic variation within the cultivar 'Owairaka Red' indicated the continuing emergence of distinct new strains. Plant field establishment represents the interaction of both propagation and growth phases of storage root production. A range of establishment techniques were investigated in a field trial under commercial conditions. Sprouts cut from seed roots and held for six days rather than immediate planting improved establishment as measured by growth, at little expense. Plug raised plants also improved establishment, while potentially reducing the degree of intra-cultivar genetic variation. Plant carbohydrate partitioning in three cultivars, 'Beauregard', 'Beniazuma' and 'Owairaka Red' was examined by field trial over the period of storage root growth. While cultivars differed in the proportions of dry matter partitioned to leaf, stem and root organs, the cultivar specific ratios of leaf to stem dry weight were relatively stable over time. Total storage root dry weight increased with time for all cultivars, but the distribution of storage root grades by size was cultivar specific. Within the storage roots % dry weight increased over time in all cultivars, but total sugar concentration only increased for 'Beauregard' and 'Beniazuma'. Finally, a storage root disorder called 'brown centre' curtails the temperate growing season so was investigated using low temperature storage and a field trial with various nutrition regimes. The disorder was found to be associated with susceptible germplasm, high soil nitrogen and harvest time.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sweet potato</field><field name="subject">Sweetpotato</field><field name="subject">Kumara</field><field name="subject">Ipomoea batatas (L.)

Each experiment involved a rotational grazing system with 300 mixed-age Romney ewes, divided into three groups of 100 ewes each. In each year, all ewes were offered low quality simulated drought pasture, containing more than 60% dead matter, at an allowance sufficient to provide a potential desired intake of 0.70 kg dry matter (DM)/day, for periods of 9 to 12 weeks, including two mating cycles. Mean pre-and post-grazing pasture masses averaged over the three years were 1100 and 600 kg DM/ha. The pasture consumed in all years was typical of pasture available to grazing livestock in a drought; it was high in neutral detergent fibre (NDF; approximately 600 g/kg DM), low in organic matter digestibility (OMD, approximately 0.52) and metabolisable energy (ME; approximately 7.5 MJ/kg DM) and contained approximately 20 g nitrogen (N)/kg DM. The supplementary poplar and willow diets were always superior to drought pasture consumed by the ewes, being higher in OMD (approximately 0.67), ME (approximately 10 MJ/kg DM) and total N (approximately 26 g/kg DM) and lower in NDF (approximately 383 g/kg DM). Tree fodder diets also contained substantial concentrations of the secondary compounds condensed tannin (CT; range 7 to 52 g/kg DM), salicin (approximately 2 g/kg DM) and other phenolic glycosides (approximately 21 g/kg DM), with willow (27 to 52 g/kg DM) containing greater concentrations of CT compared with poplar (7 to 19 g/kg DM). Mean diameter of the tree fodder stem consumed during the series of experiments was approximately 7 mm for poplar and 4 mm for willow with the diameter increasing over the experimental periods in four cases out of live (P&lt;0.05). After the supplementation period, the three groups were joined together and grazed on perennial ryegrass/white clover pasture until the conclusion of each experiment at weaning. In all years, the effect of poplar and/or willow supplementation on ewe live weight (LW) and body condition score (BCS) change; the proportion of lambs (reproductive rate) at pregnancy scanning, lambing, docking and weaning; and wool production and staple length from ewe fleeces with approximately 11 months growth, were measured. Experiment 1 was designed to determine how much poplar fodder needed to be fed to increase ewe production and reproduction over a 71-day supplementation period. The experiment involved a high supplementation group, offered 1.5 kg fresh poplar/ewe/day; a low supplementation group, offered 0.75 kg fresh poplar/ewe/day; and a control group that was offered no tree fodder. Ewes in the high and low treatments lost less LW (-67 and -71 vs. -82 g/day; P&lt;0.05) and BCS (-0.78 and -1.27 vs. -1.31 units; P&lt;0.05) compared with unsupplemented ewes. Reproductive rate was relatively low in the control group (121 lambs born/100 ewes mated), with poplar supplementation increasing ewe reproductive rate by approximately 20% units (P&lt;0.05) and 30% units (P&lt;0.001) for the low and high treatment groups, respectively, at scanning, lambing, docking and weaning. The increase in reproductive rate in supplemented ewes was due to increases in both conception rate (number of ewes pregnant/100 ewes mated) and fecundity (number of lambs born/100 ewes mated). Experiment 2 was designed to determine if production and reproduction varied between ewes fed poplar versus willow at the same rate of supplementation, 1.4 kg fresh forage/ewe/day, for 87 days. Again, reproductive rate was relatively low in the control group (133 lambs born/100 ewes mated), with willow supplementation reducing L.W loss (-86 g/day vs. -103 g/day; P&lt;0.01) and increasing reproductive rate by 15%, 17% 21% and 20% units at ultrasound scanning (P=0.097), lambing (P=0.087), docking (P&lt;0.05) and weaning (P=0.058), respectively. The increase in reproductive rate was due to an increase in fecundity; supplementation did not affect conception rate in this experiment. Unlike the previous experiment, poplar supplementation showed no effect on reproductive rate, despite the increase in DM intake and the apparent reduction in LW loss of 9 g/day (P-0.11). It is likely that severe contamination of the poplar fodder with Melampsora larici-populina, or poplar leaf rust, confounded the results. Building on the results of the first two grazing trials, the next step was to determine the period (days) of tree fodder supplementation necessary to achieve a response in reproductive rate. Experiment 3 involved ewes fed 1.3 kg fresh willow/ewe/day for a 'long' period, 63 days including 6 weeks of mating, and a 'short' period, 31 days including 3 weeks of mating. The mating period commenced on the same day for all groups and lasted for 6 weeks. Willow supplementation for 63 days reduced ewe LW loss (-96 g/day vs. -147 g/day; P&lt;0.05) and BCS (-0.79 VS. -1.09; P&lt;0.05) loss, compared with unsupplemented ewes; however, it did not increase reproductive rate at scanning and lambing. The lack of response in willow-supplemented ewes was likely to be due to toxic concentrations of zearalenone (1.5 mg/kg DM), an oestrogenic mycotoxin, in the drought pasture during mating, which confounded the results by negating any potential benefits due to increased nutrient intakes. Willow supplementation for 63 days did increase reproductive rate at weaning by 13% units, due to a 9% unit (P&lt;0.05) reduction in post-natal lamb mortality, from 17.1 to 8.4%. Supplementation for 31 days did not appear to influence ewe reproduction and production parameters. Overall, the rate of LW loss was greater in Experiment 3 compared with the first two experiments. Seven indoor in vivo digestibility experiments were conducted at the following times; early April 2001 (poplar), February, March and April 2002 (all poplar), and December, March and April 2003 (all willow). Each 14-day trial involved 6 male cryptorchid lambs, individually fed in metabolism cages. The experiments showed that the digestibility of poplar and willow tree fodder declined from late spring to autumn (P&lt;0.05), but that the decline was much smaller than the decline in digestibility of grass-based pastures in New Zealand over the same time period. The experiments also showed that mean ME and digestibilities were generally higher for willow than for poplar. The seven in vivo digestibility coefficients were then used to develop a standard curve for in vitro prediction of in vivo digestibility, this standard was used to analyse all unknown tree fodder samples from the three grazing experiments. Results from the three grazing experiments showed that supplementing ewes grazing drought pasture during mating with poplar and willow tree fodder consistently increased DM intake by 0.25 to 0.33 kg DM/ewe/day for ewes offered 1.3 to 1.5 kg fresh willow or poplar each day and increased calculated total DM intakes from 0.67 to 1.03 kg DM/ewe/day in Experiment 1, from 0.59 to 0.86 kg DM/ewe/day in Experiment 2 and from 0.47 to 0.75 kg DM/ewe/day in Experiment 3. Supplementation also consistently reduced LW loss and loss in BCS and substantially increased lambing rate through increased conception rate and fecundity and reduced post-natal lamb mortality. The effects on LW and BCS gradually declined in the post-treatment period and were no longer evident by commencement of lambing. There was no effect of supplementation on wool production or staple length in any of the experiments. One of the unexpected results of the experiments was an average 34% reduction in post-natal lamb mortality over three years, due to willow/poplar supplementation of ewes during mating. Initial results showed that despite significant increases in fecundity in supplemented ewes in 2001 and 2002, post-natal lamb mortality was not increased. This result, combined with a statistically significant reduction in lamb mortality in Experiment 3 (P&lt;0.05), in the absence of any differences in fecundity between the groups, suggested that tree fodder supplementation during mating may have reduced lamb mortality in all three years, but that the effect was masked by the increase in reproductive rate in the first two experiments. Therefore, data from the three field trials were combined and analysed by adjusting all mortality data to equal birth rank and sex; this showed a significant reduction due to supplementation (P&lt;0.05) with no treatment-year interaction. The increase in ewe production and reproduction in supplemented ewes was likely due to increases in nutrient intake, through increased DM, ME and CP intakes, prior to and during mating and to increased outputs of undegradable dietary protein and microbial protein from the rumen, per unit of crude protein consumed, thus increasing amino acid absorption. An increase in ovulation rate of 1.5 % units/MJ of digestible energy consumed (Smith 1985) should result in increases in ovulation rate due to tree fodder supplementation of only 5 and 4% units in 2001 and 2002, respectively; however, the increases in scanning rate were substantially greater at 41 and 16% units. Therefore, it is possible that the majority of the increase in reproductive rate was due to increased essential amino acid absorption, which is consistent with increases found in ewes mated on CT-containing forages such as Lotus corniculatus (Birdsfoot trefoil). Gross margin analyses using actual data from unsupplemented ewes in each of the three grazing trials compared with Riverside Farm's commercial ewes from the same years showed that drought reduced scanning rates by an average of 22.4% and wool production by 20% and that this reduction decreases sheep production income by approximately $14/ewe. Further analysis showed that almost half the cost ($6/ewe) could be recovered by supplementing ewes with tree fodder in a drought. On a whole farm basis this represents $58/hectare cost benefit due to tree fodder supplementation. Fungal contamination was a significant factor in the results obtained in Experiments 2 and 3. In all years, simulated drought pasture contained metabolites of zearalenone and the trichothecenes nivalenol and deoxy-nivalenol, produced by Fusarium fungi, while in Experiment 2 the poplar was severely contaminated with Melampsora larici-populina, or poplar leaf rust. Zearalenone concentrations in pasture were at their greatest in Experiment 3 and increased to over 2 mg/kg DM during the mating period. This may explain the lack of increase in reproductive rate expected in willow-supplemented ewes in Experiment 3, which was a feature of previous experiments; however, it did not explain the much greater loss in ewe LW in Experiment 3. Nivalenol (NIV) and deoxy-nivalenol (DON) are common trichothecene toxins found in New Zealand pasture and were found in pasture samples from all three experiments, however, the concentration in Experiment 3 was three- to four-fold greater than in previous experiments. Reports have suggested that trichothecenes may be partly responsible for the reduced growth of otherwise healthy livestock grazing dry autumn pasture, often referred to as 'ill thrift'. However, based on evidence from dosing experiments, it is unlikely that the quantities of NIV and DON present in pasture in Experiment 3 accounted for all of the greater LW loss seen in this experiment. This suggests that these toxins are likely to be indicators of other more potent fungal toxins, which have a much bigger impact on livestock health and production. It is likely that fungal toxins contribute more to reduced reproduction in breeding ewes and to ill thrift in young stock grazing dry autumn pastures in East Coast regions than is currently acknowledged</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ewes</field><field name="subject">Sheep</field><field name="subject">Nutrition</field><field name="subject">Feeding and feeds</field><field name="subject">Poplar</field><field name="subject">Willow</field><field name="subject">Populus</field><field name="subject">Salex</field><field name="subject">Reproduction</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300400 Animal Production::300403 Animal nutrition</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1741</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of a formal mentoring programme in the New Zealand police : a thesis submitted for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Psychology at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Carleton, Yvonne Julie</field><field name="description">Mentoring has been found to be an effective psychosocial buffer to occupational stress (Chao &amp; Walz, 1992; Noe, 1988; Siege1 &amp; Reinstein, 2001). Mentoring provides support for personal confirmation, acceptance, friendship and role modelling (Kram 1985, 1986) The current study was part of an initiative within the New Zealand Police to introduce mentoring as part of a supported induction for new Police Constables into the organisation. The aim was to evaluate the use of mentoring as a psychosocial support in this induction process. Using a Solomon Four Group design the 254 subjects (180 prot&#233;g&#233;(e)s and 74 mentors) were randomly assigned to four groups. These groups were (i) those who had a pre-test, assigned a mentor and post test (ii) those who had a pre-test and post test (iii) those who had a mentor and a post test (iv) those who had a post test only. Testing included two questionnaires; a Combined Measures Questionnaire &#8211; which incorporated six psychometric tests including BDI, BHS, MHI, CMTS, HSCL-21 and ITQ; and a Mentor Relationship Questionnaire. The former was administered at pre- and post- test in accordance with the experimental design while the later [i.e. latter] was only administered at the end of the mentoring programme. There was no clinically significant effect noted in terms of change in psychological well-being or distress for either prot&#233;g&#233;(e)s or mentors (p &gt; .05). There was a significant effect of mentoring in terms of an increase in intent to quit, F(1,10) = 7.43, p = .02 and a trend toward significance for decreased general distress levels F(1,10) = 4.80, p = .53 for the mentors at the end of the experimental period. These findings are tempered by a small control group (n=2). The main finding of this study was that positive outcomes were reported about the mentor relationship, on the Mentoring Relationship Questionnaire, from both prot&#233;g&#233;(e)s and mentors. These results were achieved in less than three sessions. From these findings it may be concluded that there is a place for a formal mentoring programme in the induction process of the New Zealand Police organisation.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Police induction</field><field name="subject">Psychosocial support</field><field name="subject">Mentor relationship</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380105 Social and community psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1742</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The metabolic cost of an intestinal parasite infection on amino acid kinetics in sheep fed fresh forages: a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Animal Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Bermingham, Emma Natasha</field><field name="description">There is mounting evidence that parasitic infections change nutrient utilisation within the tissues, and that this is responsible for the reduction in animal performance that has been observed. Feeding forages that contain condensed tannins (CT) are thought to alleviate the impact of parasite infection on amino acid (AA) and protein metabolism by improving protein supply post-ruminally. However, there has been no quantification of how nutrients are partitioned in the lamb fed fresh forages during a parasitic infection. Therefore, the objective of this study was to quantify the partitioning of AA between the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), liver and the hind limb tissues (muscle, skin, fat) in lambs during an established parasite infection. It was hypothesised that the feeding of CT would alter the partitioning of AA between the GIT, liver and hind limbs in lambs with an established parasite burden due to the increased availability of dietary AA to the small intestine. This hypothesis was tested in two separate experiments, which had a similar experimental design. In the first experiment (Experiment One; 1999) lambs were fed fresh Lucerne (Medicago sativa; contains no CT). In Experiment Two, which was conducted in 2000, the lambs were fed fresh Sulla (Hedysarum coronarium; 2.2% CT; Experiment Two). One week prior to infection, permanent indwelling catheters were placed in the mesenteric artery, and the mesenteric, portal and hepatic veins and vena cava for blood sampling. Additional permanent catheters were placed in the mesenteric vein (upstream from the sampling catheter) and abdominal aorta for infusion of para-aminohippuric acid (PAH) and indocyanin green (ICG) respectively, to measure plasma flow across the splanchnic tissues (PAH) and the hind limbs (ICG). A permanent Teflon cannula was fitted in the abomasum for the infusion of [1-13C]-valine and [35S]-cysteine (Chapters Five, Six and Seven only) on day 48 post infection to measure valine and cysteine kinetics across the mesenteric-drained viscera (MDV), portal-drained viscera (PDV), liver, total splanchnic tissues (TSP; PDV + liver) and hind limbs. A temporary catheter was inserted into the jugular vein two days before the start of blood sampling for the infusion of deuterium oxide (D2O), and [13C]-sodium bicarbonate and [35S]-sulfate (Chapters Five, Six and Seven only) on day 45 post infection, and [3,4-3H]-valine on day 48 post infection. Lambs were dosed with 6 000 L3 T. colubriformis larvae for 6 d (n=5) or kept as parasite free controls (n=6). Faecal egg production was monitored every second day from day 22 to day 48 post infection and total intestinal worm burdens were determined at slaughter. Blood was continuously collected from the mesenteric, portal and hepatic veins, the mesenteric artery and the vena cava in 2-hour aliquots. Plasma was harvested and AA and metabolite concentrations measured and the specific radioactivity (SRA) and isotopic enrichment (IE) of valine and cysteine were determined. After the completion of blood sampling, but while the [3, 4-3H]-valine infusate was still being administered, the sheep were euthanased by an intravenous overdose of sodium pentobarbitone. Tissue samples were rapidly collected from the sheep in the following order: skin, muscle (biceps femoris), liver, duodenum, ileum, spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes and thymus. Digesta was also sampled from the abomasum and ileum after slaughter in order for the apparent absorption of AA to be determined. The results from Experiment One (Lucerne-fed lambs) suggest that there is no re-partitioning of AA from the posterior hind limbs to the GIT and liver during an established infection- The changes that occurred within the PDV suggests that an established parasitic infection may trigger a localised alteration in AA metabolism and/or protein turnover without significantly changing the metabolism of AA and proteins in tissues peripheral to the TSP tissues and impacting negatively on the growth of the parasitised lambs. In Experiment Two (Sulla-fed lambs) a reduction in feed intake was likely to be the reason for the alterations in the first pass metabolism of AA in the TSP tissues due to the decreased apparent AA absorption by the MDV observed in the parasitised lambs. However, the results from this experiment are in agreement with those from Experiment One confirming that there is no increase in partitioning of AA from the hind limbs to the GIT or liver during an established parasite infection. Although a statistical comparison cannot be made between the data in Experiment One (Lucerne-fed) and Experiment Two (Sulla-fed), it appears that the beneficial effects of feeding CT during a parasitic infection is due to the reduction in larval establishment in the GIT of the lamb, rather than increased AA availability. In conclusion, an established infection imposes no measurable metabolic cost on the lamb, when feed intake is not reduced. When feed intake is reduced, there is no detectable mobilisation of protein from the hind limb. Therefore, localised or other sources of AA and/or energy substrates may be utilised.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sheep</field><field name="subject">Intestinal parasites</field><field name="subject">Feeding and feeds</field><field name="subject">Fresh forages</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300400 Animal Production::300405 Animal production (pests and pathogens)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1743</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Combining Farmer Decision Making With Systems Models for Restoring Multi-Functional Ecohydrological Systems in Degraded Catchments</field><field name="creator">Justin Ryan</field><field name="description">In agricultural landscapes, native ecosystems are largely replaced by non-native crop and pasture species, with the extent of modification dependent on land use history and the management practices of current farmers. The result is greater complexity in some parts of the landscape, while other areas become more simplified. Of critical importance, however, is that many landscapes become &#8216;leaky&#8217; due to the impaired feedback mechanisms between the types of vegetation present (i.e. land cover) and their ability to efficiently cycle water, sediment, nutrients and carbon between the lower atmosphere, vegetation, soil, and hydrological systems, causing landscapes to become ecohydrologically dysfunctional. In many mixed cropping-grazing landscapes of Australia, ecohydrologically dysfunctional landscapes exhibit declines in soil condition, water quality and quantity, rising salinity levels, higher wind speeds and temperatures, reduced rainfall, and a loss of biodiversity and production capacity. Ecohydrologically dysfunctional landscapes also are less resilient to climatic variations, which during extended dry periods, can result in water shortages with potentially dire socioeconomic consequences. This Thesis focuses on how landscape designs comprised of particular types and locations of land covers can improve and restore the ecohydrological functioning of mixed cropping-grazing landscapes. The specific aim of this Thesis is to show &#8216;proof of concept&#8217; for the &#8211; development of a new modelling approach which automatically calculates the effects that land cover changes at specific locations across hillslopes have on ecohydrological systems functioning, and to use this information to delineate landscape designs that enhance water retention within the landscape while minimising sediment and nutrient export to the catchment. To support this aim, the Thesis has three major objectives: 1) develop a complex adaptive systems conceptual model of ecohydrological systems functioning within landscapes; 2) develop a participatory survey method to capture the expert knowledge of farmers in terms of preferences for a given land use and changes in these preferences during seasonal variations in rainfall; and 3) demonstrate &#8216;proof of concept&#8217; that a combination of expert systems and hydrological process models can be employed to automatically delineate landscape designs which restore ecohydrological functioning within mixed cropping-grazing landscapes in sub-tropical Australia. The development of a rigorous theoretical basis of ecohydrological systems function within the landscape in terms of adaptations to environmental flux in climate and human forcings such as land cover change, was achieved by integrating the concepts of both complex adaptive systems and landscape ecology theories. The resulting framework, termed &#8216;Complex Adaptive Landscapes&#8217; (CAL), derived six core tenets which described the system dynamics of a landscape: 1) a continuum of scales; 2) open systems; 3) non-linear feedback mechanisms; 4) aggregation of components; 5) self-organisation; and 6) multiple meta-stable states. The participatory survey method resulted in the development of the &#8216;Graphical Landscape Map Survey&#8217; (GLAMS). This process applied three-dimensional representations of the landscape (i.e. Graphical Landscape Maps) in combination with Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs) to capture farmer&#8217;s expert knowledge. GLAMS generated probability estimates (P) that highlighted the importance of ecohydrological functioning to farmers and the locations and change in land use through time in both average and extended dry seasons. Achievement of the last objective resulted in the &#8216;Landscape Ecohydrological Attenuation Configuration System (LEACS). This system utilised farmer decision rules as probability estimates (P) for a given land cover within the STELLA systems software, and then revised these P estimates depending on the magnitude of runoff from a hillslope following an intense thunderstorm event as calculated by a distributed hydrological process model (MIKE SHE). The fundamental dynamics of the LECAS model was based on iterative feedback between the outputs of water at the end of the catchment and changing the spatial locations of particular land covers within the catchment over time. Together the three objectives highlighted the following major implications for natural resource and catchment management: i) the CAL framework may be used to design both sampling and monitoring strategies in natural resource and catchment management. CAL suggested that monitoring timeframes should be decadal in time-frame, and the feedback mechanisms of landscape must be accounted for if the longer-term sustainability of human-modified landscapes is to be achieved. A basis to such complexity is likely to form around aggregated components such as native vegetation patches, and these in turn, are important for self-organisation of a desirable landscape state to be maintained through increased resilience to disturbances and climatic fluxes; ii) participatory survey methods, such as GLAMS, are an excellent means to capture farmer expert knowledge in a manner that is intuitive to the farmers. The GLAMS approach accounted for any desired set of management actions put forward by a Landcare group or catchment body, differentiated between property sizes, and incorporated landscape heterogeneity in time and space. The framework helped to prioritise the level of support for a given set of NRM actions by farmers, including where activities were best placed. The approach also aided in identifying future landscape states based on a priori conditions and farmer preferences; and iii) the LEACS model demonstrated an approach capable of providing estimates of where it would be best to locate land cover changes (e.g. tree belts) to aid in the restoration of ecohydrological functioning in the landscape. A secondary outcome for simulations which tested the effects of tree belts in specific configurations was that these designs were an effective ecohydrological restoration technique that reduced water velocities and increased infiltration across steep hillslopes in the Maronghi Creek catchment, Southeast Queensland.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:131285</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influence of Occupational Structure on Economic Performance in Australia</field><field name="creator">Jerome Clayton BREDT</field><field name="description" /><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">340000 Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:135540</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors affecting milk protein concentration and composition of dairy cattle in the sub-tropical regions of northern Australia.</field><field name="creator">David Graham BARBER</field><field name="description" /><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:151571</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physiology of the PNSB Genus Rhodobacter: Volatile Fatty Acid Metabolism and Global Metabolic Regulation</field><field name="creator">Miss Jessica Welch</field><field name="description" /><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159346</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Small scale quantum algorithms</field><field name="creator">Travaglione, Benjamin Christopher</field><field name="description">It appears, in principle, that the laws of quantum mechanics allow a quantum computer to solve certain mathematical problems more rapidly than can be done using a classical computer. However, in order to build such a quantum computer, a number of technological problems need to be overcome. A stepping stone to this goal is the implementation of relatively simple quantum algorithms using current experimental techniques. The research work presented in this thesis consists of several theoretical studies exploring small scale quantum algorithms and methods of implementing them.

These unique associations rely on the exchange of specific molecular signals between nitrogen-fixing soil bacteria, collectively called rhizobia, and their host plants and, with few exceptions, result in the formation of root nodules, which provide an environment suitable for nitrogen fixation. However, nitrogen fixation is energetically expensive and nodule proliferation, in much the same manner as the proliferation of other meristems in plants, must be controlled in order to attain equilibrium between cell proliferation and differentiation. Nodule proliferation is controlled primarily and systemically by autoregulation of nodulation (AON). A gene central to this process was first isolated by map-based cloning from soybean (Glycine max) and was named G. max Nodule Autoregulation Receptor Kinase (GmNARK) in accordance with its biochemical and physiological functions. Expression patterns of GmNARK have been described by several investigators; however, these reports were based on either non-quantitative methods or a limited number of tissue types. More importantly, the expression domains of GmNARK were completely unknown. The study described in this thesis utilised techniques such as quantitative RT-PCR (QRTPCR), transcription start site mapping, promoter-reporter gene fusion, and promoter deletion, to analyse the expression levels and domains of GmNARK across a variety of tissues as well as identify the promoter elements that are responsible for the basal and tissue-specific expression of GmNARK. In addition, the promoter activity of GmNARK was also compared with that of Lotus japonicus HAR1, the GmNARK orthologue, in both homologous and heterologous transformation systems. Based on QRT-PCR, GmNARK was expressed to varying levels throughout the plant; the transcript was detected at high levels in mature leaves and roots but to a lesser extent in young leaves, shoot tips and nodules. The transcript level was not significantly affected by Bradyrhizobium japonicum during the first week following inoculation. Histochemical analysis of L. japonicus plants carrying either a 1.7 kb GmNARK promoter or 2.0 kb LjHAR1 promoter fused to a beta-glucuronidase reporter gene localised GUS activity to living cells within vascular bundles, especially phloem cells in leaves, stems, roots, and nodules. Phloem-specific expression was also detected in soybean hairy roots carrying these constructs. These results suggested that both cis- and trans-acting elements required for the transcriptional regulation of these orthologous genes are likely to be conserved. In contrast, 1.7 kb of the GmNARK promoter did not drive phloem-specific expression in Arabidopsis thaliana, indicating the absence of the trans-acting elements required for the tissue-specificity of GmNARK in this distantly related species. The comparison of 2.0 kb of promoter sequences of GmNARK, LjHAR1 and Medicago truncatula SUNN, another GmNARK orthologue, using bioinformatics and computational approaches indicated several highly conserved motifs including a putative negative regulatory region (NRR), which was previously reported to repress gene expression in non-phloem cell types. Deletion analysis of the GmNARK promoter, however, ruled out the possibility that this motif, found at -308 bp with respect to the translation start site, was truly functional and located the region controlling phloem-specific expression to DNA sequence between 908 bp and 1.7 kb upstream of the start codon. Two other candidate regions were identified by Multiple EM for Motif Elicitation (MEME). These regions, namely MEME3 and MEME4 showed strong sequence similarity to the corresponding regions of the LjHAR1 promoter. Interestingly, the MEME3 motif was also found in the MtSUNN promoter at a similar location to that of LjHAR1. Potential NRRs in the LjHAR1 and MtSUNN promoters were found in the MEME3 motifs, whereas only a variant form of a NRR in the GmNARK promoter was found in this region. Additionally, an identical semi-palindromic sequence was also observed in the MEME3 motifs of the three orthologous promoters. Based on these findings, the semi-palindromic sequence and the variant form of the NRR are proposed to be positive and negative regulatory elements for the phloem-specific expression of GmNARK, respectively. The computational approaches also identified two potential TATA elements in the GmNARK promoter. Rapid amplification of 5' cDNA ends and promoter deletion analysis have confirmed that they were functional. The two TATA elements in GmNARK promoter appeared to cooperatively direct transcription of GmNARK, but either was adequate for basal transcription. The finding that the expression of AON receptor-like kinase genes is phloem-specific has contributed to a better understanding of AON signalling pathways. The QRT-PCR study and the discovery of cis-acting regulatory regions have also provided crucial information on the transcriptional regulation of GmNARK as well as plant genes in general. Additionally, the promoters of GmNARK and LjHAR1 could potentially be used to drive phloem-specific expression in legume biotechnology research.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300203 Plant Improvement (Selection, Breeding and Genetic Engineering)</field><field name="subject">legumes</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158587</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing Healthier Banana roots with mycorrhizae and rhizobacteria</field><field name="creator">Smith, Linda Jane</field><field name="description">Fusarium wilt of banana, also known as Panama disease, is one of the most destructive diseases of banana (Musa spp.) and is regarded as one of the most significant threats to banana production not only in Australia, but worldwide. The causative agent is the soilborne fungus, Fusarium oxysporum Schlechtend.: Fr. forma specialis (f. sp.) cubense (E.F. Smith) Snyder and Hansen (Foc) for which options of control are limited, with no commercially viable means of chemical control. Micropropagated bananas are increasingly being used by the Queensland banana industry. This is because they are the best source of disease and pest-free planting material and productivity on the farm can be greatly improved with their use. However, when planting into soils heavily infested with Foc, these plants have been found to be more susceptible than conventional planting material. It is believed that microorganisms such as bacteria and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), which are not available to micropropagated plants raised in a sterile environment, may protect vegetative planting material dug from the field. Adding beneficial microorganisms to micropropagated plants in the nursery before planting in the field may provide some protection from soilborne diseases such as fusarium wilt and lead to improved performance. This research was undertaken to identify endophytic and rhizosphere inhabiting bacteria (including fluorescent Pseudomonas spp., Plant Growth Promoting Rhizobacteria (PGPR), spore-forming and chitinolytic bacteria) and fungal endophytes such as AMF that enhance plant growth and inhibit or reduce the infection of Foc in micropropagated banana plants. It is widely known that suppressive soils exist where fusarium wilt does not reach epidemic proportions. Laboratory results to date support a microbial basis for this suppressiveness. Wilt suppressive sites were located in Queensland and northern New South Wales and roots of banana plants were collected. Rhizosphere root washings and surface sterilised root segments were plated onto solid growth media to isolate both rhizosphere and endophytic bacteria. Bacterial isolates were initially evaluated using various in vitro tests including antagonism on agar, chitinolytic ability, production of fluorescent siderophores when grown on Kings B media, spore production and ability to lyse Foc mycelia using Foc as a sole carbon source. This process assisted with selection of isolates that may have the most biological control potential. Based on these tests 41 isolates were chosen for further investigation. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi were isolated from banana roots growing in disease suppressive soils and were also obtained from a culture collection at the Gatton Campus of The University of Queensland. A total of 10 pot cultures were prepared using sunflower as a host plant. Mycorrhizal fungi produced typical intraradical structures (arbuscules, vesicles, hyphae) when banana plants were inoculated with AMF. To assess the biological control potential of bacteria and AMF against Foc, a reliable small plant bioassay system was required. Attempts by various researchers to develop a reliable bioassay have been made in the past however infection of banana plants by the pathogen was inconsistent. The inconsistencies of previous work may microorganisms in the growth of micropropagated banana plants and protection of young plants from disease. However, ability to reduce disease assessed by internal rating of vascular discolouration appears to be influenced by host genotype. While reduction in disease severity and promotion of plant growth was observed in glasshouse trials, this was not observed in field trials at harvest. If plants had been assessed for differences in growth and susceptibility to disease plus nutrient uptake at the early stages of growth following transplanting into the field rather than at harvest, differences between microbial treated and untreated plants may have been determined. In the field, environmental factors such as drought influenced disease development and plant growth of inoculated plants at the race 1 field site at Terranora in NSW, which was not irrigated. Six of the bacterial isolates tested (25, 26, 2bb, 3b-1, 48 and S-5) and two soilborne isolates of Fusarium oxysporum (Calcutta-1 and K17pi) significantly reduced plant height of cv Lady finger at harvest. Six bacterial isolates (4a, 4b, 84, 8-7, 92 and S-24) and AMF isolate LJS1 had no effect on plant growth. A reduction in plant growth following application of micropropagated banana with microbial inoculants was not observed at the &#145;subtropical&#146; race 4 field testing site that was irrigated. Further research is required to understand the influence of microorganisms applied to nursery grown plants on growth under different environmental and soil conditions when transplanted. The results of this investigation illustrate how selected rhizobacterial and arbuscular mycorrhizal amendments applied to micropropagated banana as a pre-plant treatment in the nursery could be used to enhance plant growth and vigour and reduce disease caused by the fusarium wilt pathogen, thereby improving root health in young plants following transplanting. However, further trials are necessary to determine if these microbial inoculants can be practically produced and applied to commercial operations in field soil conditions to improve root health.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300303 Plant Protection (Pests, Diseases and Weeds)</field><field name="subject">620205 Tropical fruit</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158367</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chinese EFL Learners' Pragmatic Competence in Requests</field><field name="creator">Wang, Xian</field><field name="description">This study examines the development of pragmatic competence in requests in two groups of Chinese EFL learners (advanced and intermediate) in a tertiary institute in Macau, China. The learners answer a written discourse completion test that contains ten scenarios where they request common services or ask for favours. The request behaviours are examined in terms of utterance length, strategy types, formulaic expressions, and modifications (internal and external). It is found that, compared with a group of native speakers of English, the learners have not developed native-like pragmatic behaviours. Although the advanced and the intermediate learner groups reach native-like distribution in STRATEGY TYPE for the scenarios taken together, statistically significant differences from the native group are observed in several individual scenarios (particularly with the intermediate learners). In addition, the two groups of learners employ formulaic expressions sharply differently from the native group in types and according to scenario. The learners do not use internal modifiers as frequently or situation-differentially as the native group: they do not show a strong preference for bi-clausal structures and conditionals in the scenarios of substantial favour asking. The learners employ elaborated external modifications and are verbose in requests. According to Bialystok&#146;s (1993, 1994) two-dimensional model of pragmatic competence, the learners are missing analytical knowledge of the scenario-specific behaviours, and their control ability is not fully developed. This study examines adult Chinese learners of English in a foreign language environment, and extends our knowledge of the development of request behaviours in children in second language environments (Achiba, 2003; Ellis, 1992). It also relates to the research on formulae in SLA (Wray, 2000, 2002; Kecskes, 2002) by providing empirical data on formulaic expressions in learners&#146; requests. It is further argued that further examination of interlanguage pragmatics should be (a) scenario-based, and (b) formulae-based.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">751000 Communication</field><field name="subject">380201 Applied Linguistics and Educational Linguistics</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158270</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sensory processing and classroom emotional, behavioural and educational outcomes in children with autism spectrum disorder</field><field name="creator">Ashburner, Jill</field><field name="description">Many occupational therapists recommend adaptations to school tasks and classroom environments to accommodate the atypical sensory processing of students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), on the assumption that sensory processing impacts on classroom emotional, behavioural and educational outcomes.

The third aim was to explore associations between the sensory processing patterns and classroom emotional, behavioural and educational outcomes in children with ASD and typically developing children. This study employed a matched case-control design. To control for differences in teaching styles, classroom environments and educational programs, two typically developing children were selected as controls from each of the classes of thirty students with ASD aged between 6 and 10 years. Twenty-eight children with ASD and fifty-one age- and gender-matched typically developing children were included in the final analysis. The children were all included in mainstream classrooms and were screened using the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test to ensure that their estimated IQ was within the average range. Sensory processing was measured using the Short Sensory Profile. Other independent variables that may have impacted on classroom emotional, behavioural and educational outcomes included symptoms of ASD, IQ and classroom environmental factors. Symptoms of ASD were measured using the Gilliam Asperger Disorder Scale and Gilliam Autism Rating Scale. The Kaufmann Brief Intelligence Test was used as an estimate of IQ, as well as for screening purposes. The investigator recorded observations of the sensory aspects of each classroom environment, including estimates of visual clutter, crowding and background noise. The dependent variables, which included classroom emotional regulation, behaviour regulation (e.g., compliance, attention and social behaviours) and educational outcomes, were measured using two teacher questionnaires: the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment Teacher Report Form and the Conners&#146; Teacher Report Form Revised &#150; Long Form. No significant differences were found between the two groups with respect to IQ or age in months, suggesting that the two groups were well matched. Observations of the classroom environments revealed high levels of background noise, visual clutter and unpredictable tactile input. The majority of the typically developing children achieved scores at or near ceiling level on both the measures of classroom emotional and behavioural outcomes and sensory processing. This suggested that most of these children processed sensory input in a typical way and were coping well with the emotional, behavioural and academic demands of school. No significant relationships were found between the measures of sensory processing and classroom emotional, behavioural and educational outcomes in the typically developing children. The teachers rated the children with ASD as demonstrating significantly more difficulties with attention, emotional and behaviour regulation and social skills and significantly poorer academic performance than the controls. The Short Sensory Profile scores suggested a high prevalence of atypical sensory processing in the children with ASD. There were highly significant group differences on all of the Short Sensory Profile scores (p &gt; .001), with the exception of the Short Sensory Profile score: Movement Sensitivity (p = .016). Multiple regression analysis suggested that the Short Sensory Profile scores: Under-responsive/Seeks Sensation and Auditory Filtering accounted for 47% of the variance in academic performance as measured by the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment Teacher Report Form. As estimated intelligence and autistic symptoms were not predictors in this multiple regression model, these specific sensory processing difficulties appeared to contribute significantly to academic underachievement. The Short Sensory Profile Score: Auditory Filtering was also associated with inattention as measured by the Conners&#146; Teacher Report Form. An association between Short Sensory Profile Score: Auditory Filtering and social problems as measured by the Conners&#146; Teacher Report Form approached significance (p = .019). Auditory filtering difficulties therefore appeared to be highly problematic for the children with ASD and likely to be exacerbated by high levels of background noise in classrooms. Multiple regression analysis suggested that the Short Sensory Profile scores for Tactile Sensitivity and Auditory Filtering accounted for 36% of the variance in the score for Conners&#146; Teacher Report Form score for inattention. The Short Sensory Profile score for Tactile Sensitivity accounted for 22% of the variance in a Conners&#146; Teacher Report Form measure of the combined symptoms of ADHD (including inattention and hyperactivity). The Short Sensory Profile score: Movement Sensitivity accounted for 22% in the Conners&#146; Teacher Report Form score for oppositional behaviours. An association between Short Sensory Profile Score: Tactile Sensitivity and oppositional behaviours as measured by the Conners&#146; Teacher Report Form approached significance (p = .015). As atypical sensory processing was found to be associated with difficulties in learning, attention and behaviour regulation at school, sensory processing may need to be considered in the planning of educational programs for students with ASD. The development of effective strategies to accommodate the atypical sensory processing of these students is a priority.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158222</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sedimentology of the South East Bowen Basin, South East Queensland, Australia, Implications for groundwater resources in the Kalahari basin of Botswana</field><field name="creator">Lasarwe, Reneilwe</field><field name="description">Sedimentary deposits are important aquifers in many parts of the world and in order to explore, develop and manage these aquifers, it is necessary to determine the relationship between the hydrogeologic properties and sedimentary facies (aquifer characterization). Within a sedimentary hydrogeologic system, the environment of deposition and the resulting distribution of grain sizes, texture, and facies associations within different individual aquifer bodies influence variations in hydraulic properties. Successful prediction of the quality of the aquifer is dependent on the accurate mapping of both lithologic units and hydrogeologic parameters. In this project, the influence of petrophysical characteristics of the sedimentary rocks to the quality of the aquifer is investigated with a view to finding a correlation between these characteristics, the type and nature of sedimentary rocks present and their hydrogeologic properties. Investigation methods involved the use of geophysical wireline log data, lithological core logging, thin section microscopy and X-Ray Diffraction analysis. All this was done to characterize the sedimentary rocks in terms of composition, grain size and diagenesis. Porosity tests were also performed on the samples collected while permeability data was collected from the Department of Natural Resources and Mines (DNR &amp; M), Australia. The basins of interest for this project are the Bowen Basin in Australia and the Kalahari Basin in Botswana. The two basins are similar, though structurally different. The basins are similar in the sense that they have got similarity in their rock sequence. All the work done on the Bowen Basin and the results obtained are extrapolated to the similar Kalahari Basin. The units of the Bowen Basin are underlain by the Late Carboniferous to Early Permian Camboon Volcanics. The Permian units include the Buffel, Barfield, Flat Top, and Gyranda Formations and the Baralaba Coal Measures. The Triassic units are the Rewan Group, Clematis Sandstone and Moolayember Formation. Within the Bowen Basin the Permian units are generally argillaceous and therefore have generally low porosities and permeabilities and also give low resistivity (RES) base lines and high gamma ray (GR) baselines. However where fractured, the units yield some water from the shale. Boreholes drawing water from the Barfield, Flat Top and Gyranda Formations tap the fractured shales. The Triassic aquifers present a different picture. The best aquifers with high porosities and permeabilities are of the Triassic age and their distribution is influenced by their proximity to the source area. Sedimentary rocks of the Triassic age in the Bowen Basin become more argillaceous at more distal positions from the source area. The Rewan Group in particular shows this trend and hence better aquifers within the Rewan are those close to the source area. The Kalahari Basin Karoo stratigraphy commences with the Late Carboniferous to Early Permian glaciogenic sedimentary rocks of the Dwyka Group. The Dwyka Group is overlain by the argillaceous Permian to Early Triassic sedimentary rocks of The Ecca Group and the Beaufort Group. Overlying the Beaufort Group is the Lebung Group (lower Mosolotsane Formation-dominantly mudstone and siltstone sequence and upper Ntane Sandstone Formation- aeolian sandstone). Basaltic lavas of the stormberg Lava Group cap the Karoo stratigraphy. Few groundwater studies in the Karoo of the Kalahari Basin have shown that the Ecca Group does not posses good aquifer characteristics because of its argillaceous nature. However, thin arenaceous interbeds within the Ecca Group have yielded some groundwater. Non-measurable quantities of groundwater have been recorded from boreholes sunk in the Beaufort Group. Few boreholes penetrating the Mosolotsane Formation yielded very little groundwater whereas Ntane Sandstone have yielded a fair amount of groundwater. Groundwater yield from the Stormberg Lava Group is related to the presence of fractures.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">260501 Groundwater Hydrology</field><field name="subject">780104 Earth sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158198</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dark husk of beauty</field><field name="creator">Leggett, Andrew Alfred George</field><field name="description">In my dissertation &#8211; a collection of poems entitled Dark Husk of Beauty &#8211; I struggle with the dualities of beauty and ugliness, of creation and destruction. This Dark Husk of Beauty is what remains when I follow the exhortation of John Scott&#8217;s magician Aosman to take the ugly, or the deformed, or the old, and transcend &#8230; natural revulsion by uniting with it aesthetically &#8211; sometimes even physically. The body, subject to such a union, becomes the central metaphor of this creative work. The poems in the title section address the fierce disintegrative beauty of the body subject to the ravages of passion, disease and death. Those of the second section take up the metaphor of &#8220;Prophecy&#8221; &#8211; Ezekial&#146;s prophecy over the plain of dry bones that, gathered together, grow flesh and are restored to life. In the third section, &#8220;Wings of Desire&#8221;, the poems defiantly transcend aesthetic dualism, undeterred by the punishments inflicted on the body for the artists&#8217; heresy. The final poem, a sequence of versions of lesser known works of Rilke, attempts to negotiate the portal separating such extremes through grace. My critical essay &#8211; A Psychoanalytic Discourse on Creation, Destruction, Perversion, Reparation and Creation in the Works of John Scott &#8211; addresses the problems of such creation by means of a psychoanalytic literary discourse.

The study is situated primarily in the area of the history of Christian thought and is located in the area of modern Enlightenment Studies. Wesley&#146;s role as a pastoral theologian is established and his theological methodology uncovered from the perspective of his holistic vision of the God-human relationship being centred in love. This lays the foundation for an examination of his theological sources and tools derived from his extensive writings. Their interaction is explored through an examination of the doctrine and practice of Christian perfection as Wesley offered pastoral guidance to the people called Methodists. There is extensive debate within Methodist circles (particularly in North America) regarding the conception and utility of Wesley&#146;s theological method. Albert C. Outler was the key scholar who identified the components of the Wesleyan quadrilateral (Scripture, reason, tradition and experience) and proposed it as a unique and fruitful conception, with invaluable application for the Methodist movement today. Outler&#146;s claims have been much debated and in many quarters rejected, though his basic understanding remains well-established within influential sections of the church. This thesis is an examination of Wesley&#146;s writings in the light of the current debate to see if a more productive model can be established that will have greater resonance in a postmodern setting. After an overview of the scholarly debate on Wesley&#146;s location and theological method in the eighteenth century, the major focus is Wesley&#146;s own extensive writings over the course of his ministry. This is examined in three periods: 1725-39, 1740-69 and 1770-91. The study seeks to discover for each period his conception of the God-human relationship and what this implies for his theological method. The sources and tools Wesley utilised are then identified, before attention is turned to an examination of Christian perfection as a doctrine and its application in pastoral practice. The study has found that the common assessment of Wesley as a pastoral theologian is correct and this has implications for his approach to theologising. Wesley viewed the core characteristic of God&#146;s nature as love and the God-human relationship is to be defined by the qualities of trust and passion, rather than an intellectual comprehension of propositional truths about God. In his theological method Scripture, reason, community ethos and Christian experience are utilised in an interconnected dynamic network, energised by the presence of the Holy Spirit. God is clearly the sole theological authority and the components of the system are the means he uses for communication. This analysis emphasises the fundamental nature of Christianity as a relationship of love, based on trust rather than an intellectual comprehension of doctrine; it is essentially a matter of the heart rather than the head. Accordingly, pastoral theology is much more important than academic, systematic theology for Christian experience and spiritual formation. Theological method must be shaped by this understanding, and so personal knowledge is always to be valued over intellectual propositions; Christian belief concerns the encounter with God as a Person rather than the mastery of a comprehensive system of doctrines. Critical to this process is the ethos of the community, which is the intimate blending of all the elements under the guidance of the Spirit. This makes Christian experience, rather than merely life experience, of vital importance. Because love and relationships are not reducible to mechanical systems that are merely intellectually comprehended, there is an element of mystery that remains. There is a difference in the way that the Spirit utilises the means when working with the doctrinal substance and the experiential circumstance of Christian perfection. The Modernist approach that is focused on dissection and analysis results in the loss of this holistic, dynamic system and its reduction to either pure subjectivism or rationalism. Wesley&#146;s theological method is much closer to the pre-Modern approach that has been prevalent for most of history and more in harmony with much of the present developments in postmodern thought.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158126</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Models of fault-tolerant quantum computation</field><field name="creator">Dawson, Christopher Malcolm</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with certain theoretical problems that arise naturally in the context of fault-tolerant quantum computation. Fault-tolerance can be defined as the art of building reliable devices from unreliable components, and is of particular importance for quantum computers that aim to precisely control the dynamics of extremely sensitive quantum systems. A model of quantum computation is a specification of the basic building blocks by which a quantum computation is implemented. The best known model is the quantum circuit model, where computations are implemented by means of unitary quantum gates that are applied to two-level quantum systems known as qubits. In a physical implementation of a quantum circuit, the gates and qubits will inevitably be affected by noise. Fault-tolerant quantum circuits are designed to be resilient against the effects of this noise, provided that it is not too strong. Fault-tolerance in the quantum circuit model is well developed thanks to the theory of quantum error-correcting codes. These codes allow for the correction of small numbers of errors introduced by a variety of noise processes. In a fault-tolerant quantum circuit, qubits are replaced with encoded qubits, and quantum gates with encoded gates that are immediately followed by special quantum circuits for error correction. Provided the rate at which errors occur is below a constant threshold value, the accumulation of errors can be checked so that the correct output of the computation correctly determined. The threshold acts as both a measure of how good the design of a quantum circuit is, and also as a target for experimenters aiming to implement quantum circuits. Much current research in quantum computation is aimed at designing quantum circuits that increase the noise threshold, hopefully to the point where it becomes within the reach of experimenters. A fault-tolerant encoded quantum gate must limit the propagation of errors so that the code&#146;s corrective capabilities are not overwhelmed. It is not so easy to design encoded gates that satisfy this property, and to date only a finite handful of such gates are known. In a faulttolerant quantum circuit, all quantum gates must be decomposed or compiled in terms of those that may be implemented fault-tolerantly. In the first part of this thesis, we present two results that may be applied to this problem of gate compilation. The first is a generic method based on the Solovay-Kitaev theorem that may be applied to all quantum gates, but is most effective for those that act on single qubits. We present the Solovay-Kitaev theorem in its simples known form as an algorithm, together with novel constructions that can be used to implement it. Following this we give a two specialized methods for two-qubit gate decomposition, based on the Cartan decomposition of the Lie group SU(4). The cluster-state model of computation is an alternative to the quantum circuit model, and makes use of quantum measurements and highly entangled cluster-states to implement a quantum computation. The fault-tolerant techniques developed for quantum circuits are not immediately applicable in this model, so in order for it to be a realistic candidate for performing computations we prove that such techniques are possible. In the second part of the thesis we prove that constant fault-tolerance thresholds may be achieved in the cluster-state model, and in particular in an adaption to an optical implementation. Following this we design a complete error correction scheme for optical cluster-state computation, and numerically determine the threshold of this model in the face of the dominant noise models likely to affect such an implementation.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">249999 Physical Sciences not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158120</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transformative Power in Motherwork: A Study of Mothering in the 1950s and 1960s</field><field name="creator">Porter, Marie</field><field name="description">In this thesis I explore the experiences of a group of Australian women who became first-time mothers between 1950 and 1965. I interviewed twenty-four mothers, half of whom were selected as practising Roman Catholics. The other half was AnglicanfProtestant by co-incidence rather than selection. The data in this research have been collected via in-depth, unstructured interviews with the participants. The interviews were taped and transcribed verbatim, before the data were analysed. I present a grounded theory of transformative power in motherwork that has emerged from the analysis of interviews. The mothers talked about what they did in their active mothering years. I argue that despite being constrained by the gender bias in the patriarchal context, these mothers were agents who developed skills that enabled them to resist or creatively deal with the constraints they faced. Their emphasis was on their agency and the power to nurture their children into responsible adults. Their awareness of the importance of their motherwork acted as a motivator in this development. My thesis is that the relationship between each mother and each of her children is a transformative power relationship in which both mother and child are transformedthe child into an independent adult and the mother into a skilled self-motivated agent through her mothenvork. Any threat to this process resulted in the mother doing all she could to resist or counteract the constraintls she was encountering. Transformative power expressed in motherwork can be recognised analytically by several characteristics. It empowers both parties in the motherlchild duality. Complexity, diversity, fluidity, and responsiveness to the physical, intellectual, and emotional aspects of the relationship are all evident in transformative power relationships. Through their own transformation, the mothers saw the falsity of the master narratives of motherhood, prevalent in society in the 1950s and 1960s, which they had believed as inexperienced girls. From their stories about motherwork, I reveal a counter narrative that was portrayed not only in their telling of their stories: but in their discursivelreflexive practices as mothers.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">370104 Urban Sociology and Community Studies</field><field name="subject">440207 Religion and Society</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158105</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Planctomycete diversity and cell biology: perspectives from the molecular, cellular and organism levels</field><field name="creator">Butler, Margaret Kay</field><field name="description">The Planctomycetes are a deep branching phylum of the domain Bacteria that incorporate a diverse group of organisms possessing a number of unusual and distinct characteristics. These features include budding reproduction, the planctomycetecharacteristic crateriform structures on their cell surface, a cell wall that lacks peptidoglycan, internal compartmentalisation and unique molecular features of their rRNA genes. This study chose to investigate a number of aspects of planctomycete cell biology and diversity to further our knowledge of this unique group. In a study of the diversity of ribonuclease P (RNase P) RNA, one molecule of relevance to cell biology and compartmentalisation in planctomycetes, RNase P RNA genes were sequenced for species from all genera of planctomycetes for which a pure culture exists. Secondary structures for RNase P RNA of these strains were deduced, taking to 26 the number of planctomycete RNase P RNA structures. Nucleotide positions were identified in which some planctomycetes possess a less common form, including one thought to be otherwise conserved within all Bacteria and Archaea. Phylogenetic analysis of RNase P RNA genes was relatively consistent with that of 16S rRNA genes with the exception that clustering of Gemmata and anammox sequences occurred, possibly due to either long-branch attraction or lateral gene transfer. Analysis of RNase P RNA secondary structures revealed unusual features of planctomycetes relative to all other bacteria, including an additional helix within the P13 helix of &#145;Candidatus Brocadia anammoxidans&#146;, &#145;Candidatus Kuenenia stuttgartiensis&#146; and all Gemmata sequences. The longest P12 helix of any bacteria type A RNase P RNA was found in a Gemmatalike isolate. The short tandem repeats in P12 helices of two Gemmata-like isolates are possibly analogous to short tandem repetitive repeat sequences of some cyanobacteria RNase P RNA. In experiments using Gemmata obscuriglobus as a model for planctomycete cell biology and compartmentalisation functions, electron microscope-level in situ hybridisation (EMISH), and subsequent statistical analysis, was developed to localise 16S rRNA, 23S rRNA and RNase P RNA to particular regions within Gemmata obscuriglobus, the first instance of EMISH being applied in this way to bacteria. Statistical analysis localised 16S rRNA to both nuclear body and to riboplasm outside this region but it was absent from paryphoplasm. While co-localisation of both 16S rRNA and 23S rRNA molecules, which might indicate assembled ribosomes, was rarely observed, 23S rRNA, like 16S rRNA, was distributed in both riboplasm-containing areas of the cell. While statistical analysis revealed minor DNA within riboplasm outside the nuclear body, the majority was localised to that body. These results suggest at least some uncoupling of translation from transcription involving ribosomes in the riboplasm. RNase P RNA was localised both to the nuclear body and to the riboplasm outside this region, suggesting that pre-tRNA processing occurs both within nuclear body, where RNA transcripts are presumably generated, and outside nuclear body, separated from the origin of these transcripts. This is also consistent with the hypothesis that processed tRNA is required in the riboplasm outside the nuclear body, due to occurrence of some uncoupled translation. In research on planctomycetes not yet examined with respect to cell plan or structure, 16S rRNA gene sequencing of isolate ATCC 35122 confirmed its very close relationship to the type strain of Pirellula staleyi and its membership of the phylum Planctomycetes. Morphological characteristics, including polar crateriform structures and the occurrence of a unique internal, single membrane-bounded compartment enclosing nucleoid and ribosome-like particles, the pirellulosome, and a polar cap region, are also consistent with its membership of the planctomycetes and of genus Pirellula. Cells often displayed pointed, hump-like protrusions opposite each other on the cell, constituting prosthecae. Also re-examined using a number of methods were uncultured species Planctomyces bekefii and Pl. guttaeformis. Samples could be enriched for Pl. bekefii via either addition of ferric citrate or ampicillin. An application of a novel approach, laser microdissection and pressure catapulting, was also used physically to enrich P. bekefii rosettes. Fluorescent in situ hybridisation provided the first molecular evidence of Pl. bekefii and Pl. guttaeformis as Planctomycetes. Also confirming Planctomycetes membership of Pl. bekefii was the presence of a cytoplasm divided into two regions by an intracytoplasmic membrane, consistent with membership to the genus Planctomyces. Two new planctomycete-like organisms, MBLW1 and MBLW2, were isolated in this study and possessed a Gemmata-like cell plan. 16S rRNA gene sequencing confirmed these isolates belonged to the Gemmata clade within phylum Planctomycetes, though they may comprise a separate but closely related genus. Via EMISH, both ATCC 35122 and MBLW1 were hybridised with a planctomycete-specific probe, consistent with membership to the planctomycetes. Statistical analysis showed that 16S rRNA was present in both regions of the riboplasm of MBLW1, identical to the distribution observed G. obscuriglobus. This is another example of possible uncoupled translation within a member of the planctomycetes and within organisms in the Gemmata clade of planctomycetes.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270399 Microbiology not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158079</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Simultaneous Lift, Moment and Thrust Measurements on a Scramjet in Hypervelocity Flow</field><field name="creator">Robinson, Matthew</field><field name="description">This study investigates the stress wave force balance technique for the measurement of forces on a fuelled hypersonic flight vehicle in an impulse-type test facility. A three component force balance for the measurement of lift, thrust and pitching moment on a supersonic combustion ramjet engine was designed, built, calibrated and tested. The force balance was designed using finite element analysis and consisted of four stress bars instrumented for the measurement of strain. Relative errors of less than 2% were obtained for the recovered simulated calibration loads, while errors of less than 3% were obtained for lift and thrust components for simulated fuel-on and fuel-off force loading distributions. Tests in a calibration rig showed that the balance was capable of recovering the magnitude of point loads to within 3% and their lines of action to within 1% of the chord of the model. Additional errors result when testing in a wind tunnel. The uncertainties for the experiments with fuel injection are estimated at 9%, 7% and 9% for the coefficients of lift, thrust and pitching moment. The scramjet vehicle was 0.566m long and weighed approximately 6kg. It consisted of an inlet, combustion chamber and thrust surface. Fuel could be injected through a series of injectors located on the scramjet inlet. The scramjet model was set at zero angle of attack. Experiments were performed in the T4 Free Piston Shock Tunnel at a total enthalpy of 3.3MJ/kg, a nozzle supply pressure of 32MPa and a Mach number of 6.6, with equivalence ratios up to 1.4. Fuel-off force coefficients were measured to within 2% of theoretical values based on predictions using CFD and hypersonic theory. The fuel-off centre-of-pressure was measured to within 4% of the predicted value. The force coefficients varied linearly with equivalence ratio. Good comparison of the measured lift and thrust forces with theoretical values was obtained with increasing flow rates of fuel. The lift-to-drag ratio increased from 3.0 at the fuel-off condition to 17.2 at an equivalence ratio of 1.0. Poor agreement between the measured pitching moment and theoretical values was obtained due to difficulties in predicting the pressure distribution with heat addition on the latter parts of the thrust surface. A shift in the centre-of-pressure of approximately 10% of model chord was measured as the equivalence ratio varied from 0.0 to 1.0. For the design tested, the thrust produced was not enough to overcome drag on the vehicle, even at the highest equivalence ratio tested. Tests at higher stagnation enthalpies (up to 4.9MJ/kg) showed the lift and pitching moment coefficients remained constant with an equivalence ratio of 0.8 but the thrust coefficient decreased exponentially with increasing stagnation enthalpies. Good agreement of experimental values of lift and thrust force with predicted values was obtained for equivalence ratios of 0.0 and 0.8. Choking occurred at stagnation enthalpies of less than 3.0MJ/kg and a nozzle supply pressure of 32MPa with fuel injection at an equivalence ratio of approximately 0.8, resulting in a drag force of approximately 2.5 times the fuel-off drag force. Tests at a nozzle supply enthalpy of 3.3MJ/kg and nozzle supply pressures of 32, 26 and 16MPa were performed at equivalence ratios of 0.0 and 0.8. The fuel-off lift coefficient remained constant but the thrust coefficient increased. This is attributed to a reduction in skin friction associated with longer lengths of laminar boundary layers as the Reynolds number was decreased. The measured fuel-off lift and thrust coefficients agreed with the predicted values to within the known test flow and force prediction uncertainties. Combustion did not occur at a nozzle supply pressure of 16MPa. This work has demonstrated that overall scramjet vehicle performance measurements (such as lift-to-drag ratio and shifts in centre-of-pressure) can be made in a free piston shock tunnel.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">290299 Aerospace Engineering not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">690302 Space transport</field><field name="subject">shock tunnel</field><field name="subject">force measurement</field><field name="subject">scramjet</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158040</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification of denitrifying microbial communities in activated sludge exposed to external carbon sources</field><field name="creator">Ginige, Maneesha Prasaad</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis was to identify the denitrifying microbial communities in activated sludge from full-scale treatment plants and from small-scale reactors exposed to acetate or methanol as external carbon sources. Biological denitrification is currently the most widely used, sustainable and cost-effective process to remove nitrogen from wastewater. Increasingly strict effluent discharge standards are posing significant challenges to plant operators to reduce effluent NO3--N concentrations to levels as low as 2-3 mg L-1 or even lower. The lack of sufficient influent carbon in many municipal wastewater treatment plants makes it very difficult to achieve such low NO3--N concentrations in the effluent. An effective solution to the problem is to introduce additional external carbon sources to enhance denitrification. The selection of external carbon sources is not purely based on costs but is also dependent on the possible microbial transformations that these carbon sources may bring about in activated sludge. The most common carbon source used is methanol due to its low cost, but it has been found to cause long delays until an improvement in denitrification performance is observed. On the other hand, acetate has been found to improve denitrification almost instantaneously when added, but it has a significantly higher cost. In this study, methanol and acetate utilising denitrifiers were investigated in activated sludge with and without enrichment in laboratory scale bioreactors. The relevant denitrifiers were identified and evaluated in situ using culture independent methods particularly stable isotope probing (SIP), 16S rDNA cloning, fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) and microautoradiography (MAR). Activated sludge collected from a biological nutrient removal plant exhibiting good denitrification was enriched in an anoxically-operated sequencing batch reactor (SBR) by feeding methanol as the sole carbon source and nitrate as the electron acceptor. The SBR was operated over a duration of 7 months and the SBR denitrification rate improved from 0.02 mg NO3--N mg mixed liquor volatile suspended solids (MLVSS)-1 h-1 to a steady-state value of 0.06 mg NO3-N mg MLVSS-1 h-1. At steady state operation the enriched biomass was subjected to SIP with 13C-methanol to biomark the denitrifiers capable of utilising methanol under anoxic conditions. The separated 12C-DNA and 13C-DNA fractions from the SIP experiment were individually subjected to full cycle rRNA analysis. The dominant 16S rRNA gene phylotype (Group-A clones) in the 13C-library was closely related to the obligate methylotrophs Methylobacillus and Methylophilus in the order Methylophilales of the Betaproteobacteria (96-97% sequence identities), while the most abundant clone groups in the 12C-library mostly belonged to the family Saprospiraceae in the Bacteroidetes phylum. Oligonucleotide probes were designed for FISH to target the Group-A clones and Methylophilales (probes DEN67 and MET1216, respectively) and the Saprospiraceae clones (probe SAP553). Application of these probes on SBR biomass over the enrichment period demonstrated a strong correlation between the level of SBR denitrification and relative abundance of DEN67-targeted bacteria in the SBR community. By contrast, no correlation was found between denitrification rate and the relative abundances of the well known denitrifying genera Hyphomicrobium and Paracoccus nor the Saprospiraceae-clones visualised by FISH in the SBR biomass. FISH combined with microautoradiography independently confirmed that the DEN67-targeted cells were the dominant bacterial group capable of anoxic [14C] methanol uptake in the enriched biomass. As observed in full-scale operations, the methanol-fed SBR experienced a lag period of several weeks before denitrification performance increased. Using FISH quantification, it was shown that this coincided with the lag phase in the growth of the DEN67-targeted denitrifying population. It was therefore concluded that the Methylophilales bacteria dominant in our SBR system are likely to be important in full-scale methanol-fed denitrifying sludges. The acetate utilising microbial consortium in activated sludge was investigated without prior enrichment using stable isotope probing (SIP). 13C-acetate was used in SIP to biomark the DNA of the denitrifiers. The extracted 13C-DNA fraction was subjected to a full cycle rRNA analysis. The dominant 16S rRNA gene phylotypes in the 13C-library were closely related to bacterial families Comamonadaceae and Rhodocyclaceae of class Betaproteobacteria (96-97% sequence identities). Seven oligonucleotide probes (DEN444, DEN220, DEN581, DEN441, DEN124, DEN220a and DEN1454) for use in FISH was designed to specifically target the identified phylotypes. Application of these probes on the sludge of a continuously fed denitrifying sequencing batch reactor (CFDSBR) operated over a duration of 16 days indicated a strong correlation between the level of CFDSBR denitrification and relative abundance of all probe-targeted bacteria in the CFDSBR community. FISH combined with microautoradiography (FISH-MAR) further confirmed that the DEN581- and DEN124-targeted cells dominating the CFDSBR were capable of taking up [14C] acetate under anoxic conditions. The initial occurrence of the DEN444- and DEN1454-targeted bacteria and the final dominance of DEN581- and DEN124-targeted bacteria in the CFDSBR community were likely related to the changing in-reactor nitrite concentrations during the first few days of CFDSBR operation. Hence, the DEN444- and DEN1454-targeted bacteria were hypothesised to have low affinities for nitrite while DEN124- and DEN581-targeted bacteria have higher nitrite affinities. However, it was clear that all probe-targeted bacteria were denitrifiers capable of utilising acetate as a carbon source. The rapid increase in numbers of the probe-targeted organisms positively correlates with the immediate increase in denitrification rates. The rapid response and community shifts observed when acetate was used to enhance denitrification suggest that an intermittent application of acetate is quite effective to temporarily enhance the denitrification capacity of a treatment plant. However, the importance of a bacterial impact assessment of activated sludge subjected to intermittent acetate supplementation is recommended prior to the wide use of acetate in the wastewater industry. The acetate utilising denitrifying microbial communities investigated in the previous chapter were characterised according to their eco-physiological properties using the r- and K-selection criteria. The electron donor (acetate) and acceptor (nitrite) affinities of these probe-identified denitrifiers were used as traits for this characterisation. The substrate to microorganism (S/M) ratio was manipulated to provide high and low substrate concentrations in the reactor to create conditions favourable for r- and K-strategists, respectively. Two factors, namely feeding regimes and sludge retention times, were studied to achieve the desired S/M ratios and enable r/K characterisation. The high substrate affinities and high specific growth rates of two probe-identified denitrifiers (DEN124 and DEN581) did not enable resolution of these two organisms with the feeding regimes used in this study. However, the application of different sludge retention times as a control strategy to maintain constant high and low in-reactor S/M ratios enabled characterisation of the two probe-targeted denitrifiers DEN124 and DEN581 as K- and r-strategists, respectively. The in-reactor S/M ratios applied in this study did not facilitate the characterisation of populations targeted by probes DEN444 and DEN1454. The minor fluctuations of the S/M ratios during a cycle in the SBR operation was considered as a drawback, but conclusive results could still be obtained from the study. A chemostat reactor operation with constant loading and variable flow rates is suggested as an alternative. Conclusively, this study was able to identify specific groups of denitrifying microorganisms in activated sludge when exposed to acetate and methanol. Unlike most previous studies, which relied on culture dependent methods, this study adopted a pure culture independent approach to identify microorganisms in relation to their function, i.e. denitrification. Moreover, acetate denitrifiers were in situ characterised based on eco-physiological properties. The identification of denitrifying communities in this study has paved the way to a larger research project on the optimisation of denitrification processes with external acetate, methanol and other carbon supplements. As such, this study has contributed significantly to the understanding of the denitrification processes by linking process data with microbial investigations.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">L</field><field name="subject">270399 Microbiology not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">770502 Land and water management</field><field name="subject">290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="subject">670700 Industrial Chemicals and Related Products</field><field name="subject">Wastewater treatment</field><field name="subject">Activated sludge</field><field name="subject">Nitrogen removal</field><field name="subject">External carbon</field><field name="subject">FISH</field><field name="subject">MAR</field><field name="subject">Denitrification</field><field name="subject">Bacteria</field><field name="subject">Ecology</field><field name="subject">Microorganisms</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157995</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Formal concept analysis applications to requirements engineering and design</field><field name="creator">Tilley, Thomas Alan</field><field name="description">Currently, the bulk of applications of Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) in software engineering have focussed on software maintenance and re-engineering. In this thesis we broaden the approach by applying FCA to a number of early-phase activities within the software engineering life-cycle. With respect to the requirements engineering phase, a case study is presented comparing two class hierarchies that model aspects of a mass-transit railway ticketing system. The first hierarchy was produced for an existing Object-Z specification of the system while the second was derived using FCA. Contrasting the two hierarchies revealed that they were essentially the same, however, the differences highlighted specification artefacts in the existing hierarchy. With respect to the design phase, the thesis discusses the use of FCA for the navigation and visualisation of Formal Specifications written in Z. In response to the continued call for formal methods tool support, we implement and explore a prototype specification browser that exploits the abstractions afforded by FCA. The research hypothesis is an integrated architecture for navigating formal specifications using FCA. This architecture is realised using ZML and ToscanaJ to produce a practical research tool. The thesis also includes the first broad survey of FCA in the domain of software engineering and an FCA-based methodology for surveying academic literature in general.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">280111 Conceptual Modelling</field><field name="subject">700199 Computer software and services not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">formal concept analysis</field><field name="subject">requirements analysis</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">software engineering</field><field name="subject">formal specification</field><field name="subject">Z</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157991</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Late Silurian to Middle Devonian acanthodians of eastern Australia</field><field name="creator">Burrow, Carole J</field><field name="description">The acanthodians were a common and widespread group of fishes throughout the world during the mid-Palaeozoic. In this study, a full-scale systematic analysis of Silurian to Middle Devonian acanthodian taxa of eastern Australia was undertaken, incorporating a review and updating of historical records and descriptions of taxa. Phylogenetic relationships within the group and with other early gnathostomes are uncertain. The structure, function and modes of growth of acanthodian scales were described and investigated, and these features were used for comparisons between different taxa within the group, and between acanthodians and other early vertebrates. Histological and morphological characters of the scales were incorporated in a cladistic analysis of genera erected for articulated fish. This analysis did not support the traditional ordinal level groups, the Climatiida, Ischnacanthida and Acanthodida. Therefore, the highest taxonomic level used in the study was the family. Rarely were acanthodians preserved as articulated fossils. The only examples known from the Silurian-Middle Devonian of Australia are one specimen of the putative acanthodian Yealepis douglasi Burrow &amp; Young 1999 from the Ludlow of Victoria, five specimens of an indeterminate ?ischnacanthidid from the late Givetian of New South Wales and a rich assemblage from the Givetian lacustrine shales of Mt Howitt, Victoria. The latter fauna (originally dated as Late Devonian) includes six incomplete specimens of the culmacanthidid Culmacanthus stewarti Long 1983 and about 60 specimens of acanthodidid Howittacanthus kentoni Long 1986. In contrast, disassociated remains of the group are ubiquitous in microvertebrate faunas from the mid-Palaeozoic of eastern Australia. Although scales of other fish groups are sometimes more common in particular facies, acanthodian elements are found in all depositional environments, from deep shelf marine to transitional to freshwater. Most of the taxa, particularly those only preserved as isolated scales, had not been systematically described by other workers. This thesis incorporates descriptions of new taxa, and revision and updating of other taxa. Several overseas studies have produced biostratigraphic charts based on acanthodian scales. A similar biostratigraphic overview was undertaken based on a systematic analysis of the Early Devonian acanthodians of eastern Australia, permitting comparisons with acanthodian faunas of other regions. Acanthodian scales and fin spines are the most common elements in the few vertebrate faunas that are known from the Silurian of Australia. Diversity and geographic distribution of the acanthodian faunas peaked during the Early Devonian. This study has been hampered by the low numbers of scales in many samples, and by uncertainty over their dating (particularly for the faunas from non-limestone deposits). Nevertheless, the work shows that changes in the marine assemblages are broadly correlated with the pattern of marine transgressions and regressions. Composition of the acanthodian faunas, and their abundance relative to other vertebrates in the assemblages, depend on the depositional environment. This correlation is best illustrated in Lower Devonian deposits, in which acanthodians are the most prolific and diverse. In transitional and marginal marine deposits, thelodonts are dominant, and acanthodians a minor element of the fauna. In off-shore assemblages, acanthodians and placoderms are dominant, and thelodonts are rare or absent. Vertebrate faunas are poor in the earliest Devonian deposits, but become more common by the late Lochkovian, with near-shore assemblages characterized by Trundlelepis cervicostulata and ANostolepis@ guangxiensis, and deeper shelf assemblages by a new genus, possibly assignable to the Ischnacanthidae. The vertebrate record is sparse through the middle Pragian, though AN.@ guangxiensis is present low in the Coopers Creek Limestone (upper sulcatus-pireneae zones), being replaced by Nostolepoides platymarginata, Gomphonchus? bogongensis, and Radioporacanthodes sp. aff. R. (Gomphonchus) liujingensis by the kindlei Zone. Microvertebrate assemblages are more common by the late Pragian (pireneae Zone), with Radioporacanthodes sp. aff. R. liujingensis in deeper shelf deposits, and N. platymarginata and G.? bogongensis dominating near-shore assemblages. The earliest Emsian (dehiscens Zone) is marked by the incoming Cheiracanthoides wangi. Middle Emsian (perbonus-serotinus zones) assemblages are characterized by two new species, possibly assignable to Gomphonchus.The Middle Devonian cosmopolitan association of Cheiracanthoides comptus and AAcanthoides@ dublinensis, which characterizes early Middle Devonian faunas from North America, Europe and China, appears first in the latest Emsian at the serotinus-patulus zone boundary. As well as showing the value of acanthodians in biostratigraphy and as indicators of environmental settings, their use in biogeography was demonstrated. Although many of the acanthodian taxa are endemic, several are also found in other regions. The Silurian to earliest Devonian faunas of eastern Australia are most closely related to coeval Chinese assemblages. Several latest Silurian-earliest Devonian taxa are also recorded from the circum-Arctic region. The late Lochkovian to early Emsian assemblages, particularly from south-eastern Australia, have many taxa in common with Chinese faunas. The mid-Emsian taxa show highest endemicity; and the latest Emsian-Eifelian assemblages have the most cosmopolitan aspect. Acanthodian faunas become rarer and depauperate in the Middle Devonian, particularly in the south-eastern corner, and are mostly in poorly dated, ?fluviatile/marginal marine deposits. This study of acanthodian faunas has encompassed a full scale systematic review of the group in this region, an appraisal of phylogenetic relationships within the group and with other early vertebrates, their palaeoecology, and their use in biostratigraphy and biogeography.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">260112 Palaeontology</field><field name="subject">780105 Biological sciences</field><field name="subject">Acanthodii</field><field name="subject">Devonian</field><field name="subject">Silurian</field><field name="subject">bistratigraphy</field><field name="subject">biogeography</field><field name="subject">eastern Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157975</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study on diffusion and flow of sub-critical hydrocarbons in activated carbon</field><field name="creator">BAE, Jun-Seok</field><field name="description">This thesis deals with diffusion and flow of sub-critical hydrocarbons in activated carbon by using a differential permeation method. The hydrocarbons are selected according to the effect on environmental concerns and their unique characteristics such as polarity and affinity towards activated carbon. Although it has been known that transport processes in activated carbon consist of Knudsen diffusion, gaseous viscous flow, adsorbed phase diffusion (so called, surface diffusion) and condensate flow, there have been no rigorous models to describe the transport processes in activated carbon with a full range of pressures. In particular among the four processes, the mechanism of adsorbed phase diffusion in activated carbon is still far from complete understanding. Also due to the dispersion interactions between adsorbing molecules and the solid surface, one would expect that Knudsen diffusion is influenced by the dispersive forces. From intensive experimental observations with a great care over a full range of pressures, conventional methods (for example, direct estimation from inert gas experiments) to determine adsorbed phase diffusion are found to be inadequate for strongly adsorbing vapors in activated carbon. By incorporating the effect of adsorbate-adsorbent interactions into Knudsen diffusivity, the general behavior of adsorbed phase diffusion in terms of pressure (or surface loading) can be obtained, showing a significant role in transport at low pressures. For non-polar hydrocarbons such as benzene, carbon tetrachloride and n-hexane, a mathematical model, which accounts for the effects of adsorbate-adsorbent interactions and pore size distribution, is formulated and validated, resulting in a good agreement with experimental data. Moreover, the adsorption and dynamic behaviors of alcohol molecules (which are polar compounds) are investigated with an aim to compare their behaviors against those of non-polar compounds.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">670700 Industrial Chemicals and Related Products</field><field name="subject">surface diffusion</field><field name="subject">hydrocarbons</field><field name="subject">activated carbon</field><field name="subject">transport phenomena</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157965</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Direct and correlated responses to selection in large white pigs for growth rate on restricted feeding</field><field name="creator">Nguyen Hong Nguyen, Nguyen</field><field name="description">Responses in growth rate, food conversion efficiency, carcass composition, residual food intake, meat quality and reproduction traits to selection in pigs for four years, for high or low post-weaning growth rate on a fixed but restricted ration were measured in progeny grown on either restricted, ad libitum individual or ad libitum group feeding regimens. Genetic and phenotypic correlations among the traits were also examined on animals whose full pedigrees comprised a total of 5324 animals. Substantial divergent response was achieved from selection for high vs. low growth rate on restricted feeding, with the genetic means of daily gain diverging by 81.25 g or 2.78 genetic standard deviations (SigmaG). The high and low growth rate lines also differed in ultrasonic backfat and food conversion efficiency by 1.12 SigmaG and 0.84 SigmaG, and by 0.88 SigmaG, 1.10 SigmaG, and 1.14 SigmaG for carcass weight daily gain, carcass fat and lean percentage, respectively. These responses were consistent with the moderately to highly, favourable genetic correlations among and between performance and carcass composition traits. Genetic changes in growth rate, ultrasonic backfat, food conversion ratio, carcass daily gain, carcass fat and lean percentage when measured on ad libitum individual feeding were all economically beneficial. The high growth line had a significantly lower voluntary daily food intake and residual food intake than the contemporaneous low line, indicating a reduced energy requirement for maintenance in the high relative to the low line. Genetic correlations between either growth rate or backfat and carcass traits were favourable but unfavourable between daily food intake and carcass fat or lean percentage, implying that selection strategies which place emphasis on increased leanness and decreased fatness would result in a decline in voluntary food intake of the animals. The descendants of breeding pigs selected for high post-weaning daily gain on restricted feeding showed significantly increased growth rates, slaughter weights and carcase lean percentages and reduced fatness when grown in group housing with ad libitum feeding. This suggests that restricted feeding is an effective performance testing approach for seedstock lines supplying commercial regimens with group housing and ad libitum feeding. Carcase lean pH values measured 24 hours post-mortem (pH24) were not statistically different between the selected lines, suggesting that an increase in basal metabolic rate due to increased rate of lean deposition in the high relative to the low line may have been compensated for by a reduction in heat production from other sources such as physical activity. Such a reduction was evidenced by a lower residual food intake in the high than the low growth lines. This supports the hypothesis that selection for high growth rate on restricted feeding does not have detrimental effects on pork quality. The sows of the high growth line produced more piglets with significantly heavier weights at birth, giving a potential for better post-natal growth and higher yield of pork weaned per sow per year than the low growth sows. Body weights of the high line sows prior to mating were also significantly higher than those of low line sows suggesting earlier age of sexual maturity. A non-significant tendency for high line sows to have a lower voluntary food intake than low line sows pointed to the possibility that their lower maintenance requirement as growers was carried over to the lactational phase of life. It is concluded that selection for high growth rate on a restricted ration of fixed amount will produce pig strains with a high genetic potential for lean growth, reduced energy requirement for maintenance and improved reproductive performance, and which will be suitable for growing under a wide range of commercial feeding environments.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">279999 Biological Sciences not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">L</field><field name="subject">630105 Pigs</field><field name="subject">divergent selection</field><field name="subject">responses</field><field name="subject">genetic parameters</field><field name="subject">white pigs</field><field name="subject">restricted feeding</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157962</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Taxonomy and Biology of benedeniine capsalid monogeneans</field><field name="creator">Deveney, Marty R.</field><field name="description">Abstract The Benedeniinae, the largest of nine capsalid subfamilies, includes genera with an aseptate, apapillate haptor and a pair of discrete testes. Eight of 13 nominal benedeniine genera, Benedenia Diesing, 1858 (the type genus); Allobenedenia Yamaguti, 1963; Allometabenedeniella Velasquez, 1982; Dioncopseudobenedenia Yamaguti, 1965; Lagenivaginopseudobenedenia Yamaguti, 1966; Oligoncobenedenia Yamaguti, 1965; Pseudallobenedenia Yamaguti, 1966 and Tareenia, Hussey, 1986 are revised using type material of most nominal species with observations for some species from new material. Allobenedenia and Allometabenedeniella are transferred to the Trochopodinae Price, 1936 emend. Sproston, 1946 because all valid species of both genera bear septa on the ventral haptor surface. Allobenedenia ishikawae (Goto, 1894) Yamaguti, 1963 is transferred to Benedenia because its haptor is aseptate. I recognize Menziesia Gibson, 1976, based on the form of the male copulatory organ and associated structures and include five species in it. Tareenia Hussey, 1986 is synonymised with Benedenia because characters used to differentiate the two genera do not indicate discontinuities at the generic level. Benedeniella Johnston, 1929, Calicobenedenia Kritsky and Fennessy, 1999 and Trimusculotrema Whittington and Barton, 1990 are considered to belong in Entobdellinae Bychowsky, 1957, pending further studies on that group. The anatomy of Calicobenedenia is outlined briefly; the other genera are not discussed here in detail. Lachishia n. g. is described, based on the structure of the male copulatory organ and a species is transferred to it from Dioncopseudobenedenia. I describe four new species of benedeniines from teleosts caught at Heron and Green Islands, Australia namely: Benedenia ernsti n. sp. from the gills of Symphorus nematophorus; Benedenia fieldsi n. sp. from the fins of Cephalopholis boenak, C. cyanostigma and C. miniatus; Benedenia haywardi n. sp. from the skin of S. nematophorus and Dioncopsudobenedenia ancoralis n. sp. from the gills of Siganus lineatus. Benedenia akaisaki Iwata, 1990 is synonymised with B. ovata (Goto, 1894) Johnston, 1929, B. kintoki Iwata, 1990 is synonymised with B. elongata (Yamaguti, 1968) Egorova, 1997, B. sargocentron Zhang, Yang and Liu, 2001 is synonymised with B. hawaiiensis Yamaguti, 1968 and Pseudallobenedenia arabica Timofeeva, 1995 is synonymised with P. opakapaka Yamaguti, 1966. Benedenia madai Ishii and Sawada, 1938, B. pagrosomi Ishii and Sawada, 1938 and Allobenedenia pedunculata Raju and Rao, 1980 are considered species inquirendae. I examined an outbreak in aquaculture of the pathogenic benedeniine, Neobenedenia melleni (MacCallum, 1927) Yamaguti, 1963 and report this species for the first time in Australia. I examined the pathogenesis caused by this parasite by histology of host tissue. Possible routes of introduction to the farm in question are investigated and studies are detailed that should be undertaken in Australia to manage future outbreaks of N. melleni. Capsalids usually colonise new hosts by an infective ciliated oncomiracidium. An experiment was conducted to ascertain whether cleaner fish Labroides dimidiatus could transfer adult skin-parasitic monogeneans from one host fish to another. I have shown that transmission of adult monogeneans between two individuals of Hemigymnus melapterus by cleaner fish can occur. In coral reef environments, frequent contact between unrelated hosts involved in cleaning interactions might create previously unsuspected evolutionary pressures. I discuss the implications of this discovery for host-specificity and lateral transmission of monogeneans. General biological studies of monogeneans are necessary to understand the evolution, pathology, epidemiology, phylogeny and taxonomy of these parasites. My study provides a taxonomic system which, when applied to other capsalid subfamilies, should help prevent errors and create a clear system of classification for the entire family.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270299 Genetics not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">Benedeniinae</field><field name="subject">Capsalidae</field><field name="subject">taxonomy</field><field name="subject">parasite</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157960</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Changing Complex Documents</field><field name="creator">Carter, Simon Matthew James</field><field name="description">Change management is a discipline fundamental to the task of building ever more complex computing systems. Properly managed change provides a means whereby alterations to existing components of a complex artefact and their relationships can be evaluated, managed and evolved. This thesis takes as its example Official RAAF Publications, some of which need to be revised as a result of changes to the system they describe. The thesis develops a model of change propagation providing a set of operations to examine and record the changes to a set of publications. Additional operations enable coping with reversing decisions and handling the unexpected arrival of externally generated amendments. The model is extended to cover a finer granularity of entities (at the page level) to determine whether this greater level of detail would ease some tasks. A further extension provides the notion of relationships between the publications of concern, focusing on a dependency relationship between two publications. This enables exploration of the possibility of improving the process by reducing the risk of missing publications needing revision and providing a means by which some tasks can be partly automated thus speeding up the process. The models presented were developed in Sum, a variant of the Z specification language, to gain greater insight into the essential details of the operations and data structures involved. By ignoring implementation details the essential logical steps of each model can be emphasised and their differences and similarities contrasted. This thesis demonstrates that fine-grained change management is feasible. The thesis develops processes that automatically track the status of changes as they are propagated through a set of documents. The greater knowledge of work done on individual pages allows only the page(s) of concern to be affected. The work also enables recommendations to be made as to the applicability of each model and, by comparing the models, provides insight into the amount of work and resources required for tackling change at different levels of granularity.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">L</field><field name="subject">280302 Software Engineering</field><field name="subject">700199 Computer software and services not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">change management</field><field name="subject">change propagation</field><field name="subject">fine-grained change management</field><field name="subject">formal methods</field><field name="subject">Sum specification language</field><field name="subject">Z specification language</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157953</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterization of a Newly Identified Human Rhinovirus: HRV-QPM</field><field name="creator">Mr Peter Mcerlean</field><field name="description" /><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Rhinovirus,&#160;respiratory&#160;illness,&#160;picornavirus,&#160;in&#160;silico&#160;analysis.&#160;</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159338</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The limits of liberal justice: Normative constraints on multicultural policies and indigenous policies in Australia</field><field name="creator">Antal, Ildiko Barbara</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the question of the extent to which theories of citizenship, especially as developed in political liberalism, help to formulate an understanding of cultural diversity in relation to political stability and justice.

The principal aim is to establish that political liberalism provides appropriate political and ethical norms for adjudicating multicultural and indigenous rights claims. Thus, the exposition is twofold: first the thesis explores the concepts of justice as fairness as expounded in Rawlsian political liberalism.

When these wastewaters are treated in an anaerobic system like prefermentors or anaerobic digesters the sulphate is reduced to sulphide by sulphate reducing bacteria (SRB). The presence of sulphate reduction is not desirable as it may reduce methane yield due to partial substrate utilisation by SRB, causes system toxicity and the production of malodor H2S in the gas phase. In this thesis, the effects of operational conditions on sulphate transformation and assimilation was studied in a laboratory scale anaerobic wastewater treatment system. The laboratory scale system consisted of two reactors the first one a well-mixed fermentor (referred to as an acidogenic reactor) and the second an expanded granular sludge blanket reactor (referred to as a methanogenic reactor) with pH and temperature control. Two sets of studies were performed; in the first set both reactors were connected serially to represent a two-stage high-rate anaerobic treatment system. The system was fed molasses and operated at temperature of 35oC. The acidogenic reactor was controlled at pH of 6 while the methanogenic reactor was controlled at pH of 7.2 by automatic addition of caustic. In the second set of experiments only the first reactor was used to represent a prefermentor and the first stage of the two stage. The reactor was fed with glucose at various concentrations, operated at pH of 6 and temperature of 35oC. Information gained from these studies was encapsulated in a mathematical model to describe sulphate reduction in anaerobic treatment systems. This model was also validated using data generated from the experiments. The experimental study showed that &#183; At low sulphate concentrations of about 250 mg.L-1 and COD concentration of 10,000 mg.L-1 in feed, relatively high percentage (up to 35 %) of produced sulphide was assimilated by biomass, while the rest of the sulphur was distributed as unconverted sulphate, dissolved sulphide, H2S gas and to a lesser extent as metallic sulphide precipitates. &#183; The major electron donor for sulphate reduction in both the acidogenic and the methanogenic reactor was hydrogen gas. Therefore, sulphate reduction not only competed with hydrogen utilising methanogens for the available hydrogen, but also changed the distributions of organic acids, which were directly or indirectly influenced by the H2 partial pressure. &#183; Sulphide concentrations of up to 6.5 mM free hydrogen sulphide) at pH of 7.2 was not inhibitory to methanogens &#183; Sulphate reducing bacteria were able to grow even at a low hydraulic retention time of 1.2 hours in the well-mixed acidogenic reactor. It was estimated that the maximum specific growth rate (m) and half saturation constant (ks) of SRB was 1.31 h-1 and 3.8 mg S.L-1, respectively. These values were higher than those reported in literature. &#183; Sulphate reduction was suppressed at high concentration of carbon in the feed. Accumulation of high concentration of volatile organic acids at high feed-carbon concentrations had little effect on sulphate reduction. However, extent of sulphate reduction had a negative correlation with total concentration of biomass. A non-competitive biomass inhibition function was proposed to model the correlation. From this fit it was estimated that a biomass concentration of about 3300 mg-COD.L-1 will completely inhibit sulphate reduction. &#183; Sulphate reduction was affected by redox potential control and pH in the acidogenic reactor. High pH and low redox potential values were essential for sulphate reduction to proceed. At redox potential control of -300 mV, sulphate reduction was inhibited more at pH of 6 than it was at pH of 7. At redox potential values of -250 mV or higher, about 90 % inhibition of sulphate reduction was observed at both pH of 6 and 7. An existing model describing carbohydrate degradation was extended to include sulphate reduction processes. Despite experimentally observing that sulphate reduction only took place from hydrogen, all possible substrates for sulphate reducion was considered. These included: lactic acid, butyric acid, propionic acid, acetic acid and hydrogen. Kinetic parameters for sulphate reduction processes were obtained from documented literature. Inhibition of sulphate reduction by biomass and sulphur assimilation by biomass were included in the model. A new approach to calculate caustic consumption at given pH values was also included. A modification to hydrogen regulation function was also made to better predict product distributions as a function of gas-phase hydrogen concentration. Model validation was performed using data from dynamic experiments. Comparison to actual data was undertaken on several key variables in the acidogenic and methanogenic reactors such as: organic acid concentrations, gas compositions, gas production rates, sulphate and sulphide concentrations and caustic consumption rates. The model satisfactorily predicted sulphate and sulphide concentrations in both reactors. However, discrepancy between predicted and experimental data on organic carbon concentrations was seen, especially during organic carbon concentration step changes.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">L</field><field name="subject">290700 Resources Engineering</field><field name="subject">760200 Environmental and Resource Evaluation</field><field name="subject">sulphate reduction</field><field name="subject">anaerobic digestion</field><field name="subject">high-rate reactor</field><field name="subject">acidification</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157916</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Limitations to plant root growth in highly saline and alkaline bauxite residue</field><field name="creator">Kopittke, Peter Martin</field><field name="description">Revegetation of bauxite residue is hampered by a lack of understanding of the limitations imposed on plant growth in highly saline and alkaline growth mediums. In this study, several of these growth limiting factors were investigated. The toxicity of the hydroxyl ion (OH-) was examined using a solution culture system developed to allow studies at high pH without nutritional limitations. Also using this solution culture system, the effect of the high Na and Mg concentrations of bauxite residue on the Ca nutrition of plants was investigated. As the toxicity of Al at high pH is not known, a study was conducted to examine the rhizotoxicity of aluminate (Al(OH)4-) and polycationic Al at high pH. The ability of plant roots to reduce rhizosphere pH in bauxite residue was also considered. A novel gypsum application method was assessed for its efficiency at improving the Ca status of bauxite residue. Manual adjustment, ion exchange resins and automated titration were examined for their suitability for nutrient solution pH control in alkaline conditions. For short-term studies, it was found that a solution without supply of Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn, and aerated with CO2 depleted air, greatly reduced nutrient precipitation at high pH, thus eliminating nutritional differences between treatments. Manual pH adjustment and the use of ion exchange resins as pH buffers were unsuitable methods of pH control. In contrast, pH control by automated titration had little effect on solution composition while maintaining constant pH. The solution culture system was used to examine OH- toxicity in mungbeans (Vigna radiata (L.) Wilczek cv. Emerald), with root length reduced at a bulk solution pH of 8.5 and greater. The effect of Ca activity ratio (CAR) and pH on Ca uptake by mungbeans and Rhodes grass (Chloris gayana cv. Pioneer) in Na dominated solution cultures and in soil was investigated. Changes in pH in the alkaline range were shown to have no effect on the critical CAR of 0.024 (corresponding to 90 % relative root length) for mungbeans grown in solution culture. Results from soil grown mungbeans confirmed those from solution culture, with a critical CAR of 0.025. A critical CAR of 0.034 was also established for soil grown Rhodes grass. However, using dilute nutrient solutions dominated by Mg at pH 9.0, root growth was found to be more limited than had been observed for Na solutions, with growth reduced beneath a critical CAR of 0.050. Using a CAR equation modified with plasma membrane binding constants (to incorporate the differing antagonistic effects of Mg and Na), new critical CAR values were calculated for Na (0.56) and Mg (0.44) dominated solutions. This modified CAR equation permits the calculation of CAR irrespective of the dominant salt present. Solubilities of various gypsum sources and size fractions in seawater were studied to investigate the effectiveness of gypsum addition to the residue sand pipeline, rather than as a direct field application. The dissolution rate constant varied with gypsum source (analytical grade (AR) &gt; phosphogypsum (PG) &gt; mined gypsum (MG)) due to reactivity and surface area differences, generally reaching saturation within 15 s (AR) to 30 min (MG &gt; 2.0). The ability of bauxite residue to remove Ca from solution (due to cation exchange and precipitation) was also examined; the quantity of the total solution Ca adsorbed was found to be small (5 %). These low rates of solution Ca adsorption, comparatively rapid dissolution rates, and long pumping times (20 min), preclude the application of gypsum to the residue sand/seawater slurry as a method for residue amelioration. Dilute, alkaline (pH 9.5) nutrient solutions were used to investigate the effects of aluminate (Al(OH)4-) on mungbean root growth. Although root growth in Al(OH)4- solutions was slightly limited, the symptoms associated with this growth reduction were observed to be similar to those caused by the Al13 polycation at concentrations lower than that which can be detected. Also, when roots displaying these symptoms were transferred to fresh Al(OH)4- solutions, no root tip lesions were observed, and root hair growth on the lateral roots improved. Thus, Al(OH)4- is considered to be non-toxic, with the observed reduction in root growth in solutions containing Al(OH)4- due to the gradual formation of toxic Al13 in the bulk nutrient solution resulting from the acidification of the alkaline nutrient solution by the plant roots. The effect of Mn deficiency in Rhodes grass and of legume inoculation in lucerne (Medicago sativa L. cv. Hunter River), on the rhizosphere pH of plants grown in highly alkaline bauxite residue was investigated. In response to Mn deficiency in residue sand, Rhodes grass was observed to increase acidification of its rhizosphere (being up to 1.22 pH units lower than the bulk soil). Due to its ability to fix atmospheric N2 rather than relying on soil N (NO3-) reserves, inoculated lucerne (1.75 pH unit decrease) was also found to acidify its rhizosphere to a greater extent than non-inoculated lucerne (1.16 pH unit decrease).</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300804 Environmental Impact Assessment</field><field name="subject">770806 Remnant vegetation and protected conservation areas</field><field name="subject">Aluminate toxicity</field><field name="subject">alkalinity</field><field name="subject">salinity</field><field name="subject">rhizosphere pH</field><field name="subject">gypsum dissolution</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157976</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Numerical Methods in Reaction Rate Theory</field><field name="creator">Frankcombe, Terry James</field><field name="description">Numerical methods are often required to solve chemical problems, either to verify theoretical models or to access information that is not readily available experimentally.

The design of industrial flotation plants is a complex process involving many stages. Current design practice involves performing laboratory scale grinding and batch flotation tests, followed by a circuit design based on the scale-up of the laboratory kinetics and recovery-grade data. A pilot plant is then operated to evaluate the performance of the circuit based on recovery and grade, usually in the configuration of the intended full-scale plant. The circuit design is refined and economically evaluated after which the design of the full-scale plant is performed. A new approach to full-scale flotation plant design has been proposed by the Julius Kruttschnitt Mineral Research Centre and the Mineral Processing Research Unit of the University of Cape Town, as part of the Australian Minerals Industries Research Association (AMIRA) P9 Project. In this new methodology, the effects of the ore on plant performance are decoupled from the circuit effects. The ore properties are characterised by operating the pilot plant in as simple a configuration as possible. The pilot plant units are configured to perform a similar duty (in terms of mineral content and particle size) to the full-scale operation and their response measured. An important factor in the success of the methodology is having a pilot plant that is capable of accurately characterising the ore properties. For this purpose, the Wemco&#174; Floatability Characterisation Test Rig (FCTR) was built. The FCTR is a self-contained, highly instrumented mobile pilot plant designed to develop and validate the new flotation plant design methodology. The aims of this thesis were to propose, develop and validate a methodology for using the FCTR to design industrial flotation plants. The hypothesis was that full-scale flotation plant design could be accurately performed using the P9 flotation model and modelling and scale-up methodologies, in conjunction with the FCTR. Test work was performed in three main areas: calibration of the ore characteristics and model parameters for the flotation model currently used by the AMIRA P9 Project; validation of the flotation model and modelling methodology; and prediction of full-scale plant performance using parameters determined on the FCTR. The ore floatability characteristics were calibrated using four FCTR circuits of increasing complexity. The ore floatability characteristics were determined for various models derived from data from one, two, three and four calibration circuits. Validation of the flotation model and modelling methodology was performed using three validation methods: internal validity tests, parameter sensitivity tests and predictive validation. From the internal validity tests, some of the models did not meet the validation criteria. The parameter sensitivity tests used Monte Carlo simulations to determine the sensitivity of the regressed model parameters. The tests produced small differences in the values determined from the models and the average values from the Monte Carlo simulations. The floatability characteristics appeared to be stable and unique. Predictive validation was performed using five FCTR circuits, different in configuration to the calibration circuits. The predictive validation was performed using the floatability characteristics determined from each of the calibration models, in conjunction with estimates of the model parameters. Overall, the predictions of the circuit performance were accurate and within experimental standard deviations for most streams in the circuits. The predictions of the key parameters of pentlandite and chalcopyrite recovery were accurate, especially for the final concentrate. The prediction of pyrrhotite recovery produced the largest errors. The prediction of pyrrhotite recovery appeared to be dependent on the addition of depressant to the cleaner and recleaner circuits of the circuit to be predicted. When the depressant addition rates were significantly different from those used in the calibration circuits, the prediction of pyrrhotite recovery was inaccurate. These errors were however reduced when experimental water recovery values were used. The extensive and robust validation of the flotation model and modelling methodology has shown that the flotation model and modelling methodology are valid under certain conditions. This test work represents the first comprehensive validation of the flotation model and modelling methodology incorporating changes in circuit configuration. Using the proposed modelling and scale-up methodology in conjunction with the FCTR, the metallurgical performance of three industrial flotation circuits were predicted. The predicted results were then compared to the experimentally determined results around the industrial circuits. In each case, a scale-up factor between the ore floatability characteristics determined on the FCTR, and the full-scale floatability characteristics, was required to achieve an accurate prediction. The scale-up factor ranged from 0.17 to 0.97 for the case studies investigated. In light of the results from each stage of test work, the proposed flotation plant design methodology was refined. With this methodology and the continual development of techniques for the measurement and prediction of the P9 flotation model parameters, accurate industrial plant design using the FCTR will become possible. With the addition of other unit operations, such as comminution, into the flowsheet, this methodology will eventually lead to the achievement of the ultimate goal of accurate plant design of green-field sites.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">290702 Mineral Processing</field><field name="subject">091404 Mineral Processing/Beneficiation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158278</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Froth recovery measurements in large industrial flotation cells</field><field name="creator">Alexander, Daniel John</field><field name="description">The role of mathematical models and simulators in describing the performance of mineral processing applications have had a large impact in optimising existing industrial plants and designing new plants over recent years. Before the development of sophisticated computer simulators, the design engineer used industrial &#8220;rules of thumb&#8221; to estimate the size and layout of plants. However, newly designed plants after commissioning, often do not meet the design product specification requirements and quite often years of &#8220;trial and error&#8221; optimisation is required. This process can be very costly especially with froth flotation processes where the complexity of the various stages of treatment makes &#8220;trial and error&#8221; optimisation very difficult to quantify and assess the benefits. Over the past 10 years, advances in the modelling of the flotation process have been conducted by many authors. The most significant flotation modelling advances in recent years have been provided by the AMIRA (Australian Mineral Industry Research Association) P9 project, whereby a new modelling methodology has been proposed. Within this methodology, the flotation response can be represented by a number of sub-processes including parameters describing the hydrodynamic, froth and ore characteristics. Although these parameters have been proposed, methods for measuring these parameters in large flotation cells are still developing, especially in the areas of the froth zone recovery and entrainment. In the light of this it was felt that the literature on froth recovery determination should be investigated to determine the most appropriate method for measuring froth recovery in large industrial flotation cells. It was found after the investigation of the literature that three techniques for measuring the froth recovery parameter stood out as potential methods for measurement within a large scale flotation cell. These were the methods decribed by Gorain et al (1998), Vera et al (1999) and Savassi et al (1997). It was decided that all three methods should be assessed on a quantitative and qualitative basis from data collected at the Mount Isa Mines (now Xstrata) Copper flotation circuit. In this assessment, all three methods were extensively trialed in a 2.8 m3 flotation cell which was operated in parallel to the main copper rougher flotation circuit. The cell could be operated at numerous operating conditions which allowed sufficient data to be collected. The conclusions from this work were that although the method proposed by Vera et al (1999) required significant amounts of data, the method appeared to be reliable in this scale of cell. The main recommendation from this work was to further test the Vera methodology in larger industrial flotation cells. A 100 m3 Outukumpu tank cell at the Mount Keith Nickel Concentrator was chosen for the further assessment of the Vera et al (1999) methodology and its applicability to large scale cells. This flotation cell was one of the largest flotation cells operating on a production scale at the time of the testwork. Numerous tests were conducted and data collected from this investigation showed that the Vera et al (1999) technique was applicable to this scale of flotation cell. Since the work at Mount Keith was conducted in a rougher flotation cell, it was decided to test the methodology with numerous cells of various sizes and duties at the Kambalda Nickel Concentrator. As with the previous investigation at Mount Keith, it was observed that the Vera method was able to measure froth recoveries in all cells measured at Kambalda (within typical operating ranges). However, the technique was not applicable at shallow froth depths since it does not take into account the effect of the pulp-froth interface within the froth recovery parameter estimation. The pulp froth interface and close to it is where a significant proportion of dropback occurs within the froth zone. In addition to this problem, the methodology required large numbers of samples and disturbed downstream processes which made the technique unpractical for operating industrial flotation plants. Hence, a new technique for measuring froth recovery in large flotation cells was required. For the technique to be successful on an industrial scale it required the following: &#8226; minimum disturbance on the process, &#8226; take into account the pulp froth interface within the froth recovery parameter, and &#8226; require a minimum amount of samples. To meet these needs a new technique was developed based on the Savassi et al (1997) technique and combining it with recent work by authors including Vera et al (2003). The methodology involves taking samples of the feed, concentrate and tail as per a typical flotation survey and combining them with two new samples: the air hold-up sample and the top of froth sample. With the addition of these samples, a mass balance across the pulp and froth phase could be conducted and the froth recovery parameter derived. In addition, the new method provided measurements of the pulp zone average bubble load and the amount recovered by the entrainment mechanism. The proposed method has a simple procedure which allows the technique to be used by academics and mill operators alike. The proposed froth recovery measurement technique was tested in numerous cells of various types (i.e. Wemco, Outokumpu, Dorr-Oliver etc), various sizes (up to 150 m3 in size), various duties (rougher, scavenger, cleaner, recleaner, etc) and various plants. In most cases the methodology proved to be a reliable measure of the froth recovery parameter. In addition, at the Century Zinc Operation, the methodology was compared directly with the original Vera et al (1999) technique and the results showed that there was a good comparison between the results with the off-set of the pulp-froth interface. A number of contributions to both the research and industrial areas have been provided from the outcomes of the thesis. The main contributions include: &#8226; A full assessment of the three current methods for measuring the froth recovery parameter within large flotation cells. With recommendations of developing a new technique. &#8226; The development of a froth recovery measurement technique which can be used in large cells to understand the impact of the froth zone in an individual cell, use within the AMIRA P9 modelling methodology and plant diagnostics. &#8226; The new method also allows the estimation of the average bubble load and quantifies the amount of material recovered by the entrainment mechanism which is invaluable to metallurgists in assessing the performance of a flotation circuit (plant diagnostics). Finally, the results of this thesis will provide practising metallurgists both within the research and operating fields, techniques to improve the profitability of flotation circuits worldwide. Metallurgists can quickly assess the performance of large flotation cells in terms of froth performance, bubble load and entrainment which has not been available before. In addition, the results from this thesis will also allow metallurgists to mathematically represent their plant through flotation models better and improve their understanding of their flotation circuits.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">091404 Mineral Processing/Beneficiation</field><field name="subject">840399 First Stage Treatment of Ores and Minerals not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158425</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multidimensional viscous flows at superorbital speeds</field><field name="creator">Silvester, Todd</field><field name="description">A combined experimental and numerical study of multidimensional viscous flows at speeds exceeding 8 km/s is reported. Experiments were performed in the X3 superorbital expansion tube with air and nitrogen test flows at a Mach number and total enthalpy of 10 and 40 MJ/kg, respectively. Laminar skin friction, heat flux and pressure measurements were obtained at regular intervals along one wall of a rectangular duct. The spatial resolution of the transducers was chosen to capture the multidimensional flow phenomena within the duct. Quasi-steady flow periods were established along the entire length of the duct in the test times offered by the expansion tube. Direct skin friction measurements were accomplished through the use of &#145;in house&#146; acceleration compensated transducers. The successful operation of these skin friction transducers in a high performance expansion tube was demonstrated. Furthermore, the systematic uncertainty in measured shear stress was significantly reduced with the development of a new pressure calibration technique. For the conditions tested, Reynolds analogy was shown to be valid to within experimental uncertainty. The experimental data was in excellent agreement with numerical estimates. Three-dimensional numerical simulations of the diverging duct revealed that the flowfield structure in the vicinity of the corners differs from that of an unbounded corner or a constant area duct. Real gas effects other than those present in the residual nonequilibrium levels of freestream dissociation were negligible for the conditions tested. A computational study of two waverider configurations recently tested in the X3 superorbital expansion tube was conducted to assist in the interpretation of past results. The off-design aerodynamic performance was also analyzed and showed that blunting the leading edges dramatically degraded the performance by increasing drag and decreasing lift for the conditions considered.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">780102 Physical sciences</field><field name="subject">290207 Satellite, Space Vehicle and Missile Design</field><field name="subject">viscous flows</field><field name="subject">expansion tubes</field><field name="subject">hypervelocity</field><field name="subject">skin friction</field><field name="subject">Reynolds analogy</field><field name="subject">CFD</field><field name="subject">real gas effects</field><field name="subject">multidimensional flows</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158032</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bivalves and the Bucephalidae: A parasitic system on the Great Barrier Reef</field><field name="creator">Bott, Nathan James</field><field name="description">This study set out to examine, for the first time, both the molluscan intermediate and the teleost definitive hosts of a major assemblage of trematode parasites present on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). The parasite taxon was the Bucephalidae which occur in piscivorous fishes as sexually reproducing adults and in bivalves as asexually reproducing stages. The goal was to characterise the overall richness of the system and to explore patterns of host-specificity. Because of the size of this fauna it was not possible to incorporate all the taxa found in this study. This thesis reports the results of a survey of bivalves from this region, taxonomic studies on several elements of the fauna of fishes, and efforts to link life-cycles between bivalves and fishes. I surveyed 2256 bivalve individuals (47 species, 17 families) from South-east Queensland, Heron Island (southern GBR) and Lizard Island (northern GBR). Infections of trematode species from three families, Bucephalidae, Gorgoderidae and Monorchiidae, were found. Overall prevalence of infection was 2.3%. The Bucephalidae (11 species) was the most commonly found family. A single gorgoderid infection was found from a venerid, Lioconcha castrensis. This is the first report of a gorgoderid from a marine bivalve and phylogenetic analysis suggests that the species belongs to the Gorgoderinae. Monorchiids (5 species) were found from Tellinidae and Lucinidae. All infections are new host/parasite records. I deduce that this study produced lifecycle information, but no actual identifications, for 10% of the species of trematodes that infect bivalves of Queensland marine waters. Prosorhynchoides apogonis n. sp. is described from the intestine of the apogonid Cheilodipterus macrodon from the southern GBR. This is the first bucephalid to be described from the teleost family Apogonidae. Prosorhynchoides lamprelli n. sp. is described from the intestine of the carangid Caranx papuensis from off Lizard Island, GBR. This is the first bucephalid to be described from Caranx papuensis. A new trematode genus, Grammatorcynicola n. g. (Dolichoenterinae), and two new species, G. brayi n. sp. and G. nolani n. sp., are described from the intestines of the scombrids, Grammatorcynus bicarinatus and Gr. bilineatus respectively. Grammatorcynicola n. g. differs from other dolichoenterine genera in having a simple sucker-like rhynchus, the ovary anterior to the testes and by not having a particularly thick cirrus-sac wall. Six new species of bucephalid trematodes from the prosorhynchine bucephalid genera Prosorhynchus Odhner, 1905 and Neidhartia Nagaty, 1937 are reported from the epinepheline serranid genera Cephalopholis, Cromileptes, Epinephelus and Variola from the GBR. Two species of Prosorhynchus and one Neidhartia are reported from Epinephelus spp., P. jexi n. sp. from E. quoyanus, P. lafii n. sp. from E. fuscoguttatus, and N. epinepheli n. sp. from E. maculatus. The other species are P. robertsthomsoni n. sp. from several species of Cephalopholis, P. conorjonesi n. sp. from Cromileptes altivelis, and P. milleri n. sp. from Variola louti. I examined three species of Plectropomus (Serranidae: Epinephelinae), Pl. laevis, Pl. leopardus and Pl. maculatus from off Heron Island and Lizard Island on the GBR. Nine bucephalid species from the Prosorhynchinae were found, three species of Neidhartia and six species of Prosorhynchus. The three species of Neidhartia, N. haywardi n. sp., N. plectropomi n. sp. and N. tyleri n. sp., are readily distinguishable by morphology. Two of the six species of Prosorhynchus (P. lesteri n. sp. and P. wrightae n. sp.) are easily distinguished from their other congeners by morphology but the other four species (P. adlardi n. sp., P. heronensis n. sp., P. munozae n. sp. and P. plectropomi n. sp.) are highly similar in morphology and were only distinguished convincingly by comparing their ITS2 rDNA sequences. Both P. adlardi n. sp. and P. wrightae n. sp. have also been found once in V. louti at Lizard Island. This is also the first study to identify life-cycle matches of the Bucephalidae using molecular techniques. I found two perfect life-cycle matches (identical sequences). The bivalve host of Prosorhynchoides lamprelli is a tellinid, Exotica clathrata; Rhipidocotyle sp. from the sphyraenid Sphyraena jello also has E. clathrata as its first intermediate host. Bayesian Inference Analysis shows that all seven species from bivalves that were sequenced belong to the Bucephalinae. Perhaps the most striking finding of the study was that one bivalve species, E. clathrata, was shown to harbour four separate species. Matching of ITS2 rDNA sequences between life-cycle stages is highly effective in circumstances of great richness such as the Great Barrier Reef. Based on my data collected, the total bucephalid species in the system is estimated to be 84.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300508 Parasitology</field><field name="subject">780105 Biological sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158287</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Handwriting of eight year old children with and without autistic spectrum disorder</field><field name="creator">Cartmill, Linda Joan</field><field name="description">Anecdotally it was found that Queensland occupational therapists reported a surprisingly high referral rate for handwriting problems amongst school aged children with Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD). A subsequent review of the literature revealed a number of anecdotal reports of disordered handwriting in this population but limited research in the area. This thesis presents a descriptive and exploratory study of the nature of handwriting in eight year old children with and without ASD. Issues of handwriting development and motor learning are canvassed followed by an examination of concepts of motor control. Next follows a review of current handwriting models. The Systems Model of Handwriting was proposed as a response to the evidence for both dynamic and motor programme aspects of handwriting. Using this model as an organizing structure, the literature on ASD and handwriting was then examined which led to the framing of three research questions: 1. Is the handwriting speed of children with ASD significantly different from that of children without ASD? 2. Is the handwriting legibility of children with ASD significantly different from that of children without ASD? 3. At what stage/s of the Sequential Handwriting Process, is the handwriting of children with ASD different from that of children without ASD? Twenty-eight eight year old children with ASD and a matched control group of twentyeight comparison children were recruited from state primary schools in Brisbane and surrounding areas. These fifty-six children were assessed on thirteen handwriting process variables and two handwriting outcome variables in order to answer the research questions. Data produced were analyzed primarily with t-tests for between group differences and by examination of correlations between process and outcome variables. Small but measurable differences were found in both speed and legibility between the two groups, with the handwriting of the children with ASD being both less legible (t=- 2.47, df=54, p=0.02) and slower (t=-2.47, df=54, p=0.02). Accuracy of letter formation was also found to be significantly worse for the children with ASD compared to children in the control group (t=3.53, df=54, p=0.001). Further, the two groups were found to differ in some aspects of the Sequential Handwriting Process. Specifically, the children with ASD showed significant correlations between legibility and Perceiving, Conceptualizing and Planning stages, while the comparison children showed significant correlations between legibility and Interpreting, Conceptualizing, Planning and Activating stages. Only one process variable (consistency of letter formation) showed a moderate correlation with handwriting speed &#150; all other variables were of only slight to fair strength. Finally, the implications of the research findings are discussed, limitations described and directions for future research canvassed. As a result of the present study, a revised Systems Model of Handwriting is proposed. Several recommendations for occupational therapy intervention in handwriting practices in the classroom are made, notably: clear and focussed initial tuition of letter formation and secondly, the development of automaticity of the handwriting skill.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158068</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Implications of Adult Attachment Theory for Chronic Pain</field><field name="creator">Meredith, Pamela Joy</field><field name="description">This thesis presents empirical evidence supporting the relevance of adult attachment theory in understanding the chronic pain experience. The thesis arose from the recognition that, although pain-related psychosocial variables have been used to differentiate subgroups of individuals in chronic pain, little is known about the developmental origins or cognitive, behavioural, or affective correlates of these subgroups. Attachment theory offers a development framework, which is of potential value in guiding early pain intervention and prevention efforts, as well as tailoring interventions to suit specific patient needs. In order to investigate the value of applying adult attachment theory to the chronic pain field, five central research questions were identified: 1) Does insecure attachment contribute to a more negative experience of acute pain for those not diagnosed with a chronic pain condition? That is, does the association between insecure attachment and maladaptive pain-related variables precede the onset of chronic pain)? 2) How do the subgroups of adult attachment, identified in a chronic pain sample, compare to the clusters identified by pain-related psychosocial measures in the same sample? 3) Are the documented associations between attachment and psychosocial variables (i.e., cognitive appraisals, self-efficacy, coping, social support) evident in the context of chronic pain? 4) Do attachment variables moderate the associations between these psychosocial variables and painrelated variables?, and 5) What is the association between adult attachment variables and outcomes from chronic pain rehabilitation programs? To address the first question, an experimental study was designed to explore the perceptions, emotions and coping patterns of 58 pain-free individuals exposed to an acute (coldpressor) pain experience. Findings revealed that higher levels of anxiety over relationships were associated with lower pain thresholds, more stress, depression and anxiety, diminished perceptions of control over pain, and diminished ability to decrease pain. More secure attachment, on the other hand, was associated with greater perceptions of control over pain, and lower levels of depression and catastrophizing. In order to explore research questions 2-5, data from two clinical samples were collected on the first and last days of participation in one of two chronic pain rehabilitation programs (program length varied from two to three weeks). A total of 152 participants completed questionnaires before treatment, with 100 of these participants also completing questionnaires after treatment. Participants were aged between 18 and 82 years (M = 38.8, SD = 12.4), and had been in pain for an average of 3.7 years (SD = 6.9). Approximately 41% of participants were women, and 58% were men (gender for one participant was unknown). In order to address question two regarding the similarity between adult attachment subgroups and pain clusters based on a psychosocial pain measure (Multidimensional Pain Inventory, MPI), pre-treatment data were analyzed. The clustering approach using the MPI, known as Multiaxial Assessment of Pain (MAP), identifies three subgroups of individuals, labeled interpersonally distressed, dysfunctional, and adaptive copers. These clusters were compared with the four subgroups and two dimensions obtained with adult attachment measures. Results revealed that the interpersonally distressed MAP subgroup was associated with fearful attachment, while the dysfunctional MAP subgroup was linked with avoidant (low comfort) attachment. The comfort attachment dimension was associated with more adaptive MPI variables, while the anxious attachment dimension was linked with more maladaptive MPI variables. Consideration of research questions three to five prompted development of an integrative model, the Attachment-Diathesis Model of Chronic Pain (ADMCP), which provided a framework for exploring the psychosocial mechanisms linking attachment security with the outcome variables of perceived pain intensity, disability, and treatment outcomes. Based on predictions emerging from this model, a set of five studies explored pre-treatment associations between adult attachment variables, six psychosocial mechanisms (pain appraisal, depression, pain self-efficacy, anxiety, perceptions of social support, and coping), and outcome variables pre-treatment. One further paper was devoted to implications of adult attachment for treatment outcome. In general, findings from these studies revealed that variables representing attachment insecurity were significantly associated with more maladaptive coping, cognitive, affective and interpersonal characteristics, both before and after treatment, compared to variables reflecting secure attachment. Overall, both securely and insecurely attached individuals made progress in response to pain rehabilitation. Finally, a summary of the evidence of associations between attachment variables, psychosocial mechanisms, and treatment outcomes revealed by this research is presented, permitting discussion regarding the explanatory value of the ADMCP and clinical implications. Limitations to the present research, including family-wise error, the use of self-report measures, and the self-selecting nature of the sample, are discussed, and directions for further research are proposed. The evidence presented in this thesis advances our understanding of the developmental origins of chronic pain conditions, and provides a lens through which to view the heterogeneity of people with chronic pain. Overall, this project highlights the value of applying adult attachment principles to this field. It is anticipated that findings will assist in the development of a more differentiated range of treatment approaches for the individuals who experience chronic pain. In addition, the findings of this project may have important implications for prevention and early intervention of these conditions.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158257</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Water Movement in Unsaturated Concrete: Theory, Experiments, Models</field><field name="creator">Leech, Craig Anthony</field><field name="description">Prediction of contaminant transport in concrete subjected to short cyclical wetting and drying processes is integrally bound to prediction of the moisture flux. The concrete is unsaturated and the non-linear contaminant and moisture fluxes are not described by simple constant diffusion methods. This thesis presents, and partially justifies, a thermodynamic model for prediction of moisture movement in concrete, at all moisture contents commonly encountered. The wetting process is examined with Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) images during a simple absorption (sorptivity) experiment. Diffusivity functions are derived via a novel analytical approach and a universal diffusivity is suggested. Water sorption and desorption isotherms are measured on large concrete samples. van Genuchten&#146;s retention function is successfully used to model the results. The unrelia-bility of the water sorption method at high moisture contents is illustrated by comparison with Mercury Intrusion Porosimetry (MIP). The BJH method is exploited to provide a methodology for estimating the water sorption isotherm from MIP. Mualem&#146;s conductivity model is assessed with the water retention and NMR results. This thorough validation of the model yields a tortuosity parameter that is different to that commonly assumed. An analytical relationship between the sorptivity and the saturated permeability suggests the experimental the long-term unsaturated permeability overesti-mates the unsaturated conductivity function, and as such should be used judiciously when predicting unsaturated flow processes. Mualem&#146;s conductivity model is further exploited to provide unsaturated air and vapour functions that are experimentally justified. The thermodynamic description of water movement and the hydraulic functions that are developed in the thesis are incorporated into T r inCet , a transient heat and mass trans-fer model based on the Finite Element Method (FEM). The complex coupled behaviour of air, liquid, vapour and temperature are well handled under a variety of common cyclical boundary conditions. The thesis presents all necessary experimental results required for validation of a com-plex, but easily described, model for moisture movement. It covers disparate ground to provide a powerful numerical model of unsaturated moisture movement in concrete under short-term cyclical processes.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">291100 Environmental Engineering</field><field name="subject">680299 Other</field><field name="subject">sorptivity</field><field name="subject">NMR</field><field name="subject">concrete</field><field name="subject">water retention</field><field name="subject">moisture</field><field name="subject">MIP</field><field name="subject">unsaturated</field><field name="subject">permeability</field><field name="subject">numerical</field><field name="subject">FEM</field><field name="subject">water</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157970</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sensitivity of bovine morulae and blastocysts to heat shock in vitro</field><field name="creator">Naik, Veena</field><field name="description">Bovine pre-implantation embryos are sensitive to high temperatures. The hyperthermia resulting from maternal heat stress leads to an increased loss of early stage embryos. The effects of hyperthermia appear to be more pronounced in the zygote than blastocyst stages. There is also evidence to suggest that B. indicus embryos show better resistance to heat shock as compared to B. taurus embryos. The mechanism of thermotolerance in B. indicus embryos is unknown and it is also unclear if the thermotolerance of these embryos is a result of maternal or paternal contributions. There is also evidence to suggest that male embryos survive heat shock better than female embryos. This research therefore aimed 1. To examine the effect of heat shock on day-7 bovine embryos 2. To study the influence of maternal and paternal genotype on the embryo's ability to survive up to 48 hours post heat shock treatment 3. To study the expression of HSP70 in heat-shocked and non-heat shocked embryos and compare B. indicus and B. taurus embryos. 4. To compare the effects of heat shock on rapidly developing (day-6 morulae) and slowly developing (day-7 morulae) embryos to heat shock treatments 5. To determine the effect of heat shock on the sex ratio of the surviving embryos The work described in this thesis used an in vitro protocol for heat shock studies on embryos, based on observed in vivo rectal temperature fluctuations in heat stressed cows. The first study examined the effects of heat shock on embryos at the morula or blastocyst stage on day 7 of in vitro culture. The embryos were produced in vitro from oocytes collected from ovaries of either pure breed B. indicus or B. taurus and fertilised by frozen semen straws of either B. indicus or B. taurus bulls. Day-7 morulae or blastocysts were used for the study. The embryos were subjected to heat shock (HS) (41.5&amp;degC) or non-heat shock (NHS) (39&amp;degC) temperatures. Embryo survival and development 48 hours (48 h) post treatment were recorded. The data were analysed using binary logistic regression using logit link function to determine the Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence limits for individual factors. The variables used as factors in the analysis were replicate, heat shock, maternal genotype (B. indicus vs B. taurus), paternal genotype (B. indicus vs B. taurus) and stage at which heat shock was applied (morula or blastocyst). The outcome variables used for analysis were the number of viable embryos from the total treated and the proportion reaching expanded or hatched blastocyst stage, and the proportion of male embryos. Heat shock significantly reduced the probability of embryo survival by more than half (OR = 0.47; P &#8804; 0.001) and reduced the probability of the embryo's progression to the expanded or hatched blastocyst stage by almost half (OR = 0.58; P = 0.005) as compared to NHS embryos. The probability of survival of embryos with B. indicus paternal genotype (confounded by the use of a single sire) was double (OR = 2.00; P = 0.002) that of embryos with B. taurus paternal genotype. The heat shock x paternal B. indicus genotype interaction was found to be non-significant. Maternal B. indicus genotype showed no influence on thermotolerance. Nevertheless, the probability of progression to expanded blastocysts for embryos with maternal B. indicus genotypes was double (OR = 2.05; P = 0.030) that of embryos with maternal B. taurus genotype. Comparison of day-7 morulae with day-7 blastocysts showed that the probability of day-7 blastocysts surviving until 48 h after treatment was almost two and half times greater (OR = 2.39; P &#8804; 0.001). The probability of survival of a blastocyst with paternal B. indicus genotype was almost twice (OR = 1.95; P = 0.041) when compared to a blastocyst with B. taurus paternal genotype. The interaction term of heat shock &#215; blastocyst stage was found to be significant (OR = 2.70; P = 0.038) indicating that blastocyst stage embryos were resistant to heat shock. The study showed a trend towards survival of more male embryos (61% males vs 39% females) under heat shock conditions (OR = 1.64; P = 0.070) indicating that male embryos may be resistant to heat shock. The second study was designed to detect the induced form of HSP70 in heat shocked and non-heat shocked day-7 bovine embryos and to compare the patterns between B. indicus embryos and B. taurus embryos. Comparison of confocal images showed that staining for HSP70 was present in most embryos whether heat shocked or not and found to be concentrated in the nuclei and cytoplasm. Heat shock appears to have increased HSP70 staining intensity in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, suggesting increased expression of HSP70 after heat shock. The same general staining patterns were seen in heat shocked and non-heat shocked embryos of B. indicus and B. taurus embryos. In the third experiment, embryos were examined for the effects of heat shock on day-7 or on day-6 of their in vitro culture. The data were analysed to study the effects of heat shock, stage at heat shock (day-7 blastocysts vs day-7 morulae) and day of heat shock (day-7 vs day-6) on embryo survival and progression to expanded or hatched blastocysts 48 h post treatment. We found that heat shock reduced the probability of survival by more than half (OR = 0.40; P = 0.004). Probability of survival of day-7 embryos (confounded by rapidly developing blastocysts and slow developing morulae) was less than half (OR = 0.36; P = 0.008), that of day-6 embryos. The data were then analysed to study the effects of heat shock on day-7 blastocysts and day-7 morulae for embryo survival post treatment. Heat shock negatively affected embryo survival (OR = 0.35; P = 0.007). The probability of day-7 blastocysts surviving HS and NHS was more than two and a half times greater (OR = 2.71; P = 0.008) than that of day-7 morulae. No interaction of heat shock and blastocyst stage was noticed. Subsequently the effects of heat shock and the effects of the day of heat shock on morula stage embryos were examined. Overall, heat shock reduced the probability of survival (OR = 0.35; P = 0.009) and the probability of embryo development to the expanded or hatched blastocysts (OR = 0.35; P &#8804; 0.001), 48 h post treatment. The probability of day-6 morulae surviving HS and NHS was almost three times higher (OR = 2.81; P = 0.007) than that of day-7 morulae. The interaction of stage of development with heat shock was not significant. We concluded that an embryo that was capable of developing to the blastocyst stage by day-7 or morula stage by day-6 had better survival and higher probability of progressing to expanded or hatched stage when compared to an embryo that had slow development (day-7 morulae). The study showed a significantly different effect of heat shock on the survival of male and female embryos (63% males vs 36% females, OR = 1.79; P = 0.014). In our final study, embryos were produced from three different bulls each of B. indicus or B. taurus genotype. Heat shock effects consistently and negatively affected survival of embryos (OR = 0.29; P &#8804; 0.001) and their ability to progress to the expanded or hatched blastocysts (OR = 0.42; P &#8804; 0.001). Embryos with paternal B. indicus genotype showed no advantage of survival over embryos with paternal B. taurus genotype embryos. When the day-7 blastocysts were compared with the day-7 morulae, the probability of day-7 blastocysts surviving HS or NHS was more than double (OR = 2.23; P = 0.009) that of day-7 morulae. In this study the effect of survival of the interaction term of heat shock treatment with the blastocyst stage was significant and negative (OR = 0.49; P = 0.040). However the interaction term of blastocyst stage x HS for an embryo&#146;s ability to progress to expanded or hatched blastocyst stage was positive (OR = 2.00; P = 0.052), indicating that the embryos that did survive heat shock were capable of continuing their developmental progress. Although more male embryos (55% male vs 45% female) survived heat shock, the effect for this study was non-significant. In summary, the studies described in this thesis successfully tested a new in vitro heat shock protocol based on in vivo temperature changes experienced by heat stressed cows. Heat shock was consistent in negatively affecting embryo survival. Heat shock also negatively affected the embryo's progression to the expanded or hatched blastocyst stage by 48 h post treatment. We observed variable cytoplasmic and nuclear staining for HSP70 in day-7 blastocysts of both B. indicus and B. taurus. This distribution did not change dramatically after heat shock, but staining appeared to be more intense in heat shocked embryos, suggesting that there was increased expression of HSP70 after heat shock. No difference in this pattern was observed between B. indicus and B. taurus embryos. The speed of development of an embryo until being subjected to either heat shock or non heat shock temperatures affected the probability of survival and further development. However, the interaction term of day-7 blastocyst stage and heat shock was inconsistent, meaning that the rate of development appeared to specifically protect against heat shock in some studies while in the other studies, the apparent protective effect extended to control as well as heat shocked embryos. Our study found no significant influence of B. indicus paternal genotype on embryo survival. Our study showed evidence of B. indicus maternal genotype influence on the embryo's ability to progress to expanded blastocysts but not on embryo survival. The study found a clear trend towards an increased proportion of male embryos surviving heat shock conditions. In some studies this was significant, and in others it was not, but the trend was always in the same direction. This suggests that male embryos are more resistant to the effects of heat shock in vitro.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300402 Animal Reproduction</field><field name="subject">630103 Beef cattle</field><field name="subject">Sensitivity</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158248</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of collaboration: a study of the influences of violinists on the violin repertoire of Sergei Prokofiev.</field><field name="creator">Maddick, Andrew Flannigan</field><field name="description">This critical commentary examines the process of composer-performer collaboration in the violin works of Sergei Prokofiev. It focuses on four of Prokofiev&#146;s major violin works: the Concerto no. 1 op. 19, Concerto no. 2 op. 63, Sonata no. 2 op. 94-bis, and Sonata no. 1 op. 80. In all these pieces Prokofiev collaborated with prominent violinists and this critical commentary highlights the ways in which these musicians variously affected Prokofiev&#146;s violin writing style. The collaborations examined are those involving the violinists Pawel Kocha;ski, Robert So&#235;tens, and David Oistrakh. The bulk of the critical commentary provides a comparison of the Flute Sonata op. 94 and the Violin Sonata no. 2 op. 94-bis (which was edited by David Oistrakh). By analysing the amendments to the flute score the extent to which Oistrakh influenced the arrangement of the violin version is established.

Those people are often referred to as Wends, but mainly in older historiography. In the Middle Ages they occupied the territory more or less corresponding to the former state of East Germany, the region enclosed by the Baltic Sea in the North, the Oder-Neisse rivers in the East, the Ore mountains in the South and the Elbe-Saale rivers in the West (see map 1). In Central Europe, with the exception of the Baltic Prussians and Lithuanians, some of the Polabian Slavs resisted Christianisation and remained stubbornly pagan until the middle of the twelfth century. In the course of history the Polabian Slavs came under increasing political pressure from the Franks and later from the Empire, in the period between the eighth and the twelfth centuries. From the north they were also hard pressed by the Danes and in some periods from the east by the growing strength in Poland of the Piast dynasty. By the end of the twelfth century most of the Polabian Slavs fell under German or Danish political control. Some of them in the central region, what is now the Land of Brandenburg, and the tribes in the South were fully incorporated into the Empire. Others, like the Obodrites and some of the Veleti in Western Pomerania, became part of the Empire as autonomous duchies ruled by the local princes, while the island of R&#252;gen and the adjacent mainland territories, although they continued to be ruled by the Slavic dynasts, had to acknowledge Danish suzerainty. The whole territory, despite some areas being under the Danish crown, became subject to strong German political and cultural influence. Assimilation and German colonization facilitated the process of the Germanization of almost the entire area between the Saale-Elbe and Oder-Neisse rivers. Over the centuries the Polabian Slavs have almost entirely disappeared as a distinct people. However, the process is not fully completed even today, for a small Sorb minority still retains its distinct cultural identity. The modern Sorbs, numbering around 100,000 people are living today in eastern Germany in the region of Lusatia (Lausitz in German or &#163;u&#158;ica in Sorbian), mainly around Bautzen and Cottbus. Approximately 60,000 of them still speak a Slavonic language. Although this work does not deal directly with the Sorbs of Lusatia, it is dedicated to those surviving Polabian Slavs. [No abstract available - text taken from Introduction]</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">430108 History - European</field><field name="subject">Medieval</field><field name="subject">Slavs</field><field name="subject">Western Slavs</field><field name="subject">Slavic</field><field name="subject">Slavonic</field><field name="subject">Polabian</field><field name="subject">Religion</field><field name="subject">Paganism</field><field name="subject">Sventovit</field><field name="subject">Theocracy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157891</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An analysis of the underlying biochemical and genetic mechanisms that control gender and fertility in the Kuruma shrimp, Marsupenaeus japonicus (Bate)</field><field name="creator">Sellars, Melony J.</field><field name="description">Centuries of experience with terrestrial agriculture have demonstrated the value of domestication and selective breeding to improve production efficiency, profitability and sustainability. Compared to terrestrial agriculture there are remarkably few aquaculture industries that have progressed beyond the use of wild or unselected genotypes. This presents a major opportunity for the global aquaculture industry to capitalize on the benefits of domestication and selective breeding. However, there is a parallel need to ensure that a balance is achieved between optimizing genetic gains and conserving the biodiversity of the captive and wild stocks from which they are derived. In progressing towards domestication and genetic improvement, one of the key areas of interest includes the factors that control gender and fertility. Gender is of particular interest in species that are sexually dimorphic, with one gender being more attractive from a production point of view. Fertility is of broad interest as a key aspect of reproductive performance. Controlling fertility is also one method of protecting unwanted or unlicensed breeding of elite genotypes and preventing escapees from mating with wild stocks. For most aquacuculture species there is a fundamental lack of knowledge of the underlying biochemical and genetic mechanisms that control gender and fertility. The focus of this study was on developing methods for controlling gender and fertility in the Kuruma shrimp Marsupenaeus japonicus (Bate). This high value species has been farmed for several decades using the progeny of wild broodstock and, more recently, progeny of domesticated, selectively bred captive broodstock. The biological, biochemical and genetic processes that control gender and fertility in M. japonicus are of direct commercial interest and of wider interest to science. Commercial interest is for two reasons: First, M. japonicus are sexually dimorphic with females growing 30% larger than males and second, recent success in the genetic improvement of M. japonicus has prompted farmers to seek ways to protect superior genetic stocks from unlicensed breeding and to prevent escapees from genetically contributing to natural fishery populations. Thus, the knowledge and technology that could permit farmers to cost-effectively produce all-female, sterile stocks could be of significant commercial value. More broadly, research directed towards this goal could provide new insights into the underlying biological, genetic and biochemical processes that control gender and reproduction in penaeid shrimp. Previous studies on inducing sterility have demonstrated that this can result in altered gende r ratios in the target species. Accordingly, the approach adopted in this study was to investigate these traits simultaneously. There were three principal research components in this project, each of which focused on a different approach to achieving gender and/or fertility control in M. japonicus. The three components were; (1) the potential of ploidy manipulation to control gender and fertility; (2) the effect of ionizing radiation on fertility; (3) the potential of genetic engineering to control gender determination and germ cell specification. PLOIDY MANIPULATION Previous research on M. japonicus has shown that triploids produced by preventing polar body (PB) II extrusion are always female and sterile, however, induction rates never result in 100% triploid progeny. Therefore, experiments in the present study focused on developing a technique to produce triploids with a 100% induction rate. As mating of tetraploids and diploids is the only documented technique that has achieved 100% triploids in other cultured species, the present study investigated methods to induce tetraploidy in M. japonicus. First I attempted to prevent the first division in mitosis using temperature and chemical shocks. Second I attempted to inhibit extrusion of PBI and both PBI and II using chemical shocks only. I was successful at stopping the first mitotic division, preventing the extrusion of PBI and preventing the extrusion of both PBI and II in M. japonicus by applying different shocks at different times post-spawning for different durations. Tetraploid M. japonicus embryos were produced by stopping the first division in mitosis, however, they were not viable and did not hatch. The most suitable treatment regime for inducing tetraploidy, giving frequency (number of spawnings induced that result in some polyploids) and induction rate (number of individuals within a spawning induction which are tetraploid or triploid) equal importance, was a 36&#176;C shock administered 23 min post-spawning for a 5 or 10 min duration. Preventing the extrusion of PBI and both PBI and II using 150 &#181;M 6-dimethylaminopurine at 1 to 3 min post-spawning for either a 4 to 5 min duration (timed to stop PBI extrusion) or a 16 min duration (timed to stop both PBI and II extrusion) consistently resulted in the production of viable triploid M. japonicus embryos, which hatched into nauplii. No tetraploids were produced by preventing the extrusion of PBI or both PBI and II. This is the first report of successful PBI, and PBI and II prevention in shrimp, and production of triploids using the reported treatment regimes. These findings indicate that manipulation of the ploidy level may not be suitable for producing 100% all-female, sterile M. japonicus, as all tetraploids produced to-date are not viable and all known triploidy induction techniques never result in 100% triploid progeny. There may, however, be commercial value in utilising the PBI triploidy induction methods of the present study in an attempt to improve productivity as: - PBI triploids are believed to have increased heterozygosisty over PBII triploids and diploids, and possibly better growth performance, and - Stocking of ponds with spawnings that have received shocks to prevent PBI extrusion would result in a greater proportion of females to males (as the frequency of induction is always 100%), therefore resulting in improved farm profit based on greater total harvestable product in terms of weight, and the fact that females attract higher prices per kilogram due to their larger size class. IONIZING RADIATION Ionizing radiation (IR) has been successfully used to prevent reproduction in a wide range of organisms and can be effective at sterilizing 100% of treated individuals. IR also plays a role in producing monosex populations through gynogenesis and androgensis in a range of aquatic species. Despite this, there is no information on the effects of IR on penaeid shrimp reproduction. Experiments in the present study assessed the capacity of IR to confer sexual sterilization in female and male M. japonicus. Initial experiments were focused on optimizing IR dose ranges. For these experiments, harvest age shrimp were treated with 0, 10 or 20 gray (Gy) of IR and their ability to produce viable offspring was assessed by performing rigorous reproductive evaluations. Later experiments assessed the reproductive performance of 10 month old M. japonicus treated with IR at postlarval stage 15 (PL15) (15 days since metamorphosis from mysis to postlarval stage 1). Initially, a lethal dose curve of IR for PL15 M. japonicus was established. Based on these results, PL15 shrimp were treated with IR at 0, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 Gy to examine the effect of IR dose on their reproductive capacity at 10 months of age. IR was found to impair the reproductive performance of M. japonicus when treated at harvest age and when treated as postlarvae and reared to reproductive maturity. IR was, however, not 100% effective at preventing the production of viable offspring at the reported doses. Harvest age male shrimp were more sensitive to IR, being reproductively impaired at 10 Gy as compared to 20 Gy for harvest age females. PL15 females treated with 0 Gy of IR matured and spawned more frequently than PL15 females treated with 10, 15 and 20 Gy of IR. There were, however, no other significant effects of IR observed on M. japonicus reproductive performance when treated at PL15. IR doses higher than 35 Gy resulted in 100% mortality (i.e. lethal dose rate) of PL15 M. japonicus within 30 days after treatment, whilst doses of 25 and 30 Gy significantly reduced postlarval survival compared to controls. From preliminary research, dose rates of 25 Gy or more resulted in 100% mortality of harvest age females, whilst 20 Gy significantly reduced harvest age male survival. These findings indicate that IR doses that do not result in 100% mortality of harvest age and postlarval M. japonicus can reduce their reproductive capacity, however, these doses of IR can not confer 100% sterility. GENETIC ENGINEERING The combined use of molecular biotechnology and genetics to investigate mechanisms of gender and fertility determination in numerous animal phyla has gained increased research attention over the last decade. However, to-date there is only one known penaeid shrimp gene for which the complete coding sequence has been isolated (but not functionally characterized) that is known to be involved in gender and fertility determination of other species. The present study assessed the potential of using genetic engineering methodologies to control gender and fertility of M. japonicus using a multi-step approach. Initially this study attempted to identify one or more candidate genes in M. japonicus that had been previously selected from a comprehensive literature search (sex-lethal, transformer, double-sex and vasa), and subsequently characterize their complete coding sequence. Expression profiles of the isolated genes were then determined throughout embryonic, larval and postlarval development, and in female and male gonad tissue to identify key periods during early development when their expression is naturally up-regulated. Using an RNAi approach, this study then attempted to silence the candidate genes from being expressed during these key developmental periods and assess the resulting loss-of-function genotypes. In addition to these experiments, this study also investigated the suitability of different real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) assay methodologies for the studied diverse morphological sample set (relative vs absolute quantitation) and investigated different methodologies to deliver nucleic acids into shrimp embryos (electroporation vs a polyethylenimine (PEI) transfection reagent). A partial coding sequence for a dsx-like gene homologue, DMRT2, and a complete coding sequence for a PL10 vasa-like gene was isolated from M. japonicus. The PL10 vasa-like gene was named Mjpl10. Both genes were differentially expressed during embryonic, larval and postlarval development, and in female and male gonad. Using absolute qRT-PCR, I demonstrated that dsx-like gene transcripts were present at low levels throughout the first 5 h of embryogenesis after which transcript abundance increased significantly by the time embryos were 6 h old, suggesting a functional role for dsx transcripts at this developmental stage. Expression of the dsx-like gene was consistently high but variable throughout the remainder of embryogenesis and during larval and postlarval development up until PL48 at which point dsx transcripts were no longer detectible. This expression pattern indicated a functional role for the isolated dsx-like gene from 6 h post-spawning until PL30. Transcripts of the dsx-like gene were also detected in testes at low levels and were close to undetectable in the ovary of mature adults. Using absolute qRT- PCR I also demonstrated that Mjpl10 transcripts were present in the first developmental stage sampled (2-cell embryos) onwards, suggesting it is maternally expressed, and continually at low levels throughout embryogenesis. Mjpl10 expression increased significantly in the first 25 h after hatching (nauplii IV) and then decreased in a linear fashion by 316-fold over the next 52 day period. Its continued expression throughout embryonic and larval development is compatible with a conserved role in early germ cell specification. Transcript levels of Mjpl10 were also detected in the ovary and testes of mature adults. To silence expression of the identified candidate genes in vivo, short hairpin RNA (shRNA) DNA expression vectors were constructed that were capable of in vivo transcription of a dsxlike and Mjpl10 shRNA molecule. These shRNA molecules would theoretically trigger the RNAi pathway and result in gene-specific silencing of the target dsx-like gene and Mjpl10 gene transcripts. The white spot syndrome virus immediate early 1 (WSSV IE1) promoter was chosen to drive expression of the shRNA molecules. The WSSV IE1 promoter was initially isolated and cloned into a vector to drive expression of a luciferase mRNA. WSSV IE1 promoter function was found to be &gt;56% as efficient as the Orgyia pseudotsugata (Douglasfir Tussock moth) multicapsid nucleopolyhedrosis virus immediately-early 2 (OpIE2) promoter when compared in Fall Army worm, Spodopterea frugiperda (Sf) 9 insect cell culture. The vector containing the WSSV IE1 promoter was subsequently used to construct three recombinant DNA vectors capable of in vivo expression of a shRNA fragment of either the dsx-like gene, Mjpl10 or a placebo control luciferase gene. Three additional recombinant vectors were constructed with each containing a fragment of either the dsx-like gene, Mjpl10 or luciferase gene (identical to the sense strand of the shRNA fragments) that was inserted behind coding sequence for a green fluorescent protein and before the polyA tail. These three GFP fusion vectors were co-transfected with their corresponding shRNA expression vectors in Sf 9 cell culture. Theoretically mRNAs expressed by the GFP fusion vectors would be silenced and unable to express GFP if the corresponding shRNA expression vector was transcribing shRNA molecules that were capable of cleaving the GFP fusion mRNA polyA tail off the molecule through the RNAi pathway. Using this approach all three shRNA expression vectors constructed in this study were shown to be functional and capable of inducing a gene-specific silencing response in Sf 9 insect cell culture. Relative to a positive control, treatments transfected with the dsx-like shRNA expression vector had a reduced percentage of insect cells expressing GFP (i.e.18.07 &#177; 0.38% and 8.75 &#177; 0.15% compared to 100% in two independent experiments). Treatments transfected with the Mjpl10 shRNA expression vector also had a reduced percentage of cells expressing GFP relative to a positive control (i.e. 14.63 &#177; 0.59% and 9.19 &#177; 0.02% compared to 100% in two independent experiments). Similarly, treatments transfected with the luciferase shRNA expression vector had a reduced percentage of cells expressing GFP relative to a positive control (1.64 &#177; 0.02 and 0.47 &#177; 0.06% compared to 100% in two independent experiments). From these experiments it was evident that the WSSV IE1 promoter was functional, and that the shRNA fragments of the recombinant vectors were being expressed, folding and initiating a specific RNAi response. The three shRNA expressing recombinant DNA vectors and the positive transfection control luciferase mRNA expression vector were transfected into 1-cell M. japonicus embryos using the commercially available jetPEITM transfection reagent. Using qRT-PCR I demonstrated that jetPEITM DNA complexes were successfully transfected into 1-cell embryos as evidenced by the presence of in vivo transcribed exogenous luciferase mRNA in the positive transfection controls. Using qRT-PCR I then demonstrated that the Mjpl10 shRNA molecules were able to induce a small, but significant non-specific gene silencing response in vivo. The number of Mjpl10 mRNA copies detected per ng of total RNA was 14,108 &#177; 1,763 in the control compared to 6,701 &#177; 494 in the placebo shRNA treatment and 8,151 &#177; 1,151 in the genespecific Mjpl10 shRNA treatment. In comparison, the dsx-like shRNA molecules did not result in a non-specific silencing response. No specific gene silencing response was observed for either of the shRNA expression vectors. Given that the Mjpl10 and luciferase shRNA expression vectors were capable of reducing the total number of Mjpl10 mRNAs but no specific gene silencing was observed; the fact that the two endogenous targets, the dsx-like homologue and Mjpl10, are known to be expressed in specific cell types (i.e. the genital ridge and the germ cell lineage respectively) and a measurable gene silencing result would therefore require that large numbers of shRNA be in vivo transcribed in these specific cell types; and that the shRNA expression vectors had been demonstrated to be functional in Sf 9 cell culture, these results indicate that the WSSV IE1 promoter was not strong enough to drive in vivo expression of suitable quantities of shRNA molecules to induce a measurable gene silencing response. Future research should isolate alternative shrimp specific constitutive promoters such as &#946;-actin which are highly active at all life-history stages in the majority of cell types. The use of such promoters instead of the WSSV IE1 promoter would ensure a high level of expression of recombinant DNA vectors that are transfected in vivo. Comparison of the relative and absolute qRT-PCR quantitation approaches revealed significant differences in transcript level profiles between the two procedures for both target genes, the dsx-like gene and Mjpl10. When 18S rRNA was used as a reference, target gene expression was more similar to that of the absolute method than when &#946;-actin was used as a reference. Variability between the relative and absolute procedures occurred for a greater Percentage of the embryonic stages compared to later developmental stages. This study indicates that the use of 18S rRNA or &#946;-actin as reference genes for studying gene expression patterns in M. japonicus embryonic, larval, postlarval and gonad samples will give significantly variable results, and illustrates the proposition that housekeeping genes are not necessarily appropriate references for qRT- PCR data normalization. Until suitable reference genes are characterized, gene expression experiments using the studied M. japonicus tissues of different morphological developmental stages should use absolute quantification procedures. Finally, comparison of electroporation and the polyethylenimine (PEI) transfection reagent procedures demonstrated the jetPEITM transfection reagent was the most suitable means by which to transform 1-cell M. japonicus embryos. Electroporation was not found to be suitable for delivering nucleic acids into 1-cell M. japonicus embryos at quantities greater than what is detectible from nucleic acids attached to the outer embryo surface after DNase or RNase treatment. However, the commercially available jetPEITM transfection reagent was able to deliver nucleic acids into 1-cell M. japonicus embryos when soaked in the transfection media for between 50 min to 4 h post-spawning. Transfection was most successful when complexation was performed for 15 min in a sodium chloride buffer, followed by a 3 to 4 h incubation in sterile seawater prior to the addition of embryos. Greatest transformation rates (as measured by the number of exogenous mRNA template copies per ng of total RNA) were achieved when 1 mL of seawater and embryos were added to complexation mixtures within the first 5 min of spawning.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158613</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Complexity approach to national IT policy making: The case of Malaysia's Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC)</field><field name="creator">Abdul Wahab, Amirudin</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT This dissertation examines the design and implementation of Malaysia's national Information Technology (IT) policy with a focus on the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) project. Qualitative research methods, including in-depth interviews, document analysis and literature analysis, were used to build an understanding of the development of the MSC. The analysis adopts a holistic approach that draws upon the multidisciplinary perspectives of complex adaptive systems in order to understand how social, economic, political and institutional forces interact in a changing environment. This research contributes a policy framework called Goal-Policy-Implementation-Outcome (GPIO), which is used to understand, describe and assess the MSC policy design and methods. It is one of the first public studies of the MSC and one of very few complex systems analyses of a socio-economic system in a developing country. It has been argued that many countries around the world are competing rapidly to produce 'visionary' reports and policy statements on the future of their nations and societies in the 'Information Age'. This is due to the belief that IT can play critical role in stimulating the socio-economic growth of the countries. In Malaysia, the government embarked on an ambitious program to establish the MSC as an attempt to achieve Vision 2020, a national vision and Malaysia's statement of national goals that articulates the country's objective for developed-nation status, while moving towards the creation of an information-rich society by the year 2020. Despite the importance of national IT policies and the major commitment of resources to implement them, there are few critical studies of the positive and negative impacts of 'post-industrial' or 'information society' policy, particularly in the developing countries like Malaysia. This study seeks in part to fill this gap by providing a critical assessment of a Malaysian national IT policy. This research argues that IT policy for national development must be viewed holistically, taking into consideration innovations needed in the social, economic, political and institutional spheres, rather than taking limited view of IT as an economic growth engine. This is a paradigm shift that represents a movement from the traditional worldview (TWV), that was based on the Cartesian/Newtonian paradigm into new ways of thinking and action that is labelled here as the emerging worldview (EMV). The EMV is grounded in complexity theory, an interdisciplinary endeavour that draws upon ideas from a number of fields and seeks to understand and model systems with many interacting parts. This approach can help policy makers and analysts to understand, assess and develop a more balanced and comprehensive policy for the evolution of new technology such as IT and to tackle the complexity of socio-economic change of a dynamic real world setting. The data collection method is from in-depth, open-ended interviews and document analysis. This qualitative exploratory approach was chosen to understand and capture the points of view of other people without specifically limiting the lines of inquiry through questionnaires etc. This research was influenced by multiple theoretical frameworks, because taking one framework alone in analysing the complex issues involved in ICT would not provide a comprehensive understanding of the interplay of the socio-technical and techno-economic paradigms. This resulted in the contribution of a policy framework called Goal-Policy-Implementation-Outcome (GPIO), which is used to understand, describe and assess the MSC policy design and method. This research found that the MSC policy plan and process were not working as intended to achieve the goals of Vision 2020. The strategy of clustering businesses in one physical location to establish synergy did not work as anticipated because: (1) Cyberjaya was not yet fully ready with all the necessary people, infrastructure and community since many basic amenities have yet to be competed; (2) The distance of Cyberjaya to key cities were perceived to be too far; (3) Operational costs in Cyberjaya were perceived as high; (4) The Cyberjaya ecosystem lacks attractive incentives; and (5) Most of the current and potential MSC firms, customers and suppliers were already located outside Cyberjaya with existing networks of people and facilities in other locations. (6) The current environment of the MSC was also found not to be conducive to facilitating a self-organizing system due to the lack of a wide consultative and participatory process. Consequently, drastic changes to the organizational structure and behaviour are needed before success can happen. It was found that the key challenges and barriers to the transformation process in and through the MSC lie in the nature of the existing mindset, the operational practice, culture and power structural arrangements within and among the policy, people and institutions of the MSC. Discussion on the MSC tends to be centred on the technological and commercial without recognizing that technological change relies on concomitant social and political shifts. By succumbing to technology driven views and 'information society' rhetoric, policy makers are allowing real economic and social choices to be smothered. This dissertation argues that instead of presenting technology as something which is external to the society, with a dynamics of its own, and to which society must learn to adapt, effective debate about new technology must acknowledge the related political choices, power relationships and value judgments about the shape and direction of the society using the technology. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop policies to ensure that the economic benefits and social engineering associated with Malaysia&#146;s knowledge economy are managed through participatory and partnership methods at all levels of the country. This research has shown that complex systems analysis can lay the groundwork for a new approach that more accurately represents societal choices and outcomes than past approaches. Few researchers have undertaken complex systems analyses of social systems, with still fewer examining the context of a national public IT policy in a developing country like Malaysia. Further, there are very few thorough public studies done of the MSC itself, with most studies on the MSC either being done in confidence and/or being conducted by foreign consultants appointed by the government or by the Multimedia Development Corporation (MDC). As such, public accessibility to critical studies on the MSC or public documents on them is rarely available. This research, if not the first, is one of the first attempts made to provide a thorough constructive critical study on the MSC policy project since its official launch in 1996. It is also, if not the first, one of the first attempts made to apply the emerging paradigm or the new science of complexity in a real world national policy case study, specifically the MSC policy project. Moreover, there is a huge lacking of research done on behalf of 'marginalized communities'. This research is not carried out on behalf of private enterprise or national governments but rather it is done on behalf of its citizens.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">360203 Research, Science and Technology Policy</field><field name="subject">729901 Technological and organisational innovation</field><field name="subject">Multimedia Super Corridor</field><field name="subject">MSC</field><field name="subject">Malaysia</field><field name="subject">Complexity</field><field name="subject">IT Policy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157967</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Political Economy of the Music Industry: Technological Change and the Political Control of Music</field><field name="creator">Cvetkovski, Trajce</field><field name="description">The task undertaken in this dissertation is to determine the extent of the challenge facing the major firms (majors) who currently control over 80% of global sound carrier and publishing revenue in the popular (pop) music industry. The aim of this thesis is to explain the disorganising effects currently being experienced. Specifically, the central question guiding this thesis asks: what will be the effect of new technologies on the future organisation of the music industry? I focus broadly on recent universally accessible digital technologies which have raised questions about the future of the industry&#146;s current organisational structure and processes both in terms of input (creation of music products in their commodified form) and output (access and consumption of music products). The industry&#146;s processes are highly integrated and its business model is complex because it centres around the sophisticated management and aggressive appropriation of intellectual property (namely copyright) for repeated exploitation for decades after its initial acquisition. The purpose of this research, therefore, is to examine not only the tangible aspects of the manner in which the industry&#146;s organises its products but also the intangible dimension. Significant recent changes experienced by the industry are identified. The literature is not conclusive in terms of explaining these developments. While existing research exists on recent developments, a comprehensive analysis of the organisation of the industry both in terms of input and output remains underdeveloped in the literature. In particular, in relation to product re-organisation and consumer behaviour, copyright development and corporate restructuring, the literature is not fully developed. Current research is focused on illegitimate technological attacks &#150; namely digital piracy. However these do not adequately or comprehensively explain current disorganisation in the industry. This dissertation remedies this deficiency by proposing four separate but interconnected factors are affecting the highly concentrated status quo. Together, the positive and negative impacts of emerging technologies have created a serious dilemma in terms of product commodification for the controllers of the industry. I argue interconnected illegitimate and legitimate technological challenges are at play suggesting re-organisation is occurring multidimensionally. The research undertaken is empirically grounded, and though primarily based on qualitative data (and subsequent quantitative data for statistical corroboration), the current work has implications for understanding the industry&#146;s methods. Together, these approaches form the basis of the dissertation&#146;s methodology. The research reported in this dissertation attempts to determine to what extent the use and consumption of these different technologies can be regarded as the primary catalyst for the challenge to corporate control of the music industry, and the manner in which it is structured. If the dominant few intend to identify and rationalise challenges in terms of their corporate model, then they must understand the dynamic nature of interacting technologies.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">popular music</field><field name="subject">copyright</field><field name="subject">internet</field><field name="subject">technology</field><field name="subject">creative industries</field><field name="subject">MP3</field><field name="subject">pop culture</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158010</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of bovine colostrum supplementation on immune variables and exercise performance in trained cyclists</field><field name="creator">Shing, Cecilia Mary</field><field name="description">Bovine colostrum is homologous in composition to human colostrum but contains greater concentrations of key bioactive components that contribute directly to growth and immunity. It has been used by humans to treat and prevent enteric pathogens and to promote wound healing and intestinal repair. Moreover, bovine colostrum has been promoted and used by athletes as a supplement to enhance immune function and improve exercise performance. This is despite limited data in support of its value to athletes and the relative absence of strong data that identify mechanisms that could improve exercise performance and immune function. The aim of the three studies that comprise this thesis was therefore to investigate the influence of a bovine colostrum protein concentrate (CPC) on immune variables, hormone concentrations, autonomic activity and exercise performance in highly-trained endurance cyclists. Study one involved monitoring exercise performance and immune variables during an eight week bovine CPC supplementation period, which included five consecutive days of high-intensity training (HIT). Twenty-nine highly-trained male road cyclists completed an initial 40-km time trial (TT40) and were then randomly assigned to either a supplement (n=14, 10 g bovine CPC per day) or placebo group (n=15, 10 g whey protein concentrate per day). Following five weeks of supplementation, the cyclists completed a second TT40 before undertaking five consecutive days of high-intensity training (HIT) that included another TT40. A final TT40 was completed one week following the HIT. Venous blood and saliva samples were collected immediately before and after each TT40, and upper respiratory illness symptoms were recorded over the experimental period. Supplementation with bovine CPC elicited improvements in TT40 performance at the end of the HIT period, when compared to the placebo group, (1.9&#177;2.2%; mean&#177;90% confidence limits) and maintained ventilatory threshold following the HIT (4.6&#177;4.6%). When compared to the placebo group, bovine CPC supplementation significantly increased pre-exercise serum soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor 1 during the HIT period (p&lt;0.039).

When compared to the placebo group, bovine CPC supplementation significantly increased pre-exercise serum soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor 1 during the HIT period (p&lt;0.039). Supplementation also suppressed the post-exercise decrease in cytotoxic/suppressor T cells during the HIT period (bovine CPC=- 1.0&#177;2.7%, placebo=-9.2&#177;2.8%; mean&#177;SE, p=0.017) and during the following week (bovine CPC=1.4&#177;2.9%, placebo=-8.2&#177;2.8%, p=0.004). In addition, bovine CPC supplementation prevented a post-exercise decrease in serum IgG2 concentration at the end of the HIT period (bovine CPC=4.8&#177;6.8%, p=0.88; placebo=-9.7&#177;6.9%, p=0.013) and there was a trend towards reduced incidence of upper respiratory illness symptoms in the bovine CPC group (p=0.055). Study one demonstrated that low dose bovine CPC supplementation elicited improvements in TT40 performance during a HIT period and maintained ventilatory threshold following five consecutive days of HIT. Supplementation was also found to modulate immune variables during normal training and following an acute period of intense exercise, which may have contributed to the trend toward reduced upper respiratory illness in the bovine CPC group. The maintenance of performance, prevention of post-exercise suppression of IgG2 and cytotoxic/suppressor T cells and increase in anti-inflammatory serum soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor 1 suggest that bovine CPC supplementation is beneficial to cyclists during a period of high-intensity training. The aim of Study two was to investigate the hormonal, immune and autonomic responses of competitive cyclists over a five-day stage race following eight weeks of bovine CPC supplementation. Ten highly-trained male road cyclists were randomly assigned to a placebo (n=6, 10 g whey protein concentrate/day) or bovine CPC group (n=4, 10 g bovine CPC/day). Cyclists provided a baseline saliva sample before commencing supplementation that culminated in a five day competitive cycle race. The cyclists provided daily saliva samples and heart rate variability (HRV) was measured on each day of the race. A Profile of Mood States questionnaire was completed on days one, three and five of the race and cyclists recorded upper respiratory illness symptoms throughout the experimental period. While there was no influence of bovine CPC on salivary IgA, supplementation maintained testosterone concentrations over the competition period (p&lt;0.05) and prevented a decrease in parasympathetic activity (p&lt;0.05). There was also a trend towards improved mood state (p=0.06) in the bovine CPC group. These data indicate that bovine CPC supplementation may prevent disturbances in autonomic function and the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis associated with consecutive days of cycle racing The aim of study three was to assess whether bovine CPC would directly stimulate cytokine production of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), with and without lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and phytohemagglutinin (PHA) stimulation. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was added to cell cultures as a potent enhancer of monocyte and macrophage cytokine release and a model of exercise stress. Phytohemagglutinin was added to PBMC to stimulate T cell proliferation. Blood was sampled from four healthy, male endurance cyclists who had abstained from exercise for 48 hours. PBMC were separated and cultured with bovine CPC concentrations of 0 (control), 1.25, 2.5 and 5% with and without LPS (3&#181;g&#183;mL-1) and PHA (2.5&#181;g&#183;mL-1). Cell supernatants were collected at 6 and 24 hours of culture for the determination of tumour necrosis factor (TNF), interferon (IFN)-y, interleukin (IL)-10, IL-6, IL-4 and IL-2 concentrations. Following six hours of PBMC incubation at 37&#176;C with 5% CO2, IFN-y, IL-10 and IL-2 secretion were increased with increasing concentrations of bovine CPC (p&lt;0.05). In a dose dependent manner, IFN-y and IL-2 remained elevated following 24 hours of incubation (p&lt;0.05). Data from this final study showed that bovine CPC modulates in vitro cytokine production of human PBMC. In conclusion, the present data suggest that bovine CPC supplementation is beneficial to highlytrained cyclists during periods of high-intensity training and competition. Bovine CPC promotes the release of cell mediated cytokines from PBMC and has the potential therefore to influence a number of physiological systems. Supplementation was associated with enhanced recovery over consecutive days of high-intensity training and competition, as evidenced by maintained exercise performance, ventilatory threshold and testosterone concentrations. Bovine CPC modulated immune function, particularly at the end of a HIT period, and there was a trend for reduced incidence of upper respiratory symptoms following bovine CPC supplementation in Study one. The data collectively suggest that bovine CPC supplementation may influence a combination of physiological pathways including the autonomic nervous system and the hypothalamic-pituitary axis.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321401 Exercise Physiology</field><field name="subject">750203 Organised sports</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158236</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Viable Software: the Intelligent Control Paradigm for Adaptable and Adaptive Architecture</field><field name="creator">Herring, Charles Edward</field><field name="description">The Intelligent Control Paradigm for software architecture is the result of this work. The Viable Software Approach is developed as an instance of the paradigm. The approach uses the Viable System Model as the basis for software system architecture. The result is a model-based architecture and approach for developing software systems by piecemeal adaptation with the goal that they become adaptive systems at runtime. Software built in this manner is called Viable Software. Viable Software represents a unifying class of self-controlling software that is an &#147;intelligent&#148; control system. Cybernetics, Control Theory, and Complexity Theory are the background for this work, and aspects relevant to this work are presented. These results are related to software architecture and software engineering. Rationale for the selection of the Viable System Model as a basis for software systems is given. The Viable System Model is described. The model is restated as an Alexanderian &#147;pattern language&#148; to make it more accessible to software engineering. A Viable Software Approach is proposed and expressed in the form of a Product Line Architecture that arranges the Viable System Model, the Viable Software Architecture, a Viable Component Framework, and a Component Transfer Protocol into a system for generative programming. An important result is the formalisation of the pattern of the Viable System into the interface specifications of the Viable Component. Three case studies illustrate the approach. The first is an analysis and extension of the Groove collaboration system. This study shows how the approach is used to map an existing system into the Viable Software Architecture and add fuzzy-adaptive user interface controllers. The second study presents the design and detailed software construction of an adaptive camera controller as part of a smart environment. The final study shows how a Business-to-Business e-Commerce system can be evolved and an expert system-based controller developed to implement business contracts.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">L</field><field name="subject">280302 Software Engineering</field><field name="subject">700199 Computer software and services not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">Software Architecture</field><field name="subject">Viable System Model</field><field name="subject">Intelligent Control</field><field name="subject">Adaptive Control</field><field name="subject">Adaptable Software</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157886</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The evolution of residential property price premia in a metropolis: Reconstitution or contamination?</field><field name="creator">Huston, Simon</field><field name="description">Residential property price premia (&#8216;premia&#8217;) have long fascinated investors, particularly in times of euphoria, but their social, climatic and urban ramifications are much wider. A proper understanding of premia is hindered by the variety of exogenous influences determining them. They occur within idiosyncratic, complex, and continuously reconfiguring metropoli, conditioned by topography, history, regime, commerce, and culture. Given imperfectly competitive housing markets, conventional explanations for premia are either restricted to their financial dissection, trawl though metrics or cast around for hedonic coefficients. However, premia illuminate affordability and other problems in the broader planning and social debate. With the general significance of premia clarified, the research question of the project becomes: &#8216;What drives residential property price premium evolution in a metropolis?&#8217; A complete answer involves dissecting the nature and establishing the location of putative premia and disentangling the influence and interactions of their various price drivers. To provide it, the project conducts a property and urban literature review. Based on theory&#8217;s insight that higher order contains lower order systems, it develops and investigates a general systems model of residential premia with two modes. The system is conditioned by ideology but forced by population and capital inflows. Within it, premia mutate, influenced by a nested hierarchy of more or less contaminated information. To investigate the model and its different modes, the project employs tests across system pointers, at the macro, meso (all urban) and micro spatial resolutions. First, the turbulence and permeability of residential property markets to exogenous influences is assessed. The project then looks at the urban mosaic in the growing Sunbelt migration city of Brisbane, Australia, over the boom period from 1998-2004. Locally, it conducts a case study and survey in one micro-location, seeking clues in transaction patterns (output), property system agents (components) and the information they use (feedback mechanisms). Finally, the project draws some relevant policy implications. Its key findings are that urban housing markets are open, complex and polarised. In an exuberant economic climate, migration and debt fuel metropolitan price escalation. Public urban initiatives reinforce central incumbent affluence or spark fresh bouts of speculation. Individual premia are heterogeneous but often feed off local construction projects or iconic refurbishment. Reflecting their demographics and motives, agent risk appetites are diverse although investors are usually less averse to renewal. System feedback involves a congruence of media and local activity signals. Neither local conviviality nor Bohemian influences are, by themselves, significant. Rather, buyer rationality is validated by post-purchase infrastructure completions. The thesis of this project is, hence, that in euphoric capital markets, migration and debt accelerates the endogenous mutation of property from homes within a community towards speculative paper assets. The implication is that the excessive proliferation of premia indicates economic imbalance and urban malaise which requires recognition and treatment. While premia are paid for perceived privilege or prospects, cognitive risk representations and expectations evolve. Sometimes judgment is contaminated by media fantasy but often validated by accommodating government policy and central revitalisation projects. Yet, within a wider social and ecological remit, rampant premia suggest flaws in urban strategy, governance and planning practice. In terms of windfall events or unearned rent, the cumulative effects of ill-considered projects and price distortions can be ugly and wasteful. They alienate and accentuate spatial privilege without generating sustainable jobs. The project has procedural and substantive policy implications. The dynamics of residential premia cannot be disentangled from capital market volatility, urban fragmentation and reconstitution. Enlightened property development requires visionary urban planning beyond electoral cycles. Rather than unregulated markets or disjointed incrementalism, the project points to the advantages of cohesive projects and inclusive hubs. It impels ecological and people-focused development to nurture capable, connected and considerate edge communities. Its first steps are theoretical recognition, policy clarification, government reform, market constraints, price and tax rationalisation and spatial transparency.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Premia</field><field name="subject">Residentail house prices</field><field name="subject">Metropolis</field><field name="subject">Information asymmetry</field><field name="subject">Systems theory</field><field name="subject">Urban planning</field><field name="subject">Governance</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:211491</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Oral treatments for monogenean parasites of farmed yellowtails, Seriola spp. (Carangidae).</field><field name="creator">Williams, Rissa E.</field><field name="description">Japanese yellowtail Seriola quinqueradiata has been commercially farmed in Japan since the 1940s. In comparison, sea-cage farming of yellowtail kingfish Seriola lalandi in Australia is still developing, with commercial production commencing in 1998. In Australia, S. lalandi is parasitised by Zeuxapta seriolae and Benedenia seriolae. In Japan, S. quinqueradiata is parasitised by Heteraxine heterocerca and B. seriolae. These monogeneans affect industries in both countries and management of these parasites is required to prevent impacts on fish health and commercial losses. I investigated efficacy (% reduction of mean parasite abundance) for orally administered praziquantel, fenbendzole and oxfendazole against Z. seriolae and B. seriolae on S. lalandi and the efficacy of orally administered praziquantel and febantel against H. heterocerca and B. seriolae on S. quinqueradiata.

Seriola lalandi administered fenbendazole and oxfendazole by surface coating of feed had lower abundance of the gill parasite Z. seriolae. Seriola quinqueradiata intubated with febantel had lower abundance of the gill parasite H. heterocerca. Neither fenbendazole nor oxfendazole administered to S. lalandi in Australia, nor febantel administered to S. quinqueradiata in Japan resulted in a lower abundance of the skin parasite B. seriolae. Praziquantel was first administered to S. lalandi by surface coating of feed. Fish rejected medicated feed, suggesting praziquantel affected its palatability. Fish treated with feed medicated with praziquantel had fewer Z. seriolae and B. seriolae than untreated fish. Praziquantel administered to S. lalandi by intubation allowed a more accurate dose to be tested without differential feeding or reduced palatability obstructing results, and resulted in fewer Z. seriolae (99.5-100 % reduction) and B. seriolae (91 &#8211; 97.7 % reduction). Intubated praziquantel also led to fewer recruitment life stages of Z. seriolae and B. seriolae, even at low doses, but did not completely eliminate them from S. lalandi. Praziquantel administered to S. lalandi alone and combined with cimetidine had high efficacy (&gt;99%) against Z. seriolae. In comparison, praziquantel administered alone resulted in fewer B. seriolae (68.3 &#8211; 69.7 % reduction) than the same doses of praziquantel combined with cimetidine (36.9 &#8211; 40.9 % reduction). A 90.4 -100% reduction in H. heterocerca was achieved when praziquantel was administered by intubation to S. quinqueradiata in Japan but there was only a 22-77.8 % reduction in B. seriolae. The dose of PZQ (150 mg kg&#8315;&#185;  body weight day&#8315;&#185; for 3 days) on the label of a commercially available product used to treat B. seriolae in Japanese aquaculture resulted in a 50.9% reduction against B. seriolae, but completely eliminated H. heterocerca. In trials against Z. seriolae and B. seriolae on S. lalandi in South Australia, I also screened 27 other anthelmintics and antiparasitics from the chemical groups: amprolium derivatives, benzimidazoles, benzyl ureas, diphosphate salts, imidazothiazoles, macrocyclic lactones, nitromidazoles, organophosphates, piperazines, salicylanilides, substituted phenols and tetrahydropyrimidines. Of these, only the benzimidazole, albendazole, was effective against Z. seriolae and none appeared to have an effect against B. seriolae.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Monogenea; sea-cage aquaculture; praziquantel; anthelmintics; oral treatments; Carangidae; Seriola Ialandi; Seriola quinqueradiata; Platyhelminthes; Benedenia seriolae; Heteraxine heterocerca; Zeuxapta seriolae</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60980</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Weight management in young women.</field><field name="creator">Lim, Siew S.</field><field name="description">Context: Young women are at high risk of weight gain but there has been limited knowledge on weight management in this group. Hyperandrogenemia and menstrual abnormalities are common co-morbidities of obesity in young women but their associations with food cravings are not known. Metformin has been shown to reduce body weight and improve metabolic outcomes in older adults but its effects on healthy overweight and obese young women have not been investigated. Quantitative lifestyle advice has been shown to be effective in inducing weight loss but its psychological effects on young women have not been extensively studied. The overall objective of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of metformin, quantitative lifestyle advice and internet-based intervention on weight management in young. Methods: In the first 12-weeks, 203 overweight and obese young women (BMI 33.3&#177;0.3 kg/m&#178; , age 28&#177;0.3 years; age range:17-37) were randomized to one of three treatment arms to receive metformin (Diabex XR 1500mg a day) plus qualitative lifestyle advice (M-QL), placebo plus qualitative lifestyle advice (P-QL) or a structured lifestyle program (L-QT). L-QT consisted of an energy restricted diet with quantitative lifestyle advice (6000KJ; 40% protein, 40% carbohydrate, 30% fat), structured exercise program, and behavioural therapy. From weeks 13 to 48, all participants were placed on the structured lifestyle program conducted through a website. Outcome measures include body weight, fasting lipids, insulin, glucose, psychological distress, self-esteem, food cravings, energy intake and physical activity. Primary analyses were conducted using linear mixed models. Results: At baseline, psychological distress and hyperandrogenemia were associated with increased food cravings (P&lt;0.01). At 12-weeks, L-QT group had greater weight loss (-4.2&#177;0.4 kg) compared to M-QL (-1.0&#177;0.4 kg) and P-QL groups (-0.2&#177;0.3 kg) (P&lt;0.001). Attrition at week 12 was high particularly in L-QT group, ie 48% (28/59) for L-QT group, 34% (22/65) for M-QL group and 29% (23/79) for P-QL group (P=0.08). Baseline psychological distress and food cravings predicted attrition at week 12. At week 12, L-QT group had significantly greater improvements in psychological distress (-3.0+0.9 vs -0.84+0.52, P=0.013) and self-esteem (3.2&#177;0.8 vs -0.04&#177;0.4, P&lt;0.001) compared to the M-QL and P-QL groups. At 48 weeks, both QT and QL groups maintained significant weight loss (-4.8&#177;0.1 kg vs -1.3&#177;0.4 kg respectively, P=0.0005). Weight changes from week 13 to 48 were similar between the groups (P&gt;0.05). Attrition was similarly high in both groups by week 48 (78%; 159/203) (P=0.003). Being married or having children predicted attrition at week 48. Conclusions: A structured lifestyle intervention program was more effective than metformin in achieving weight loss in young women. Quantitative lifestyle advice produced greater improvements in psychological outcomes compared to qualitative lifestyle advice. Internet-based weight loss program was effective in maintaining weight loss in young women independent of initial weight loss. High attrition rates were seen throughout the study, particularly among those who had greater psychological distress or food cravings, and those who were married or had children. Strategies on managing issues relating to psychological distress, food cravings and family responsibilities may allow better tailoring of weight management programs for this group.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">obesity; weightloss; young women</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60981</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mulches in smallholder maize systems in the Limpopo Province of South Africa: untangling the effects of N through experimentation and simulation.</field><field name="creator">Sasa, Seshuhla Rebinah</field><field name="description">In Limpopo Province of South Africa, poor soil fertility and low crop yields are serious problems facing resource poor smallholder farmers. A survey of over 60 farmers in 2 villages (Gabaza and GaKgoroshi) found that most of the smallholder farmers were women (68%), elderly (50% above 68 years of age) and had not attended school or only attended up to the primary level (80%). Very few farmers kept livestock (usually in small numbers) and most grew cereal and legume crops (on 1ha of land) for home consumption and livestock feed, with legumes being planted on 13% of the land. The study showed that 80% of farmers were not fully aware of the benefits of legumes in fixing nitrogen (N) and improving yield. A field study at the survey village of Gabaza found that the application of fertiliser N and grass mulch combination and fertiliser N plus guarbean mulch significantly increased plant height and maize shoot growth at 4 and 8 weeks after planting. However, when grass mulch was without N fertiliser, there was no increase in maize growth relative to the control (0N). A farming systems simulation model (Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator - APSIM) was used to simulate this field study as well as over the long-term (1971 to 2008). Simulation analysis showed poor average maize yield (&lt;3000 kg ha&#8315; &#185;) with the application of grass residues even when used with 30 kg N fertiliser. However, the application of guarbean residues as mulch with or without N fertiliser and as green manure increased maize yields to &gt;4000 kg ha&#8315; &#185;. Simulation showed that the grass mulch with or without the addition of N fertiliser reduced water stress and soil water evaporation but increased N stress during the reproductive phase of the crop in most seasons. When guarbean mulch was used as green manure by itself, or mulch plus N fertiliser, N stress was reduced but water stress and soil water evaporation were increased which could have been due to faster decomposition of legume mulch as compared to grass mulch. Addition of N fertiliser reduced N stress to maize but increased water stress and soil water evaporation similar to the guarbean mulch because of high soil evaporation. APSIM analysis clearly showed the importance of N x soil water interactions in determining maize growth and yield at Gabaza. Therefore, two studies were undertaken in the laboratory in Australia to determine the dynamics of carbon (C) and N where residues of different qualities [canola (C:N 43), wheat (26), pea (9) and mucuna (14)] were applied to clay loam (Tarlee) or sandy (Waikerie) soils. In experiment 1, where residues were incorporated into the two soils, the cumulative CO&#8322;-C evolution for the wheat and canola treatments at the end of the incubation period were fairly similar but significantly higher than for pea, mucuna and the control. In general, the application of residues increased microbial biomass C more than the control, with highest increases up to 1.48 and 1.56 mg C g&#8315; &#185; soil for canola and wheat in Tarlee soil, respectively and 0.82 mg C g&#8315; &#185; soil for pea in Waikerie soil. Even though the Tarlee soil showed greater C release than Waikerie soil, the C turnover from the residues between the 2 soils was not significantly different except for pea residues. Canola and wheat residues were found to immobilise N whereas N content increased in both soils with the application of legumes (pea and mucuna). In experiment 2, mucuna, pea and wheat residues were either incorporated or applied as surface mulches on Waikerie soil. Initially the CO&#8322;-C release was higher for incorporated than mulched residues and CO&#8322;-C released was higher for pea residues. However, at the end of the incubation more CO&#8322;-C was released with the application of wheat residue indicating differences between residue types in the pattern of soil respiration. Microbial biomass C was higher for incorporated than mulched residue treatments; pea residue showed the highest biomass C for incorporated (0.78 mg C g&#8315; &#185; soil) whereas mucuna had the highest microbial biomass (0.11 mg C g&#8315; &#185; soil) treatments. The method of residue application resulted in a significant difference in C turnover between residues, with pea residue showing significant increase in C utilisation than mucuna and wheat. The pea residues, which had the lowest C:N, increased soil mineral N more than other treatments in both incorporated and mulched treatments. Lower mineralisation of N observed in residues of high C:N ratio compared to the control could be due to immobilisation of N. Therefore, understanding the nutrient dynamics of different crop residues could play an important role in the management of residues in different soil types. Based on these results it can be concluded that legume residues have the potential to improve soil fertility and crop yields in dryland farmers&#8217; fields in Limpopo. Extension programs aimed at increasing farmers&#8217; knowledge of the benefits of N fixation by legumes may increase their adoption and thereby improve soil fertility and maize yield.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">smallholder; maize; legume; mulch; grass mulch; N fertiliser; APSIM; N mineralization; carbon mineralization</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60984</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of the flow properties of New Zealand wood pulp suspensions</field><field name="creator">Duffy, Geoffrey G.</field><field name="description">One of the most important process operations in the pulp and paper industry is the transport of pulp in pipe lines. Because pipe friction losses are much higher than with water under comparable conditions, accurate design correlations for each pulp are important to the industry. The purpose of this investigation was to design and build a flow rig suitable for investigating a wide range of pulp conditions, to obtain pipe friction loss data for New Zealand pulps, and to produce design correlations and procedures for the industry. This thesis is therefore concerned primarily with describing the experimental equipment and procedures, presenting pipe friction loss data for a variety of New Zealand pulps, including a design correlation for them, and developing design methods for computing friction losses. It includes, in addition, data on drag reduction observed at high velocities of flow, and a discussion of flow mechanisms in each regime of flow. The equipment was designed to produce friction loss data from three pipe diameters simultaneously for each consistency of pulp. Flow rate was controlled without throttling the flow. Pipe friction loss data are presented for five Kraft pulps and one neutral sulphite semi-chemical pulp. Data were obtained from 1,2,3 and 4 in. diameter PVC pipes for a wide range of consistencies and flow rates up to 0.8 ft3/sec. Standard Lampen mill evaluations on hand sheets made from the pulps are presented, as well as data on the characteristics of the fibres. The Kraft pulps exhibited the characteristic maxima and minima but the semi-chemical pulp did not exhibit these turning points. For Kraft pulps head losses before the respective maxima were increased by refining the pulp and using rough pipe; and decreased by adding short-fibre Tawa and by drying and reslushing the pulp. In comparison with maxima for the unbeaten Kraft Pulp, the maxima of the head loss curves for all Kraft pulps were shifted to lower velocities by the above-mentioned operations. This would reduce the friction loss in many practical cases. In particular, rough pipe lowers the magnitude of friction loss in this regime, and can therefore yield a considerable economic advantage. A single design correlation for Kraft pulps is presented for the regime of flow before the maxima in the head loss curves. The limits of the correlation are given. Friction losses of New Zealand pulps were found to be lower than those previously reported in the literature. Two methods of design are presented for the regimes at velocities above the maxima in the head loss curves. A procedure is suggested for pulp and paper mills to obtain their own limits for the design correlation and to verify the correlation proposed in this investigation for their own pulps. A design correlation for the Tawa NSSC pulp is also presented. Mechanisms of flow are discussed for Kraft pulps and a semi-chemical pulp. Visual observations in an artificially roughened pipe for the regime of flow before the maxima of the head loss curves have confirmed fibre-wall contact in this regime. Data obtained at the first sign of permanent plug disruption have been correlated with data at the onset of drag reduction. Fully developed turbulence was found to occur at the maximum level of drag reduction. Some velocity profiles are reported for the transition regime using a modified annular-purge probe. In addition the disruptive shear stress of fibre networks has been correlated by three different methods. Data for the onset of drag reduction are presented and compared with data previously obtained from large diameter pipes from other investigations. This correlation is used as a method for designing piping systems at high flow rates.</field><field name="date">1972</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2532</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of UHF communications on overhead earth-wires in power transmission networks</field><field name="creator">Castle, N. J.</field><field name="description">The motivation for this research is a proposed UHF surface wave communication system in which the waveguides are the stranded, overhead earth wires of Power System transmission lines. Attention is confined largely to an investigation of certain aspects which affect the overall surfaces wave transmission loss, a full-scale system having been set up in the laboratory for experimental purposes. For the prediction of transmission loss the stranded conductor is assumed to be equivalent to a solid conductor of the same diameter but with surface anisotropy in the form of two mutually orthogonal surface impedances the major reactive component of which is attributed to the effects of the helical stranding. This reactance is determined from a consideration of the fields which are assumed to exist within the cavities between the strands, and externally. From a comparison between experimental and theoretical loss characteristics there is sufficient inducement to accept the anisotropic model of the stranded conductor for practical design purposes. Approximate equations are developed to simplify the calculation of transmission loss and the notion of &#8216;capture cross-section&#8217; is employed for the estimation of the efficiency of conical horn launchers. It is deduced from &#8216;sensitivity&#8217; relationships that the horn loss is relatively insensitive to small changes in the fictitious surface reactance representing the effects of helical stranding, which tends to justify the assumptions upon which the anisotropic model is based. On the other hand, variations in the helix angle are shown to have a marked effect upon the calculated horn loss. This influences the choice of the stranded conductor used as the waveguide for the experimental verification of the model. The Author&#8217;s experimental research is described at length, the principal objective being to establish the anisotropic model as an acceptable theoretical substitute for the stranded conductor. To reduce the horn loss, dielectric sheaths are ted to the waveguide in the vicinity of the horn apertures. The discrepancies which then appear between theory and experiment are attributed both to the scattering of the surface wave by the boundary discontinuities at the ends of the sheaths and to the anomalous behaviour of commercial-grade PVC dielectric. Considering the increase in the transmission efficiency which may be realised by fitting dielectric sheaths to the conductor near the horn apertures it is concluded that a theoretical investigation of the scattering properties of the discontinuities  s in order. Thus, the remainder of the Thesis is devoted, to this scattering effect as it may be encountered in the proposed scheme, the theoretical analysis following the lines of earlier documented research. A short-cut method is applied for the determination of certain &#8216;half-plane&#8217; functions which appear in the expressions for the scattered power. Theoretical results are presented together with a discussion of some experimental measurements and a brief theoretical examination of the effects on the horn loss of varying the thickness of the dielectric sheaths. It is argued that the horn loss may be reduced if the dielectric thickness is graded in steps to a value at the horn apertures consistent with the desired &#8216;power capture&#8217;. The Thesis is concluded with an Addendum which outlines a number of topics suggested by the Author for future research.</field><field name="date">1976</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290900 Electrical and Electronic Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2542</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors influencing nutrition risk of older New Zealanders : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Human Nutrition at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Carr, Rosemary Joy</field><field name="description">As the population ages it is increasingly important to understand the factors influencing dietary habits of older people. Social, biological and psychological factors influence food intake and affect nutrition risk among older people living in the community. The purpose of this study was to identify food-related behaviours that place older people at nutrition risk and to evaluate older peoples&#8217; perceptions and experiences of various nutrition support options. Fifty-one community living people aged between 80 and 85 years were recruited in North Shore City. Food-related behaviours were explored with the use of three quantitative tools. Practitioner Assessment of Network Type (PANT) was used to evaluate social networks. Elderly Assessment System (EASY-Care) was used to evaluate physical and mental wellbeing. Seniors in the Community: Risk Evaluation for Eating and Nutrition Version II (SCREEN II) assessed nutrition risk. Five people participated in a qualitative interview about nutrition support they had received. A third of the participants (31 percent) were found to be at nutrition risk. Twothirds (67 percent) showed some evidence of disability and needed assistance with everyday tasks. Nearly half (47 percent) of these older people had supportive social networks including close relationships with local family, friends and neighbours. There was an inverse linear relationship between participants&#8217; self-rated health and nutrition risk (p&lt;.001). Those who perceived their health to be fair or poor were more likely to be at nutrition risk. The importance of social contact, a sense of gratitude, &#8216;getting a meal&#8217;, and &#8216;meeting the need&#8217; were common themes that emerged from interviews with participants who received nutrition support. These findings indicate that nutrition risk may be prevalent among community living older people in New Zealand. Strategies and initiatives are needed to encourage independent living and to help older people with the procurement, preparation, cooking and sharing of enjoyable meals.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nutrition</field><field name="subject">aged</field><field name="subject">old people</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321205 Nutrition and dietetics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/859</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Lady, is this civilisation?' : a case study of community participation in a health development programme in Aotearoa New Zealand : a thesis presented in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Development Studies at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Batten, Lesley Susan</field><field name="description">Community participation is a key feature of major global health declarations and a fundamental principle of health strategies in Aotearoa New Zealand. However, the frequency with which it is espoused belies the complexities associated with its practical application. Engaging communities in primary health care programmes designed to improve their health has been identified as a major challenge. This study&#8217;s objective was to explore community members&#8217; perspectives of participation within a health development programme. The programme chosen aimed to increase the fruit and vegetable intake of targeted population groups, including M ori, Pacific peoples, and low income earners. A qualitative instrumental case study approach was adopted to examine the programme and investigate what influenced, constrained, and sustained community participation. Data collection included fieldwork over an eighteen-month period. Two programme projects were selected as the study foci: a communityled project involving distributions of thousands of free heritage variety plants; and, instigated by health services, a project establishing community gardens. These projects provided markedly different pictures of participation occurring within the same programme. The plant distributions had widespread appeal, while the community garden faltered. Community participation fitted within a description of &#8216;focused social action&#8217;. Participation was motivated by needs, values, and interests. While some were personal and family based, the programme also became an imagined vehicle for addressing wider health, social justice, and environmental sustainability goals. Ongoing challenges related to defining targeted communities and groups, varying degrees and types of participation, and different perspectives of participation, especially as health sector staff worked from an equity mandate and community members spoke of equality. Programme groups established as mechanisms to foster community participation had contradictory effects, engaging some as advisors, while failing to reach communities targeted for the programme. The complexities of health sector bureaucracy both enabled and constrained the programme and community participation. This thesis provides an in-depth examination of the complexities of community participation in action, the contradictory effects of contexts enveloping programmes, and the resolve of community members. It increases our understandings of how community members perceive health programmes and community participation, which are critical factors in improving population health.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">community participation</field><field name="subject">primary health care programmes</field><field name="subject">disadvantaged communities</field><field name="subject">Maori and Pacific</field><field name="subject">health promotion</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">fruit and vegetable intake</field><field name="subject">community gardens</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321216 Health promotion</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/886</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Switching costs in the New Zealand banking market : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Banking at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand / Claire Dianne Matthews</field><field name="creator">Matthews, Claire Dianne</field><field name="description">This thesis explores issues related to bank switching costs, in the context of the New Zealand banking market. Switching costs comprise the range of economic costs faced by customers changing bank, including monetary switching costs, the loss of the relationship with bank staff, and needing to learn new systems. An important effect of switching costs is customers become locked in to their bank, which has implications for market competition, and this raises questions about the need for a regulatory response. The study comprised a mail survey to 2983 people drawn from New Zealand electoral rolls, with a response rate of 34%. The survey instrument was a questionnaire of 70 questions in four sections: banking relationships, switching behaviour, switching costs, and demographic information. Nine categories of switching costs were used: Learning, Search, Monetary Loss, Benefit Loss, Personal Relationship, Brand Relationship, Service Disruption, Uncertainty, and Hassle. These categories are found to be appropriate. Furthermore, the three higher order categories of Procedural, Financial and Relational found by Burnham, Frels and Mahajan (2003) are confirmed. Although prior studies have recognised different switching costs, there has been limited work to understand whether they differ in their impact on attitudes and behaviour around switching. Different switching costs are found to have different effects. The study also examined whether the experience of switching matches the perception, and found switching is easier than expected. Furthermore, customers who have switched banks have different perceptions of switching costs to those who have not. Customers are different, and their attitudes and needs should therefore vary. Prior research has found differences in attitudes towards financial issues based on the family life cycle, but the relationship between switching costs and family life cycle has not been explored. This thesis finds perceptions of switching costs and switching behaviour vary significantly between life cycle groups, which appears in part to be related to associated changes in the complexity of the banking relationship. Four recommendations for regulators are generated from the results of the study. These include recommending greater acknowledgement of the existence and effect of switching costs, and investigation of bank account number portability.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">banking</field><field name="subject">switching costs</field><field name="subject">changing bank</field><field name="subject">market competition</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350300 Banking, Finance and Investment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1108</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Public prototyping : a participatory design process exploring the application of co-creative sketching : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Design, Massey University, Institute of Communication Design, College of Creative Arts, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Pittar, Luke</field><field name="description">The objective of this research is to demonstrate that co-creative sketching as a part of the participatory process has the potential to support the developmental nature of a visual communication tool used to promote the exchange of experience. The tool is intended to create an informative hub that influences a travellers experience of a location. Ethnographic research as reflective sketching was conducted in the Tongariro National Park. Within this setting reflective sketching located the kitchen and common area of traveller specific accommodation as an ideal collaborative environment to conduct participatory design research. In this collaborative environment snowboarders and skiers who are aged between 20-30 years are identified as the target audience. This specific audience participated in co-creative sessions throughout the design process, resulting in the participatory design of the tool. The design aim of the visual communication tool was to promote the exchange of experience between snowboarders and skiers about a specific location. This was achieved by adapting generative tools made up of a visual language which supported the word of mouth exchange and individual expression. The exchange of experiences was facilitated by co-creative sketching with the visual language during a state of play. Playful co-creative sketching supported word of mouth dialogue between the snowboarders and skiers in a way that co-created an informative visual representation of the dialogue or contextmap. The resulting contextmap represented an image for experience which was beyond an individuals conception and made individuals tacit-knowledge accessible to audiences within and outside the moment of exchange, creating an informative hub which influenced the specific audiences view of experience for a location. An action research methodology is used during the course of this research, informed by the approaches of co-creation, context-mapping and generative tools. These approaches constructed a theoretical framework for the participatory development and co-creative sketching of the communication tool. This supportive thesis discusses the context, the theoretical concepts and provides an in depth account on the research through design process; the week-by-week participatory process undertaken to develop the visual communication tool.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Communication design</field><field name="subject">Co-creation</field><field name="subject">Visual communication</field><field name="subject">Snowboarding</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410300 Cinema, Electronic Arts and Media Studies::410306 Communications and media studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1340</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Integrating gender into planning, management and implementation of rural energy technologies : the perspectives of women in Nepal : a thesis submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Development Studies, School of People Environment and Planning at Massey University, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Mahat, Ishara</field><field name="description">Women in rural Nepal are heavily involved in management of energy resources particularly biomass, which constitute the main form of rural energy as is the case in most developing countries. Women's most time consuming activities in rural areas of Nepal are cooking, collecting firewood, and processing grain, all of which are directly associated with the rural energy system. Despite women's strategic interests in improved rural energy in Nepal, energy planners (normally male) rarely consider women's roles, needs, and priorities when planning any interventions on rural energy. This study targeted at rural women in the mid hill region of Nepal, has examined the socio-economic implications of alternative energy technologies (AETs) especially in terms of saving women's labor and time and increasing opportunities for them to participate in social and economic activities. The analysis indicates that there is a positive implication of AETs on women's workload especially with access to the micro hydro mills available in the villages. In general, women have been able to save their labor and time in collecting firewood, and milling activities, although this is not always apparent due to women using the saved time for other household chores. However, AETs were rarely used for promoting end use activities (such as, energy based small cottage industries) in order to enhance women's socio-economic status. In addition, AETs had rather limited coverage and were not able to fulfill the energy demands of all rural households. There were also limitations in the adoption of such technologies mainly due to financial, technical, and social problems. For instance, the solar photovoltaic system and biogas plants were still costly for the poorest households even with subsidies. Consequently, socio-economic gaps within small communities widened and became highly visible with access to such technologies. Women's participation was mainly in terms of their involvement in community organizations (COs) and representation in Village Energy Committees (VECs) rather than their active participation in planning and decision-making processes with regard to AETs. Nevertheless, women were actively involved in providing labor in construction work relating to AETs, and creating and mobilizing saving funds as a means to be involved in small income generating activities associated with AETs. This study ultimately suggests a framework for increasing women's participation in rural energy plans and programs at local and national level, and develops policy measures to enable integration of gender into energy planning and policies. This would help to address practical and strategic gender needs in terms of fulfilling basic energy needs managed by women, and providing them with opportunities to be involved in some social and economic activities, which lead towards the self-enhancement of women.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rural women</field><field name="subject">Women's status</field><field name="subject">Energy development</field><field name="subject">Participation in development</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::379900 Other Studies In Human Society::379901 Gender specific studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1744</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Low back pain : a personal projects analysis : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Psychology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Vroman, Kerryellen Griffith</field><field name="description">Low back pain is characterised by loss of ability to carry out everyday tasks, the disruption of life plans, and psychological distress as well as pain. This study examined the adaptation of individuals with low back pain. In a departure from established models used to study and understand illness representation and adjustment, this study used a personal projects approach to examine the relationship between individuals' appraisals of projects and their functional adaptation to low back pain in the context of their day-to-day goal-directed activities. A functional personal project system was proposed; specifically, those individuals whose project dispositions were highly concordant and socially oriented would have better function and health. For people dealing with low back pain, it was expected that these dispositions, and personal competency, would enhance adaptation. Conversely, poor adaptive abilities, such as difficulties with physical function, social function, and poorer health, would be associated condition-specific perceptions of pain and negative appraisals of project stress[.] The results showed there was a relationship between personal project dispositions and functional ability, well-being, and perceived general health of individuals with low back pain. The results did not confirm that a functional project system possessed adaptive benefits. However, the appraisal of pain as salient to the progress and success of projects and stressfulness of personal projects were predictive of limited function and poorer health. Notably, all aspects of function, both social and physical, were associated with pain-salience cognition. Furthermore, pain salience cognition was still predictive of function after traditional predictors of low back pain disability, pain severity or pain-related fear, were included in the analysis. The significance of the relationship of pain and negative appraisals of the effect of pain on performance supports functional self-efficacy and pain-related fears models used to explain disability level in individuals with low back pain. Since this personal projects analysis was an integrated assessment of individuals' dispositions in the context of participants' everyday lives, it was concluded that pain salience and stressfulness of projects outweighed any advantages offered by their other dispositions in negotiating the participant's personal projects.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lower back pain</field><field name="subject">Psychological effect of pain</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380107 Health, clinical and counselling psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1745</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Phytoremediation of mercury-contaminated mine wastes : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Soil Science, Massey University, Palmerston North</field><field name="creator">Morena, F&#225;bio Netto</field><field name="description">Content removed due to copyright restrictions: Anderson, C., Moreno, F., &amp; Meech, J.

This thesis documents the conservation ecology and phylogeography of an endangered lizard, Oligosoma grande, from southern New Zealand, and tests hypotheses that may explain its endangered status. Grand skinks are large rock-dwelling lizards endemic to montane grasslands in central Otago, New Zealand. They are classified as vulnerable to extinction by IUCN criteria and are the subject of intensive management. The causes of their endangerment are not well understood, but changes to landscape connectivity caused by agricultural development have been implicated. I developed microsatellite and mitochondria1 DNA markers, and combined them with field studies to address four key problems relevant to the conservation of this species. First, I investigated the ability of newly developed analytical tools for genetic data (assignment tests) to provide qualitative and quantitative dispersal information. I show that assignment tests can provide highly accurate dispersal information, and describe the circumstances where they perform best. Second, building on these results, I combined genetic and demographic data to provide an empirical account of how two forms of agricultural landuse affect the connectivity of skink populations. I show that the nature of the vegetation matrix between skink populations both quantitatively and qualitatively affected dispersal patterns, but also that characteristics of individual populations play a role in determining dispersal dynamics. Third, following the evidence that grand skink populations were very insular, I used parentage and kinship analysis to investigate the extent of inbreeding and inbreeding avoidance behaviours. It is often assumed that close inbreeding is harmful and animals should avoid it by either dispersing after birth, or recognising and avoiding mating with kin. However, I found no evidence for inbreeding avoidance or inbreeding depression. Finally, I used phylogeographic analyses to understand the contributions of historical and contemporary processes to O. grande's rarity and fragmented distribution. I demonstrate that that the current fragmented distribution has both historical as well as recent anthropogenic origins. Some populations show evidence of recent declines that may have occurred since human settlement in New Zealand, but in addition, more ancient biogeographic processes have driven population fragmentation.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Skink population dispersal</field><field name="subject">Endangered lizards</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science::300805 Conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1747</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understorey effects on phosphorus fertiliser response of second-rotation Pinus radiata : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Soil Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ravaie, A. Arivin</field><field name="description">The current silvicultural regimes of Pinus radiata plantations in New Zealand with wider initial tree spacings have created the potential for increased growth of understorey vegetation. A consequence of this is that the response of P. radiata to P fertiliser is expected to be more influenced by the interaction between the P fertiliser, the tree and the understorey vegetation than was the case in the past. The objectives of this study were to investigate the influence of different rates of a soluble and a sparingly-soluble P fertiliser (Triple superphosphate and Ben-Geurier phosphate rock) and weed control, and their interactions, on soil P chemistry and the growth and P uptake of 4-5-year-old second-rotation P. radiata on an Allophanic Soil (Kaweka forest) and a Pumice Soil (Kinleith forest). The results showed that the application of P fertilisers had no effect on P. radiata growth at both field trial sites two years after this treatment, although it increased radiata needle P concentration. However, at both sites, the understorey vegetation removal treatment increased tree diameter at breast height and basal area. At the highly P-deficient (Bray-2 P 4 &#181;g g-1) Kaweka forest, the presence of understorey (bracken fern and some manuka) reduced resin-Pi and Olsen P concentrations, but at the moderate P fertility (Bray-2 P 13 &#181;g g-1) Kinleith forest, the understorey (Himalayan honeysuckle, buddleia and some toetoe) increased Bray-2 P, resin-Pi, and Olsen P concentrations. A glasshouse study on P. radiata seedlings was conducted to test the hypothesis that when ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum) is grown with P. radiata, it increases radiata needle P concentration, while when broom (Cytisus scoparius L.) is grown with P. radiata, it has no effect. The acid phosphatase activity in the rhizosphere of P. radiata was higher when radiata was grown with broom than that when it was grown with ryegrass. This is consistent with the higher P concentration in needles of radiata grown with broom than that of radiata grown with ryegrass, in the absence of P fertiliser addition. However, when P fertiliser was added (50 and 100 &#181;g P g-1 soil) the needle P concentration of radiata grown with broom was lower than that when radiata was grown with ryegrass.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Effects of fertiliser</field><field name="subject">Soil chemistry</field><field name="subject">Understorey vegetation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300100 Soil and Water Sciences::300103 Soil chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1748</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spatial patterns of invertebrate communities in spring and runoff-fed streams : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Ecology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Barqu&#237;n Ortiz, Jos&#233;</field><field name="description">Invertebrate spatial patterns were investigated in 36 and 12 spring and runoff-fed streams in New Zealand and in Northern Spain, respectively. Moss biomass and resource levels were more abundant in springbrooks than in runoff-fed streams. Invertebrate densities were greater in spring habitats, but invertebrate richness was higher and lower at more stable sites in New Zealand and Spain, respectively. These differences in invertebrate diversity may be related to the larger diversity of invertebrate predators in New Zealand springbrooks, and the lack of temperature mediated life history cues in the New Zealand invertebrate fauna. I carried out two experiments to look at the effect of local factors on the spatial distribution of invertebrate communities. The first experiment investigated the effect that algal biomass and habitat structure had on stream invertebrate communities. To do this I used artificial canopies to reduce algal growth and artificial substrates with different habitat complexities. Numbers of invertebrate taxa and individuals were both lower on bricks under the artificial canopies and on the simplest substrates. Algal productivity may enhance invertebrate richness by increasing the number of individuals in a given area, whereas habitat complexity may increase invertebrate richness by providing greater food and/or space resources. The second experiment examined the effects of primary productivity and physical disturbance on stream invertebrates by using artificial canopies and by kicking and raking patches of the stream bed (10 m2). We compared the effects of natural versus experimental disturbance on the benthic invertebrate fauna Invertebrate fauna in high productivity patches recovered quicker than in low productivity patches after both experimental and natural disturbance. The experimental disturbance reduced number of invertebrate taxa and individuals to a greater extent than the spate. Primary productivity limited the recovery of the invertebrate fauna after the disturbances. I also investigated temperature patterns in five runoff and seven spring-fed streams in the North and South Islands of New Zealand. The invertebrate fauna was sampled at 4 distances (0, 100, 500 and 1 km) from seven spring sources. Temperature variability was much larger for runoff-fed streams than for springs, and it increased with distance from the source. Flow, altitude, and the number and type (i.e., spring or runoff-fed) of tributaries joining the springbrook channel determined the degree of temperature variability downstream of the spring sources. Moving downstream, invertebrate communities progressively incorporated taxa with higher mobility and those more common to runoff-fed streams. Changes in substrate composition, stability and invertebrate drift are more likely explanations of the observed longitudinal patterns in the invertebrate communities than changes in temperature regimes.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Freshwater invertebrates</field><field name="subject">Ecology</field><field name="subject">Stream ecology</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270701 Freshwater ecology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1749</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards an integrated biopsychosocial risk model of distress disorder aetiology for children of middle childhood : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Psychology, Massey University</field><field name="creator">Stuart, Nancy Eleanor</field><field name="description">Recent theoretical developments both within and outside the clinical literature have stressed the complex interactions between biological and environmental risk in relation to psychopathology development. They have also highlighted the importance of cognitive dimensions, especially those related to control perceptions, in the developmental path towards anxiety and mood disorders in children. Few studies have investigated these cognitive dimensions in relation to risk and protective factors. In light of these considerations, the present study evaluated structural models investigating the relationship of perceived control and competence to child temperamental risk, parent personal risk, family environmental risk and anxious and depressed feelings. It was hypothesised that temperamental, and psychological risk in relationship to family environment would be mediated by the cognitive dimensions of perceived control and competence. It was further hypothesised that family environment, would mediate the relationship between child temperamental risk and anxious and depressed feelings. A school sample of 293 New Zealand children aged between 8 and 11 and their parents was assessed using a cross-sectional design. Overall results indicated that in the face of temperamental and family adversity, feeling in control of emotions and social interactions and feeling socially competent afforded children protection from anxious or depressed feelings. In addition, a sensitive, accepting family environment was seen to protect a temperamentally vulnerable child from distressed feelings. In contrast, distress was more likely to occur when a temperamentally vulnerable child lived in a family characterised by parental psychological control and conflict than one characterised by less cohesion and parental rejection. Results also indicated that, in terms of cognitive features, perceptions of social competence were particularly important in protecting a child from having anxious or depressed feelings. These findings are discussed in relationship to Barlow's and other recent integrated aetiological theories of distress disorder. Findings are also considered in relation to implications for identification, intervention and prevention strategies for distressed children in both clinical and school populations. Further results, limitations and proposals for future research are also discussed.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychopathology</field><field name="subject">Child anxiety</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380103 Biological psychology (neuropsychology, psychopharmacology, physiological psychology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1750</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Palynological evidence of vegetation dynamics in relatively undisturbed and disturbed sites in New Zealand : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Li, Xun</field><field name="description">New Zealand forest has been affected by both natural and anthropogenic disturbances. Protecting and restoring indigenous forest is one of the focal issues in conservation of New Zealand, and understanding vegetation dynamics is a key part of management strategies. The longevity of most of New Zealand trees impedes short-term vegetation dynamic studies. Instead fossil pollen records provide one of the most valuable sources of long term data to trace vegetation development. In this study, pollen records are used as proxies of vegetation population to test the roles of long-term climate change and transient environmental disturbances in vegetation dynamics. Two sediment cores, from Sponge Swamp, Haast, and Tiniroto Lakes, Gisborne, were collected as representatives of undisturbed and disturbed sites, the former being used as a reference site to separate out the effects of climate and evaluate the impact of disturbance on the vegetation. Pollen data were inspected using Tilia, and zones defined. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on pollen data to summarise the change in species composition over time, and the sample scores of the first PCA axis were exploited as an index of vegetation dynamics for further comparison. Redundancy analysis (RDA) is also applied to help interpretation of the vegetation change with respect to environmental factors. The result of this study indicates that the vegetation development in both sites is characterized by non-equilibrium dynamics, in which vegetation composition is changing continually through time. In Sponge Swamp, this change is steady and consistent over the whole time span, with a consistent decline of Ascarina lucida and a progressive increase of cold tolerant or moisture-stressed taxa, like Gleichenia and Lycopodium australianum. Subsequently there is a partial replacement of swamp forest taxa such as Dacrycarps dacrydioides and tree ferns by Prumnopitys taxifolia, and further expansion of Nothofagus and Phyllocladus is distinguished. A climate gradient, from mild and wet to cooler and/or drier is suggested from the pollen evidence, and appears the driving force for the vegetation dynamics at that undisturbed site. At Tiniroto, however, the vegetation development is divided into two stages. Before c. 2300 yr BP, the vegetation change is steady and consistent which is comparable to that from Sponge Swamp. A forest invasion, a process of gradually replacing open land and light-adapted taxa, such as Dodonaea viscosa, Coprosma, Pseudopanax, Schefflera digitata, Pteridium, Hebe and members of the family Fabaceae and Asteraceae, by increasing proportions of forest taxa, characterise this change. Climate amelioration with increased rainfall is responsible. After c. 2300 yr BP, this trend was frequently punctuated by disturbances, in which sudden changes of vegetation occur, generating substantial fluctuations about the trend. From RDA, sample age explains more than 20% of the variance of species data at both sites. The long-term directional climate change derived from pollen evidence of Sponge Swamp and at least partly at the Tiniroto site, may be represented by the explanatory variable age. At Tiniroto, additional variance is also explained by the explanatory variables charcoal and pollen taxonomic richness, suggesting the impact of disturbance on vegetation dynamics. The impact of disturbance on vegetation dynamics becomes clearer after the climate gradient is removed. Autocorrelation analysis on detrended sample scores of the first PCA axis suggests further differences between the two sites, in response to local disturbances. There is little dependence of the present state of vegetation composition on its past state in the Sponge Swamp site; instead, the vegetation composition is affected by various "random" events, implying small disturbances such as floods, or landslides caused by earthquakes etc. At Tiniroto, the change of vegetation composition is more "successional", and the present state of vegetation depends only on the immediate past state, due to the impact of catastrophic disturbance. Despite the Tiniroto site having been subjected to a long history of disturbance, the climate gradient, which is distinct at the earlier stage, becomes less identifiable and partially masked by outbreaks of disturbances only since c. 2300 yr BP. This implies that the relative role of disturbance on vegetation dynamics with respect to climate is depended on different types or different levels of disturbances and different responses by the vegetation. Short-term vegetation responses to different types of disturbance were examined by fine resolution pollen analyses around five disturbance episodes, including the Taupo (1850&#177;10 yr BP), Waimihia (3280&#177;20 yr BP), Whakatane (4830&#177;20 yr BP) eruptions, and two charcoal peaks (c. 1100 yr BP and c. 2300 yr BP). Almost no vegetation change occurred relative to the eruption within the Whakatane and Waimihia episodes, except that a temporary rise of shrubs and ferns corresponded with intermittent occurrence of charcoal particles. Substantial vegetation change relative to disturbance was found within both the Taupo episode and the fire episode around c. 2300 yr BP, in which establishment of ensuing semi-open vegetation was encouraged for decades. The fire c. 2300 yr BP transformed part of the forest into fernland, while the Taupo eruption turned part of the shrubs and tree ferns into bracken field. Although it is difficult to judge the effect of the fire around 1100 yr BP as the result was unreliable due to contamination, the vegetation at Tiniroto is suggested to be more vulnerable to fire than tephra. Non-equilibrium dynamics are common in New Zealand forests, even at stable sites such as Sponge Swamp, due to climate change. Locally these non-equilibrium dynamics appear highly responsive to disturbances, esp. at Tiniroto. Even disturbances at Tiniroto are dynamic and a change of disturbance regime is suggested around the later disturbance episodes. This change is possibly due to climate increasing the fire frequency, but an alternative explanation is the presence of humans earlier than currently accepted. Forests and forest ecological studies in New Zealand are very dynamic, and forest management needs to improve to incorporate these dynamics.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Vegetation dynamics</field><field name="subject">Palynology</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370400 Human Geography::370499 Human geography not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1751</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Expression of hnRNPs A/B in cancer cells and their roles in carcinogenesis</field><field name="creator">He, Yaowu</field><field name="description">The identification of specific and reproducible biomarkers is critical for the early diagnosis of cancer, which has a profound effect the survival rate of patients. Comprehensive laboratory and clinical evidence needs to be collected to confirm the accuracy of the biomarkers prior to their clinical use. Heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) A2 and B1 have been suggested as biomarkers for cancer since 1988 when hnRNP A2/B1 overexpression was first linked with the occurrence of lung cancer. Later studies established a correlation between the expression levels of these hnRNPs and other cancers, such as breast, pancreatic, and lymphatic tumours. In this study, the expression of hnRNPs A1, A2, A3, and B1 has been investigated in various cancer cell lines. hnRNPs A1 and A3, in addition to A2 and B1, were found to be overexpressed in some cancer types. However, the overexpression of none of the hnRNP A/B proteins was universal, and their upregulation may be limited to a few cell types, suggesting they may be effective biomarkers for a subset of cancers. The upregulation of hnRNP A/B proteins in tumours and cancer cell lines led to the hypothesis that they are involved in the uncontrolled cell growth in cancer. According to our Western blot analysis, expression of the hnRNP proteins, A1, A2, and B1, is dependent on the cell cycle whereas no significant change was detected for hnRNP A3, implying that the former three are needed during certain cell cycle stages. The results, together with the transcription factor analysis of the promoter regions of the HNRPA1, HNRPA2, and HNRPA3 genes, suggest that hnRNPs A1, A2, and A3 may have distinct regulatory machineries and cellular functions although they have high amino acid sequence identity. However, their mRNA levels were unchanged across the cell cycle, suggesting the cell-cycle-dependent expression of hnRNPs A1, A2, and B1 is modulated at the translational level. Previous studies showed higher expression of hnRNPs A1 and A2 in rapidly proliferating cells than in quiescent cells, suggesting a role of these proteins in cell proliferation. Though interruption of hnRNP A1 expression did not result in significant change in the viability of murine CB3 cells, simultaneous suppression of hnRNPs A1 and A2 caused apoptosis in a few cell lines. Consistent with this, suppression of hnRNP A1 or A3 expression in our study in Colo16 squamous cells using RNA interference did not affect cell proliferation, but simultaneous suppression of both caused slow cell proliferation. By contrast, reduction of the hnRNP A2 level alone slowed the proliferation of Colo16 cells. These results suggest that although hnRNPs A1, A2, and A3 share some roles in cell proliferation, each of them may have distinct tasks. This conclusion is supported by the data from the comparative analysis of the downstream targets of hnRNPs A1, A2, and A3, which has shown that these three proteins share a limited number of common downstream proteins. The observed impact on cell proliferation of suppressing hnRNP A2 subfamily proteins is in accord with our finding that the downstream targets of hnRNP A2 are overrepresented by genes involved in proliferation regulation, as shown in microarray and real-time PCR analysis. These include cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors, p21 and p27, and their regulatory proteins, such as Skp2 and Rpn10. Skp2 controls the ubiquitination of p21 and p27, and Rpn10 links them to the 26S proteasome, the complex that degrades these two CDK inhibitors. hnRNP A2 also regulates the transcription of securin and separin, which are essential for sister chromatid separation during late anaphase. In addition, hnRNP A2 can also influence cell proliferation through cell growth factors, including fibroblast, vascular endothelial, transforming, and insulin growth factors. Our gene array and real-time PCR analysis have shown that hnRNP A2 regulates the expression of these factors, their receptors, or associated proteins such as IGFBP7 and TGFBR2. The data presented in this thesis link the overexpression of hnRNP A/B proteins, in particular the A2/B1 subfamily, in cancer with their regulatory roles in cell division and cell proliferation. Our findings provide mechanistic evidence that these proteins may be a driving force for the uncontrolled cell growth in cancer, suggesting that some of hnRNP A/B proteins may be potential therapeutic targets for cancer. However, further studies are needed to obtain a global view of the roles of these proteins in cancer.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270201 Gene Expression</field><field name="subject">780105 Biological sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158357</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of motivation through repertoire in intermediate cello students</field><field name="creator">Berry, Anne Irma</field><field name="description">The decision to research motivation through repertoire in intermediate cellists arose from two different perceived areas of need. Firstly, it was found that there was a scarcity of availability and accessibility of Australian compositions for intermediate cellists. Secondly, the literature suggested that there was a need for the further research of intrinsic motivation in the field of instrumental pedagogy. A review of the literature found that research into intrinsic motivation in instrumental pedagogy was mostly related to the 'process' of developing and maintaining motivation. Of the research which examined the aspect of 'content' in the maintenance of intrinsic motivation, this was mostly related to 'student choice'. This study emerged as a way of providing information to composers and teachers about what aspects of repertoire may be motivational. It investigates intrinsic motivation by questioning students and their teachers about which aspects of music repertoire are most likely to inspire students to practice more and strive for excellence. A discussion of the philosophies of Bruner and Csikszentmihalyi is included to give meaning and context to 'intrinsic motivation' in instrumental pedagogy. Research was conducted through purpose-designed questionnaires distributed to cello teachers and their students in Queensland. Questionnaires for teachers and students were very similar although the student questionnaire was a little shorter. The questionnaires gathered information on the most frequently used general teaching repertoire, as well as teachers&#146; experiences in teaching contemporary and Australian repertoire. Musical aspects investigated included style, emotional content, harmony, articulation, tempo (speed), tonality, and rhythm as well as cellistic techniques. This information was balanced with questions regarding the technical developmental requirements perceived necessary for intermediate students. In comparison with other motivators such as verbal encouragement, ensemble participation and preparation for performances and exams, repertoire was found to be a significant motivator for 'students' best work'. Students' preference for challenging music, or by contrast, beautiful music was a persistent theme throughout the results. The three characteristics which were nominated as most motivating by both teachers and students were fast and lively, from the Romantic period and for cello and piano. The strongest difference between results for teachers and students was on the characteristic of folk feel which produced opposite results for the two groups of respondents. Some differences were also found within the respondent groups on the basis of gender and age. It is noted that students acknowledged the benefits of learning more advanced aspects of technique, such as thumb position, in expanding the pool of repertoire which they would be able to play. It was confirmed that Australian repertoire was not often taught to students at this level and that this was, at least in part, because of a lack of availability. Suggestions have been made for both composers and teachers in choosing techniques and repertoire for intermediate students. However, the importance of asking students about their preferences is borne out by the volume and detail of students' individual responses. Also, by questioning their students, teachers are likely to be stimulating the valued development of 'metacognitive strategies' in adolescent students.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">410101 Music</field><field name="subject">750201 The performing arts (incl. music, theatre and dance)</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158346</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Leading conservatoria through change. New challenges for music institutions and their leaders, 1985-2005</field><field name="creator">Lancaster, Helen May</field><field name="description">Conservatoria in the past provided prospective musicians with training in performance, generally in the classical Western European tradition. Most of them were independent of universities, free from academic constraints, focused on performance, flexible in their practice, and desirous of (yet susceptible to) high profile individual leadership. The last two decades in particular have generated significant change, placing conservatoria under increasing pressure from new challenges. Now confronting those shifting boundaries which have reshaped the artistic climate and organisational environment, many are also compelled to broaden access whilst meeting the challenge of reduced government subsidy. New higher education policies and declining resources have caused the relocation of many conservatoria into the university sector, most particularly (but not exclusively) in Australia and the USA. This development has resulted in new systems of governance and different expectations of both the conservatorium and its leaders. Thus government policy impacts on the potential shape of the conservatorium. Changing funding structures in higher education and the arts further complicate the influence government policy might have on conservatoria. For autonomous conservatoria, government arts and education policies directly effect institutional policy and financial stability. Where conservatoria exist within universities, a domino effect devolves the impact of higher education policy to internal units like the conservatorium. Compounding these circumstances is the reality that traditional performance is diminishing in social relevance and the professions into which future music graduates will move are now more diverse than ever before and clearly less dependent solely on conventional music training. Consequently contemporary conservatorium leaders now confront a different, less compliant musical environment. Decisions made by these leaders have the potential to impact well beyond conservatorium walls. Therefore, for those conservatoria which have evolved as part of the cultural infrastructure of their respective communities, internal conservatorium choices may obscure the broader ramifications these choices have for the wider community. From inside the university sector, some conservatoria are challenged to give priority to the needs of the university community, with resultant effects on their individual conservatorium characters. The time-honoured preference for conservatorium leaders to be renowned musicians does not necessarily meet all of the contemporary criteria relevant to the role. Traditionally, leaders in conservatoria were selected for their artistic profile, ostensibly to enhance that of the institution. As spokespersons and figureheads of their institutions, leaders once made more artistic considerations and connections than strategic decisions. Whereas in years past they may have maintained high profile roles as conductors, performers, composers, or musicologists, now leaders are expected to provide varying degrees of artistic direction, academic leadership, curriculum design, administration, financial management, facilities management, event production, marketing, public relations, and community liaison. These diverse roles make an external career unrealistic for most. This dissertation examines the challenges confronting conservatoria as they appear through the eyes of conservatorium leaders around the world. By analysing the leaders&#146; comments in parallel with surveys, case examples, and documentary research, I aim to develop an understanding of the impact these challenges have on conservatoria and those who lead them. Through continual reporting of the emerging results back to the field during the period of the research, I build on their credibility, shedding light on those policies which both shape the conservatorium condition and elicit resilience among some who lead them. The thesis argues that each conservatorium is distinctive, and that the challenges confronting a conservatorium must be viewed in the light of its specific, often unique context. Among conservatoria, uniqueness emerges from the common ground that all such institutions share: within the context of conservatorium family resemblances, it may be that one conservatorium has a mix of quite distinctive attributes or conditions. It is that idiosyncratic set of circumstances shaping each institutional environment which generates this uniqueness, making generalisations problematical and inappropriate to the conservatorium condition. Each context is further complicated by constant change which is both evolutionary and imposed. For these reasons, there is no single profile fitting a conservatorium leader. Rather, leadership style needs to align to shifting circumstances, which implies that conservatorium leaders need to understand how to adjust their approach to leadership as the individual setting evolves. The argument is consistent with the findings that purposive preparation is crucial for leaders of contemporary conservatoria, to give them the diversity of skills required for the role and the flexibility necessary to adapt to changing circumstances. Because a conservatorium has the potential to be part of the cultural infrastructure of the community in which it resides, these conditions carry implications which extend beyond the conservatorium and have the capacity to impact on future generations. The conservatorium culture implies natural intersections with the community through the provision of performance and teaching services. Conservatorium facilities in their turn become part of the repertoire of community performance and recording resources. The extent to which this relationship might develop relies on each conservatorium&#146;s perception of its place within its own community, and each leader&#146;s interpretation of this positioning. A leader who places emphasis on external relationships might embed the institution within the community, socially and culturally. This combined understanding of the institution&#146;s role within the community is a significant factor in the realisation of each conservatorium&#146;s individual potential.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">410101 Music</field><field name="subject">750201 The performing arts (incl. music, theatre and dance)</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158250</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Playing musical hopscotch: How Indigenous Australian women perform around, within and against Aboriginalism.</field><field name="creator">Barney, Katelyn Sarah</field><field name="description">Indigenous Australian women who perform contemporary music are acutely aware that Aboriginalist discourse has created unrealistic expectations and public perceptions of Indigenous Australian performance. The theory of Aboriginalism is critiqued and interrogated in this thesis in relation to Indigenous Australian women, performance, and race. This thesis addresses the complex and contradictory ways that Aboriginalist discourse fixes non-Indigenous expectations of Indigenous Australian performance, gender, and race by exploring how the performers themselves work within and against these Aboriginalist constructions through their music. One of the immediate effects of Aboriginalism is that it silences Indigenous Australians. In academic discourse and popular media, the voices of Indigenous women who perform contemporary music are rarely heard and often overlooked or ignored. This thesis aims to redress and understand this gender imbalance by focusing on Indigenous women and their contemporary music and illustrate how Indigenous Australian women performers are enacting new types of agency to negotiate their way through, around, and over one-dimensional Aboriginalist constructions of themselves to self-define more positive and diverse identities as Indigenous Australian women. This thesis is divided into four parts. Part One (Chapters One, Two, and Three) provides necessary background to the study. Chapter One introduces the topic and poses research questions in relation to Aboriginalism, Indigenous women, and contemporary performance. Chapter Two examines a number of themes which emerge in the existing literature relating to Indigenous Australian musicians performing contemporary music. Chapter Three locates Indigenous Australian women in this academic discourse and explores some possible reasons for the increasing number of contemporary music recordings by Indigenous Australian women since the 1990s. Part Two (Chapters Four, Five, and Six) positions this study theoretically and methodologically. Chapter Four outlines the theoretical framework that informs this project while Chapter Five discusses the methodological issues and challenges I faced throughout the research process. Chapter Six introduces the Indigenous women performers who took part in this study. This chapter uses the literary convention of a &#147;playlet&#148; by weaving together comments of Indigenous Australian women performers from one-on-one interviews I conducted, media excerpts about the performers, as well as my own questions and comments into a conversation which tells a story about the performers&#146; backgrounds, experiences, albums, and achievements. Part Three (Chapters Seven, Eight, and Nine) comprises the analysis chapters and examines Aboriginalism in relation to race, gender, and performance. Each of these chapters utilise theoretical discussions of Aboriginalism, excerpts from interviews with Indigenous women performers, song texts, and media representations to examine how Indigenous women perform within and against Aboriginalism. Chapter Seven focuses on how Indigenous women performers resist Aboriginalist constructs of race through performance while Chapter Eight turns the gaze to gender and Aboriginalism to explore how the performers challenge Aboriginalist representations of Indigenous women by attempting bring Indigenous women&#146;s experiences, history, and topics to the foreground through song. Chapter Nine examines the way in which Indigenous women performers steer their way through Aboriginalism in music performance by blurring musical boundaries and drawing on a diverse range of musical styles. Finally, Part Four (Chapter Ten) discusses the possibilities of moving beyond Aboriginalism and reflects on my own contribution to discourse concerning Indigenous women performers.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">410101 Music</field><field name="subject">420303 Culture, Gender, Sexuality</field><field name="subject">410104 Indigenous Performing Arts</field><field name="subject">750201 The performing arts (incl. music, theatre and dance)</field><field name="subject">751005 Communication across languages and cultures</field><field name="subject">750309 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander development and welfare</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158217</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sedimentology of the South East Bowen Basin, South East Queensland, Australia, Implications for groundwater resources in the Kalahari basin of Botswana</field><field name="creator">Lasarwe, Reneilwe</field><field name="description">Sedimentary deposits are important aquifers in many parts of the world and in order to explore, develop and manage these aquifers, it is necessary to determine the relationship between the hydrogeologic properties and sedimentary facies (aquifer characterization). Within a sedimentary hydrogeologic system, the environment of deposition and the resulting distribution of grain sizes, texture, and facies associations within different individual aquifer bodies influence variations in hydraulic properties. Successful prediction of the quality of the aquifer is dependent on the accurate mapping of both lithologic units and hydrogeologic parameters. In this project, the influence of petrophysical characteristics of the sedimentary rocks to the quality of the aquifer is investigated with a view to finding a correlation between these characteristics, the type and nature of sedimentary rocks present and their hydrogeologic properties. Investigation methods involved the use of geophysical wireline log data, lithological core logging, thin section microscopy and X-Ray Diffraction analysis. All this was done to characterize the sedimentary rocks in terms of composition, grain size and diagenesis. Porosity tests were also performed on the samples collected while permeability data was collected from the Department of Natural Resources and Mines (DNR &amp; M), Australia. The basins of interest for this project are the Bowen Basin in Australia and the Kalahari Basin in Botswana. The two basins are similar, though structurally different. The basins are similar in the sense that they have got similarity in their rock sequence. All the work done on the Bowen Basin and the results obtained are extrapolated to the similar Kalahari Basin. The units of the Bowen Basin are underlain by the Late Carboniferous to Early Permian Camboon Volcanics. The Permian units include the Buffel, Barfield, Flat Top, and Gyranda Formations and the Baralaba Coal Measures. The Triassic units are the Rewan Group, Clematis Sandstone and Moolayember Formation. Within the Bowen Basin the Permian units are generally argillaceous and therefore have generally low porosities and permeabilities and also give low resistivity (RES) base lines and high gamma ray (GR) baselines. However where fractured, the units yield some water from the shale. Boreholes drawing water from the Barfield, Flat Top and Gyranda Formations tap the fractured shales. The Triassic aquifers present a different picture. The best aquifers with high porosities and permeabilities are of the Triassic age and their distribution is influenced by their proximity to the source area. Sedimentary rocks of the Triassic age in the Bowen Basin become more argillaceous at more distal positions from the source area. The Rewan Group in particular shows this trend and hence better aquifers within the Rewan are those close to the source area. The Kalahari Basin Karoo stratigraphy commences with the Late Carboniferous to Early Permian glaciogenic sedimentary rocks of the Dwyka Group. The Dwyka Group is overlain by the argillaceous Permian to Early Triassic sedimentary rocks of The Ecca Group and the Beaufort Group. Overlying the Beaufort Group is the Lebung Group (lower Mosolotsane Formation-dominantly mudstone and siltstone sequence and upper Ntane Sandstone Formation- aeolian sandstone). Basaltic lavas of the stormberg Lava Group cap the Karoo stratigraphy. Few groundwater studies in the Karoo of the Kalahari Basin have shown that the Ecca Group does not posses good aquifer characteristics because of its argillaceous nature. However, thin arenaceous interbeds within the Ecca Group have yielded some groundwater. Non-measurable quantities of groundwater have been recorded from boreholes sunk in the Beaufort Group. Few boreholes penetrating the Mosolotsane Formation yielded very little groundwater whereas Ntane Sandstone have yielded a fair amount of groundwater. Groundwater yield from the Stormberg Lava Group is related to the presence of fractures.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">260501 Groundwater Hydrology</field><field name="subject">780104 Earth sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158198</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dark husk of beauty</field><field name="creator">Leggett, Andrew Alfred George</field><field name="description">In my dissertation &#8211; a collection of poems entitled Dark Husk of Beauty &#8211; I struggle with the dualities of beauty and ugliness, of creation and destruction. This Dark Husk of Beauty is what remains when I follow the exhortation of John Scott&#8217;s magician Aosman to take the ugly, or the deformed, or the old, and transcend &#8230; natural revulsion by uniting with it aesthetically &#8211; sometimes even physically. The body, subject to such a union, becomes the central metaphor of this creative work. The poems in the title section address the fierce disintegrative beauty of the body subject to the ravages of passion, disease and death. Those of the second section take up the metaphor of &#8220;Prophecy&#8221; &#8211; Ezekial&#146;s prophecy over the plain of dry bones that, gathered together, grow flesh and are restored to life. In the third section, &#8220;Wings of Desire&#8221;, the poems defiantly transcend aesthetic dualism, undeterred by the punishments inflicted on the body for the artists&#8217; heresy. The final poem, a sequence of versions of lesser known works of Rilke, attempts to negotiate the portal separating such extremes through grace. My critical essay &#8211; A Psychoanalytic Discourse on Creation, Destruction, Perversion, Reparation and Creation in the Works of John Scott &#8211; addresses the problems of such creation by means of a psychoanalytic literary discourse.

The study is situated primarily in the area of the history of Christian thought and is located in the area of modern Enlightenment Studies. Wesley&#146;s role as a pastoral theologian is established and his theological methodology uncovered from the perspective of his holistic vision of the God-human relationship being centred in love. This lays the foundation for an examination of his theological sources and tools derived from his extensive writings. Their interaction is explored through an examination of the doctrine and practice of Christian perfection as Wesley offered pastoral guidance to the people called Methodists. There is extensive debate within Methodist circles (particularly in North America) regarding the conception and utility of Wesley&#146;s theological method. Albert C. Outler was the key scholar who identified the components of the Wesleyan quadrilateral (Scripture, reason, tradition and experience) and proposed it as a unique and fruitful conception, with invaluable application for the Methodist movement today. Outler&#146;s claims have been much debated and in many quarters rejected, though his basic understanding remains well-established within influential sections of the church. This thesis is an examination of Wesley&#146;s writings in the light of the current debate to see if a more productive model can be established that will have greater resonance in a postmodern setting. After an overview of the scholarly debate on Wesley&#146;s location and theological method in the eighteenth century, the major focus is Wesley&#146;s own extensive writings over the course of his ministry. This is examined in three periods: 1725-39, 1740-69 and 1770-91. The study seeks to discover for each period his conception of the God-human relationship and what this implies for his theological method. The sources and tools Wesley utilised are then identified, before attention is turned to an examination of Christian perfection as a doctrine and its application in pastoral practice. The study has found that the common assessment of Wesley as a pastoral theologian is correct and this has implications for his approach to theologising. Wesley viewed the core characteristic of God&#146;s nature as love and the God-human relationship is to be defined by the qualities of trust and passion, rather than an intellectual comprehension of propositional truths about God. In his theological method Scripture, reason, community ethos and Christian experience are utilised in an interconnected dynamic network, energised by the presence of the Holy Spirit. God is clearly the sole theological authority and the components of the system are the means he uses for communication. This analysis emphasises the fundamental nature of Christianity as a relationship of love, based on trust rather than an intellectual comprehension of doctrine; it is essentially a matter of the heart rather than the head. Accordingly, pastoral theology is much more important than academic, systematic theology for Christian experience and spiritual formation. Theological method must be shaped by this understanding, and so personal knowledge is always to be valued over intellectual propositions; Christian belief concerns the encounter with God as a Person rather than the mastery of a comprehensive system of doctrines. Critical to this process is the ethos of the community, which is the intimate blending of all the elements under the guidance of the Spirit. This makes Christian experience, rather than merely life experience, of vital importance. Because love and relationships are not reducible to mechanical systems that are merely intellectually comprehended, there is an element of mystery that remains. There is a difference in the way that the Spirit utilises the means when working with the doctrinal substance and the experiential circumstance of Christian perfection. The Modernist approach that is focused on dissection and analysis results in the loss of this holistic, dynamic system and its reduction to either pure subjectivism or rationalism. Wesley&#146;s theological method is much closer to the pre-Modern approach that has been prevalent for most of history and more in harmony with much of the present developments in postmodern thought.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158126</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Models of fault-tolerant quantum computation</field><field name="creator">Dawson, Christopher Malcolm</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with certain theoretical problems that arise naturally in the context of fault-tolerant quantum computation. Fault-tolerance can be defined as the art of building reliable devices from unreliable components, and is of particular importance for quantum computers that aim to precisely control the dynamics of extremely sensitive quantum systems. A model of quantum computation is a specification of the basic building blocks by which a quantum computation is implemented. The best known model is the quantum circuit model, where computations are implemented by means of unitary quantum gates that are applied to two-level quantum systems known as qubits. In a physical implementation of a quantum circuit, the gates and qubits will inevitably be affected by noise. Fault-tolerant quantum circuits are designed to be resilient against the effects of this noise, provided that it is not too strong. Fault-tolerance in the quantum circuit model is well developed thanks to the theory of quantum error-correcting codes. These codes allow for the correction of small numbers of errors introduced by a variety of noise processes. In a fault-tolerant quantum circuit, qubits are replaced with encoded qubits, and quantum gates with encoded gates that are immediately followed by special quantum circuits for error correction. Provided the rate at which errors occur is below a constant threshold value, the accumulation of errors can be checked so that the correct output of the computation correctly determined. The threshold acts as both a measure of how good the design of a quantum circuit is, and also as a target for experimenters aiming to implement quantum circuits. Much current research in quantum computation is aimed at designing quantum circuits that increase the noise threshold, hopefully to the point where it becomes within the reach of experimenters. A fault-tolerant encoded quantum gate must limit the propagation of errors so that the code&#146;s corrective capabilities are not overwhelmed. It is not so easy to design encoded gates that satisfy this property, and to date only a finite handful of such gates are known. In a faulttolerant quantum circuit, all quantum gates must be decomposed or compiled in terms of those that may be implemented fault-tolerantly. In the first part of this thesis, we present two results that may be applied to this problem of gate compilation. The first is a generic method based on the Solovay-Kitaev theorem that may be applied to all quantum gates, but is most effective for those that act on single qubits. We present the Solovay-Kitaev theorem in its simples known form as an algorithm, together with novel constructions that can be used to implement it. Following this we give a two specialized methods for two-qubit gate decomposition, based on the Cartan decomposition of the Lie group SU(4). The cluster-state model of computation is an alternative to the quantum circuit model, and makes use of quantum measurements and highly entangled cluster-states to implement a quantum computation. The fault-tolerant techniques developed for quantum circuits are not immediately applicable in this model, so in order for it to be a realistic candidate for performing computations we prove that such techniques are possible. In the second part of the thesis we prove that constant fault-tolerance thresholds may be achieved in the cluster-state model, and in particular in an adaption to an optical implementation. Following this we design a complete error correction scheme for optical cluster-state computation, and numerically determine the threshold of this model in the face of the dominant noise models likely to affect such an implementation.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">249999 Physical Sciences not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158120</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating re-purchase intention in an experiential context using operations and marketing perspectives</field><field name="creator">Hume, Margee</field><field name="description">Abstract The purpose of this thesis is to undertake theory development and testing particular to re-purchase intention in an experiential service context, specifically the cultural performing arts. Services researchers suggest implementing a multi-disciplinary approach to research that uses theories and methods from several of the management fields will advance the domain of services research. This thesis aims to contribute to the field of service research by drawing from methods and theories offered in both service operations and services marketing fields. To date, service research has been preoccupied primarily with consumer behaviour aspects of services marketing such as satisfaction but underestimates the importance of constructs such as re-purchase intention and the subsequent implications for strategy formulation and implementation. Further to this, the current approach to services research has overlooked the nexus between marketing and operations and the importance of the implementation of strategy to achieve objectives. It is argued that failing to integrate service operations both practically and theoretically into the re-purchase intentions research framework confines its potential effectiveness. In addition, the lack of specific service context application has been identified as a significant oversight in previous services research. Construct measurements and findings have been difficult to replicate across contexts and contextual examination of constructs and relationships has been suggested as a solution. One such context deserving of attention is that of the experiential services, specifically the performing arts. Therefore, using measures and theories developed specifically for this context, this thesis will offer a more comprehensive approach to re-purchase intention research in a performing arts setting. This thesis adopts a mixed method approach by implementing a series of three integrated studies, which amalgamates both operations and marketing fields. This thesis aims to identify the aspects of a performing arts encounter that are relevant to the customer by conducting a two-staged set of qualitative interviews. This process is based on the operations technique Service Transaction Analysis (STA). First, consultant consumers and organisational personnel were used to formulate a consensus definition of a typical performing arts experience and, second, 26 in-depth interviews were conducted with potential future consumers of the performing arts based on this description of the offering. These two studies, coupled with extant literature, informed the research instrument designed for the main survey. This instrument was conducted on 273 potential future consumers of the performing arts. Qualitative work undertaken in Study 1 identifies the service experience description. Study 2 highlights the service management and marketing issues relating to re-purchase intention especially focusing on value, customer satisfaction, show experience and service quality and discloses a set of specific issues incorporated into the wording of the survey instrument. Study 3 measures and tests the key constructs of service quality, show experience, value, satisfaction and the significance of the hypothesised pathways to re-purchase intention. The proposed model is then analysed using the AMOS 5.0 Structural Equation Modelling package. This thesis is structured in the journal paper format with each of the chapters representing each of the five journal papers. In addition, an introductory and concluding chapter are appended with the concluding chapter providing an in-depth discussion of the contributions of this thesis. The papers are based on the progressive results of the research program and offer an integrated set of findings and discussions. The papers are not mutually exclusive but interrelated to comprehensively illuminate the central research theme of the thesis and discuss many aspects of marketing and operations significant to re-purchase intention. The entire thesis is drawn from the data set generated from the three integrated studies developed to address the overall research theme. The central research theme is to investigate the nature of re-purchase intention in an experiential setting using marketing and operations theories as platforms of analysis. Interestingly, the tested model of this thesis found empirically that the subjective and experiential aspects of the service, such as the emotional and artistic quality of the show, did not have a significant and direct relationship with re-purchase intention. This finding is of interest, in particular, to scholars of experiential consumption and marketing practitioners offering these types of services. Previous research has supported the desire to fulfil experiential needs as driving the initial purchase. Conversely, this finding suggests that the desire to visit again is driven by utility and value. As customer maintenance and repeat patronage are of utmost importance to practice, this is an exciting development. Offering further support, the tested model found service quality and show experience were mediated by value to satisfaction, with satisfaction inturn mediating the relationship between value and re-purchase intention. Collectively, these findings have lead to several developments and contributions for both scholarship and practice. The contributions to knowledge of this thesis highlight five main theoretical contributions and four main managerial implications. These encompass: &#183; Advancing the &#145;service management trinity&#146;, specifically strengthening the importance of the relationship between service marketing and service operations. &#183; Advancing service management theory by understanding the service offering more intricately and the importance of service description. &#183; Clarifying the roles of experiential and utilitarian attributes of the service experience in an experiential setting extending knowledge related to re-purchase intention. &#183; Particularizing and measuring the construct of re-purchase intention to the performing arts and clarifying the predictors of this construct in the context of experiential performing arts. . &#183; Testing and clarifying the relationships of value and satisfaction to re-purchase intention extending the understanding of re-purchase intention in this field and elaborating the approach and understanding of this construct for future research. This thesis further contributes to knowledge by offering several managerial contributions. These incorporate: &#183; Market segmentation and targeting strategies as critical for performing arts management. &#183; Operations service design and creation strategies in the performing arts by including important aspects of the service experience as highlighted by customer driven research. &#183; Specific recommendation for streamlining delivery through standardised mass customisation. &#183; Offering value frameworks for creating value in service delivery and targeting customer perceptions of superior value. This extending the understanding of the customer perceived value equation. By contributing to the field of service management and advancing enquiry in the field of services marketing and service operations, this thesis offers a new perspective and practical approach to service marketing context analysis making a valuable contribution to scholarship. This approach is based on improving organisational performance in experiential services specifically by applying operations and marketing theory from a customer-perspective. By doing this, findings inform organisations of ways to better meet the needs and wants of consumers through design, delivery and marketing. Moreover, the findings assist researchers in further advancing the field of services research. This research positions the future research program to focus on continuing the advancement of service management by examining the higher order constructs of service quality and show experience and examining the impact of additional customer motivations such as emotional goal attainment and involvement in experiential settings.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">720401 Marketing</field><field name="subject">350204 Marketing and Market Research</field><field name="subject">services marketing</field><field name="subject">services operations</field><field name="subject">performing arts</field><field name="subject">service quality</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158043</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Simultaneous Lift, Moment and Thrust Measurements on a Scramjet in Hypervelocity Flow</field><field name="creator">Robinson, Matthew</field><field name="description">This study investigates the stress wave force balance technique for the measurement of forces on a fuelled hypersonic flight vehicle in an impulse-type test facility. A three component force balance for the measurement of lift, thrust and pitching moment on a supersonic combustion ramjet engine was designed, built, calibrated and tested. The force balance was designed using finite element analysis and consisted of four stress bars instrumented for the measurement of strain. Relative errors of less than 2% were obtained for the recovered simulated calibration loads, while errors of less than 3% were obtained for lift and thrust components for simulated fuel-on and fuel-off force loading distributions. Tests in a calibration rig showed that the balance was capable of recovering the magnitude of point loads to within 3% and their lines of action to within 1% of the chord of the model. Additional errors result when testing in a wind tunnel. The uncertainties for the experiments with fuel injection are estimated at 9%, 7% and 9% for the coefficients of lift, thrust and pitching moment. The scramjet vehicle was 0.566m long and weighed approximately 6kg. It consisted of an inlet, combustion chamber and thrust surface. Fuel could be injected through a series of injectors located on the scramjet inlet. The scramjet model was set at zero angle of attack. Experiments were performed in the T4 Free Piston Shock Tunnel at a total enthalpy of 3.3MJ/kg, a nozzle supply pressure of 32MPa and a Mach number of 6.6, with equivalence ratios up to 1.4. Fuel-off force coefficients were measured to within 2% of theoretical values based on predictions using CFD and hypersonic theory. The fuel-off centre-of-pressure was measured to within 4% of the predicted value. The force coefficients varied linearly with equivalence ratio. Good comparison of the measured lift and thrust forces with theoretical values was obtained with increasing flow rates of fuel. The lift-to-drag ratio increased from 3.0 at the fuel-off condition to 17.2 at an equivalence ratio of 1.0. Poor agreement between the measured pitching moment and theoretical values was obtained due to difficulties in predicting the pressure distribution with heat addition on the latter parts of the thrust surface. A shift in the centre-of-pressure of approximately 10% of model chord was measured as the equivalence ratio varied from 0.0 to 1.0. For the design tested, the thrust produced was not enough to overcome drag on the vehicle, even at the highest equivalence ratio tested. Tests at higher stagnation enthalpies (up to 4.9MJ/kg) showed the lift and pitching moment coefficients remained constant with an equivalence ratio of 0.8 but the thrust coefficient decreased exponentially with increasing stagnation enthalpies. Good agreement of experimental values of lift and thrust force with predicted values was obtained for equivalence ratios of 0.0 and 0.8. Choking occurred at stagnation enthalpies of less than 3.0MJ/kg and a nozzle supply pressure of 32MPa with fuel injection at an equivalence ratio of approximately 0.8, resulting in a drag force of approximately 2.5 times the fuel-off drag force. Tests at a nozzle supply enthalpy of 3.3MJ/kg and nozzle supply pressures of 32, 26 and 16MPa were performed at equivalence ratios of 0.0 and 0.8. The fuel-off lift coefficient remained constant but the thrust coefficient increased. This is attributed to a reduction in skin friction associated with longer lengths of laminar boundary layers as the Reynolds number was decreased. The measured fuel-off lift and thrust coefficients agreed with the predicted values to within the known test flow and force prediction uncertainties. Combustion did not occur at a nozzle supply pressure of 16MPa. This work has demonstrated that overall scramjet vehicle performance measurements (such as lift-to-drag ratio and shifts in centre-of-pressure) can be made in a free piston shock tunnel.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">290299 Aerospace Engineering not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">690302 Space transport</field><field name="subject">shock tunnel</field><field name="subject">force measurement</field><field name="subject">scramjet</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158040</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In/visibility: Women looking at men's bodies in and through contemporary Australian women's fiction</field><field name="creator">Bode, Katherine</field><field name="description">Masculinity is an increasingly prominent and important issue in debates within feminism, literary studies and visual theory. This study intervenes in and contributes to such debates by analysing an emerging group of Australian women&#146;s fictions (published between 1998 and 2002) which focus on male characters and, in particular, on the description and narrative potential of their bodies. The majority of these texts, and the ones that are explored in this thesis &#150; namely, Jillian Watkinson&#146;s The Architect, Georgia Blain&#146;s The Blind Eye, Mireille Juchau&#146;s Machines for Feeling, Fiona Capp&#146;s Last of the Sane Days, Sarah Myles&#146;s Transplanted and Wendy Scarfe&#146;s Miranda &#150; share two preoccupations. Firstly, male characters bodies&#146; are almost always damaged or suffering in some way; secondly, the ability (or inability) of female characters to look at these bodies is repeatedly foregrounded. I argue that the interactions between male characters&#146; bodies and female characters&#146; gazes function in complex ways both to confirm and to challenge patriarchal constructions of masculinity and male corporeality. Specifically, this occurs in relation to the engagement of each text with popular discourses of feminism and masculinity crisis, discourses that emerge and interact in complex and often contradictory ways in depictions of male visibility and exposure. While my approach is generally feminist, it is also fiction-centred. Thus, I draw on a variety of theoretical perspectives, including literary theory, masculinity studies, visual theory, history, sociology and philosophy, in order to unpack and engage with these contemporary Australian women&#146;s fictions. Paradoxically, one of the main consequences of this fiction-centred approach is a reengagement with and a rethinking of theoretical concepts emerging from psychoanalytic feminist film theory. In a remarkably consistent and explicitly pedagogical way, these fictions explore notions of objectification and dichotomisation, especially as they are elucidated in Laura Mulvey&#146;s analysis of Hollywood narrative cinema. Objectification is overwhelmingly aligned with oppressive power structures and identified as problematic, and the first half of this thesis explores the novels&#146; critiques of this mode of visual interaction. The second half investigates the alternatives to objectification imagined in these fictions. While, upon closer consideration, some of these alternatives recapture male and female characters within traditional patriarchal power relations, others enable a rethinking of both women&#146;s vision and desire, and men&#146;s subjectivity, visibility and desirability.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">420303 Culture, Gender, Sexuality</field><field name="subject">751001 Languages and literature</field><field name="subject">masculinity</field><field name="subject">female gaze</field><field name="subject">men's bodies</field><field name="subject">contemporary Australian women's fiction</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158036</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study on diffusion and flow of sub-critical hydrocarbons in activated carbon</field><field name="creator">BAE, Jun-Seok</field><field name="description">This thesis deals with diffusion and flow of sub-critical hydrocarbons in activated carbon by using a differential permeation method. The hydrocarbons are selected according to the effect on environmental concerns and their unique characteristics such as polarity and affinity towards activated carbon. Although it has been known that transport processes in activated carbon consist of Knudsen diffusion, gaseous viscous flow, adsorbed phase diffusion (so called, surface diffusion) and condensate flow, there have been no rigorous models to describe the transport processes in activated carbon with a full range of pressures. In particular among the four processes, the mechanism of adsorbed phase diffusion in activated carbon is still far from complete understanding. Also due to the dispersion interactions between adsorbing molecules and the solid surface, one would expect that Knudsen diffusion is influenced by the dispersive forces. From intensive experimental observations with a great care over a full range of pressures, conventional methods (for example, direct estimation from inert gas experiments) to determine adsorbed phase diffusion are found to be inadequate for strongly adsorbing vapors in activated carbon. By incorporating the effect of adsorbate-adsorbent interactions into Knudsen diffusivity, the general behavior of adsorbed phase diffusion in terms of pressure (or surface loading) can be obtained, showing a significant role in transport at low pressures. For non-polar hydrocarbons such as benzene, carbon tetrachloride and n-hexane, a mathematical model, which accounts for the effects of adsorbate-adsorbent interactions and pore size distribution, is formulated and validated, resulting in a good agreement with experimental data. Moreover, the adsorption and dynamic behaviors of alcohol molecules (which are polar compounds) are investigated with an aim to compare their behaviors against those of non-polar compounds.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">670700 Industrial Chemicals and Related Products</field><field name="subject">surface diffusion</field><field name="subject">hydrocarbons</field><field name="subject">activated carbon</field><field name="subject">transport phenomena</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157965</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Taxonomy and Biology of benedeniine capsalid monogeneans</field><field name="creator">Deveney, Marty R.</field><field name="description">Abstract The Benedeniinae, the largest of nine capsalid subfamilies, includes genera with an aseptate, apapillate haptor and a pair of discrete testes. Eight of 13 nominal benedeniine genera, Benedenia Diesing, 1858 (the type genus); Allobenedenia Yamaguti, 1963; Allometabenedeniella Velasquez, 1982; Dioncopseudobenedenia Yamaguti, 1965; Lagenivaginopseudobenedenia Yamaguti, 1966; Oligoncobenedenia Yamaguti, 1965; Pseudallobenedenia Yamaguti, 1966 and Tareenia, Hussey, 1986 are revised using type material of most nominal species with observations for some species from new material. Allobenedenia and Allometabenedeniella are transferred to the Trochopodinae Price, 1936 emend. Sproston, 1946 because all valid species of both genera bear septa on the ventral haptor surface. Allobenedenia ishikawae (Goto, 1894) Yamaguti, 1963 is transferred to Benedenia because its haptor is aseptate. I recognize Menziesia Gibson, 1976, based on the form of the male copulatory organ and associated structures and include five species in it. Tareenia Hussey, 1986 is synonymised with Benedenia because characters used to differentiate the two genera do not indicate discontinuities at the generic level. Benedeniella Johnston, 1929, Calicobenedenia Kritsky and Fennessy, 1999 and Trimusculotrema Whittington and Barton, 1990 are considered to belong in Entobdellinae Bychowsky, 1957, pending further studies on that group. The anatomy of Calicobenedenia is outlined briefly; the other genera are not discussed here in detail. Lachishia n. g. is described, based on the structure of the male copulatory organ and a species is transferred to it from Dioncopseudobenedenia. I describe four new species of benedeniines from teleosts caught at Heron and Green Islands, Australia namely: Benedenia ernsti n. sp. from the gills of Symphorus nematophorus; Benedenia fieldsi n. sp. from the fins of Cephalopholis boenak, C. cyanostigma and C. miniatus; Benedenia haywardi n. sp. from the skin of S. nematophorus and Dioncopsudobenedenia ancoralis n. sp. from the gills of Siganus lineatus. Benedenia akaisaki Iwata, 1990 is synonymised with B. ovata (Goto, 1894) Johnston, 1929, B. kintoki Iwata, 1990 is synonymised with B. elongata (Yamaguti, 1968) Egorova, 1997, B. sargocentron Zhang, Yang and Liu, 2001 is synonymised with B. hawaiiensis Yamaguti, 1968 and Pseudallobenedenia arabica Timofeeva, 1995 is synonymised with P. opakapaka Yamaguti, 1966. Benedenia madai Ishii and Sawada, 1938, B. pagrosomi Ishii and Sawada, 1938 and Allobenedenia pedunculata Raju and Rao, 1980 are considered species inquirendae. I examined an outbreak in aquaculture of the pathogenic benedeniine, Neobenedenia melleni (MacCallum, 1927) Yamaguti, 1963 and report this species for the first time in Australia. I examined the pathogenesis caused by this parasite by histology of host tissue. Possible routes of introduction to the farm in question are investigated and studies are detailed that should be undertaken in Australia to manage future outbreaks of N. melleni. Capsalids usually colonise new hosts by an infective ciliated oncomiracidium. An experiment was conducted to ascertain whether cleaner fish Labroides dimidiatus could transfer adult skin-parasitic monogeneans from one host fish to another. I have shown that transmission of adult monogeneans between two individuals of Hemigymnus melapterus by cleaner fish can occur. In coral reef environments, frequent contact between unrelated hosts involved in cleaning interactions might create previously unsuspected evolutionary pressures. I discuss the implications of this discovery for host-specificity and lateral transmission of monogeneans. General biological studies of monogeneans are necessary to understand the evolution, pathology, epidemiology, phylogeny and taxonomy of these parasites. My study provides a taxonomic system which, when applied to other capsalid subfamilies, should help prevent errors and create a clear system of classification for the entire family.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270299 Genetics not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">Benedeniinae</field><field name="subject">Capsalidae</field><field name="subject">taxonomy</field><field name="subject">parasite</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157960</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterization of a Newly Identified Human Rhinovirus: HRV-QPM</field><field name="creator">Mr Peter Mcerlean</field><field name="description" /><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Rhinovirus,&#160;respiratory&#160;illness,&#160;picornavirus,&#160;in&#160;silico&#160;analysis.&#160;</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159338</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Origins and Evolution of the North-Eastern and Central Polabian (Wendish) Religious and Political System</field><field name="creator">Zaroff, Roman</field><field name="description">The term Polabian Slavs is a generic name applied to the westernmost branch of the Western Slavs, now almost extinct. Those people are often referred to as Wends, but mainly in older historiography. In the Middle Ages they occupied the territory more or less corresponding to the former state of East Germany, the region enclosed by the Baltic Sea in the North, the Oder-Neisse rivers in the East, the Ore mountains in the South and the Elbe-Saale rivers in the West (see map 1). In Central Europe, with the exception of the Baltic Prussians and Lithuanians, some of the Polabian Slavs resisted Christianisation and remained stubbornly pagan until the middle of the twelfth century. In the course of history the Polabian Slavs came under increasing political pressure from the Franks and later from the Empire, in the period between the eighth and the twelfth centuries. From the north they were also hard pressed by the Danes and in some periods from the east by the growing strength in Poland of the Piast dynasty. By the end of the twelfth century most of the Polabian Slavs fell under German or Danish political control. Some of them in the central region, what is now the Land of Brandenburg, and the tribes in the South were fully incorporated into the Empire. Others, like the Obodrites and some of the Veleti in Western Pomerania, became part of the Empire as autonomous duchies ruled by the local princes, while the island of R&#252;gen and the adjacent mainland territories, although they continued to be ruled by the Slavic dynasts, had to acknowledge Danish suzerainty. The whole territory, despite some areas being under the Danish crown, became subject to strong German political and cultural influence. Assimilation and German colonization facilitated the process of the Germanization of almost the entire area between the Saale-Elbe and Oder-Neisse rivers. Over the centuries the Polabian Slavs have almost entirely disappeared as a distinct people. However, the process is not fully completed even today, for a small Sorb minority still retains its distinct cultural identity. The modern Sorbs, numbering around 100,000 people are living today in eastern Germany in the region of Lusatia (Lausitz in German or &#163;u&#158;ica in Sorbian), mainly around Bautzen and Cottbus. Approximately 60,000 of them still speak a Slavonic language. Although this work does not deal directly with the Sorbs of Lusatia, it is dedicated to those surviving Polabian Slavs. [No abstract available - text taken from Introduction]</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">430108 History - European</field><field name="subject">Medieval</field><field name="subject">Slavs</field><field name="subject">Western Slavs</field><field name="subject">Slavic</field><field name="subject">Slavonic</field><field name="subject">Polabian</field><field name="subject">Religion</field><field name="subject">Paganism</field><field name="subject">Sventovit</field><field name="subject">Theocracy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157891</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanised Intercropping and Double Cropping in Southern Queensland</field><field name="creator">Peter Michael Masasso</field><field name="description">The potential for relay intercropping and double cropping was assessed in field trials over three consecutive years at Gatton, Queensland. The rationale was to use controlled traffic technology to facilitate relay and double cropping and thus research a cropping system that could exploit late winter crop rainfall. In Field Trial I, grain sorghum and sunflower, broadacre crops already grown within the Southern and Darling Downs regions of Queensland and New South Wales were intercropped into wheat; sunflower was intercropped with wheat in Field Trial II. Sole summer plantings were made at the same time as intercrops were planted. The wheat crop was cut and stubble removed to facilitate this. Various planting dates (three for Field Trial I; four for Field Trial II) for the relayed summer crops were used to determine if an optimum planting time existed. Plant height, tiller number, light interception, grain yield, soil moisture and economic return were used as parameters to compare the intercrop with sole plantings in Field Trial I. Grain yield, soil moisture, rainfall infiltration and economic return were measured in Field Trial II. Research also involved the modification and testing of a tractor to carry out the sowing of the intercrop. In Field Trial I, light interception was shown to vary at different stages of the wheat crop and the use of these stages to determine optimum planting dates of the relay crop is suggested. In both trials, no differences were recorded in the grain yield between intercropped and sole cropped wheat treatments suggesting the trafficking of the plot did not affect the wheat. As neither sorghum or sunflower established as intercrops, competition was not a factor in affecting wheat yields. Moisture readings in both trials showed little change below a depth of 100 cm; however some treatment differences were present at shallower depths. In Field ii Trial I, sole summer sorghum, especially the first planting date, showed reduced water capture/ higher soil evaporation due to wheat removal initially and later transpiration loss due to crop growth and increased weed pressure. Sole wheat treatments showed increased moisture storage after harvest due to lack of water use by the crop and increased infiltration/reduced runoff due to stubble retention. Improved soil moisture recharge after rainfall events was apparent in double cropped treatments suggesting not only improved water utilisation but also improved capture and storage is possible within this system. Sorghum, commonly used throughout south eastern Queensland as a summer crop option, proved unsuitable for relay intercropping in Field Trial I for Planting Dates 1 and 2. Minimum soil temperatures for these plantings were marginal as they were close to the 15o Celsius level recommended for sorghum. However, even though establishment was poor for the intercropped plantings, it was higher for sole sorghum plantings. Wheat allelopathic effects may be involved. To avoid the temperature limitations of sorghum, sunflower was selected as an alternative intercrop in the later planting dates of Field Trial I and all dates for Field Trial II. Reasons for the poor establishment and yield of sunflowers in the earlier intercrop planting dates compared to sole plantings remain unknown but also may be related to allelopathic effects from intercropped wheat. Low soil temperature was not a factor affecting establishment Yields for planting dates were recorded in the intercropped sunflower treatments for Field Trial II and the optimal planting time for sunflowers in a wheat/sunflower relay intercrop was identified as when physiological maturity of the wheat had occurred. This may relate to the wheat crop stage. In Field Trial II, no significant differences in soil moisture were recorded between treatments from overall water use for the trial period. There were differences in water use between intercropped and sole cropped treatments for iii some rainfall events. Three rainfall events were chosen for closer study in each of the field trials conducted. Each event varied in the length and time as well as the duration and intensity of the rain that fell for the period. For the first rainfall period the moisture content of the first planting date of the sole summer treatment and to a lesser extent the second planting date of the same treatment increased, most likely due to wheat removal. In the third rainfall period the double cropped sunflower treatment with stubble tended to store less moisture and this may be due to the active crop growth at this time. It was evident in both field trials of the need for an effective weed control program in the intercrop plots. Weeds were controlled in wheel tracks by glyphosate sprays. Cultural methods may help but a herbicide suitable for both components of the intercrop would be very useful. A tractor was successfully modified to a 3 metre wheelspace and a clearance of 70 cm. This proved sufficient for planting the relay intercrop in Field Trial II without negatively affecting the yield of the standing crop. The row spacing of 18 cm for wheat in a 3 metre fixed bed and wheeltrack configuration assisted with guidance and interplanting of the relay crop. The relay crop was sown as single alternating rows.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences</field><field name="subject">relay intercropping, controlled traffic, wheat, sunflower, sorghum, LER, ATER, CPR, tramlining, reaised beds</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159371</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The design and analysis of high frequency phased array coils for MRI</field><field name="creator">Li, Bing Keong Joe</field><field name="description">This thesis is focussed on extending the use of phased array radiofrequency (RF) coils for use in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Phased arrays are very useful as receiver coils and have been used over the last 15 years or so to improve receiver coil coverage and to speed up image acquisition. These arrays have almost invariably been constructed and used at mid- to highfrequency (&amp;lt128 MHz), thus there is clearly an opportunity to increase the operating frequency of the phased array and also use these systems in transceive mode. Using phased array coils in transceive mode has the advantage of gaining better spatial specificity of excited regions. Also as the operating wavelength in high field strength is shortened by the dielectric properties of the patient and approaches the size of conventional transmitter coils, there are distinct advantages in using the smaller coils in the phased array system for transmission. In addition, with the ability to independently control the magnitudes and phases of the transmission power on each element of a transceiver phased array system, RF focussing or shimming can be performed during RF transmission. The research work presented in this thesis is therefore, primarily focussed on designing and analysing high frequency phased array coils for MRI applications with transceive and RF focussing capability and investigating the possibility of using focussing transceive phased array coils to ameliorate image distortions that appear in high field MR images. The second major area of work concerns evaluation of the performance of partial parallel imaging when used at high field strength and the compatibility with transceive phased array systems. Common to both areas are investigation into other approaches for the design of high field RF coils, exploring the possibility of new mutual decoupling techniques and the consideration of other numerical computational methods that can assist in designing future high frequency phased array coils and help evaluate the complex field-tissue interactions at high field strength.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">291500 Biomedical Engineering</field><field name="subject">671402 Medical instrumentation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158146</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification of denitrifying microbial communities in activated sludge exposed to external carbon sources</field><field name="creator">Ginige, Maneesha Prasaad</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis was to identify the denitrifying microbial communities in activated sludge from full-scale treatment plants and from small-scale reactors exposed to acetate or methanol as external carbon sources. Biological denitrification is currently the most widely used, sustainable and cost-effective process to remove nitrogen from wastewater. Increasingly strict effluent discharge standards are posing significant challenges to plant operators to reduce effluent NO3--N concentrations to levels as low as 2-3 mg L-1 or even lower. The lack of sufficient influent carbon in many municipal wastewater treatment plants makes it very difficult to achieve such low NO3--N concentrations in the effluent. An effective solution to the problem is to introduce additional external carbon sources to enhance denitrification. The selection of external carbon sources is not purely based on costs but is also dependent on the possible microbial transformations that these carbon sources may bring about in activated sludge. The most common carbon source used is methanol due to its low cost, but it has been found to cause long delays until an improvement in denitrification performance is observed. On the other hand, acetate has been found to improve denitrification almost instantaneously when added, but it has a significantly higher cost. In this study, methanol and acetate utilising denitrifiers were investigated in activated sludge with and without enrichment in laboratory scale bioreactors. The relevant denitrifiers were identified and evaluated in situ using culture independent methods particularly stable isotope probing (SIP), 16S rDNA cloning, fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) and microautoradiography (MAR). Activated sludge collected from a biological nutrient removal plant exhibiting good denitrification was enriched in an anoxically-operated sequencing batch reactor (SBR) by feeding methanol as the sole carbon source and nitrate as the electron acceptor. The SBR was operated over a duration of 7 months and the SBR denitrification rate improved from 0.02 mg NO3--N mg mixed liquor volatile suspended solids (MLVSS)-1 h-1 to a steady-state value of 0.06 mg NO3-N mg MLVSS-1 h-1. At steady state operation the enriched biomass was subjected to SIP with 13C-methanol to biomark the denitrifiers capable of utilising methanol under anoxic conditions. The separated 12C-DNA and 13C-DNA fractions from the SIP experiment were individually subjected to full cycle rRNA analysis. The dominant 16S rRNA gene phylotype (Group-A clones) in the 13C-library was closely related to the obligate methylotrophs Methylobacillus and Methylophilus in the order Methylophilales of the Betaproteobacteria (96-97% sequence identities), while the most abundant clone groups in the 12C-library mostly belonged to the family Saprospiraceae in the Bacteroidetes phylum. Oligonucleotide probes were designed for FISH to target the Group-A clones and Methylophilales (probes DEN67 and MET1216, respectively) and the Saprospiraceae clones (probe SAP553). Application of these probes on SBR biomass over the enrichment period demonstrated a strong correlation between the level of SBR denitrification and relative abundance of DEN67-targeted bacteria in the SBR community. By contrast, no correlation was found between denitrification rate and the relative abundances of the well known denitrifying genera Hyphomicrobium and Paracoccus nor the Saprospiraceae-clones visualised by FISH in the SBR biomass. FISH combined with microautoradiography independently confirmed that the DEN67-targeted cells were the dominant bacterial group capable of anoxic [14C] methanol uptake in the enriched biomass. As observed in full-scale operations, the methanol-fed SBR experienced a lag period of several weeks before denitrification performance increased. Using FISH quantification, it was shown that this coincided with the lag phase in the growth of the DEN67-targeted denitrifying population. It was therefore concluded that the Methylophilales bacteria dominant in our SBR system are likely to be important in full-scale methanol-fed denitrifying sludges. The acetate utilising microbial consortium in activated sludge was investigated without prior enrichment using stable isotope probing (SIP). 13C-acetate was used in SIP to biomark the DNA of the denitrifiers. The extracted 13C-DNA fraction was subjected to a full cycle rRNA analysis. The dominant 16S rRNA gene phylotypes in the 13C-library were closely related to bacterial families Comamonadaceae and Rhodocyclaceae of class Betaproteobacteria (96-97% sequence identities). Seven oligonucleotide probes (DEN444, DEN220, DEN581, DEN441, DEN124, DEN220a and DEN1454) for use in FISH was designed to specifically target the identified phylotypes. Application of these probes on the sludge of a continuously fed denitrifying sequencing batch reactor (CFDSBR) operated over a duration of 16 days indicated a strong correlation between the level of CFDSBR denitrification and relative abundance of all probe-targeted bacteria in the CFDSBR community. FISH combined with microautoradiography (FISH-MAR) further confirmed that the DEN581- and DEN124-targeted cells dominating the CFDSBR were capable of taking up [14C] acetate under anoxic conditions. The initial occurrence of the DEN444- and DEN1454-targeted bacteria and the final dominance of DEN581- and DEN124-targeted bacteria in the CFDSBR community were likely related to the changing in-reactor nitrite concentrations during the first few days of CFDSBR operation. Hence, the DEN444- and DEN1454-targeted bacteria were hypothesised to have low affinities for nitrite while DEN124- and DEN581-targeted bacteria have higher nitrite affinities. However, it was clear that all probe-targeted bacteria were denitrifiers capable of utilising acetate as a carbon source. The rapid increase in numbers of the probe-targeted organisms positively correlates with the immediate increase in denitrification rates. The rapid response and community shifts observed when acetate was used to enhance denitrification suggest that an intermittent application of acetate is quite effective to temporarily enhance the denitrification capacity of a treatment plant. However, the importance of a bacterial impact assessment of activated sludge subjected to intermittent acetate supplementation is recommended prior to the wide use of acetate in the wastewater industry. The acetate utilising denitrifying microbial communities investigated in the previous chapter were characterised according to their eco-physiological properties using the r- and K-selection criteria. The electron donor (acetate) and acceptor (nitrite) affinities of these probe-identified denitrifiers were used as traits for this characterisation. The substrate to microorganism (S/M) ratio was manipulated to provide high and low substrate concentrations in the reactor to create conditions favourable for r- and K-strategists, respectively. Two factors, namely feeding regimes and sludge retention times, were studied to achieve the desired S/M ratios and enable r/K characterisation. The high substrate affinities and high specific growth rates of two probe-identified denitrifiers (DEN124 and DEN581) did not enable resolution of these two organisms with the feeding regimes used in this study. However, the application of different sludge retention times as a control strategy to maintain constant high and low in-reactor S/M ratios enabled characterisation of the two probe-targeted denitrifiers DEN124 and DEN581 as K- and r-strategists, respectively. The in-reactor S/M ratios applied in this study did not facilitate the characterisation of populations targeted by probes DEN444 and DEN1454. The minor fluctuations of the S/M ratios during a cycle in the SBR operation was considered as a drawback, but conclusive results could still be obtained from the study. A chemostat reactor operation with constant loading and variable flow rates is suggested as an alternative. Conclusively, this study was able to identify specific groups of denitrifying microorganisms in activated sludge when exposed to acetate and methanol. Unlike most previous studies, which relied on culture dependent methods, this study adopted a pure culture independent approach to identify microorganisms in relation to their function, i.e. denitrification. Moreover, acetate denitrifiers were in situ characterised based on eco-physiological properties. The identification of denitrifying communities in this study has paved the way to a larger research project on the optimisation of denitrification processes with external acetate, methanol and other carbon supplements. As such, this study has contributed significantly to the understanding of the denitrification processes by linking process data with microbial investigations.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">L</field><field name="subject">270399 Microbiology not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">770502 Land and water management</field><field name="subject">290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="subject">670700 Industrial Chemicals and Related Products</field><field name="subject">Wastewater treatment</field><field name="subject">Activated sludge</field><field name="subject">Nitrogen removal</field><field name="subject">External carbon</field><field name="subject">FISH</field><field name="subject">MAR</field><field name="subject">Denitrification</field><field name="subject">Bacteria</field><field name="subject">Ecology</field><field name="subject">Microorganisms</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157995</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Implications of Adult Attachment Theory for Chronic Pain</field><field name="creator">Meredith, Pamela Joy</field><field name="description">This thesis presents empirical evidence supporting the relevance of adult attachment theory in understanding the chronic pain experience. The thesis arose from the recognition that, although pain-related psychosocial variables have been used to differentiate subgroups of individuals in chronic pain, little is known about the developmental origins or cognitive, behavioural, or affective correlates of these subgroups. Attachment theory offers a development framework, which is of potential value in guiding early pain intervention and prevention efforts, as well as tailoring interventions to suit specific patient needs. In order to investigate the value of applying adult attachment theory to the chronic pain field, five central research questions were identified: 1) Does insecure attachment contribute to a more negative experience of acute pain for those not diagnosed with a chronic pain condition? That is, does the association between insecure attachment and maladaptive pain-related variables precede the onset of chronic pain)? 2) How do the subgroups of adult attachment, identified in a chronic pain sample, compare to the clusters identified by pain-related psychosocial measures in the same sample? 3) Are the documented associations between attachment and psychosocial variables (i.e., cognitive appraisals, self-efficacy, coping, social support) evident in the context of chronic pain? 4) Do attachment variables moderate the associations between these psychosocial variables and painrelated variables?, and 5) What is the association between adult attachment variables and outcomes from chronic pain rehabilitation programs? To address the first question, an experimental study was designed to explore the perceptions, emotions and coping patterns of 58 pain-free individuals exposed to an acute (coldpressor) pain experience. Findings revealed that higher levels of anxiety over relationships were associated with lower pain thresholds, more stress, depression and anxiety, diminished perceptions of control over pain, and diminished ability to decrease pain. More secure attachment, on the other hand, was associated with greater perceptions of control over pain, and lower levels of depression and catastrophizing. In order to explore research questions 2-5, data from two clinical samples were collected on the first and last days of participation in one of two chronic pain rehabilitation programs (program length varied from two to three weeks). A total of 152 participants completed questionnaires before treatment, with 100 of these participants also completing questionnaires after treatment. Participants were aged between 18 and 82 years (M = 38.8, SD = 12.4), and had been in pain for an average of 3.7 years (SD = 6.9). Approximately 41% of participants were women, and 58% were men (gender for one participant was unknown). In order to address question two regarding the similarity between adult attachment subgroups and pain clusters based on a psychosocial pain measure (Multidimensional Pain Inventory, MPI), pre-treatment data were analyzed. The clustering approach using the MPI, known as Multiaxial Assessment of Pain (MAP), identifies three subgroups of individuals, labeled interpersonally distressed, dysfunctional, and adaptive copers. These clusters were compared with the four subgroups and two dimensions obtained with adult attachment measures. Results revealed that the interpersonally distressed MAP subgroup was associated with fearful attachment, while the dysfunctional MAP subgroup was linked with avoidant (low comfort) attachment. The comfort attachment dimension was associated with more adaptive MPI variables, while the anxious attachment dimension was linked with more maladaptive MPI variables. Consideration of research questions three to five prompted development of an integrative model, the Attachment-Diathesis Model of Chronic Pain (ADMCP), which provided a framework for exploring the psychosocial mechanisms linking attachment security with the outcome variables of perceived pain intensity, disability, and treatment outcomes. Based on predictions emerging from this model, a set of five studies explored pre-treatment associations between adult attachment variables, six psychosocial mechanisms (pain appraisal, depression, pain self-efficacy, anxiety, perceptions of social support, and coping), and outcome variables pre-treatment. One further paper was devoted to implications of adult attachment for treatment outcome. In general, findings from these studies revealed that variables representing attachment insecurity were significantly associated with more maladaptive coping, cognitive, affective and interpersonal characteristics, both before and after treatment, compared to variables reflecting secure attachment. Overall, both securely and insecurely attached individuals made progress in response to pain rehabilitation. Finally, a summary of the evidence of associations between attachment variables, psychosocial mechanisms, and treatment outcomes revealed by this research is presented, permitting discussion regarding the explanatory value of the ADMCP and clinical implications. Limitations to the present research, including family-wise error, the use of self-report measures, and the self-selecting nature of the sample, are discussed, and directions for further research are proposed. The evidence presented in this thesis advances our understanding of the developmental origins of chronic pain conditions, and provides a lens through which to view the heterogeneity of people with chronic pain. Overall, this project highlights the value of applying adult attachment principles to this field. It is anticipated that findings will assist in the development of a more differentiated range of treatment approaches for the individuals who experience chronic pain. In addition, the findings of this project may have important implications for prevention and early intervention of these conditions.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158257</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sensory processing and classroom emotional, behavioural and educational outcomes in children with autism spectrum disorder</field><field name="creator">Ashburner, Jill</field><field name="description">Many occupational therapists recommend adaptations to school tasks and classroom environments to accommodate the atypical sensory processing of students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), on the assumption that sensory processing impacts on classroom emotional, behavioural and educational outcomes. The purpose of this study was to explore the rationale underpinning this practice. Specifically, the first aim was to determine whether or not children with ASD differ significantly from typically developing children with regard to sensory processing. The second aim was to provide descriptive information about the nature and prevalence of atypical sensory processing in children with ASD. The third aim was to explore associations between the sensory processing patterns and classroom emotional, behavioural and educational outcomes in children with ASD and typically developing children. This study employed a matched case-control design. To control for differences in teaching styles, classroom environments and educational programs, two typically developing children were selected as controls from each of the classes of thirty students with ASD aged between 6 and 10 years. Twenty-eight children with ASD and fifty-one age- and gender-matched typically developing children were included in the final analysis. The children were all included in mainstream classrooms and were screened using the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test to ensure that their estimated IQ was within the average range. Sensory processing was measured using the Short Sensory Profile. Other independent variables that may have impacted on classroom emotional, behavioural and educational outcomes included symptoms of ASD, IQ and classroom environmental factors. Symptoms of ASD were measured using the Gilliam Asperger Disorder Scale and Gilliam Autism Rating Scale. The Kaufmann Brief Intelligence Test was used as an estimate of IQ, as well as for screening purposes. The investigator recorded observations of the sensory aspects of each classroom environment, including estimates of visual clutter, crowding and background noise. The dependent variables, which included classroom emotional regulation, behaviour regulation (e.g., compliance, attention and social behaviours) and educational outcomes, were measured using two teacher questionnaires: the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment Teacher Report Form and the Conners&#146; Teacher Report Form Revised &#150; Long Form. No significant differences were found between the two groups with respect to IQ or age in months, suggesting that the two groups were well matched. Observations of the classroom environments revealed high levels of background noise, visual clutter and unpredictable tactile input. The majority of the typically developing children achieved scores at or near ceiling level on both the measures of classroom emotional and behavioural outcomes and sensory processing. This suggested that most of these children processed sensory input in a typical way and were coping well with the emotional, behavioural and academic demands of school. No significant relationships were found between the measures of sensory processing and classroom emotional, behavioural and educational outcomes in the typically developing children. The teachers rated the children with ASD as demonstrating significantly more difficulties with attention, emotional and behaviour regulation and social skills and significantly poorer academic performance than the controls. The Short Sensory Profile scores suggested a high prevalence of atypical sensory processing in the children with ASD. There were highly significant group differences on all of the Short Sensory Profile scores (p &gt; .001), with the exception of the Short Sensory Profile score: Movement Sensitivity (p = .016). Multiple regression analysis suggested that the Short Sensory Profile scores: Under-responsive/Seeks Sensation and Auditory Filtering accounted for 47% of the variance in academic performance as measured by the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment Teacher Report Form. As estimated intelligence and autistic symptoms were not predictors in this multiple regression model, these specific sensory processing difficulties appeared to contribute significantly to academic underachievement. The Short Sensory Profile Score: Auditory Filtering was also associated with inattention as measured by the Conners&#146; Teacher Report Form. An association between Short Sensory Profile Score: Auditory Filtering and social problems as measured by the Conners&#146; Teacher Report Form approached significance (p = .019). Auditory filtering difficulties therefore appeared to be highly problematic for the children with ASD and likely to be exacerbated by high levels of background noise in classrooms. Multiple regression analysis suggested that the Short Sensory Profile scores for Tactile Sensitivity and Auditory Filtering accounted for 36% of the variance in the score for Conners&#146; Teacher Report Form score for inattention. The Short Sensory Profile score for Tactile Sensitivity accounted for 22% of the variance in a Conners&#146; Teacher Report Form measure of the combined symptoms of ADHD (including inattention and hyperactivity). The Short Sensory Profile score: Movement Sensitivity accounted for 22% in the Conners&#146; Teacher Report Form score for oppositional behaviours. An association between Short Sensory Profile Score: Tactile Sensitivity and oppositional behaviours as measured by the Conners&#146; Teacher Report Form approached significance (p = .015). As atypical sensory processing was found to be associated with difficulties in learning, attention and behaviour regulation at school, sensory processing may need to be considered in the planning of educational programs for students with ASD. The development of effective strategies to accommodate the atypical sensory processing of these students is a priority.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158222</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Acquisition of word order in Chinese as a foreign language: An error taxonomy</field><field name="creator">Jiang, Wenying Wendy</field><field name="description">Research in the field of Chinese second/foreign language (L2) acquisition, at present, does not match the increasing demand to learn Chinese as an L2, given that Chinese is the fastest growing foreign language (FL) in countries such as Japan, South Korea, the United States, Canada and Australia. There is a significant gap between Chinese L2 acquisition research and the large body of literature in second language acquisition (SLA), which mainly focuses on English L2. The need for more research in Chinese SLA is compelling. Particularly, research in Chinese L2 word order acquisition requires more attention because word order plays a more complex role in Chinese than in English. Chinese relies heavily on word order for information structuring of a sentence because this language lacks other means, such as verb endings indicating tense and aspect, to accomplish this function. Due to the different roles word order plays in Chinese and English, adult English-speaking learners find Chinese word order acquisition very challenging. Chinese L2 word order errors frequently occur in learners&#146; L2 production. However, Chinese L2 researchers and teachers are left with no means to adequately describe and explain these errors for instruction purposes. This dissertation develops such a means &#151; a comprehensive taxonomy of Chinese L2 word order errors. This taxonomy organizes these errors into a logical system of classification. Through the classification, explicit description of various Chinese L2 word order errors is achieved, and specific sources of these errors are traced. Data was collected from 116 native-English-speaking learners of Chinese at a large university in Australia. The Chinese L2 learners were divided into three proficiency levels based on their institutional status. Four hundred and eight word order errors were extracted by qualitatively analyzing the learners&#146; written samples. Among the 408 word order errors, 404 (99%) are successfully classified into different categories according to a new criterion proposed in this dissertation. The new taxonomy provides a principle-based description and explanation of various Chinese L2 word order errors. A word order error is deemed to constitute an error when it violates a relevant word order principle (or sub-principle). These principles not only explain why an error is an error but also provide a means for correcting the error. In a pedagogical sense, the directness and explicitness in explaining word order errors achieved by employing this taxonomy cannot be achieved by relying on any other sources of errors available in the literature. The new taxonomy overcomes the limitations of existing taxonomies in the literature that are either superficial, or unsystematic, or not empirically testable. For example, it draws on the Cognitive Functionalist Approach of L2 acquisition. Both its description and explanation of Chinese L2 word errors go beyond superficiality. The approach maintains that adult L2 learners&#146; conceptualization of the world is initially based on their L1. Their conceptualization of the world imposes constraints on the linguistic structures of their L2. Therefore, errors may occur when English learners of Chinese impose their conceptualization based on the English language onto the Chinese structures. The new taxonomy is systematic because it categorizes word order errors using one criterion. New categories emerging from the data and the existing categories from the literature are incorporated into one system. Finally, the new taxonomy is empirically testable because many new categories emerged from the data. It is an open-ended rather than a closed system. New categories can be added as necessary. The dissertation finds that violation of relevant word order principles has a high explanatory value for the various word order errors encountered in the data. This has clear pedagogical implications. Chinese L2 learners generally lack awareness of the word order principles (and sub-principles) on which the new taxonomy is based. These principles and sub-principles are seen to be of considerable importance to the acquisition of Chinese L2 word order. In order to improve learners&#146; word order performance, the results of this study indicate that it is imperative for the basic Chinese word order principles be included in a CFL curriculum.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">380201 Applied Linguistics and Educational Linguistics</field><field name="subject">751000 Communication</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158129</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Longwall shearer cutting force estimation</field><field name="creator">Reid, Anthony Walton</field><field name="description">A methodology to monitor the real-time cutting forces generated by a longwall shearer is developed. Longwall shearers are the single productive element in an underground longwall coal mine, and are a major source of unscheduled system downtime. The cutting forces constitute the interaction between the longwall and the coal face. Knowledge of the forces can improve the reliability and productivity of longwall mines by providing a means of shearer condition monitoring. A Kalman filter based cutting force estimator is developed, and then tested using a comprehensive shearer simulation incorporating a dynamic representation of the cutterhead. Subsequently, prior work on autonomous shearer guidance with measured pick forces is extended by employing the estimated cutting forces to track changes to the shearer's horizon. This is validated by simulation. The force estimation methodology uses an extended Kalman filter to blend noisy measurement information with a nonlinear system model, the latter combining the dynamics of the shearer and its inputs. A detailed model is developed of the shearer rigid body dynamics, and of the measurements required for observability. The formulation avoids the use of sensors at the coal cutting interface. The methodology uses proven, practicable and reliable sensor technologies, making it suitable for longterm force monitoring. A comprehensive simulation of a longwall shearer is developed using the MATLAB(R) Simulink(R) and MSC.visualNastran 4DTM software environments. This incorporates dynamic representations of the major structures and inputs, including the interaction between the cutterhead and the coal face. The simulation is used to investigate the cutting forces in a number of different operational scenarios. This facilitates the construction of a basic dynamic model of the forces, and provides insight into the relationship between the cutting forces and the condition of the cutting interface. The cutting force estimator is tested using measurements from the shearer simulations. It is shown that the cutting force estimates track the fiducial forces well in each scenario. A number of modifications to the force models are also shown to improve the performance of the estimator. Sensitivity analyses are conducted to investigate the effect of tuned process noise covariance and model parameter errors on the estimates. The application to the problems of shearer condition monitoring and horizon tracking are considered. The first is demonstrated by detecting the effects of a worn pick and a seam hardness gradient on the force estimates, and the second by using the force estimates to track the motion of the cutterhead relative to an embedded stone band. The results show that it is possible, in principle, to estimate the cutting forces generated by a longwall shearer from indirect measurements using a Kalman filter methodology. Furthermore, the force estimates reveal changes to the cutting environment, and can track the vertical motion of the shearer as it operates. This thesis represents the first step in the development of a shearer cutting force estimator. The ultimate goal of the research is to improve the reliability and productivity of Australian longwall operations, using the estimated forces to monitor shearer condition. Autonomous horizon tracking with estimated forces can lead to further improvements to longwall productivity, and to the health and safety of mine personnel. A number of recommendations are made for future field validation, and development of an automated shearer condition monitoring system based on the cutting force estimates.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">290502 Industrial Engineering</field><field name="subject">650202 Coal</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158453</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Late Silurian to Middle Devonian acanthodians of eastern Australia</field><field name="creator">Burrow, Carole J</field><field name="description">The acanthodians were a common and widespread group of fishes throughout the world during the mid-Palaeozoic. In this study, a full-scale systematic analysis of Silurian to Middle Devonian acanthodian taxa of eastern Australia was undertaken, incorporating a review and updating of historical records and descriptions of taxa. Phylogenetic relationships within the group and with other early gnathostomes are uncertain. The structure, function and modes of growth of acanthodian scales were described and investigated, and these features were used for comparisons between different taxa within the group, and between acanthodians and other early vertebrates. Histological and morphological characters of the scales were incorporated in a cladistic analysis of genera erected for articulated fish. This analysis did not support the traditional ordinal level groups, the Climatiida, Ischnacanthida and Acanthodida. Therefore, the highest taxonomic level used in the study was the family. Rarely were acanthodians preserved as articulated fossils. The only examples known from the Silurian-Middle Devonian of Australia are one specimen of the putative acanthodian Yealepis douglasi Burrow &amp; Young 1999 from the Ludlow of Victoria, five specimens of an indeterminate ?ischnacanthidid from the late Givetian of New South Wales and a rich assemblage from the Givetian lacustrine shales of Mt Howitt, Victoria. The latter fauna (originally dated as Late Devonian) includes six incomplete specimens of the culmacanthidid Culmacanthus stewarti Long 1983 and about 60 specimens of acanthodidid Howittacanthus kentoni Long 1986. In contrast, disassociated remains of the group are ubiquitous in microvertebrate faunas from the mid-Palaeozoic of eastern Australia. Although scales of other fish groups are sometimes more common in particular facies, acanthodian elements are found in all depositional environments, from deep shelf marine to transitional to freshwater. Most of the taxa, particularly those only preserved as isolated scales, had not been systematically described by other workers. This thesis incorporates descriptions of new taxa, and revision and updating of other taxa. Several overseas studies have produced biostratigraphic charts based on acanthodian scales. A similar biostratigraphic overview was undertaken based on a systematic analysis of the Early Devonian acanthodians of eastern Australia, permitting comparisons with acanthodian faunas of other regions. Acanthodian scales and fin spines are the most common elements in the few vertebrate faunas that are known from the Silurian of Australia. Diversity and geographic distribution of the acanthodian faunas peaked during the Early Devonian. This study has been hampered by the low numbers of scales in many samples, and by uncertainty over their dating (particularly for the faunas from non-limestone deposits). Nevertheless, the work shows that changes in the marine assemblages are broadly correlated with the pattern of marine transgressions and regressions. Composition of the acanthodian faunas, and their abundance relative to other vertebrates in the assemblages, depend on the depositional environment. This correlation is best illustrated in Lower Devonian deposits, in which acanthodians are the most prolific and diverse. In transitional and marginal marine deposits, thelodonts are dominant, and acanthodians a minor element of the fauna. In off-shore assemblages, acanthodians and placoderms are dominant, and thelodonts are rare or absent. Vertebrate faunas are poor in the earliest Devonian deposits, but become more common by the late Lochkovian, with near-shore assemblages characterized by Trundlelepis cervicostulata and ANostolepis@ guangxiensis, and deeper shelf assemblages by a new genus, possibly assignable to the Ischnacanthidae. The vertebrate record is sparse through the middle Pragian, though AN.@ guangxiensis is present low in the Coopers Creek Limestone (upper sulcatus-pireneae zones), being replaced by Nostolepoides platymarginata, Gomphonchus? bogongensis, and Radioporacanthodes sp. aff. R. (Gomphonchus) liujingensis by the kindlei Zone. Microvertebrate assemblages are more common by the late Pragian (pireneae Zone), with Radioporacanthodes sp. aff. R. liujingensis in deeper shelf deposits, and N. platymarginata and G.? bogongensis dominating near-shore assemblages. The earliest Emsian (dehiscens Zone) is marked by the incoming Cheiracanthoides wangi. Middle Emsian (perbonus-serotinus zones) assemblages are characterized by two new species, possibly assignable to Gomphonchus.The Middle Devonian cosmopolitan association of Cheiracanthoides comptus and AAcanthoides@ dublinensis, which characterizes early Middle Devonian faunas from North America, Europe and China, appears first in the latest Emsian at the serotinus-patulus zone boundary. As well as showing the value of acanthodians in biostratigraphy and as indicators of environmental settings, their use in biogeography was demonstrated. Although many of the acanthodian taxa are endemic, several are also found in other regions. The Silurian to earliest Devonian faunas of eastern Australia are most closely related to coeval Chinese assemblages. Several latest Silurian-earliest Devonian taxa are also recorded from the circum-Arctic region. The late Lochkovian to early Emsian assemblages, particularly from south-eastern Australia, have many taxa in common with Chinese faunas. The mid-Emsian taxa show highest endemicity; and the latest Emsian-Eifelian assemblages have the most cosmopolitan aspect. Acanthodian faunas become rarer and depauperate in the Middle Devonian, particularly in the south-eastern corner, and are mostly in poorly dated, ?fluviatile/marginal marine deposits. This study of acanthodian faunas has encompassed a full scale systematic review of the group in this region, an appraisal of phylogenetic relationships within the group and with other early vertebrates, their palaeoecology, and their use in biostratigraphy and biogeography.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">260112 Palaeontology</field><field name="subject">780105 Biological sciences</field><field name="subject">Acanthodii</field><field name="subject">Devonian</field><field name="subject">Silurian</field><field name="subject">bistratigraphy</field><field name="subject">biogeography</field><field name="subject">eastern Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157975</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Defining the role of C5a in atherosclerosis</field><field name="creator">Helga Manthey</field><field name="description">Atherosclerosis is a slow-developing disease of large and medium sized arteries, and is the premier cardiovascular disease that underlies myocardial and cerebral infarction, aneurysm, stroke and gangrene of the extremities. At least 17 million people die of atherosclerotic complications each year worldwide, with another 15 million surviving unstable events. Despite therapeutic advances such as drug-eluting stents and statins, which reduce cardiovascular events by around 25%, there is an urgent need for additional strategies to complement these treatments and further reduce morbidity and mortality. Inflammation plays a fundamental role in mediating all stages of atherogenesis. The innate immune response has long been implicated in atherogenesis, and activation of the complement system has been associated with all stages of disease. In particular, C5b-9 (membrane attack complex) has been detected in human plaques and may be pathogenic. Since C5b-9 is produced in plaques then the complement activation product 5a (C5a) must also be generated. However, very little is known about the role of C5a in atherogenesis. Indeed, elevated levels of serum C5a have been detected in patients with advanced atherosclerosis and recently the classical C5a receptor, CD88, has been detected on most of the cells found in human atherosclerotic plaques. To date, no studies examining specific C5a receptor antagonism in an animal model of atherosclerosis have been performed. This thesis explored the potential therapeutic benefits of inhibiting C5a, using the C5a receptor antagonist, PMX53, in the ApoE knockout (ApoE-/-) mouse model of atherosclerosis. In Chapter 2, expression of both receptors to C5a, CD88 and C5L2, in aortae of ApoE -/- mice was explored. CD88 and C5L2 mRNA expression was detected in the aorta of ApoE -/- mice at 3, 5, 9,12, 17 and 25 weeks of age. CD88 expression in ApoE -/- mice increased with time, and with macrophage accumulation within the plaque, as indicated by an increase in expression of the macrophage marker, F4/80. Expresssion of CD88 was significantly increased at 17 and 26 weeks of age, compared with age-matched wild-type controls. C5L2 was also expressed albeit at much lower levels compared with wild-type controls. Having established the presence of C5a receptors in ApoE -/- mice, in Chapter 3, the effects PMX53-treatment on ApoE -/- mice on a normal chow diet was examined. PMX53 treatment (3 mg/kg; tri-weekly s.c., plus ~1mg/kg/day p.o. for 20 weeks) resulted in a significant reduction in neointimal area and therefore the intima:media ratio in the brachiocephalic artery compared to untreated controls (P &lt; 0.05; n = 6-8). PMX53 treatment also reduced collagen content and outward remodelling of the brachiocephalic artery. In Chapter 4, studies exploring the effects of PMX53-treatment in the more inflammatory environment created by a high fat (or Western-type diet) were explored. Male ApoE -/- mice were treated with PMX53 from 5 &#8211; 25 weeks of age (3 mg/kg; tri-weekly s.c., plus v ~1mg/kg/day p.o.). Mice were placed on a high fat diet from 10 weeks of age. While PMX53- treated did not affect neo-intimal area, it did result in a significant increase in cell density (P&lt;0.01; n=12) and a significant reduction in buried caps (P &lt; 0.05; n = 12) in the brachiocephalic artery compared with untreated animals. Interestingly, PMX53-treated mice also had significantly reduced total cholesterol compared with untreated controls (P &lt; 0.05; n = 12). These results provide the first evidence for a role for C5a in plaque destabilisation and cholesterol metabolism. Finally, Chapter 5 described the expression of CD88 and C5L2 in cultured primary rat vascular SMC was explored. Expression of CD88 and C5L2 was detected by Western blot; immunocytochemical analysis demonstrated intracellular expression of both C5L2 and CD88. Conversely, radioligand binding experiments suggested the presence of ~25000 cell surface receptors with a high affinity to C5a (KD = 0.3 nM). After establishing the presence of receptors to C5a, experiments were conducted to determine whether C5a has any functional effects on these cells. C5a induced a moderate increase in TNF-&#945; release after 4 hours of treatment (P &lt; 0.05, n = 3), but did not affect SMC proliferation (n = 3). In summary, this study is the first to demonstrate the benefits of specifically inhibiting C5a in a mouse model of atherosclerosis. These findings suggest that C5a plays a role in atherogenesis in ApoE -/- mice and that the C5a receptor antagonist PMX53 may have therapeutic potential in human atherosclerotic disease.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">complement, C5a, atherosclerosis, ApoE -/- mouse, C5a receptor antagonist.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:211593</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stories of sacrifice and entitlement: How differences between students shape their possible subjectivities in classrooms</field><field name="creator">Emma Charlton</field><field name="description">Abstract In places such as Australia, the United States and the United Kingdom, girls are increasingly hailed as contemporary educational success stories and are positioned as presenting &#8216;ideal&#8217; and &#8216;good&#8217; student subjectivities. While it is not all girls who are succeeding in schools in these places, the middle-class girls who are more likely to succeed academically are often still constrained in classroom spaces. These constraints are exemplified in comments from the participants in this research who suggest that these girls are responsible, do not push boundaries, are not entertaining, interesting or lively, and have nothing to say. This is in contrast to the perceptions they have of boys as entertaining, lively, interesting, boundary-pushing, verbal and irresponsible. This thesis explores the ways that students in the case study school fill their classroom spaces, and suggests that many female students are constrained within these spaces, partly due to immediate constraints (such as uniforms), but also due to broader discourses of sacrifice and entitlement. This feminist research project draws on poststructuralism in looking at the ways one group of 14-15 year old middle-school students at an elite private school in Australia made use of their classroom spaces. While this was a gender-focused study, other aspects of difference between students were persuasive in shaping and constraining student subjectivities. These differences between students related to race/ethnicity, class and gender, as well as to alliances between students and familiarity with the structures of schooling. These differences between are made sense of in relation to discourses of sacrifice, as well as in relation to discourses of entitlement. Rather than residing in fixed subject positions, it is within the way that differences between subjects are made meaningful that the impact of discourses of entitlement and sacrifice can be observed. In this research, entitled subjectivities, such as the &#8216;entertainer&#8217; or the &#8216;lad&#8217;, were less accessible for girls, as well as for students designated ethnically/racially marginal/Other, for students who were unfamiliar within the hierarchies of the class and the school, and for students who lacked influential alliances. This &#8216;entertaining&#8217; subjectivity formed the most popular and valued subject position for certain boys. While in some ways this subjectivity worked against academic application, &#8216;entertainers&#8217; were popular with students and staff. This subjectivity, however, involved the objectification of students deemed less desirable in their subjective presentation. It also often disrupted the learning context. The entertaining subjectivity exercised entitlement and rendered many students sacrificial due to the denigration of others that was often a part of being entertaining as well as due to the necessary toleration of noise and disruption. Disruption partially explains the allure of the entertaining subjectivity &#8211; it can present a valued disruption to the routines of the classroom. It often involves (and plays a role in constituting) students deemed popular and worth watching in the classroom space and thus is tied up with popularity. That this subjectivity is inaccessible for many students indicates constraint. This research calls into question the claim that girls are educational success stories. Instead, the &#8216;success&#8217; of middle-class girls is complex and must be contextualized. Many of the girls and a number of the boys within this research accessed discourses of sacrifice as a protective posture, as a way of minimising the disruptive potential of their success, application and/or desires, and as a way of embracing an acceptable subjectivity. The consequences of taking a sacrificial position in relations of power are particularly clear in more physical subjects where many of these students were observed as less confident in the use of their bodies; but the consequences are subtly influential in an array of learning contexts through physical constraint, immobility, low-level volume and tolerance of entitled subjectivities. Thus discourses of sacrifice and entitlement are indicative of competing discourses and political struggle. This research concludes that attention needs to be paid to the ways that students resist dominant versions of gender. While some of the students in this research resisted these dominant versions, resistance often has the contradictory effect of reinforcing dominant discourses. Schools, particularly teachers, can play a role in harnessing the transformative potential of points of resistance, opening up the possibilities for student subjectivities, particularly in terms of reducing the constraints that inhibit engagement with education. A feminist politics of difference and a recognition of female masculinity and male femininity presents productive ways of thinking about differences between students in contrast to a current state of affairs in which difference doubles as deficit. Such a process of discursive destabilisation problematises notions of gender, particularly those notions that constrain students. Embracing female masculinities and male femininities may enable a more &#8216;feminine&#8217; approach to learning from boys, and a more &#8216;masculine&#8217; approach to physical participation from girls. In problematising notions of gender, and explicitly labelling behaviours within one body as masculine and feminine, possibilities for student subjectivities will be broadened.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gender</field><field name="subject">Difference</field><field name="subject">sacrifice</field><field name="subject">entitlement</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:212694</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding the Structure, Antecedents and Cross-Level Effects of Safety Climate: Investigations Using Qualitative, Individual-level and Group-Level Analyses</field><field name="creator">Sarah Colley</field><field name="description">Workplace incidents result in significant human and financial costs. Despite these costs, it is estimated that less than 1% of organisational research focuses on issues concerning occupational health and safety (Barling &amp; Zacharatos, 2000; Reason, 1990). Safety research has begun however to focus increasing attention on understanding the role that the wider organisational context, and in particular the role that safety climate, plays in influencing safety (Barling, Kelloway, &amp; Iverson, 2003; Clarke, 2006a; Cox &amp; Cheyne, 2000; Parker, Axtell, &amp; Turner, 2001; Zohar, 2000). Safety climate refers to safety related policies, procedures and practices that signal the concern for safety (Griffin &amp; Neal, 2000). The aim of the current program of research was to further understanding of the structure, antecedents and cross-level effects of safety climate. Specifically, this research aimed to better understand how organisational factors, and more specifically culture, influence safety climate and safety incidents. This knowledge is important as it assists organisations to purposively engineer stronger climates for safety and in doing so assists them to reduce the number of workplace incidents and accidents. The current program of research consists of three field-based studies. An overview of each study is provided below: Overview Study 1 Study 1 aimed to identify the safety climate schema for a sample of individuals working within the rail industry and explore whether safety climate schemas differ across individuals with and without leadership responsibilities. A proportional number of upper managers (n = 6), supervisors (n = 7) and workers (n = 12) were purposively sampled and interviewed. Interview data was analysed using Leximancer &#8211; an advanced computer assisted data mining tool. Results identified 10 emergent themes underlying a safety climate schema &#8211; many of these themes aligned closely with common safety climate factors in the academic literature. Results also showed differences between the safety factors that were dominant in the safety climate schemas of upper managers, supervisors and workers: upper managers were more closely associated with themes relating to &#8216;culture,&#8217; and &#8216;people&#8217;; supervisors were more closely associated with themes relating to &#8216;corporate values,&#8217; &#8216;management practices,&#8217; and &#8216;safety communication&#8217;; whereas workers were more closely associated with themes relating to &#8216;procedures,&#8217; and &#8216;safety training&#8217;. Results are discussed in relation to safety climate theory and in relation to how managers can use this knowledge to better communicate to the specific safety needs of different sub-groups. Overview Study 2 Study 2 aimed to better understand how perceived cultural profiles are related to safety. The Competing Values Framework adopted in this study proposes that four cultural types exist in unison in any organisation. Depending on the demands that are placed on the organisation, each type will be more or less dominant and each organisation will have a specific &#8216;cultural profile&#8217; reflecting the strengths of each type. A cross-section of individuals (N = 368) working in high risk industries were sampled to identify the relationship between perceived cultural profiles and (1) psychological safety climate and (2) individual safety incidents. Modal Profile Analysis (MPA) identified four commonly perceived cultural profiles across the sample. A one-way MANOVA indicated that individuals who perceived their organisation had a strong human relations profile, or a dual focused human relations-rational goal profile, reported higher safety climate perceptions and fewer safety incidents. Comparably, individuals who perceived their organisation had a strong internal process profile, or a dual focused internal process-rational goal profile, reported lower safety climate perceptions and more safety incidents. These findings are discussed in terms of their theoretical contribution to the safety climate literature, and in relation to the practical importance that culture plays in influencing safety. Overview Study 3 Study 3 aimed to better understand how the culture of an organisation influences safety, and to explore the levels of analysis that are involved in this relationship. Specifically, this study examined the role that an internal process culture played in influencing safety climate; and in turn the mediating role that two sources of safety climate &#8211; business-unit safety climate and perceived supervisory safety climate &#8211; played in explaining the relationship between culture and individual-level outcomes (incidents, satisfaction and turnover intentions). Results showed that business-unit culture was related to business-unit safety climate; and that business-unit safety climate and perceived supervisory safety climate mediated the relationship between business-unit culture and incidents, satisfaction and turnover intentions. This research adds to the safety climate literature by providing evidence for the multi-level nature of the relationship between culture, safety climate and outcomes.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Safety Climate, Organisational Culture, Competing Values Framework, Qualitative Analysis, Leximancer, Modal Profile Analysis, Meso-mediation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:212780</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'This Cyprus is so fertile and rich.....': A Study of the Economy of Roman Cyprus during the Antonine and Severan Periods</field><field name="creator">Pamela Davenport</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the economy of Roman Cyprus during the Antonine and Severan periods.

Perhaps the most important result of the study is that Roman Cyprus had a healthy, flourishing economy which made a significant contribution to the prosperity of the Roman Empire.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Roman Cyprus</field><field name="subject">Taxation</field><field name="subject">Coinage</field><field name="subject">Demography</field><field name="subject">Infrastructure</field><field name="subject">Harbours</field><field name="subject">Roads</field><field name="subject">Exports</field><field name="subject">Imports</field><field name="subject">Economy</field><field name="subject">Severan Emperors</field><field name="subject">Antonine Emperors</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:212833</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of genes and organisms associated with reductive acetogenesis in the rumen and forestomach of a native Australian marsupial</field><field name="creator">Emma Gagen</field><field name="description">Reductive acetogenesis via the acetyl-CoA pathway is a hydrogenotrophic pathway that has the potential to reduce methanogenesis from ruminant livestock. However our understanding of the organisms capable of this transformation (acetogens) is hindered by a lack of specific molecular tools for this group. In the present thesis, a PCR primer set specific for a wide range of acetogens was developed, targeting the acetyl-CoA synthase (ACS) gene which is unique to the acetyl-CoA pathway. ACS was found to be useful marker for potential acetogens and ACS sequences could be used to infer family-level phylogeny for many acetogens. ACS gene specific primers were used in combination with existing molecular tools targeting the gene encoding formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase (FTHFS, present in the acetyl-CoA pathway but not unique to it) and 16S rRNA genes, as well as cultivation techniques, to investigate acetogen diversity in the rumen and two analogous gut systems where microbial hydrogenotrophy differs: the forestomach of a native Australian marsupial, the tammar wallaby Macropus eugenii; and the developing rumen of young lambs. Novel potential acetogens present naturally in the rumen of pasture fed and grain fed cattle affiliated with the Ruminococcaceae/Blautia group and distantly with the Lachnospiraceae. A large diversity of potential acetogens with functional genes affiliating broadly between the Lachnospiraceae and Clostridiaceae though without a close sequence from a cultured relative were also detected. Rumen acetogen enrichment cultures revealed the presence of a known acetogen, Eubacterium limosum, in grain fed cattle, as well as novel acetogens affiliating with the Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae/Blautia group. The novel potential acetogen population detected in this study may represent an important hydrogenotrophic group in the rumen that we understand very little about and that requires further investigation. The tammar wallaby, which exhibits foregut fermentation analogous to that of the rumen but resulting in lower methane emissions, housed a different acetogen population to that of the bovine rumen (LIBSHUFF, p &lt;0.0001) though novel potential acetogens in the tammar wallaby forestomach affiliated broadly in the same family groups (Blautia group, Lachnospiraceae and between Lachnospiraceae and Clostridiaceae without a close cultured isolate). Acetogen enrichment cultures from the tammar wallaby forestomach facilitated isolation of a novel acetogen, which was closely related to potent reductive acetogens from kangaroos. The differences between the acetogen population of the tammar wallaby forestomach and the bovine rumen may be a factor in explaining lower methane emissions and methanogen numbers in tammar wallabies relative to ruminants. Using a gnotobiotically reared lamb model, the unique acetogen population present in the developing rumen was identified and it&#8217;s response to methanogen colonisation examined. The acetogen E. limosum and potential acetogen Ruminococcus obeum were identified as well as a small diversity of novel potential acetogens affiliating with the Blautia group and the Lachnospiraceae. A small but diverse population of naturally resident methanogens were also identified in gnotobiotically reared lambs that had been isolated at 17 hours of age. After inoculation with Methanobrevibacter sp. 87.7, methanogen numbers in gnotobiotically reared lambs significantly increased but acetogen diversity was not altered, indicating that this population is resilient to methanogen colonisation to some degree. The potential acetogen population in gnotobiotically reared lambs was significantly different (LIBSHUFF, p &lt; 0.0001) to that in conventionally reared sheep, which indicates that factors other than methanogen establishment alone, probably relating to other microbes and associated hydrogen concentrations in the rumen, affect acetogens during rumen development.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">acetogen</field><field name="subject">acetogenesis</field><field name="subject">acetyl-coA pathway</field><field name="subject">acetyl-CoA synthase</field><field name="subject">formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase</field><field name="subject">gnotobiotic</field><field name="subject">methanogenesis</field><field name="subject">rumen</field><field name="subject">tammar wallaby</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:212829</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effect of Mental Workload on Decision Making in Air Traffic Control</field><field name="creator">Selina Fothergill</field><field name="description">The aim of the present research was to examine the impact of mental workload on conflict resolution decision making in air traffic control (ATC). While previous studies have examined the effect of workload on performance (Averty, 2004; Kopardekar &amp; Magyrits, 2002) and conflict detection (Mogford, 1997; Seamster, Redding, Cannon, Ryder &amp; Purcell, 1993), limited research examines the effect of workload on conflict resolution decisions. The aim of the first study was to gain an initial understanding of how controllers manage their airspace. Results demonstrated that controllers scan repetitively, in a clockwise and top-bottom pattern; group aircraft with similar characteristics and use at least five lateral and eight vertical conflict resolution heuristics. Study two examined the effect of conflict type on conflict resolution under different levels of workload. Under moderate workload controllers used a mix of solutions, while under high workload, solutions became more conservative. Study three examined the effect of other contextual factors on conflict resolution. Results again suggested conflict type affects conflict resolution decisions and also that other contextual parameters, such as aircraft performance may play a role in solution preferences. Study four examined the effect of workload on conflict resolution using a realistic ATC task. Workload not only impacted on controllers&#8217; performance scores, but interacted with conflict type to determine whether an efficient solution was preferred over a less efficient solution. This research identifies some of the heuristics experts use when competing priorities are present and provides an understanding of how conflict type, contextual factors and workload affect decisions. Findings contribute to the naturalistic decision making (NDM) literature by demonstrating how the situation can influence decision making.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">workload</field><field name="subject">decision making</field><field name="subject">conflict resolution</field><field name="subject">air traffic control</field><field name="subject">performance</field><field name="subject">human factors</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:213007</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An assessment of disease on the health of green (Chelonia mydas) and loggerhead (Caretta caretta) turtles in southern Queensland Australia</field><field name="creator">Mark-Shannon Flint</field><field name="description">Marine turtle numbers are in a state of flux around the world. Six of the seven remaining species of these long-lived animals are threatened; with the seventh being listed data deficient. Reasons for these fluctuations are speculated to be due to human related impacts (direct) and increase in disease occurrence caused by changes in the natural environment (indirect). Most direct impacts have been identified and strategies implemented to mitigate their effects with varying degrees of success; however the indirect effects on marine animals remain an understudied area. This thesis outlined the development of ante- and post-mortem diagnostic techniques to identify prevalent diseases affecting two marine turtle species in southern Queensland over a four year (2006-2009) period. This data was used to determine the impact of disease on turtle survivorship. Two-hundred and ninety green turtles (Chelonia mydas) from Moreton and Shoalwater Bays were captured, clinically assessed and blood sampled. Clinically healthy animals (n = 211) were used to derive biochemical and haematological reference intervals using two methods. Comparisons with clinically unhealthy animals (n = 25) indicated all unhealthy animals had at least some plasma biochemical and haematological values outside the derived intervals (albumin, 48% of unhealthy animals; alkaline phosphatase (ALP), 35%; aspartate transaminase (AST), 13%; creatinine, 30%; globulin, 3%; glucose, 34%; lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), 26%; phosphorus, 22%; sodium, 13%; thrombocytes, 57%; and monocytes, 5%). Amongst small immature animals, those with Chelonibia testudinaria plastron barnacle counts of at least 20 were approximately three times more likely to be unhealthy than turtles with no barnacles. In addition, small immature and mature turtles were more likely to be unhealthy than large immature turtles (Chapter 2). By the same method, 101 loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) in Moreton Bay were assessed and bled. Clinically healthy animals (n = 63) were used to derive intervals. Comparisons with clinically unhealthy animals (n = 23) indicated 82% and 45% had at least one biochemical and hematological result, respectively, outside of at least one of the calculated intervals. Neither sex nor maturity (mature versus large immature) influenced the risk of being clinically unhealthy (Chapter 3). A standardised approach to post-mortem examination of marine turtles for veterinary clinicians with a concurrent descriptive review of gross and microscopic pathological lesions commonly seen during examination in Australia (Chapter 4) was used to accurately determine diseases and causes of death in 100 green turtles submitted from various regions of southern Queensland for examination. Spirorchiid parasitism was found to be the most frequently occurring cause of mortality (41.8%), followed by gastrointestinal impaction (11.8%), microbiological infectious diseases (5.2%) and trauma (5.2%). Spirorchiid parasitism with associated inflammation (75%) was the most frequently occurring disease followed by gastrointestinal impaction (5.1%). Season and turtle age had limited influences on disease. Severity of spirorchiidiasis in the brain was independent of severity in other organs (Chapter 5). From these examinations, the most prevalent disease syndrome (spirorchiidiasis) and a previously unreported finding in Australian waters (corneal fibropapillomatosis) were selected to be examined in greater detail. Spirorchiid parasites from four organs in five green turtles were identified by established morphological and molecular techniques. Morphological study of adults identified Carettacola sp. in the serosal wall of the gastrointestinal tract, Hapalotrema mehrai in the heart and Learedius learedi in the spleen. Worms from the brain probably belonged to the genus Neospirorchis. DNA sequences from a portion of the 28S ribosomal RNA gene were obtained; but only matches for Hapalotrema mehrai and Learedius learedi were made. The prevalence and severity of this disease warrants further investigation into development of molecular techniques for use as a prognostic tool for turtles entering rehabilitation (Chapter 6). Chelonid corneal fibropapillomatosis, a previously unreported disease manifestation in Australia, was identified in 0.5% of 787 examined green turtles in 2008 (Chapter 7). This novel syndrome was shown to reduce visibility, potentially negatively affecting turtle survivorship and should be monitored for further spread. Findings from this thesis and the published literature were used to derive a mathematical model to determine the effects of identified diseases on Moreton Bay green turtle survivorship. This model demonstrated diseases at current prevalence will not negatively affect survivorship but an adverse environmental disruption or an increase in current disease frequency may threaten these animals (Chapter 8). Information presented in this thesis was used to test the general hypothesis &#8216;Differences in disease and health between stranded and functional populations of marine turtles will indicate major and currently unmeasured causes of population decline.&#8217; This hypothesis was partially upheld. Differences in disease and health status between stranded and functional populations were demonstrated, but more work is required to comprehensively examine these statuses. Diagnostics and continued environmental assessment should become the focus of future investigations. These findings should be incorporated in future management strategies.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">blood reference interval</field><field name="subject">Caretta caretta</field><field name="subject">Chelonia mydas</field><field name="subject">corneal fibropapillomatosis</field><field name="subject">disease investigation</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">marine turtle</field><field name="subject">post-mortem examination</field><field name="subject">spirorchiidiasis</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:213013</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experience and benefits derived from a dark tourism site visit: the effect of demographics and enduring involvement</field><field name="creator">Eun Jung Kang</field><field name="description">Abstract Dark tourism has been recognised as a distinctive tourism phenomenon of the twenty-first century, with increasingly significant numbers of visitors and tourists going to dark tourism attractions and sites, new dark tourism products and attractions emerging, and modern global communication media generating interest in dark tourism attractions, while at the same time affecting the image of destinations. The phenomenon of dark tourism has been examined in academia from the mid-1990s; however, it remains one of the less developed areas of tourism and leisure research. Not surprisingly, knowledge of the experiences of visitors and tourists at dark tourism attractions and sites is both theoretically fragile and limited. In redressing this omission in tourism and leisure research, this study examines the effect of enduring involvement and socio-demographic variables on visitor experiences and benefits gained at a contemporary dark tourism site. The focus of the study is the April 3rd Peace Park on Jeju Island, South Korea, a site commemorating and memorialising one of the most destructive episodes in modern Korean history. In doing so, the study developed a theoretical framework for understanding visitor experiences at dark tourism sites, using a benefits-based approach along with the concept of enduring involvement. This approach provides a framework for comprehending visitors&#8217; dark tourism experiences by identifying reasons for visit, on-site experiences, and benefits gained from these experiences. Enduring involvement is applied to investigate the effect of a visitor&#8217;s &#8216;personal connection&#8217; to the tragic event when it comes to their experiences at the site. The April 3rd Peace Park on Jeju Island commemorates a violent political conflict, which began on April 3rd in 1948, and resulted in 30,000 of the inhabitants dead or missing. The park was inaugurated in 2008 for the purposes of education, commemoration, and reconciliation within the Jeju community, in which the family and relatives of both victims and perpetrators still live. The research employs qualitative and quantitative research methods to explore visitor experiences. In its qualitative component, 46 semi-structured interviews were conducted between September and October 2008 in order to identify reasons for visit, the cognitive and affective on-site experiences of visitors and the benefits gained from their visit. This data was utilised in the construction of a site-specific questionnaire. In the quantitative component, self-administered questionnaires and face-to-face interviews were conducted from June 23 to July 31, 2009. A total of 407 valid questionnaires, out of 450 distributed, were utilised to test 16 hypotheses derived from the theoretical framework. The results indicate that a benefits-based approach was effective in exploring visitors&#8217; dark tourism experiences. With this approach, a sense of obligation or personal duty was identified as one of the key reasons for visiting the site. Emotional experiences were also found to be important, and likely to lead to the visitors&#8217; benefits gained. However, results also indicate a benefits-based approach was not effective for segmentation of visitors. In relation to enduring involvement, visitor experiences and benefits gained from experiencing the site and its history were found to differ significantly based on visitors&#8217; level of enduring involvement. High involvement visitors were more likely to recall actual memories of the April 3rd incident, as opposed to acquiring knowledge of it or related issues at the site itself, in stark contrast with low involvement visitors. These differences in visitor experiences and benefits gained were due therefore to visitors&#8217; prior knowledge of and familiarity with the incident. The results of the study also indicate that high involvement visitors are more likely to be elderly, to reside locally, to be connected to the incident, or to have higher levels of education. Low involvement visitors on the other hand are more likely to be young, non-local, and with generally lower levels of education. The study concludes that an effective way of understanding dark tourism experiences from a theoretical perspective is to apply both a benefits-based approach and the concept of enduring involvement.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dark tourism</field><field name="subject">Benefits</field><field name="subject">Experience</field><field name="subject">Involvement</field><field name="subject">Thanatourism</field><field name="subject">Visitor study</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:213074</field></doc></add>
