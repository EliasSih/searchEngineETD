Consequently, how various spinal postures during loading and various loading rates for a given posture affect the disc's internal failure mechanics has yet to be documented. In the studies contained herein, ovine lumbar intervertebral discs have been mechanically disrupted by injecting radio-opaque gel into their nucleus via an injection screw inserted longitudinally through their inferior vertebra. The resulting disruption caused to each disc was subsequently examined using microcomputed tomography and microscopy in tandem.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5616</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Our lands, our selves: the postcolonial literary landscape of Maurice Gee and David Malouf</field><field name="creator">McWilliams, Amber</field><field name="description">Landscape is an enduring feature of Antipodean settler literature. Postcolonial fiction in New Zealand and Australia draws on pre-colonial, colonial, and postcolonial narratives of landscape to create compelling representations of place and people. In the adult fiction of New Zealand author Maurice Gee and Australian author David Malouf, characters typically turn to the landscape at moments of crisis or transition. Close analysis of Gee&#8217;s and Malouf&#8217;s fiction demonstrates that the physical environment serves as a touchstone for personal and national identity throughout personal and national histories. From childhood to old age, characters seek self-definition by locating themselves within their physical environment, rather than by directly referencing their social or cultural context. Individual life stages are shown to be analogous to early stages of national development for New Zealand and Australia &#8211; the journey from colonial child to mature identity for both the individual and the nation is figured through landscape images. However, Gee and Malouf also use the relationship between characters and landscape to reflect social attitudes and values, demonstrating a connection between confident identification with the &#8216;other&#8217; of the landscape and the ability to integrate meaningfully with the &#8216;others&#8217; of human society. Thus landscape functions in these texts as a means of both reflecting and constructing identity in postcolonial New Zealand and Australia.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5617</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Constitutional conflicts and aboriginal rights: hunting, fishing and gathering rights in Canada, New Zealand and the United States</field><field name="creator">Charlton, Guy</field><field name="description">Judicial resolution of non-aboriginal conflicts was crucial to the vindication of indigenous rights within the new state as the determination of the nature and quality of aboriginal legal interests and entitlements involved fundamental questions of land ownership, secure legal title for settler alienation, as well as governmental priority and competence. If not for these disputes, court decisions and common law doctrine solicitous of indigenous interests based on the idea of indigenous occupancy, use and possession of their territory, and the creation of law based on colonial and imperial policy -- which incorporated notions of indigenous sovereignty and supported pluralist legal relations -- would have been discarded by the courts due to the underlying dynamism and logic of colonialism. Using a recent judicial decision by the highest court in each jurisdiction as a window to discuss the various approaches courts have taken to usufructuary rights, this thesis discusses the major components of the legal doctrine of hunting, fishing and gathering rights in Canada, New Zealand and the United States. It argues that the judicial protection of these aboriginal or treaty rights have been profoundly affected by non-aboriginal disputes over the constitution and the nature of national polity. At the same time the analysis suggests that values &#8213;external to the law are not the sole determinant of judicial outcomes over time. Rather in certain instances the legal doctrine and decisions implicate values inherent to the legal system, such as a conceptual commitment to a logical internal structure, a respect for precedent and previous governmental policy as well as the principle that courts are disinterested dispensers of neutral justice. These internal values comingle with deep-seated commitments held by individual decision-makers and the judiciary more generally, regarding the constitutional structure of the state and the role of the judiciary.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5624</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Second chances: youth justice co-ordinators&#8217; perspectives on the youth justice family group conference process.</field><field name="creator">Slater, Christine Marie</field><field name="description">In New Zealand&#8217;s system of Youth Justice (YJ) the Family Group Conference (FGC) process plays a pivotal role in addressing the offending behaviour of young people under seventeen. Mandated under the Children, Young Persons, and their Families Act 1989 (the Act), the FGC is a formal meeting in which the persons most affected by a young person&#8217;s offending, typically the young person, their family, their victim(s) and associated professionals, collectively decide how the young person should be held accountable. The process is managed by a YJ Co-ordinator, appointed by the Department of Child, Youth and Family (the Department). This dissertation presents the findings of an evaluation of the YJ FGC process from the perspectives of YJ Co-ordinators. The study aimed to understand the process and the development of practice, to identify factors constituting best practice and current areas of weakness in the process. It comprised of semi-structured interviews with (n=19) YJ Co-ordinators with at least twelve years&#8217; practitioner experience (Project One) and four focus groups (n=27) of Co-ordinators with a range of practice (Project Two). Three major themes emerged from the thematic analysis of data: a) The Act as Anchor &#8211; philosophical underpinnings of the FGC process, b) Working with the Act &#8211; best practice and current issues in YJ FGC service provision, and c) The Office &#8211; organisational factors. The results indicated the YJ FGC process was effective for the majority of young people, but generally inadequate for recidivist young offenders with complex additional needs. Aspects of best practice included: aligned professional approaches to FGC philosophy and practice, service delivery by trained YJ Co-ordinators and the quality of FGC preparation. Also considered best practice was the inclusion of victims in the process to assist in the development of a strengths-based personalised plan for the young person. With several areas of weakness identified, recommendations for improving the process included: addressing Co-ordinator training and Departmental leadership, reviewing the process for recidivists, improving process information quality, enhancing professional collaboration and addressing Police training in the Act and the FGC. Limitations of the study and directions for future research are discussed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5626</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthetic studies towards polyketide derived biologically active natural products</field><field name="creator">Heapy, Amanda</field><field name="description">The first part of this thesis describes the successful synthesis of the FG ring fragment 178 of the structurally complex marine toxins, the pectenotoxins. The synthesis hinges on functional group manipulations of the advanced olefin-(Z) 179 to install the tetrahydrofuran and tetrahydropyran ring systems. Olefin-(Z) 179 is itself obtained by the cis selective Wittig olefination of aldehyde 180 and the phosphorus ylide derived from phosphonium salt 181. Key stereocentres of these two fragments are installed using a Katsuki-Sharpless asymmetric epoxidation and a Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation reaction, respectively. The second part of this research presents synthetic attempts to access the fungal metabolites cephalosporolides E and F (290). These compounds contain the small but interesting &#946;,&#947;-fused-[4.4]-spiroacetal-&#947;-lactone moiety which is a functional group found in seven known natural products, and has until recently eluded the synthetic chemist. A Fukuyama coupling reaction was initially proposed to prepare advanced precursor ketone 474 but proved to be unsuccessful in our hands. A variant of the original Fukuyama reaction was successfully employed to obtain the same advanced ketone 474 but low yielding reactions combined with the delicate nature of this structure posed an insurmountable bottleneck in the planned synthetic strategy.

This study explores a key issue: the role and importance of imagination in the developmental stages of spiritual intelligence in students within each of these groups. By comparing students in a Catholic integrated school with those in a State intermediate school, it identifies both similarities and differences that teachers need to take into account in carrying out their professional responsibilities. The study begins by analysing and explaining concepts of spiritual intelligence that are often a source of ambiguity and confusion for teachers. It draws on a well-established hierarchal stage developmental theory of spiritual intelligence, but supplements this with a corresponding account of the role of imagination in the formation of spiritual intelligence at each of these stages. Spiritual intelligence is based on a theistic definition and its development on the imagination side of cognition rather than emotions. This results in the development of a nine stage taxonomy which is tested by analysis of variance (ANOVA). The research design examines seven important social factors, or variables, affecting the development of spiritual intelligence: school age group (intermediate, middle and senior), gender (male and female), school sample type (gifted and talented and average mainstream), areas of giftedness and talent (bodily-kinaesthetic, logical-mathematical, linguistic, musical, spatial, interpersonal and environmental), type of school (state and integrated), ethnicity (New Zealand European and others) and religion (Catholic, non-Catholic Christians, other religions and no religion). Using Fisher's Exact Test of variance, current trends in the spiritual intelligence characteristics of students are identified. The study provides teachers with four statistically verified tasks, their respective criterion referenced task assessment schedules (CRS) and exemplars for assessing stages of development of spiritual intelligence in students. The findings of this research project will help teachers of Values Education and Religious Education, Directors of Religious Studies (DRS) and Boards of Trustees in Catholic integrated schools to understand the theoretical and pedagogical principles of spiritual development, enabling them to design research-based programmes for advancing spiritual intelligence in their students.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5629</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Monitoring and simulation of the filling and post-filling stages of the resin infusion process</field><field name="creator">Govignon, Quentin Paul Nic&#233;phore Marc Marie</field><field name="description">The doctoral research presented in this thesis is focused on the resin infusion moulding process. The resin infusion process is part of the liquid composite moulding family where a dry reinforcement is impregnated with a liquid resin inside a closed mould to form a composite part. The specificity of resin infusion resides in the fact that only one side of the mould is rigid, the cavity being sealed by a vacuum bag. The preform compaction and fluid flow are driven by the pressure difference between the cavity and the ambient pressure. The reinforcement can therefore exhibit through thickness deformation as the resin penetrates the cavity. The aim of the research was to monitor and simulate the process. A number of previous studies have considered the impregnation process, but very little work had focused on the post-filling stage of the process, once the resin inlet is closed and the resin pressure field inside the mould is left to equilibrate.  In the first part of this study, the behaviour of two different fibrous reinforcements was experimentally characterised, and a new model was developed to replicate the compaction behaviour of the reinforcements. This model is based on elastic behaviour, but was able to account for the compaction history of the reinforcement.  A comprehensive monitoring system was designed and built to collect relevant experimental data to be compared with the simulation. This included i  the development of a mould fitted with sensors, as well as a stereophotogrammetry system which provides full field monitoring of variations in reinforcement properties. This system measures local cavity thickness, allowing calculation of other parameters such as fibre volume fraction and permeability.  A 1D finite element simulation of the resin infusion process is subsequently presented. The simulation covers both the filling and post-filling stages of the process and uses a modified version of Darcy&#8217;s law to govern the flow of fluid through porous media.  Finally, an investigation of different factors affecting the post-filing is presented through both simulation and experimental evaluations.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5630</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The pedagogy of the clinic: health professionals and women with viral sexually transmitted infections</field><field name="creator">Cook, Catherine</field><field name="description">This study investigates sexual health teaching and its effects. The focus is on how the health clinic works as a pedagogical environment where lessons are offered by clinicians to women patients (often unwittingly) about morality, femininity and the body. Of central concern is the question of how health professionals might contribute to women's quality of life after a viral STI diagnosis. I use examples of the reported engagement between clinicians, women and the two most common viral STIs, the human papilloma virus (HPV) and the herpes simplex virus (HSV). To consider the effects of the myriad beliefs that inform clinical teaching I draw from poststructuralist feminist discourse theory. For data collection I used in-depth email interviews, a research method that allowed participants with viral STIs to 'speak' more freely than might be possible in face-to-face interviews. The method also readily enabled me to interview sexual health clinicians and other women within a wide geographical area, in New Zealand, Australia, North America and England. My research findings include the insights that: by the time women seek out medical care for a viral STI they have received considerable social 'education' that STIs are categorically different from other conditions; although clinicians emphasise the normalcy of viral STIs they tend to have limited knowledge of the difficulties women face in disruptions to sexuality after a diagnosis. Liberal views about sex do not necessarily make the negotiation of safer heterosexual sex and prevention of STI transmission easier for women. Women found it helpful when clinicians addressed both the medical 'normalcy' of viral STIs and their potential to disrupt women's sense of self, sexual and social relationships. In public health education, gynaecological examinations are presented as a routine and essential practice, yet my study found that such examinations are often difficult for women. Research addressing women's reasons for non-compliance with screening emphasises 'underlying' psychological categories of 'anxiety' and 'poor coping'. Minimal attention is paid to the effects of clinicians' interventions upon women's decision-making. My findings indicate that women's screening compliance is influenced by clinicians' gender, (in) attention to power relations, rapport-building, attentiveness to bodily (dis)comfort, and technical skill. In striving for non-judgmental, scientific teaching, clinicians were often unaware that their talk inevitably constituted viral STIs as 'moral' infections. Clinicians may best contribute to women's lives by acknowledging that medical discourse is only one part of the fragmentary and contradictory education women receive about bodies and selves.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5632</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Surface properties and finishing of aluminium casting alloys</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Chuong Luu</field><field name="description">Aluminium alloys are materials of huge practical importance. However their use is dependent on surface oxides and hydroxides which are critical in protecting the highly reactive underlying metal. The stability and integrity of the oxides and hydroxides are also crucial in finishing and bonding applications. Better understanding of these surfaces has significant implications in enhancing their application. LM6 and LM25 aluminium-silicon casting alloys were studied as these materials show a particularly inhomogeneous phase structure and complex surface behaviour. This complexity is of fundamental interest and leads to considerable practical difficulties, especially in surface finishing. The surfaces were characterised, subjected to thermal treatments and modified with Ion Assisted Deposition coatings of TiN. A characterisation method for these surfaces was also developed based around the layered structure of aluminium hydroxides. It was observed that the thermally induced surface segregation of minor elements, such as Mg and Na, is availability-limited. Surface concentrations of these elements are determined by the net effect of enriching via surface segregation and depleting through surface evaporation. The inhomogeneous phase structure of the alloys used in this study enables the observation of two migration processes driven by different forces. Below the oxide dominated surface layer, the migration of Mg is driven by chemical potential gradient and is primarily perpendicular to the surface. Closer to the surface, concentration driven horizontal diffusion of the element occurs. The deposition of a thin TiN layer has been used to probe the interface. While the deposition conditions of TiN coatings affect the chemistry of the coatings, substrate surface conditions determine how well bonding is achieved between the film and substrate. The height difference between silicon particles in the eutectic phase and the primary aluminium phase of the casting alloys provides surface roughening and optimal adhesion through mechanical interlocking with the coating. This height difference is achieved by preferentially removing the surface exposed primary aluminium phases with ion bombardment.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5633</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Unravelling the interactions of the beta7 integrin cytoplasmic domain</field><field name="creator">Chan, Yih-Chih</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted until 03/2012, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5638</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fluoride Emissions from Aluminium Electrolysis Cells</field><field name="creator">Patterson, Edwin Campbell</field><field name="description">Modern aluminium electrolysis cells generate between 15 to 40 kg fluoride per tonne of aluminium fluoride produced. This represent a large material recycle load, of which over 99% of this fluoride content is returned to the cell via a dry scrubbing system. Most past research has concentrated on increasing the efficiency of this end scrubbing system, neglecting the actual cause of the fluoride emissions. Lower emissions would reduce this loading, resulting in smaller scrubbing systems, and ultimately lower capital costs. Fluoride emissions also contribute to the changes in heat balance in the cell. The fluoride evolved represents a material loss that requires to be replaced with AlF3. The addition of this species is a major variable in cell heat balance instability [1]. Overall a better understanding of the contributors to fluoride generation in an aluminium cell would benefit the operation and economics of an aluminium smelter. Past studies [2-6] have identified most of the important emission contributors to hydrogen fluoride (HF) generation. Two sources were shown to be significant. The most studied source was primary HF generation. This is HF generation from electrolytic reactions between constituents of the fluoride based electrolyte and water from the fed alumina and hydrogen in the anode. Overlooked in some studies were generation reactions outside the electrolyte - defined in this study as secondary HF generation. This source was found to occur mainly from hydrolysis reactions with the generated particulate fluorides. However the results and the relative contributions from these studies are not strictly applicable to the current generation scenario. The present smelting practices and technology, dry scrubbing technology and raw material specifications differ substantially from those used during the period of each past investigation. The present study was designed to identify and quantify emission sources for the current smelter technology and practices. This used controlled laboratory based studies of the individual generation sources complemented by in plant studies analysing the HF emission from production aluminium electrolysis cells. It was shown that the main contributor to primary HF generation is the addition of water to the electrolyte from the feed alumina. This results in the cyclic short term variations in HF emission, which correlate to the rate of alumina addition to the cell. Laboratory and industrial studies show that only a fraction of the added water reacts. The water reacted is likely the structural water of the alumina. The adsorbed water is thought to be flashed off before addition to the bath. Depending on feeding technology and crust integrity, between 10 to 50% of this water can react. This produces 7 to 14 kgF/tonneAl. This makes it the most significant emission component. The remainder of this structural water is either entrained in the anode gases or forms part of the electrolyte dissolved water content. Dissolved water generation is the second most significant primary generation contributor, and third most significant emission component. Dissolved water is in equilibrium with the alumina content of the bath. It represents a constant emission source. Depending on feeding technology and cell design, the emission can vary between 3 to 10 kgF/tonneAl. The final primary HF emission contributor results from electrolytic generation of the hydrogen content of the anode. Laboratory studies found the emission to have a reaction efficiency of approximately 10%. This results in a small emission, of 2 &#8211; 5 kg/tonneAl. The remainder of the hydrogen content is expected to be entrained in the anode gases, as the generation of this CO/CO2 mixture is an order of magnitude greater than the HF generation reaction. Secondary generation of hydrogen fluoride is also a significant HF emission source. In an industrial cell this results from mainly thermal hydrolysis of the particulate fluoride emissions at the crust&#8211;air interface. Laboratory studies have shown that other identified secondary emission sources are unlikely due to the ambient conditions and feeding practices in a modern prebake aluminium electrolysis cell. Hence previously proposed generation from hydrolysis of the particulates in the ducts and desorption of the surface fluoride from the fed secondary alumina, have been found to be insignificant compared to the main HF generation sources. The thermal hydrolysis emission contributor is the only significant secondary generation emission component. Industrial measurements show that it varies with ambient humidity and crust integrity, two parameters which vary constantly in a modern prebake anode cell. Measurements show that the emission from this source is responsible for 2 to 8 kgF/tonneAl. This makes it the second highest HF emission component. Control of the crust condition and feeder hole states reduces this component significantly. Hence in a modern prebake aluminium cell, the most significant operational factors affecting emission are related mainly to secondary generation. Industrial measurements show that the long term variations in an emission result from changes in the ambient humidity and the cells crust cover. Control of the crust integrity is thus paramount in reducing such variations. This relates both to normal operation and batch operations. Reduction of all other sources of emission are a material composition problem. Simply reducing the water content (LOI(300) and LOI(1000)) and reducing the hydrogen content of the anodes will reduce the emission. However material considerations affect other aspects of cell operation and hence these factors are not as simple to adjust.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5662</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of adolescent obesity in New Zealand: quality of life, psychosocial factors and psychological theory</field><field name="creator">Carne, Sarah S.</field><field name="description">Purpose: To ascertain the quality of life (QOL) in an adolescent population with a high prevalence of obesity, compare findings to previous research, and  investigate psychosocial factors that may account for differences in results by  use of psychological theory.

His greatest poem, "The Prelude" had as its subject matter the growth of his own poetic mind; something that can also be understood as the growth of his 'imagination'. His friend and fellow poet, later turned philosopher, Samuel Taylor Coleridge developed a novel and romantic understanding of 'the Imagination' in the early years of his friendship with Wordsworth. He identified Wordsworth's genius, as a poet, as the product of a particularly gifted imagination, something he conceived of as an innate ability. In this thesis I challenge this 'Romantic' representation of Wordsworth's genius, one that has become canonical, largely as a result of Coleridge's treatment of Wordsworth, Poetry and Imagination in "Biographia Literaria". In making a more detailed analysis of Wordsworth's own claims about his identity, his poetic art, and imagination, I develop an argument that proposes a very different ethos to the one still largely considered normative in English Studies. The argument depends on a better recognition of Wordsworth's Classical Republican sympathies in the 1790s, and the extent to which the example of the famous Roman statesman, orator, philosopher, and poet, Marcus Tullius Cicero captured Wordsworth's imagination. Contrary to those who would romanticise Wordsworth's genius, I suggest his best work was the product of a theory of poetry based on principles that defined a very classical ideology. My argument builds on the work of recent, more detailed, representations of Wordsworth as a historical subject whose ideas were defined by particular historical circumstances, and whose identity developed out of those experiences. In addition to paying more attention to the 'historical' Wordsworth, I have also made a detailed analysis of his language, discovering the existence of a particular idiom. Wordsworth's vocabulary reflects, not only a classical humanist ideology, but also strong Stoic sentiments and an attitude of Socratic, Academic Scepticism. I trace the source of this characteristic idiom back to the influence of Cicero whose works, along with Marcus Quintilian's "De Institutione Oratoria" defined key aspects of Wordsworth's poetic theory in the late 1790s and early 1800s.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5677</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A critical edition of The triumphant widow, or, The medley of humours by William Cavendish and Thomas Shadwell</field><field name="creator">Hoare, Sally Ann</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted until 03/2012, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5681</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessment of left ventricular diastolic function with three dimensional cardiac magnetic resonance imaging</field><field name="creator">Fonseca, Carissa Grace.</field><field name="description">Measurement of diastolic left ventricular (LV) function is vitally important in the assessment of cardiac disease. However, only limited information on tissue function can be obtained with current clinical techniques. This Thesis developed and investigated novel parameters of both global and regional myocardial function, using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with three-dimensional tissue tagging. Multidirectional peak myocardial shortening strains and strain rates, as well as the peak systolic displacement and velocity of the mitral valve annulus plane (MVP), were considered as parameters of LV systolic function. The corresponding peak diastolic strain relaxation rates and peak diastolic MVP velocity were used to assess diastolic function. The effects of normal ageing were studied in people with no evidence of cardiac disease, and compared with the effects of disease in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). In normal healthy subjects, systolic strain parameters were preserved, while diastolic parameters were impaired, with age. DM patients showed impaired diastolic function on correction for age, and systolic functional parameters were also impaired, even though LV ejection fraction was normal. MVP systolic and diastolic motion were reduced both with age and in DM patients. Systolic LV torsion was increased with age and in DM, with no corresponding increase in torsional relaxation. Both systolic and diastolic function parameters were regionally heterogeneous. With normal ageing, diastolic function was impaired in a regionally non-uniform manner. Thus, a complete assessment of LV function requires measurement of LV tissue mechanics as well as chamber haemodynamics. MRI provides valuable information regarding myocardial tissue behaviour, contributing to systolic and/or diastolic dysfunction, which cannot be obtained otherwise. Systolic tissue dysfunction may develop concomitantly in patients with diastolic dysfunction, even when global ejection fraction is preserved. Regional analyses provide important information on how local changes contribute to global function. The influence of age must be taken into account in studies of disease.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5715</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A developmental comparison of voltage-activated Ca2+ channels and group I metabotropic glutamate receptors in oculomotor and hypoglossal motoneurons</field><field name="creator">Miles, Gareth B.</field><field name="description">Voltage-activated Ca2+ channels and group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are important determinants of neuronal excitability and repetitive discharge behaviour. They are also implicated in perinatal developmental processes and Ca2+ -dependent excitotoxic cascades thought to contribute to neurodegeneration. To understand the role that these channels/receptor systems play in the physiology, ontogeny and pathophysiology of MNs, it is necessary to characterise them, during development, in MNs that differ functionally in the behaviours they control, the firing behaviour they produce, their rate of maturation, and their vulnerability to degeneration in ALS. Surprisingly few studies, however, have characterised these channels/receptor systems in MNs, particularly beyond early postnatal stages. I therefore compared voltage-activated Ca2+ channels and group I mGluRs in brain slices from neonate (P1-5) and juvenile (P14-19) rat, in oculomotor (III) and hypoglossal (XII) MNs using whole-cell patch-clamp recording and immunohistochemical techniques. III MNs innervate extraocular muscles, control eye movements that are not fully functional in rat until 2 weeks postnatal, fire at high frequency for sustained periods, and are resistant in ALS. In contrast, XII MNs innervate tongue muscles, control behaviours that are functional at birth, fire bursts of low frequency action potentials, and are vulnerable to degeneration in ALS. In neonates, low voltage-activated (LVA) Ca2+ current densities are similar in III and XII MNs but high voltage-activated (HVA) Ca2+ current densities are ~2-fold higher in XII MNs. While N- and P/Q-type HVA Ca2+ channels are present in both MN pools, greater expression of P/Q-type channels in XII MNs accounts for their greater HVA Ca2+ currents. Developmentally, LVA and HVA Ca2+ current densities decrease ~2-fold by P14-19 in III MNs, but remain unchanged in XII MNs. Thus, in juveniles the HVA Ca2+ current density is ~3-fold greater and the LVA ca2+ current density ~2-fold greater in XII compared to III MNs. The group I mGluR agonist, DHPG, induces inward currents in III and XII MNs of neonatal and juvenile rat, which are mediated by the reduction of a resting K+ conductance. Antagonism of these currents by the mGluR1 antagonist LY367385, but not the mGluR5 antagonist MPEP, and immunohistochemical labelling for mGluR1a but not mGluR5 protein on III and XII MNs, suggest that currents primarily result from the activation of mGluR1. In neonatal rat the current density of DHPG-induced currents is similar between III and XII MNs. However, in juvenile rat DHPG-induced current density is ~3-fold greater in XII compared with III MNs. Differential expression of LVA and HVA Ca2+ currents and varying effects of group I mGluR activation in III and XII MNs during development supports a role for these channels and receptor systems in determining the distinct firing patterns of these two different classes of MNs. The greater voltage-activated Ca2+ currents and group I mGluR-mediated effects in XII MNs, particularly in juvenile MNs, may also contribute to the greater sensitivity of XII MNs to pathophysiological processes, predisposing them to degeneration as seen in ALS.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5716</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of undergraduate student self-employment intention and the impact of entrepreneurship education and previous entrepreneurial experience</field><field name="creator">McStay, Dell</field><field name="description">Chapter One, introduction and research methodology.

However as yet we do not fully understand the types of familiness or the conditions that give rise to them and as such familiness remains in need of further exploration. This research explores the familiness construct and its role in perpetuating entrepreneurial activity in the family business through the development and deployment of an entrepreneurial orientation (EO) over multiple generations. The Resource-Based View (RBV) is the adopted firm level framework used to identify the unique bundle of family resources that represent familiness. These resources are then explored for their contribution to nurturing and perpetuating an EO, thereby creating a source of competitive advantage. The research also explores the association of EO to the achievement of the firm&#8217;s nonfinancial objectives. Using exploratory in-depth qualitative case studies of four multigenerational Australian family firms, data was collected via semi-structured interviews, observations, and secondary documents. NVivo assisted with the coding and analysis of data to identify common patterns and themes from both within-case and across-case analyses.Six resource dimensions were found to represent the familiness resource bundle: reputation, experience &#8211; insights and skills, learning,  decision-making, relationships, and networks. These resource dimensions, identified by their prevalence across all four cases, are spread across the resource categories (human, organizational, and process) and thus confirm the widespread potential of the family&#8217;s influence in business. The resource dimensions displayed a paradoxical nature and the ability to manage these paradoxes enabled these firms to exploit their familiness advantages (f+) and simultaneously mitigate the disadvantages (f-). Managing the paradoxical nature was central to the multigenerational success of these firms. Three of the six dimensions (experience &#8211; insights and skills, decision-making, and networks) were instrumental in influencing the development of the firm&#8217;s EO while three other dimensions (reputation, learning, and relationships) were more closely aligned with a market, learning, and communication orientation. The findings also suggest that family firms are better able to address non-financial objectives when they have strong EOs that engaged them in entrepreneurial activities. All interpretations of the findings are integrated into a conceptual model for future empirical analysis.The study contributes to research by identifying six dimensions (familiness resources model) that constitute the familiness resource bundle and through which family influence is most prevalent and best examined within the business. The study suggests that the paradoxical nature of these dimensions highlights conditions that give rise to familiness advantages (f+) or disadvantages (f-) and that managing these paradoxes gives rise to sustained competitive advantage. The study also proposes that the family is most influential in driving the firm&#8217;s EO: by being exposed to internal and external experiences that heighten their ability for opportunity recognition; by balancing the process (informal or formal), speed (fast or slow), and forum (concentrated or collaborative) of decisions; and by integrating and exploiting the firm&#8217;s strong and weak network ties. Finally the study confirms a close association between a firm&#8217;s EO and its non-financial objectives. The study thus encourages family firms to pursue entrepreneurial activity, not only because it sustains their livelihood over generations, but because it also assists in meeting the family&#8217;s non-financial objectives.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Family-owned business enterprises Management</field><field name="subject">Entrepreneurship</field><field name="subject">Resource-based view</field><field name="subject">familiness</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management (0454)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/17</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Polymerisation and export of alginate in Pseudomanas aeruginosa : functional assignment and catalytic mechanism of Alg8/44 : a thesis presented to Massey University in partial fulfilment of the requirement for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Microbiology</field><field name="creator">Remminghorst, Uwe</field><field name="description">Alginate biosynthesis is not only a major contributor to pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa but also an important factor in colonization of adverse environmental habitats by biofilm formation. The requirement of proteins Alg8 and Alg44, encoded by their respective genes in the alginate biosynthesis gene cluster, for alginate biosynthesis of P. aeruginosa was demonstrated, since deletion mutants were unable to produce or polymerise alginate. AlgX deletion mutants failed to produce the alginate characteristic mucoid phenotype, but showed low concentrations of uronic acid monomers in the culture supernatants. Complementation experiments using PCR based approaches were used to determine the complementing ORF and all deletion mutants could be complemented to at least wildtype levels by introducing a plasmid harbouring the respective gene. Increased copy numbers of Alg44 did not impact on the amount of alginate produced, whereas increased copy numbers of the alg8 gene led to an at least 10 fold stronger alginate production impacting on biofilm structure and stability. Topological analysis using reporter protein fusions and subsequent subcellular fractionation experiments revealed that Alg8 is located in the cytoplasmic membrane and contains at least 4 transmembrane helices, 3 of them at its C terminus. Its large cytosolic loop showed similarities to inverting glycosyltransferases and the similarities were used to generate a threading model using SpsA, a glycosyltransferase involved in spore coat formation of B. subtilis, as a template. Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed the importance of identified motifs commonly detected in glycosyltransferases. Inactivation of the DXD motif, which has been shown to be involved in nucleotide sugar binding, led to loss-offunction mutants of Alg8 and further replacements revealed putative candidates for the catalytic residue(s). Contradicting the commonly reported prediction of being a transmembrane protein, Alg44 was shown to be a periplasmic protein. The highest specific alkaline phosphatase activity of its fusion protein could be detected in the periplasmic fraction and not in the insoluble membrane fraction. Bioinformatical analysis of Alg44 revealed structural similarities of its N terminus to PilZ domains, shown to bind cyclic-di-GMP, and of its C terminus to MexA, a membrane fusion protein involved in multi-drug efflux systems. Thus, it was suggested that Alg44 has a regulatory role for alginate biosynthesis in bridging the periplasm and connecting outer and cytoplasmic membrane components. AlgX was shown to interact with MucD, a periplasmic serine protease or chaperone homologue, and is suggested to exert its impact on alginate production via MucD interaction. In vitro alginate polymerisation assays revealed that alginate production requires protein components of the outer and cytoplasmic membrane as well as the periplasm, and these data were used to construct a model describing a multi-enzyme, membrane and periplasm spanning complex for alginate polymerisation, modification and export.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pseudomonas aeruginosa</field><field name="subject">alginates</field><field name="subject">biosynthesis</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270300 Microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/735</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal : self-care processes among Thai people suffering from AIDS : a thesis presented in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Siriwatanamethanon, Jirapa</field><field name="description">AIDS is a chronic disease that seriously affects health, emotions, social relations and household economy. People living with HIV/AIDS experience great suffering, stigmatisation and discrimination from other people around them because they know that it is incurable, contagious, evokes social disgust and is a complex disease requiring life-long self-care. This researcher explored ways people with HIV/AIDS take care of their health and manage their lives in the context of stigma and discrimination. A grounded theory study was conducted with 30 participants with HIV/AIDS, in Mahasarakham Province, Thailand. Participants were recruited from an HIV/AIDS day care clinic and by snowball sampling. Data were gathered through in-depth interviews, participant observations and field notes made during home visits. Interviews were tape recorded, then transcribed verbatim. &#8220;From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal&#8221; was generated inductively from the data as the basic social psychological process of Thai people living with HIV/AIDS. From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal comprised four categories: being HIV/AIDS, making choices, keeping well and feeling empowered. The category &#8220;being HIV/AIDS&#8221;- discovering the meaning of having HIV/AIDS, comprises four concepts: being diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, being stigmatised, suffering, and learning about HIV/AIDS. The category &#8220;making choices&#8221;- to live a normal life, involves three concepts: avoiding unhappy situations, getting remarried and seeking support. The category &#8220;keeping well&#8221;- maintaining emotional and physical health, includes eight concepts: religious practices, keeping a cheerful mind, self-treatment, taking care of the body, keeping the environment clean to prevent getting germs, healthy behaviours, getting healthcare services, and attention to, and concern about, medication. The last category &#8220;feeling empowered&#8221;- personal and social acceptance of illness, includes eight concepts: being encouraged, acknowledging the disease, social acceptance, tamjai, feeling proud of self, feeling good about life, feeling lucky and having hope. In the context of northeastern Thailand, successful management of HIV/AIDS was underpinned by participants making a transition from &#8220;experiencing social disgust&#8221; to &#8220;passing as normal&#8221; within their communities. The desire to live a normal life despite having HIV/AIDS motivated participants to undertake effective self-care in order to remain symptom free (thus avoiding visible signs of the disease), and to selectively disclose their illness to avoid the ongoing risk of stigma and discrimination. The findings of this study are useful in that they will provide Thai health professionals with a clearer conceptualisation of self-care among the Thai population. An inductively derived theory of self-care among Thai with HIV/AIDS can be applied and integrated by health professionals into the self-care models for people living with HIV/AIDS including models used in nursing education, research and practice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">AIDS</field><field name="subject">Self-care</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">Stigma</field><field name="subject">Discrimination</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321100 Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/739</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Managing risk : a case study of a non-government organisation that provides long-term care and support services for people with mental, intellectual and physical disabilities : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Management at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Mohammed, Kassim M.</field><field name="description">This research examines the way employees perceive risk in a non-governmental healthcare organisation that provides care and support for people with mental, intellectual and physical disabilities. Thirty-four respondents from all levels and services within an NGO participated in in-depth semi-structured interviews to explore the meaning of the concept of risk from their own viewpoints, as well as their perspectives regarding types and sources of risk in their work and initiatives for controlling and dealing with such types and sources. This involved discussing the role of training in improving the awareness of employees in minimising risk, and the effect of training on the entire risk management process. Additional information was obtained by the researcher from documentation and personal observation. Themes that emerged from analysing data pointed to the interrelated link between perception and risk. Accordingly, the study found that risk is culturally constructed, individualistic, and subjective. It was evident that risk is a perceptual matter affected by beliefs, feelings, knowledge, culture, image, context, and the experience of people. The culture of fear of risk and of perceiving risk as something purely negative was dominant among the participants, who viewed risk as an unfavourable issue that does not have opportunities, which creates another source of risk &#8211; the risk of perception of risk. This research demonstrates that the perceptual aspect of risk emphasises the central role of people in any risk management process. For effective risk management, all perspectives should be considered. This requires a participatory system of managing risk, improving the awareness of people about risk, and modifying the culture of risk among them. Training has a significant role in the achievement of these fundamentals.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">MASH Trust</field><field name="subject">non-governmental organisations</field><field name="subject">risk management</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">people with disabilities</field><field name="subject">health care organisations</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360200 Policy and Administration</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/792</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Surveillance for diseases of poultry with specific reference to avian influenza : a dissertation presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Lockhart, Caryl Yolanda</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses issues related to surveillance for disease in commercial and non-commercial poultry populations. The motivation for this work has largely arisen from the unprecedented outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 that have occurred in 52 countries in Asia, Africa and Europe since 2003. A series of studies are presented using data derived from two countries, Vietnam and New Zealand. The two Vietnamese studies provide in-depth epidemiological analyses of the outbreak of HPAI H5N1 from December 2003 to March 2004. The three New Zealand studies deal with issues related to the development of effective surveillance strategies for HPAI &#8212; informed both directly and indirectly by the findings from the Vietnamese studies. This approach provides an example of how &#8216;lessons&#8217; learnt from countries that have experienced large scale infectious disease epidemics can be used to assist in the design of surveillance activities in (as yet) unaffected countries. The descriptive analyses of the 2003 &#8211; 2004 outbreak of HPAI H5N1 in Vietnam indicate that the epidemic was seeded simultaneously in the north and south of the country in the later part of 2003 with 87% of provinces affected by February 2004. HPAI risk was concentrated around the Mekong and Red River Deltas. The broad scale spatial distribution of disease is likely to have been associated with regional differences in the poultry farming, trade in poultry, and environmental conditions such as the presence of bodies of water which would support reservoir species for the virus. A Bayesian zero-inflated Poisson regression model was used to quantify the influence of environmental and demographic factors on the spatial distribution of HPAI positive communes. In areas where disease was reported, our results show that HPAI risk was positively associated with the presence of irrigation and negatively associated with elevation. After controlling for these fixed effects, a single large area of elevated risk in the Red River Delta area was identified, presumably arising from similarities in the likelihood of reporting disease or the presence of factors increasing disease transmission and spread. Further investigations to elucidate likely transmission mechanisms, targeting this area of the country, would be a profitable area of future research. The second part of this thesis presents three studies that address issues related to the development of effective surveillance strategies for HPAI in New Zealand. The first was a cross-sectional study to enumerate the prevalence of backyard poultry ownership in two areas (one urban and the other rural) close to a large provincial city in the North Island of New Zealand. The prevalence of poultry ownership was 2% (95% CI 1% &#8211; 4%) in the urban area and 19% (95% CI 12% &#8211; 30%) in the rural area. The relatively low numbers of land parcels where poultry are present indicates that these areas, in the event of an infectious disease incursion, would be unlikely to pose a risk for spread of infectious agent. A cross-sectional survey of all members of the Poultry Industry Association of New Zealand was conducted in the later half of 2007. Respondents were asked to document contacts made with other enterprises related to feed, live birds and hatching eggs, table eggs and poultry product, and waste litter and manure. Patterns of contact were analysed using social network analyses. Each of the four networks had scale-free properties, meaning that for each movement type there were small numbers of enterprises that had contacts with large numbers of enterprises (potential &#8216;super-spreaders&#8217; of disease). The presence of an undetected infectious disease in enterprises with super-spreader characteristics increases the likelihood that an epidemic will propagate rapidly through the population, assuming there is a directly proportional relationship between the number of contacts an enterprise makes and the probability that disease will be transferred from one location to another. While the finding that feed suppliers had large numbers of poultry farm contacts in the feed network came as no surprise, what was of greater interest was that there were small numbers of poultry farms that reported off-farm movements of feed. This should serve as an important reminder for disease control authorities: movement (and other) restrictions applied during the course of an animal health emergency should be applied across a range of industry sectors, recognising that some industry participants may practice activities that are not entirely typical for their enterprise type (e.g. poultry farms on-selling feed to other farms). In the absence of perfect and up-to-date network data, knowledge of the characteristics of individual enterprises that render them more likely to be atypical (e.g. size, type, and geographic location) would be of value, since this information could be used to inform a risk based approach to disease surveillance and control. A scenario tree model was developed as an approach for evaluating the effectiveness of New Zealand&#8217;s passive surveillance system for HPAI. The model was developed in two stages. In the first, factors thought to influence the geographic distribution of NAI risk of introduction and spread (and therefore surveillance strategy) were combined to create a spatial risk surface. In the second stage, a scenario tree model of the passive surveillance system for NAI was developed using the spatial risk surface and the HPAI surveillance strategy prescribed by Biosecurity New Zealand. The model was most sensitive to farmers reporting the presence of suspected cases of disease. This implies that the sensitivity of the system as a whole stands to increase if the importance of reporting suspicious clinical signs is reiterated to poultry producers. The studies presented in this thesis have presented a range of techniques and methodological approaches that are sufficiently generic to be used in any country to inform the design of surveillance strategies for a variety of animal diseases, not just those of poultry. Although epidemiology, as a discipline, is endoured with a vast range of analytical techniques that can be used to enhance the understanding of factors influencing the spread of disease among animal populations, the quality of data used to support these techniques is often lacking. The challenge in the years ahead, for both developed and developing countries, is to set in place the appropriate infrastructures to collect details of animal populations consistent in quality over time and space.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bird flu</field><field name="subject">HPAI H5N1</field><field name="subject">infectious diseases</field><field name="subject">poultry industry</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300500 Veterinary Medicine::300503 Epidemiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/813</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Choice of acquisition form, domestic liquidity costs for US cross-listed firms, and convergence in information environment : an investor protection perspective : a dissertation submitted in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Finance, Department of Commerce, Massey University</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Nhut Hoang</field><field name="description">This dissertation contains three empirical studies that examine the effect of investor protection on three different aspects of corporate governance: mergers and acquisitions, US cross-listings, and convergence of information environment around the world.1 The first study investigates the relation between investor protection and the choice of acquisition form (partial versus full acquisition). I argue that if private benefits are a motivation for mergers and acquisitions, an acquirer is more likely to bid for a controlling fraction (but not a hundred percent) of a target firm in countries with weak investor protection because in these countries private benefits of control are an important asset. The empirical results support this argument: compared to full mergers, partial acquisitions are the preferred form of acquisition when target countries do not effectively protect minority investors. Partial acquisitions are also more common among foreign acquirers from countries with poor legal systems. Finally, I show that firm-level corporate governance of the target firm is negatively related to the likelihood of partial acquisition. The second study examines the effect of investor protection on domestic liquidity for cross-listed firms. If US cross-listing can improve a firm&#8217;s information environment because of more stringent disclosure requirements in the US, I expect the information improvement to be reflected in a reduction in domestic liquidity costs. The empirical results are consistent with this prediction: local bid-ask spreads and price impact (a proxy for the cost of adverse information) significantly decrease while local trading volume significantly increases one year after US cross-listing. In addition, the liquidity improvement is larger for cross-listed firms that are from poor investor protection countries, and that are listed on the NYSE. The results in the second study are consistent with the &#8220;bonding&#8221; argument by Coffee (2002). The third study tests Coffee&#8217;s (1999) prediction of a convergence in corporate governance around the world. Since information environment is a key factor of corporate governance, it is important to see if there is a convergence in information environment across countries over the past two decades. Using various common proxies for information environment, I show that the quality of information environment generally improves through time, but the improvement is larger for developed markets and countries with better institutional quality. In the third study, I also reproduce the main results in Bailey, Karolyi and Salva (2006), and Fernandes and Ferreira (2008). These studies report similar divergence in information environment for cross-listed firms post-US-listing, but fail to control for the quality of information environment in the domestic market. After we control for this market effect, we do not find support for their results: there is no improvement in information environment for cross-listed firms, and no difference in the change between developed and emerging countries.  1 The second and third empirical studies are co-authored work with my supervisor, Professor Henk Berkman.

Lonely extramural students need extra support for interactions and collaboration in learning, especially in second language learning that requires intensive oral language practice between the students and the tutor. This research project was a trial to extend IMMEDIATE (the prototype of the Learning Computer) to a second language extramural course. To meet the requirements of long distance conversation in such a course, a synchronous/asynchronous bimodal approach was conceptualised based on a review of e-learning, communication, and VoIP technologies. It was proposed that the prototype should automatically adapt to either synchronous mode or asynchronous mode according to different levels of Internet connection speed. An asynchronous conversation mode similar to Push-to-Talk (PTT) was also proposed. A VoIP SDK was investigated and used in the prototype for fast development. IMMEDIATE messaging protocols have been extended in the prototype to control call procedures and the asynchronous conversation mode. An evaluation of the prototype which was conducted to assess its usability, functionality and integrity of the prototype demonstrated that users can conduct telephone-like synchronous conversation efficiently at high connection speed. Although the PTT-like asynchronous mode has a time lag problem, especially when two users are both at low connection speed, it is a still a good way for novices to practise second language oral skills. The evaluation has given strongly support to the feasibility and effectiveness of the bimodal approach for applying IMMEDIATE in second language extramural learning.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">distance education</field><field name="subject">second language learning</field><field name="subject">peer to peer architecture</field><field name="subject">e-learning</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280300 Computer Software</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/865</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The usage of traditional Maori narratives as cognitive models and educational tools : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Social Anthropology at Massey University, Albany Campus, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Benavides, Sebastian Pelayo</field><field name="description">The present research consists of an interdisciplinary approach which combines mainly sub-disciplines from the anthropological and psychological perspectives as theoretical background. Regarding the latter, from the cognitive anthropology perspective the research highlights Bradd Shore&#8217;s (1996) view on cognitive models, together with the theories put forward by the sociocultural approach in psychology based on Vygotsky&#8217;s school of thought. The main objective of the study is to achieve a broad view on the use of traditional korero paki and korero o nehera (Maori folktales/legends and myths) as pedagogical tools and as cognitive models. The latter includes a bibliographical review which covers the analysis of narratives and their usage from different areas, such as Maori epistemology and education, cultural psychology and cognitive anthropology.

Therefore, the research analyses &#8211;based on semi-structured interviews- the perspectives and understanding of the usage of traditional Maori narratives as educational tools of scholars in the Maori studies/education field and of a sample of Maori teachers, most of them connected to a Kura Kaupapa Maori school, constituting a &#8220;study case&#8221; for this qualitative study.

Therefore, the nature of the news provided has important implications for the opportunities audiences have to become informed about events and issues, and to use this knowledge to participate in social decision-making. The structure and content of news bulletins reflect the decisions made by broadcasters about the topics that are considered to be important, and which sources should have the opportunity to be represented. Thus, the goal of this research was to compare the structure and content of the news provided by New Zealand&#8217;s national free-to-air news programmes; ONE News (TVNZ), 3 News (TV3), Prime News (Prime Television), and Te K ea (M ori Television). A content analysis of one constructed week of the four news programmes was undertaken, focusing on four general areas of interest. First, the profile of the news bulletins was examined (i.e., the proportion of the bulletin allocated to different segments of the news, the duration of main news stories, the origin of production of main news stories, the proportion of New Zealand and international news, and the topics included in the news). Second, the research investigated the identity of the types of sources selected by the broadcasters for inclusion in locally produced main news stories. Third, the frequency and duration of &#233;lite and non-&#233;lite source speech was examined. Finally, the extent to which journalists speak on camera in news stories was also investigated. The study showed that the four programmes generally conformed to the &#8216;standard profile&#8217; of modern television news bulletins; the programmes included considerable amounts of non-news content and the news topics often reflected entertainment values, rather than focusing on serious issues. A further significant characteristic of the bulletins was that &#233;lite sources were more likely to be included in news stories on all programmes and generally had greater opportunities to speak. However, in many respects it appears that Te K ea provides an alternative news bulletin compared to the other three channels, by focusing on a wider range of news topics, including more non-&#233;lite sources in stories, and giving all sources considerably more time to share their views. Te K ea seems to broadcast a news programme that makes a compromise between the entertainment values which are entrenched in contemporary television news, and the broader M ori Television mandate to inform and educate the public. This contrasts with the more homogenous (in terms of the characteristics examined in this research) news programmes offered by the ONE News, 3 News, and Prime News. This study concludes that the nationally available free-to-air news programmes currently broadcast on New Zealand television fulfil the traditional news functions of informing and educating the public in only a very narrow sense. The deregulated news environment is poised to undergo further transformation with an anticipated increase in convergence among news media and the emergence of more television news providers. The challenge within this commercial environment is for ONE News, 3 News, Prime News, and Te K ea to deliver on their stated commitments to provide information and promote debate on the important issues of the day.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">news bulletins</field><field name="subject">journalism</field><field name="subject">public broadcasting</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/922</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing praxis for a few non-English speaking background students in the class : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Education at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Haworth, Penelope</field><field name="description">This thesis explores how teachers develop working theories and practices for small numbers of non-English speaking background (NESB) students in mainstream classes. The investigation included eight class teachers and four different school settings. A pilot phase was conducted in one school at the end of 2000. The major phase of the study was carried out in 2002. In each of the four terms that year, a different school became the context for the study and the focus was placed on a year 1-2 class teacher and a year 5-6 class teacher in that school. The study employed a qualitative ethnographic approach. Information was collected about each class teacher's experience, knowledge, confidence, teaching strategies, the degree of stress experienced when teaching NESB students in various class groupings, and the way in which individual and class needs were balanced. An initial intensive interview with each class teacher was followed by in-class observations. These observations were interspersed by two reflective discussions which took place in the middle and at the end of the school term. Discussions took a reflective problem-solving approach that made use of a write-down, think-aloud technique, and focused on critical learning and teaching episodes from the class. In addition, a reflective journal was kept, and semi-structured interviews were carried out with teachers responsible for the English for Speakers of Other Languages programme in the school. The results of the inquiry led to the development of a theoretical model which illustrated how the evolution of teachers' praxis was influenced by dynamic interactions within and across three contextual layers: the educational community, the classroom, and the reflective practitioner. Each teacher's professional knowledge was informed by a unique background of experience and the nature of the collaboration that occurred with  colleagues and parents. In turn, these factors impacted on the formation of pedagogic beliefs, perceived efficacy, and the evolution, selection and implementation of particular teaching roles and strategies. The study culminated with a number of recommendations being made for the enhancement of professional development initiatives, as well as for school and educational policies. In particular, these recommendations highlight the need for taking a broad ecological approach to addressing the professional needs of class teachers working with small numbers of NESB students.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Linguistic minorities</field><field name="subject">Literacy</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330104 Educational policy, administration and management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/993</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Kia taupunga te ng&#257;kau M&#257;ori : anchoring M&#257;ori health workforce potential : a thesis presented for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, M&#257;ori Studies, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Gillies, Annemarie</field><field name="description">In New Zealand M&#257;ori are under-represented in the workforce across multiple sectors. This thesis explores this incongruity with regard to M&#257;ori health. A M&#257;ori perspective and philosophical foundation formed the basis of the methodological approach, utilising a case study research design to inform the study. This provided the opportunity to explore M&#257;ori health workforce development initiatives and their potential to contribute to improvements and gains in M&#257;ori health. It was important that this work take into account social and economic factors and their impact on health, as well as the varying political climates of market oriented reform and a fiscal policy focus, because it has not only challenged M&#257;ori health development but also provided opportunities for increased M&#257;ori involvement and participation in health and New Zealand society. Therefore the thesis, while focused on health takes cognisance of and, coincides with the capacity and capability building efforts that have been a feature of overall M&#257;ori development, progress and advancement. In the context of this thesis M&#257;ori health workers are seen as leaders within their wh&#257;nau, hap&#363;, iwi, and M&#257;ori communities. Consequently a potential workforce that is strong and powerful can lead to anticipated gains in M&#257;ori health alongside other M&#257;ori movements for advancement. The potential cannot be under-estimated. This thesis argues that there are critical success factors, specific determinants, influencing M&#257;ori health workforce potential, and that these success factors have wider application. Therefore, as this thesis suggests M&#257;ori workforce development, especially in relationship to the health workforce, is dependent on effective M&#257;ori leadership, the application of M&#257;ori values to workplace practices, levels of resourcing that are compatible with training and development, critical mass, and targeted policies and programmes.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Medical personnel</field><field name="subject">Allied health personnel</field><field name="subject">Tikanga</field><field name="subject">Hauora tinana</field><field name="subject">Tohu m&#257;tauranga</field><field name="subject">Kaimahi</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321207 Indigenous health</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/994</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Kaupapa hauora M&#257;ori : ng&#257; whakaaro whakahirahira o ng&#257; kaum&#257;tua : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in M&#257;ori Studies at Te Pumanawa Hauora Research Centre for M&#257;ori Health and Development, Massey University, Wellington, Aotearoa/New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Wenn, Janice</field><field name="description">There is a requirement for all services within the New Zealand health system to be accredited with an established quality organisation and to demonstrate an ability to provide a measurable quality service to consumers.  For M&#257;ori these requirements must make sense in M&#257;ori terms. This thesis is based on the view that, for M&#257;ori, the concept of health is more effectively expressed as hauora - optimal health and wellbeing for M&#257;ori. This thesis makes five contributions to M&#257;ori health and M&#257;ori health research.  First, it identifies a responsive approach to engaging kaum&#257;tua effectively in the process of qualitative research.  Second, it identifies a fundamental underlying conceptual framework &#8211; kaupapa hauora M&#257;ori as a means of understanding hauora &#8211; expressed in terms derived from kaum&#257;tua in Taranaki and Kahungunu. Third, it adapts this conceptual framework into an analytical research framework and then applies it to allow kaupapa hauora M&#257;ori (described in terms of worldview, values and ethics) to be identified from a range of data.  Fourth, it critically analyses popular models of M&#257;ori health &#8211; Te Whare Tapa Wh&#257;, Te Wheke and Ng&#257; Pou Mana.  Finally, it proposes and details post-doctoral research that will translate kaupapa hauora M&#257;ori into a quality services framework/tool. &#8220;Kaupapa Hauora M&#257;ori&#8221; is a conceptual framework articulated by kaum&#257;tua, and has its origins in te ao M&#257;ori, from which the aronga or worldview is developed.  The aronga is composed of the kaupapa or values and tikanga or ethics that provide kaum&#257;tua with the values base of hauora. These components have been identified by kaum&#257;tua and not only inform the concept of KHM but also inform the analytical research framework that is applied to the data. The values have been identified as a core set of values comprising whakapapa, wairua, whenua, wh&#257;nau, tikanga te reo M&#257;ori, tinana, and hinengaro, and the associated tikanga is expressed as behaviour or ethics. These, together, influence the perception and understanding individuals have of their world and of hauora.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Health and hygiene</field><field name="subject">Medical care</field><field name="subject">Hauora</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321207 Indigenous health</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/995</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of a low-cost robotic visual tracking system : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Engineering, Mechatronics at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Chiang, Shun Fan</field><field name="description">This thesis describes a system which is able to track and imitate human motion.

After the object is detected and tracked coordinates are saved to a pre-establish database in the purpose of further data processing, a mathematical algorithm is performed to the data in order to give a better robotic motion control.

Conventional cultivation of plants is of course subject to vagaries of weather, pests and availability of land; hence, the interest in highly controlled culture of plant cells and hairy roots in bioreactors as methods of producing various products. This project focussed on production of blue and red colors of Lavandula augustifolia and Beta vulgaris, respectively. Callus and suspension cell culture were successfully produced from L. augustifolia after extensive trials, but hairy roots could not be generated from this species. In contrast, a successful protocol was developed for consistently producing hairy roots from B. vulgaris, but calli could not be generated from this species. Effects of medium composition on growth of L. augustifolia calli and freely suspended cells and production of the blue pigment by the latter, were investigated. Optimal production of callus occurred in full-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 2 mg/l of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and 1 mg/l of kinetin. Stable suspension cultures could be produced and maintained in full-strength MS medium supplemented with 1 mg/l each of IAA and kinetin. In suspension culture in full-strength MS medium, the following hormone combinations were tested: (1) 1 mg/l each of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and kinetin; (2) 2 mg/l of IAA and 1 mg/l of kinetin; (3) 2 mg/l of IAA and 1 mg/l of benzyl amino purine (BAP); and (4) 2 mg/l each of IAA and BAP. Combination (3) maximized cell growth, but the highest cell-specific production of the blue pigment was seen in combination (2), although pigment production occurred at all hormone combinations. The medium formulation that gave the best production of the pigment in shake flasks was scaled up to a 2 L aerated stirred tank bioreactor, but both the biomass and pigment productivities were reduced in the bioreactor apparently due to the high shear stress generated by the Rushton turbine impeller. Compared to suspension cultures of L. augustifolia, the hairy root cultures of B. vulgaris grew extremely rapidly. Hairy roots also produced large amounts of the red pigments. Growth of hairy roots was influenced by the composition of the medium. Although the full strength MS medium better promoted biomass growth compared to the half-strength MS medium, the final concentration of the biomass and the pigment were nearly the same in both media. Attempts were made to enhance production by using various hormones (i.e. naphthalene acetic acid, BAP, IAA added individually at a concentration of 0.5 mg/l), but none of the hormones proved useful. BAP adversely affected the growth of hairy roots. In summary, production of pigments by suspension culture of L. augustifolia and hairy root culture of B. vulgaris, is technically possible, but requires substantial further optimization for enhancing productivity than has been possible in this project. iii</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pigment production</field><field name="subject">biomass growth</field><field name="subject">lavender</field><field name="subject">beetroot</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290101 Fermentation, biotechnology and industrial microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/997</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Person-job fit and its relationship with work attitudes: a study of Christian missionaries from Australasia : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Psychology at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Manson, Jennifer Margaret</field><field name="description">Do Christian missionaries who exhibit good person-job fit, (&#8216;aligned&#8217; with host nation colleagues and &#8216;in harmony&#8217; with expatriate colleagues), experience more positive work attitudes? Personjob fit was conceptualized in terms of competencies. Perspectives on what competencies the role of missionary requires were obtained from 3 groups of subject matter experts: host nation colleagues, missionaries, and mission agency leaders. In Study I, subject matter experts (host nation colleagues, n=22, missionaries, n=25, and agency leaders, n=23) rated the &#8216;Universal Competency Framework&#8217; (SHL) 20-level competencies. Host nation colleagues differed significantly on 3 of the competencies, suggesting that in this sample, the perspective of expatriates on the role of a missionary was not fully aligned with that of host nation colleagues. In Study 2, a sample of 130 current overseas missionaries self-assessed their performance and provided their own ratings of the importance of the competencies used in Study 1. Measures of Person-Job fit (Demands-Abilities fit, Supplies-Values fit and Perceived Performance) were regressed against outcome variables (job satisfaction, work engagement and satisfaction with life). Results indicated that a person&#8217;s fit with the job as described by both host nation colleagues (Alignment) and other expatriates (Harmonization) is positively associated with job satisfaction, work engagement and satisfaction with life. These results offer support for competencies as an effective method of describing missionary roles. Possible implications for enhancing the effectiveness and well-being of missionaries, and other aid and development workers, are discussed.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">competency</field><field name="subject">expatriates</field><field name="subject">job satisfaction</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380104 Personality, abilities and assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/998</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Anthelmintic treatment and digestive organ morphology of captive-reared kaki (Himantopus novaezelandiae) released to the wild : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Conservation Biology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Robertson, Louise Mary</field><field name="description">The continued existence of New Zealand&#8217;s critically endangered and endemic black stilt or kak&#239; (Himantopus novaezelandiae) relies on an intensive captive management programme. While this is successful at rearing large numbers of birds for release to the wild, poor survivability of these birds is limiting significant increases in the wild population. Predation and starvation are suspected to be the most common causes of death in released birds, but underlying contributing factors to these mortalities have not been fully evaluated. This research investigates the possible contribution of gastrointestinal (GI) helminth burdens and suboptimal digestive organ development to the high mortality rates of released kak&#239;. Emphasis is placed on evaluating the methods used to assess the importance of these factors and to make informed recommendations for future management. The efficacy of the anthelmintic regime used for kak&#239; was assessed by dosing half of the 80 captive birds with praziquantel (PZQ) prior to release in 2007. Faecal samples were collected before and after anthelmintic treatment, and before and after release to the wild. Post mortem worm counts were conducted on 11 birds that died following release and historical worm count records dating back to 1997 were accessed. The main findings were: PZQ had high efficacy against trematodes; treatment did not prevent re-infection; birds were exposed to helminths at release site; and there was no advantage of treatment for survival. Overall, the results suggest that anthelmintic treatment is an unnecessary cost. Consequently, recommendations were made to cease anthelmintic treatment or reduce its intensity, continue health screening, and incorporate annual efficacy testing to monitor the emergence of anthelmintic resistance. The reliability of faecal screening for GI helminths was evaluated. Faecal egg counts (FECs) were found to be poor indicators of worm burden. The two modified sedimentation methods used to detect trematodes provided relatively low egg recovery rates. Trematode egg shedding varied between days but not by hour of the day or temperature. The collection and analysis of pooled faecal samples proved to be more cost and time-effective than samples from individual birds and the larger masses collected resulted in greater sensitivity. In conclusion, faecal analysis of pooled samples is a useful qualitative indicator of helminth presence or absence but is quantitatively unreliable. In order to assess the importance of digestive organ development to captive-reared and released kak?, the digestive organs of healthy and emaciated captive, released and wild Himantopus sp. were compared. Captive and released kak? had generally smaller digestive organs than wild birds, released birds did not increase digestive organ size to match the high fibre wild diet, and emaciated birds did not have atrophied organs. However, the greatest mortality rates occur soon after release, while the birds were still being supplementary fed. These results suggest that reduced digestive efficiency is probably not contributing significantly to mortality rates and the direct impacts of the translocation are probably greater risk factors. The continued provision of supplementary food to released birds and an increased focus on habitat enhancement and predator control at release sites were recommended. The reliability of comparing fresh and formalin fixed Himantopus sp. gut specimens was evaluated. Significant differences in fresh and formalin fixed organ dry masses and variation in preserved organ lengths indicate that this variation should be considered in future studies. In conclusion, current management practices appear to be successful in ensuring that GI helminths and reduced digestive efficiency do not significantly lower the survivorship of captive-reared and released kak&#239;. There is a need for further research into developing a more direct physiological assessment of the impacts of GI helminths and gut morphology as well as considering the role that starvation may have on poor survivability.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">black stilt</field><field name="subject">captive management</field><field name="subject">endangered species</field><field name="subject">gastrointestinal helminth</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science::300805 Conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1001</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Organicism, motivic parallelism, and performance in Beethoven's piano sonata Op. 2 No. 3 : a thesis submitted to the New Zealand School of Music in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master  of Music in Musicology</field><field name="creator">Robb, Hamish James Alexander</field><field name="description">This thesis summarises the important ideologies and concepts of musical organicism in the late eighteenth century and applies them to motivic analysis and performance. Much has been written about the organic nature of Beethoven&#8217;s later works, but less has been written about the organic coherence found in his earlier compositions. This study involves a motivic analysis of his Op. 2 No. 3 sonata (1795), for which little or no significant research has been carried out. This musical work is used as an illustration of ways in which musical organicism, motivic analysis, and performance can interrelate. The thesis is in three parts. Part one presents a review of late eighteenth-century ideologies of unity and their musical applications. In the search for an effective means of comparing motivic development with organicism, it is then argued that Schenker&#8217;s &#8216;motivic parallelism&#8217; or &#8216;concealed repetition&#8217; is considerably undervalued in his analytical framework. Drawing on the insights of Richard Cohn, I endorse a more autonomous treatment of the motivic parallelism in analysis, so that it is an independent unifying tool in its own right and not only a by-product of tonal analysis. Several approaches are applied to the motivic parallelism in order to illustrate how the parallelism can be used in ways normally only associated with the surface motif. Part two of the thesis consists of a detailed motivic analysis of Beethoven&#8217;s Op. 2 No. 3 sonata. It is argued that the motivic parallelisms contained in this sonata reflect late eighteenth-century ideals of organicism. I propose that there are several motivic cells found in the opening four bars of the sonata, which recur (or are &#8216;paralleled&#8217;) within all structural levels and over all four movements, unifying the sonata organically as one whole. In this way, I show that the Op. 2 No. 3 sonata can be seen to foreshadow the organic treatment of motifs by later composers, who were influenced by Goethe&#8217;s complex prototype (1802) as an organic model.(1) I also offer an &#8216;organic narrative&#8217; for the sonata, using motivic parallelisms as the guiding forces in the discourse. The third and final part relates the motivic parallelisms and other analytical findings to performance. Techniques of &#8216;performing&#8217; motivic parallelisms are discussed and applied to the Op. 2 No. 3 sonata. The organic perspective is proposed as one avenue through which to understand and enhance a performance of a work.  (1) The sonata can also be seen to foreshadow the highly seminal treatment of motifs that was to become more widely used in Beethoven&#8217;s later works (such as the Eroica Symphony).</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">motivic analysis</field><field name="subject">organic narrative</field><field name="subject">eighteenth-century music</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410100 Performing Arts Studies::410101 Music studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1000</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improving understanding of music therapy with a non-verbal child: sharing perceptions with other professionals : a research presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the Master of Music Therapy at New Zealand School of Music, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Park, Yaeun Kyung</field><field name="description">This study explored the value of music therapy practice with a non-verbal child conducted by the author, a Music Therapy Student (MTS), as seen through the eyes of two music therapists and the child&#8217;s mother, as well as the improvement achieved in the MTS&#8217;s understanding of music therapy practice through sharing the three professionals&#8217; insights. The paper addresses two research questions: (1) How is music therapy with a non-verbal child perceived by music therapy professionals? (2) How does sharing these professionals&#8217; understanding of music therapy improve the MTS&#8217;s understanding of this therapeutic process? The MTS&#8217;s self-reflections were treated as part of the data in this research, as was the non-verbal communication within the music therapy intervention to support the findings. The qualitative research, &#8216;Naturalistic inquiry&#8217; was used for this research. Data was collected by interviewing these three professionals individually about their perceptions of music therapy after watching three video extracts of normal music therapy sessions with the child. The video extracts were selected from the significant moments of non-verbal communication. Through this process of sharing the professionals&#8217; perceptions, the MTS gained a deeper understanding of both the child and the music therapy practice administered, confirming and extending her understanding of the musical and therapeutic skills and techniques of the three professionals, which they had gained in their varied experiences and which had been shaped by their varied backgrounds. The MTS was thus engaged in a learning process which hoped would enhance the quality of therapy provided by her in the future.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">music therapy professionals</field><field name="subject">perceptions</field><field name="subject">music therapy practice</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410100 Performing Arts Studies::410101 Music studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/999</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Compliance and impact of corporate governance best practice code on the financial performance of New Zealand listed companies : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Business and Admnistration at Massey University, Auckland campus, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Teh, Chor Tik</field><field name="description">The corporate governance best practice code (Code) of the New Zealand Exchange (NZX) came into effect on October 29, 2003. However, so far there is no systematic study of compliance with and impact of NZX Code on the performance of NZX companies. This study attempts to provide some answers to the perceived knowledge gap. The NZX Code recommends certain governance mechanisms to enhance corporate performance. The mechanisms analysed in this study are the percentage of independent directors, duality, presence of board subcommittees (audit, remuneration, and nomination), and the performance evaluation of board and individual directors. This thesis examines the possible relationship between recommended governance structures and the performance of NZX companies for the years 2003 (pre-Code) and 2007 (post Code), using data from the same 89 companies for each year. Although the number of companies adopting the NZX structures has increased, the rate of full compliance of the Code remains disappointingly low, rising from 5.6% in 2003 to just 22.5% in 2007. Probably due to the small sample size relative to the number of independent variables, and the problem of co-linearity, the multiple linear regression results do not seem to be conclusive and may be unreliable as the basis to form any formal statistical inference. However, treating the 89 companies as the whole population (89 out of 90), and using a simpler and more descriptive statistical tool to analyse the impact of individual independent variables on firm performance, the 2007 results show a consistent pattern of a positive relationship between Code compliance and firm performance, assuming all other factors being constant. This positive relationship is further reinforced by dividing the population into the various industry groupings as classified by the NZX, which also results in a consistent pattern of companies which comply fully with the Code structures financially outperforming companies that only partially comply with the Code during 2007. Surprisingly, listed companies adhering to the Chairman/CEO dual role do not seem to have impacted negatively on firm performance, contrary to agency theory expectation.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">NZX Code</field><field name="subject">New Zealand stock exchange</field><field name="subject">performance evaluation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350300 Banking, Finance and Investment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1004</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating musculoskeletal disorders in New Zealand meat processing using an industry-level participative ergonomics approach : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Organisational Studies and Ergonomics at Massey University, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Tappin, David Charles</field><field name="description">In New Zealand, the highest incidence of musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) is found in meat processing, accounting for over half the injury compensation costs for the sector. This thesis reports on a two-year study of MSD in the New Zealand meat processing industry, with the aims of identifying MSD risk factors and interventions using an industry-level participative ergonomics approach. A review of the literature on occupational musculoskeletal disorders and participatory ergonomics identified gaps in knowledge, notably contextual factors for MSD and a limited scope for participatory ergonomics. The studies described in this thesis contribute to addressing these knowledge gaps. The first stage of the study established a profile of MSD injury data in the industry. Data were collected from four injury data sources for meat processing. A number of priority tasks were identified for beef and sheep processing, based on triangulation of these data, and findings were approved by the industry stakeholders, the Meat Industry Health and Safety Forum (MIHSF). The second stage of the study was the assessment of these tasks in a representative sample of processing plants, with the purpose of identifying risk factors that contribute to the occurrence of MSD, implementation barriers and MSD interventions. The study involved interviews with 237 workers, management, union and safety personnel in 28 meat processing sites. MSD risk factor data were separated into those concerning the high MSD-risk tasks (task-specific), and the wider work system (task-independent). From these data a list of contextual factors was developed which it is proposed may create conditions under which greater exposure to physical and psychosocial factors can occur in meat processing. Some 276 interventions were also identified. The third and final stage of the study involved working with the MIHSF in developing the interventions for use by the industry in reducing MSD risk. MSD intervention ideas were collated, summarised and prioritised. A document containing interventions, implementation barriers and risk factors was developed with the MIHSF and distributed to all levels of the industry. The thesis reflects on the effectiveness of an industry-level participative ergonomics approach to the achievement of the study aims, notably the identification of contextual risk factors and interventions for MSD.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">MSD risk factors</field><field name="subject">meat processing workers</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::359900 Other Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1003</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Accelerating classifier training using AdaBoost within cascades of boosted ensembles : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Computer Sciences at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Susnjak, Teo</field><field name="description">This thesis seeks to address current problems encountered when training classifiers within the framework of cascades of boosted ensembles (CoBE). At present, a signifi- cant challenge facing this framework are inordinate classifier training runtimes. In some cases, it can take days or weeks (Viola and Jones, 2004; Verschae et al., 2008) to train a classifier. The protracted training runtimes are an obstacle to the wider use of this framework (Brubaker et al., 2006). They also hinder the process of producing effective object detection applications and make the testing of new theories and algorithms, as well as verifications of others research, a considerable challenge (McCane and Novins, 2003). An additional shortcoming of the CoBE framework is its limited ability to train clas- sifiers incrementally. Presently, the most reliable method of integrating new dataset in- formation into an existing classifier, is to re-train a classifier from beginning using the combined new and old datasets. This process is inefficient. It lacks scalability and dis- cards valuable information learned in previous training. To deal with these challenges, this thesis extends on the research by Barczak et al. (2008), and presents alternative CoBE frameworks for training classifiers. The alterna- tive frameworks reduce training runtimes by an order of magnitude over common CoBE frameworks and introduce additional tractability to the process. They achieve this, while preserving the generalization ability of their classifiers. This research also introduces a new framework for incrementally training CoBE clas- sifiers and shows how this can be done without re-training classifiers from beginning. However, the incremental framework for CoBEs has some limitations.

To do it in a Maori-appropriate way that supports Maori research approach 3. To provide something new and useful for Maori and other stakeholders involved in such issues A Kaupapa Maori mixed-methodology was used to guide research decisions and actions, including the development of a &#8216;Haurapa&#8217; approach based on the journey of a &#8216;typical Maori researcher&#8217;. Through literature review, case studies and semi-structured interviews, a pool of knowledge was identified and used to draw out a set of themes and indicators which complement others in related fields. New knowledge was validated against related findings. Use of the findings is demonstrated, along with ideas for future application and testing. A conceptual &#8216;Pa model&#8217; is proposed as a useful way to approach the subject for engagement with Maori and improved understanding of the overall context. Existing frameworks are adapted to work for this topic, including a useful tool for filtering potential indicators. In conducting this study, the following hunches or hypotheses were considered: ? That Maori are not adequately prepared or included regarding modern hazards and disaster response ? A lack of Maori involvement results in inequalities ? Valuable gains can be made with a Maori-centred approach and proper treatment of Maori issues The conclusion supports the statements and recommends further work in the area.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">disaster recovery</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::379900 Other Studies In Human Society::379902 Indigenous studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mixing memory and desire: recollecting the self in Harry Potter and His Dark Materials : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in English at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Waugh, Kirsty</field><field name="description">Just as memory pervades our everyday lives, it pervades the lives of the characters and readers of J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series and Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials trilogy. Acts of recall or recollection occur in almost every chapter as the characters in these novels devote much of the present to keeping in touch with some aspect of the past. Memory is integral to Harry Potter and His Dark Materials, highlighting the following problematic questions: Who are we and how do we relate to the past? How is what we wish for the future grounded in the past and the present? Memory is at the core of constructivism, the active construction of reality by the individual through the use of mental activity. In this thesis I maintain that the central protagonists in Harry Potter and His Dark Materials, Harry Potter and Lyra Belacqua, actively construct their "selves" from memories and narratives &#8211; their own and those of others &#8211; just as the novels' readers negotiate their own identities in the world outside of the novels. The constant recalling of the past to confirm and amply one's present creates a complex web of remembering and forgetting, assimilating and discarding, which we attempt to explicate through the use of culturally appropriate metaphors. The thesis comprises three chapters that correlate memory with genre, narrative, and technology respectively. I commence the thesis by exploring the idea of genre as collective memory. I position Harry Potter and His Dark Materials within the genre of heroic fantasy and examine how the monomyth provides readers with the memory triggers they require to decode the structure of these texts. The novels conform to and yet manipulate the preconceived patterns present in the heroic or "high" fantasy genre, where narrative, memory and identity are all linked by the desires of the stories' participants. Chapter Two applies Freud's concept of Nachtraglichkeit, which supposes the process of memory is one of incessant reconsideration or "retranslation", the reworking of memory traces in the light of later knowledge and experience. This conceptualisation of memory is compared to the common, but less productive, tendency to describe memory through objectifying metaphors, such as the idea that memory works analogously to a photograph. Chapter Three addresses how knowledge and experience in Harry Potter and His Dark Materials are furnished by prosthetic memory devices, such as photographs, the Pensieve, the alethiometer and the Amber Spyglass, &#8220;that permit us to transcend "raw" biological limits &#8211; for example, the limits on memory capacity or limits on our auditory range&#8221; (Bruner, Acts of Meaning 34). The novel's protagonists are then armed with these devices in trying to make sense of the landscapes they inhabit. Ultimately, we are all story-tellers (for better or for worse), weaving our self-narratives from material gleaned from the collective memories and prosthetic memory devices of the society we belong to, our own experiences, and the tales of others, trying to achieve the uniformity of consciousness and an awareness of the connection between the actions and events of the past, and the experience of the present, which are fundamental to a sense of individual identity.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">collective memory</field><field name="subject">heroic fantasy</field><field name="subject">memory and identity</field><field name="subject">Philip Pullman</field><field name="subject">J.

The applications of planar electromagnetic sensors will depend on both the characteristic of the sensor type chosen and also the characteristic of material under test. Conventional planar interdigital sensors and novel planar interdigital sensors have been designed, fabricated and tested for detection of dangerous marine biotoxins in seafood. Our main objective is to sense the presence of dangerous contaminated acid in mussels and other seafoods. Initial studies were conducted with three peptide derivatives namely Sarcosine, Proline and Hydroxylproline. These three chemicals are structurally closely related to our target molecule (domoic acid). The initial results have shown that all sensors respond very well to the chemicals and it is possible to discriminate the different chemicals from the output of the sensor. Novel interdigital sensors have shown better sensitivity measurement compared to conventional interdigital sensors. The novel interdigital sensors were then being tested with three seafood products. Results from the analysis have shown that novel interdigital sensor with configuration #1 (Sensor_1) has better sensitivity compared to other sensors. Sensor_1 has been chosen for experiment using proline and mussels. The changes in sensor sensitivity were analysed with mussels before and after adding the proline. The presence of proline on the mussel surface and also injected proline to the mussel samples were clearly detected by Sensor_1. Further experiment was conducted with small amount of domoic acid (0.5 &#181;g to 5.0 &#181;g) injected to a mussel and it was found that Sensor_1 was able to detect small amount of domoic acid (1.0 &#181;g) injected into the mussel sample. Sensor_1 was able to detect approximately 12.6 &#181;g/g of domoic acid in mussel meat. Three threshold levels of particular sample thickness have been established for detection of domoic acid. The first prototype of a low cost sensing system known as SIT (Seafood Inspection Tool) has been developed. The outcomes from the experiments provide chances of opportunity for further research in developing a low cost miniature type of sensors for reliable sensing system for commercial use.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">planar electromagnetic sensors</field><field name="subject">interdigital sensors</field><field name="subject">seafood toxins</field><field name="subject">peptide derivatives</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::299900 Other Engineering and Technology::299903 Biosensor technolgies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1007</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of Malay entrepreneurship in Malaysia : a thesis presented in fulfilment of the requirement for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Business at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Hamidon, Syahira</field><field name="description">Since the institution of the New Economic Policy (NEP) in 1971 and beyond its end in 1990, the Malaysian government has had mixed successes in developing Malay entrepreneurship. Despite on-going of privileges and assistance and the government&#8217;s concerted efforts and initiatives, Malay entrepreneurship still continues to lag behind that of the Chinese. This study centres on the challenges faced by the Government of Malaysia in the promotion of Malay entrepreneurial development. Based on interviews with diverse people, both within and outside the government, the study reveals that Malay entrepreneurial development is a complex process confronted by many issues and problems. The study also reveals that government privileges and assistance to Malays to promote entrepreneurship do not help much in boosting an entrepreneurial culture nor do they help them in enhancing entrepreneurial competitiveness and achievement. Instead, such privileges and assistance have conversely made the Chinese more resilient and competitive entrepreneurially but discriminative against the Malays. This conclusion confirms the proposition that &#8220;state assistance in the form of an affirmative action to an economically-challenged sector of society does little to create entrepreneurship; rather it challenges rival economic groups to sharpen their own competitiveness&#8221;. Finally, the study is able to indicate that Malay entrepreneurship differs slightly from the conventional Western concepts of entrepreneurship. The differences are largely due to the historical background of the Malays as a communitarian society; as Muslims; as a society still divided along class lines and as a status conscious community.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Economic Policy</field><field name="subject">entrepreneurial development</field><field name="subject">business competitiveness</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1009</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electroencephalographic responses of calves to the noxious sensory input of slaughter by ventral neck incision and its modulation with non-penetrative captive bolt stunning : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements of the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Physiology, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Gibson, Troy John</field><field name="description">Slaughter by ventral neck incision (VNI) is performed on some animals without prior stunning in New Zealand and other countries. A single incision with a razor sharp blade is made in the ventral aspect of the neck, sectioning both carotid arteries and jugular veins, though, not the vertebral arteries. There are a number of potential welfare concerns surrounding slaughter by VNI including pain due to the incision, which may lead to distress during the time before loss of consciousness. The aims of this thesis were to identify cortical responses indicative of noxious stimulation due to slaughter by VNI using analysis of the electroencephalogram (EEG) power spectrum and to investigate the effects of non-penetrative captive bolt (NPCB) stunning on these cortical responses. The studies utilised adaptations of a minimal anaesthesia model, which has been validated in a range of mammalian species. Surgical dehorning was used as a validation technique for this methodology in cattle and demonstrated a &#8216;typical&#8217; EEG response to noxious stimulation. Cattle slaughtered by VNI without prior stunning produced specific responses in the EEG that strongly indicated responses to noxious stimulation. Causation was investigated in cattle where blood flow through the brain remained intact during neck tissue incision (NTI) or the major blood vessels of the neck were isolated and transected independently of other neck tissues (BVT). The response to neck incision in intact animals was principally due to the noxious sensory input due to incision of neck tissues and not mainly as a result of loss of blood flow through the brain. NPCB stunning produced states of cortical activity that were incompatible with the maintenance of sensibility and pain perception. Experimental examination of the time to onset of undoubted insensibility was attempted in cattle subsequent to a pilot study in sheep. The generation of somatosensory-evoked potentials was problematic in cattle. The conclusions of this thesis are that incision of neck tissues during slaughter without prior stunning constitutes a substantial noxious stimulus. Were an animal conscious, this stimulus would be perceived as painful until the onset of hypoxiainduced insensibility. This would represent a significant compromise to animal welfare.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">animal stress</field><field name="subject">cattle slaughter</field><field name="subject">cortical response</field><field name="subject">pain perception</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300500 Veterinary Medicine::300505 Anatomy and physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1010</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Arguing for the spirit in the language of the mind: a Maori practitioner's view of research and science : a thesis submitted for the degree of Doctor of Philosphy at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Barnes, Helen Moewaka</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the ways that colonisation has resulted in Maori being cast as different and the other in Aotearoa/New Zealand. It challenges perceptions of relationships between Maori and western knowledge and between science and practice, drawing on a range of theorists, scholarly writings and multiple research and evaluation projects. The study examines how these perceptions, and the definitions arising from them, tend to compartmentalise Maori knowledge and research and, in doing so, serve non-Maori agendas more than they serve Maori aspirations. The thesis looks at the impacts that the world of the coloniser has had on our ways of knowing and ways of practising. Through illustrating initiatives that operate within Maori paradigms and collaborations between Maori and non-Maori, the development of equitable relationships is explored. Key findings are the need for a more inclusive understanding of knowledge and research practice in order to reframe the way we (coloniser and colonised) look at and express our understandings of the world and how these might be operationalised through research relationships. Part of the contribution of this thesis is to provide a framework for more equitable research relationships, focusing on non- Maori development. This is suggested as a counter to the constant examination and defining of Maori as different and in need of development.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori research</field><field name="subject">Maori knowledge</field><field name="subject">research relationships</field><field name="subject">research practice</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::379900 Other Studies In Human Society::379902 Indigenous studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1008</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biofilm formation of Enterobacter sakazakii on three different materials of infant feeding tube : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Technology in Food Microbiology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Md Zain, Siti Norbaizura Binti</field><field name="description">The aim of this study was to observe biofilm formation by Enterobacter sakazakii (E. Sakazakii) from different clinical, dairy and environmental origins on three infant feeding tubes made of different materials. Infant formula milk was selected as the medium for E. sakazakii growth. Seventeen isolates from different origins were retrieved and tested for purity, using a plating method and biochemical tests to eliminate the non E. sakazakii strains from this study. A method to rapidly and accurately detect viable cells of E. sakazakii on infant feeding tube surfaces using of the BacTrac&#174; 4000 microbiological growth analyser was developed. The sources of errors such as from cleaning, operation and handling procedures were assessed prior to experimental runs. The strength of biofilm formation by different isolates of E. sakazakii on plastic surfaces was scrutinised using a microtiter plate assay. The results from the microtitre plate assay were based on the absorbance at 550 nm of crystal violet stained films and showed that all the clinical isolates were able to attach and form strong biofilms on the plate. Some environmental isolates formed strong or weak biofilms and some did not produce biofilm at all. However, dairy isolates formed both strong and weak biofilms in the microtitre plate when incubated in 10% reconstituted infant formula milk. The further studies were to quantify biofilm formation by three isolates of different origin on three different materials of infant feeding tubes using a batch system. Tubing pieces were incubated with infant formula milk inoculated with E. sakazakii cells at approximately 8 log CFU mL-1 and the biofilm formation was assessed at three time intervals: 4, 12 and 24 hours. Biofilm formation on the tubing by clinical isolates was also observed using epifluorescence microscopy and the scanning electron microscope. E. sakazakii from clinical, dairy and environmental isolates were able to form biofilm on three different materials of infant feeding tubes. The results showed that the initial attachment at 4 h on silicone tubing was low compared with the other two tubes. The scanning electron micrographs showed the surface characteristics of each tubing and the biofilm formation by E. sakazakii clinical isolates after 4, 12 and 24 hours. Silicone tubing appeared to be the best choice for premature babies that need feeding using feeding tubes, as it was slow to become colonised compared with the PVC and polyurethane tubing.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">infant formula</field><field name="subject">premature babies</field><field name="subject">silicone tubing</field><field name="subject">PVC tubing</field><field name="subject">polyurethane tubing</field><field name="subject">biofilm</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290105 Other industrial biotechnology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1012</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Risk-based suveillance in animal health : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Prattley, Deborah Jayne</field><field name="description">Animal health surveillance is an important part of animal health care, particularly in countries dependent on livestock for food production and international trade. There are two major issues related to the provision of e&#174;ective surveillance activities. Firstly, for good information to become available, the design and conduct of data collection activ- ities should be carried out following sound statistical principles. In reality, constraints such as imperfect tests and unavoidably-biased sampling strategies hinder straightfor- ward analysis and interpretation of survey results. Risk-based surveillance is used to target high-risk sub-populations to increase e&#177;ciency of disease detection; however, biased datasets are generated. This thesis develops methodologies to design risk-based surveillance systems and al- low statistically valid analysis of the inherently biased data they generate. The &#175;rst example describes the development of a method to analyse surveillance data gathered for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). The data are collected from four dif- ferent surveillance streams of animals tested for BSE, with each stream containing unavoidable biases and limitations. In the BSurvE model, these data are combined with demographic information for each birth cohort to estimate the proportion of each birth cohort infected with BSE. The prevalence of BSE in a national herd can then be estimated using the method of moments, whereby the observed number of infected animals is equated with the expected number. The upper 95% con&#175;dence limit for the prevalence is estimated both for infected countries and for those where no BSE has previously been detected. A similar approach to that used in BSurvE is then applied to surveillance data for trichinellosis, for which risk-based post-mortem testing is also performed. Negative results from multiple species using di&#174;erent, imperfect tests are combined to give an estimate of the upper 95% con&#175;dence limit of the national prevalence of trichinellosis in a reference population. This method is used to provide support for freedom from trichinellosis in Great Britain. A di&#174;erent approach to risk-based surveillance is explored as the surveillance strategy for detection of exotic causes of abortion in sheep and goats in New Zealand is examined. Using a geographic information system (GIS) maps of disease risk factors were overlain to produce a risk landscape for the lower North Island. This was used to demonstrate how areas of high- and low-risk of disease occurrence can be identi&#175;ed and used to guide the design of a risk-based surveillance programme. Secondly, within one surveillance objective there may be many ways in which the available funds or human resources could be distributed. This thesis develops a method to assess BSE surveillance programmes, and provides tools to facilitate BSE detection on the basis of infection risk and to increase the e&#177;ciency of surveillance strategies. A novel approach to allocation of resources is developed, where portfolio theory con- cepts from &#175;nance are applied to animal health surveillance. The example of surveil- lance for exotic causes of sheep and goat abortion is expanded upon. Risk of disease occurrence is assessed for a population over di&#174;erent time periods and geographical areas within a country, and portfolio theory used to allocate the number of tests to be carried out within each of these boundaries. This method is shown to be more likely to detect disease in a population when compared to proportional allocation of the available resources. The studies presented here show new approaches that allow better utilisation of imperfect data and more e&#177;cient use of available resources. They allow development of surveillance programmes containing an appropriate balance of scanning and targeted surveillance activities. Application of these methods will enhance the implementation and value of surveillance in animal health.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">disease detection</field><field name="subject">BSE</field><field name="subject">trichinellosis</field><field name="subject">abortion</field><field name="subject">animal surveillance</field><field name="subject">animal health</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300400 Animal Production::300405 Animal production (pests and pathogens)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1011</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The physiological effects of pseudoephedrine on endurance cycling : a thesis submitted in the partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Sport and Exercise Science, Massey University (Palmerston North, New Zealand)</field><field name="creator">Mouatt, Joshua Roger</field><field name="description">Background: Pseudoephedrine (PSE) is a mild central nervous system stimulant that when consumed at a high dosage has the potential to alter physiological and psychophysical responses. PSE is widely accessible as over-the-counter medication and despite limited research into PSE at high dosages or its effects on prolonged exercise (&gt;2 hours) is no-longer on the World Anti-Doping Association&#8217;s banned substance list. Currently unrestricted in sport and with no real understanding of the abovementioned responses during endurance exercise there is a high potential for abuse in sport. A recent study performed in our laboratory found PSE to improve self-paced cycling performance in some individuals, however no physiological measurements were taken Purpose: The primary purpose of this study was to determine the physiological effects of PSE at a dosage previously shown to improve performance (2.5 mg/kg) in some individuals during prolonged cycling. A secondary purpose of this study was to assess the effect on endurance cycling performance. Methods: In a randomized, double-blind and counter-balanced design, ten welltrained cyclists participated in two trials, consisting of 120 min of fixed-intensity cycling at 65% VO2max followed by a set work, self-paced time-trial (TT) of ~30 min, following ingestion of either 2.5 mg/kg PSE or visual-matched glucose placebo. Venous blood samples were collected before and during exercise, along with body temperatures and heart rate. Perceived effort and expired gas samples were collected during exercise. Exercise and diet was controlled ~48-hours prior to the trials. Results: Mean heart rate was significantly higher with PSE (P = 0.028) during fixed-intensity exercise. Blood glucose concentrations were significantly lower with PSE (P &lt;0.001) for the first 40 min of fixed-intensity exercise. Respiratory exchange ratio was lower in the final 20-min of fixed-intensity and TT with PSE. Blood lactate, perceived effort, ventilation, and body temperatures were not significantly different between conditions during exercise, nor was TT performance; however individual response was variable. Conclusions: PSE ingestion increased heart rate during endurance cycling and initially suppressed carbohydrate release into the bloodstream while increasing fat oxidation in the later stages of exercise. Despite individual responses, endurance cycling performance remained unchanged with PSE ingestion.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cycling performance</field><field name="subject">physiological measurements</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321400 Human Movement and Sports Science::321401 Exercise physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1013</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Suppressing stereotypes of the poor: rebound effects can be positive (as well as negative) : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Psychology at Massey University, Auckland</field><field name="creator">Kennedy, Sharyn</field><field name="description">Suppressing unwanted stereotypes ironically leads suppressors to think and behave in a more stereotypical manner than controls. Suppression studies typically test for rebound with target groups that perceivers may feel entitled to stereotype (e.g., skinheads) or that are associated with negative stereotypes (e.g., African Americans). In contrast, stereotypes of the aid-related poor are expected to contain ambivalent content: a mix of both positive and negative stereotypic information. Since this content may affect perceivers&#8217; cognitive processes of stereotype activation, application, suppression and rebound, it was expected that stereotype rebound effects (e.g., judgments and behaviours) for the aid-related poor would differ from those reported for previously tested target groups. Stereotype rebound effects for this target group might occur as: a) positive responses, such as approach behaviour or positive judgments, b) occur as negative responses, such as avoidance behaviour or negative judgments, or c) not be evidenced in suppressors&#8217; responses. Four experiments were designed to explore the effects of stereotype suppression, and to examine stereotype rebound effects in perceivers who suppressed (i.e., were asked not to think stereotypically) their stereotypes of the aid-related poor. In the first experiment (N = 29), there was no evidence of stereotype suppression in suppressors&#8217; essays about a poor African youth. In the second experiment (N = 24) however, suppressors sat significantly closer than controls to the alleged seat of an African student (a reverse rebound effect). In the third experiment (N = 35), suppressors again showed evidence of approach behaviour when interacting with African poor individuals, and demonstrated avoidance behaviour when interacting with African wealthy individuals. Experiment 4 (N = 70) used implicit measures of stereotyping; participants were asked to name the ink colour of stereotypic and nonstereotypic trait words presented immediately following two category primes. Suppressors tended to be faster than controls to name the colour of positive trait words and slower than controls to name the colour of negative trait words that were stereotypic of the African poor target group. This difference in response times implies that, for suppressors only, the salient stereotype features being primed were positive rather than negative; thus eliciting a positive rebound effect. Stereotype rebound effects may therefore not always be evidenced by higher levels of negative or prejudiced responding in suppressors, but can also appear as positive evaluations and approach behaviours. Findings from this research (i.e., stereotype rebound effects can be either positive or negative) have important implications for those viewers of aid advertisements who suppress unwanted stereotypes, especially as rebound effects for the aid-related poor are associated with unconscious behavioural and cognitive responses.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">stereotype suppression</field><field name="subject">stereotype rebound effects</field><field name="subject">African poor</field><field name="subject">prejudiced behaviour</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380105 Social and community psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1014</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of field techniques to predict soil carbon, soil nitrogen and root density from soil spectral reflectance : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Soil Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Kusumo, Bambang Hari</field><field name="description">The objectives of this research were to develop and evaluate a field method for in situ measurement of soil properties using visible near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (Vis-NIRS). A probe with an independent light source for acquiring soil reflectance spectra from soil cores was developed around an existing portable field spectrometer (ASD FieldSpecPro, Boulder, CO, USA; 350-2500 nm). Initial experiments tested the ability of the acquired spectra to predict plant root density, an important property in soil carbon dynamics. Reflectance spectra were acquired from soil containing ryegrass roots (Lolium multiflorum) grown in Allophanic and Fluvial Recent soils in a glasshouse pot trial. Differences in root density were created by differential nitrogen and phosphorus fertilization. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) was used to calibrate spectral data (pre-processed by smoothing and transforming spectra to the first derivative) against laboratory-measured root density data (wet-sieve technique). The calibration model successfully predicted root densities (r2 = 0.85, RPD = 2.63, RMSECV = 0.47 mg cm-3) observed in the pots to a moderate level of accuracy. This soil reflectance probe was then tested using a soil coring system to acquire reflectance spectra from two soils under pasture (0-60 mm soil depths) that had contrasting root densities. The PLSR calibration models for predicting root density were more accurate when soil samples from the two soils were separated rather than grouped. A more accurate prediction was found in Allophanic soils (r2 = 0.83, RPD = 2.44, RMSECV = 1.96 mg g-1) than in Fluvial Recent soils (r2 = 0.75, RPD = 1.98, RMSECV = 5.11 mg g-1). The Vis-NIRS technique was then modified slightly to work on a soil corer that could be used to measure root contents from deeper soil profiles (15- 600 mm depth) in arable land (90-day-old maize crop grown in Fluvial Recent soils). PLSR calibration models were constructed to predict the full range of maize root densities (r2 = 0.83, RPD = 2.42, RMSECV = 1.21 mg cm-3) and also soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) concentrations that had been determined in the laboratory (LECO FP- 2000 CNS Analyser; Leco Corp., St Joseph, MI, USA). Further studies concentrated on improving the Vis-NIRS technique for prediction of total C and N concentrations in differing soil types within different soil orders in the field. The soil coring method used in the maize studies was evaluated in permanent and recent pastoral soils (Pumice, Allophanic and Tephric Recent in the Taupo-Rotorua Volcanic Zone, North Island) with a wide range of soil organic matter contents resulting from different times (1-5 years) since conversion from forest soils. Without any sample preparation, other than the soil surface left after coring, it was possible to predict soil C and N concentrations with moderate success (C prediction r2 = 0.75, RMSEP = 1.23%, RPD = 1.97; N prediction r2 = 0.80, RMSEP = 0.10%, RPD = 2.15) using a technique of acquiring soil reflectance spectra from the horizontal cross-section of a soil core (H method). The soil probe was then modified to acquire spectra from the curved vertical wall of a soil core (V method), allowing the spectrometer&#8217;s field of view to increase to record the reflectance features of the whole soil sample taken for laboratory analysis. Improved predictions of soil C and N concentrations were achieved with the V method of spectral acquisition (C prediction r2 = 0.97, RMSECV = 0.21%, RPD = 5.80; N prediction r2 = 0.96, RMSECV = 0.02%, RPD = 5.17) compared to the H method (C prediction r2 = 0.95, RMSECV = 0.27%, RPD = 4.45; N prediction r2 = 0.94, RMSECV = 0.03%, RPD = 4.25). The V method was tested for temporal robustness by assessing its ability to predict soil C and N concentrations of Fluvial Recent soils under permanent pasture in different seasons. When principal component analysis (PCA) was used to ensure that the spectral dimensions (which were responsive to water content) of the data set used for developing the PLSR calibration model embraced those of the &#8220;unknown&#8221; soil samples, it was possible to predict soil C and N concentrations in &#8220;unknown&#8221; samples of widely different water contents (in May and November), with a high level of accuracy (C prediction r2 = 0.97, RMSEP = 0.36%, RPD = 3.43; N prediction r2 = 0.95, RMSEP = 0.03%, RPD = 3.44). This study indicates that Vis-NIRS has considerable potential for rapid in situ assessment of soil C, N and root density. The results demonstrate that field root densities in pastoral and arable soil can be predicted independently from total soil C, which will allow researchers to predict C sequestration from root production. The recommended &#8220;V&#8221; technique can be used to assess spatial and temporal variability of soil carbon and nitrogen within soil profiles and across the landscape. It can also be used to assess the rate of C sequestration and organic matter synthesis via root density prediction. It reduces the time, labour and cost of conventional soil analysis and root density measurement.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">soil properties</field><field name="subject">soil carbon dynamics</field><field name="subject">root density</field><field name="subject">in situ assessment</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300100 Soil and Water Sciences::300101 Soil physics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1015</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On the zero-point energy of elliptic-cyliindrical and spheroidal boundaries : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Theoretical Physics at Massey University, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Kitson, Adrian Robert</field><field name="description">Zero-point energy is the energy of the vacuum. Disturbing the vacuum results in a change in the zero-point energy. In 1948, Casimir considered the change in the zeropoint energy when the vacuumis disturbed by two parallelmetal plates. The plates disturb the vacuum by restricting the quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field. Casimir found that the change in the zero-point energy implies that the plates are attracted to each other. With the recent advances made in the experimental verification of this remarkable result, theoretical interest has been rekindled. In addition to the original parallel plate configuration, several other boundaries have been studied. In this thesis, two novel boundaries are considered: elliptic-cylindrical and spheroidal. The results for these boundaries lead to the conjecture that zero-point energy does not change for small deformations of the boundary that preserve volume. Assuming the conjecture, it is shown that zero-point energy plays a stabilizing role in quantum chromodynamics, the leading theory of the strong interaction.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">zero-point energy</field><field name="subject">vacuum</field><field name="subject">quantum chromodynamics</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences::240200 Theoretical and Condensed Matter Physics::240201 Theoretical physics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1016</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A new model of students' perceptions of the primary school classroom emotional environment : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Psychology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Andersen, Rachel Joy</field><field name="description">94 items was developed that encapsulate what children notice in their classrooms as affecting the emotional environment and the language they use to describe it.

Within these, religions, distinctive singing and meditation techniques can be used to aid concentration, calm and balance the mind, and soothe the body. A meditative technique adopted by Hindu and Buddhist practitioners is to draw the mind into a centred point of focus, blocking out external distractions that inhibit concentration. The sound based meditation Om, for example, is a most powerful mantra, capable of healing and elevating consciousness (Beck, 1995). Vocal sounding and chant as well as gazing at or visualising images are techniques that have been utilised in ancient religious practice to aid people to develop their natural capabilities to shift energy within body and mind. Contemporary neuroscientists are interested in the states of mind that Buddhist monks claim to enter into while sounding. Equipped with technology for analysing brainwave activity, experiments have revealed that electromagnetic stimuli such as sound, light and colour can have physical affect upon the practitioner&#8217;s brain. Researchers have developed new therapeutic tools and techniques to benefit the health and well-being of individuals from these findings. This thesis traces the therapeutic use of sound, light, colour and form in motion from ancient Hindu and Buddhist religion into its use in complementary therapy. Sound Vision is the name of the film which fulfils the practical component of this research. Inspired by the visual form and motion of sound, this thesis contemplates: if we could see sound, what would it look like and could those images function as a healing art form? Sound Vision translates ancient and contemporary techniques of therapy into a digital audio/visual medium to function as visual therapy and aid for meditation. The themes of this research are foremost to visualise sound and secondly to deduce aspects of sound and vision that have therapeutic qualities. Chapter Three of this thesis thematically outlines qualities of sound that have been found to be capable of exciting or calming its listener. The same process has been applied for vision, specifically how light and colour affect the viewer as well as for form in motion. An interim presentation of the preliminary film, Dance of Light, was exhibited in November 2008 and here formative feedback was gained through unobtrusive observation and discussions with viewers toward the development of Sound Vision. Aspects of the film were found to provoke feelings of unease and tension while other aspects incited focus and calm. Sound Vision, serves as a prototype apply healing using light therapy to create positive physical and psychological outcomes. From the research presented within this thesis, Sound Vision employs various digital methods and techniques which are recognised with ability towards healing. Explorations to further this thesis&#8217; research may include Neurological brainwave analysis and patient testing to determine which kinds of video footage produce particular desirable results.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">audio/visual therapy</field><field name="subject">meditation</field><field name="subject">physiological effects</field><field name="subject">psychological effects</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::419900 Other Arts::419999 The arts not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1018</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Camera and image : mediator and interface : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the Master of Fine Arts at Massey University, Wellington, Aotearoa New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Samsell, Molly</field><field name="description">How can art, specifically photography, illustrate the limitations of vision? What do those limits reveal about perception and knowing? To explore these questions two distinct mechanisms need to be discussed in relation to creative practice, Paul Virilio&#8217;s augmenting lens that forever changes the photographer&#8217;s perception and the image acting as an object for both Maurice Merleau-Ponty&#8217;s embodied experience and Jean Baudrillard&#8217;s simulacrum. The photographic image becomes an index by exposing the relationship between photographer and image. The camera is a tool, to Virilio a prosthetic eye, which immediately affects the photographer&#8217;s perception of her environment. The phenomenal world is the one that is photographed, a subjective experience. The tension between surface and reality, image and object, removes the photographic experience from an experience of the real. The making of the image closely parallels the act of viewing the image. A dual experience emerges from the photograph, the creation of the image and the viewer&#8217;s act of reading, inferring. An image, as an index, is open to multiple interpretations, placing equal weight on each participant, viewer, and creator, so that there is no hierarchy of interpretation, experience, or meaning. In this thesis these questions are explored in relation to a creative practice embedding theory with process and outcome.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">photography</field><field name="subject">limitations of vision</field><field name="subject">photographer's perception</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410200 Visual Arts and Crafts Studies::410203 Photography studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1020</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On making the immeasurable measurable : a search for spirituality in painting practice : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Fine Arts at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Harvey, Amber</field><field name="description">No abstract available</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">spirituality in art</field><field name="subject">painting</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410200 Visual Arts and Crafts Studies::410202 Fine arts studies (incl. sculpture and painting)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1019</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nutritional evaluation of grain legumes for poultry : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Poultry Nutrition at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Nalle, Catootjie Lusje</field><field name="description">The nutritional value of faba beans (Vicia faba), Australian sweet lupins (Lupinus angustifolius), white lupins (Lupinus albus) and peas (Pisum sativum) grown in New Zealand for broilers were evaluated in terms of their nutritional characteristics, protein quality (protein efficiency ratio), apparent metabolisable energy, apparent ileal digestibility coefficient of amino acids and the effects on bird performance. The effects of dehulling and extrusion cooking on the nutritive value of legumes were also investigated. The first experiment discussed in Chapter 3 evaluated the effect of cultivars on the nutrient profile and protein quality of chickpeas (Cicer arietinum), Australian sweet lupins, peas and soybeans (Glycine max). With the exception of white lupins, cultivars had no effect on the proximate and fibre composition of grain legumes. Starch was the primary carbohydrate component of chickpeas and peas, whilst non-starch polysaccharides were the major carbohydrates in lupins. The legume proteins were deficient in lysine, methionine, cystine and threonine. No differences were found in protein quality between cultivars of the different grain legume species. The lowest weight gain and protein efficiency ratio, in addition to the highest relative pancreatic weight and mortality rate was found in raw soybeans, suggesting that soybeans contained high a concentration of anti-nutritional factors, such as protease inhibitors. Birds fed chickpeas, lupins and peas had a low mortality rate and relative pancreatic weight, confirming that the level of anti-nutrients in these legume seeds was low. The apparent metabolisable energy and apparent ileal digestibility coefficient of amino acids of faba beans, Australian sweet lupins, white lupins and peas were determined in the second experiment (Chapter 4). Cultivar effect on the apparent metabolisable energy values was observed only for faba beans and white lupins. Faba beans, white lupins and peas had comparable apparent metabolisable energy values, but these values were higher than those of Australian sweet lupins, and lower than that of soybean meal. No cultivar differences were found in the apparent ileal digestibility coefficient of amino acids of grain legumes. The apparent ileal digestibility coefficient of amino acids of both lupin species was found to be comparable to that of soybean meal. The effects of feeding diets containing 200 g/kg faba beans, lupins or peas on the performance, digestive tract development and litter quality of broilers were investigated in the third and fourth trials. In the cage trial (Chapter 5), the results showed that the weight gain of birds fed diets containing grain legumes was similar to that of control diet. Feed intake and feed per gain of birds fed diets containing the majority of grain legume cultivars did not differ from those fed the maize-soy diet. Birds fed diets containing faba beans had more dry and friable excreta compared to other treatment diets. The performance of birds fed diets containing 200 g/kg grain legumes during the 35 d grow-out period, in the floor pen trial (Chapter 6), confirmed the results of the cage trial. In this trial, weight gain and feed per gain of birds fed diets without meat meal were superior to those with meat meal. In cage trials, the modification of some segments of digestive tract development was probably due to the dietary NSP. Whilst in floor pen trial, digestive tract development was not influenced by the inclusion of grain legumes. The effect of methodology of determination (direct vs. difference method) on the apparent ileal digestibility coefficient of amino acids of wheat, maize, Australian sweet lupins, peas and soybean meal for broilers was evaluated in the fifth study (Chapter 7). The influence of methodology on apparent ileal digestibility coefficient of amino acids was found to vary amongst the feed ingredients. In general, the apparent ileal digestibility coefficient of amino acids of test ingredients determined by the difference method was higher than those determined by the direct method, suggesting that the use of the direct method may underestimate the apparent ileal digestibility coefficient of amino acids in low and medium protein ingredients. Data reported in Chapter 8 shows that dehulling increased the apparent metabolisable energy values of faba beans and Australian sweet lupins, but it had no beneficial effect on peas. The increase of apparent metabolisable energy values may be attributed to the decrease in non-starch polysaccharides of these legume seeds after dehulling. The removal of hulls increased the amino acid concentrations, but it had no effect on the apparent ileal digestibility coefficient of most amino acids. These results suggest that dehulling of grain legumes would be nutritionally beneficial and, likely to be economical in view of the improved amino acid concentrations and energy values. The final experiment (Chapter 9) demonstrated that extrusion of peas markedly influenced the content of crude protein, non-starch polysaccharides, starch, and trypsin inhibitors. The soluble non-starch polysaccharides and trypsin inhibitor contents of the majority of extruded pea samples were higher than those of raw peas, but insoluble and total non-starch polysaccharides decreased with extrusion. Extrusion had no effect on the apparent ileal protein digestibility and the apparent metabolisable energy of peas, but it increased ileal starch digestibility.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">faba beans</field><field name="subject">lupins</field><field name="subject">peas</field><field name="subject">chickpeas</field><field name="subject">poultry diet</field><field name="subject">digestibility</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300400 Animal Production::300403 Animal nutrition</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1021</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Plagiarism and fabrication: dishonesty in the newsroom : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements of the degree of Master of Management (Communication) at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Samson, Alan Michael</field><field name="description">This first comprehensive study of New Zealand news media plagiarism proceeds from the observation that plagiarism, if not demonstrably increasing, is more common than many practitioners would care to believe. It affirms that, contrary to conventional opinion, plagiarism cannot be understood or dismissed simply or entirely as the product of dishonest or lazy journalists. The study findings support indications of an underlying culture of copying within news media organisations&#8212;a professional ideology encouraging, if not overtly justifying, copying, and discouraging clear authorship attribution. The findings emanate from responses to a survey distributed to all New Zealand&#8217;s journalists, followed by in-depth interviews with five journalists identified as having personal experience with aspects of the practice identified in the survey, and a sixth with a journalist against whom a complaint of plagiarism was upheld by watchdog body, the NZ Press Council. The research analysed the just four complaints related to plagiarism brought before the Press Council since its 1972 inception, as well as another five much-publicised examples of the practice written about in the news media, to the present day. Of the nine cases examined, three reflected the most serious type of dishonesty associated with Jayson Blair of the New York Times&#8212;calculated theft of words as well as outright interview fabrication. The others can be categorised in a perceived less blameworthy variety of plagiarism, bedevilled by confusion of terms and newsroom pressures. But because much run-of-the-mill plagiarism is likely to have gone unrecorded and unnoticed beyond the newsroom involved, the true extent of any sort of plagiarism here could not be judged. What was possible in this research, was to gauge a sense of prevalence by asking working journalists not of their own sins, but of their experience of being plagiarised by others. Suddenly the numbers of plagiarism cases rocketed, not in a usefully quantifiable way, but clearly demonstrative of an extent sufficient to warrant analysis of nature and origin. These experiences were set against an American model that identified four antecedents of plagiarism behaviour, two individual&#8212;journalistic rationalising of dishonesty and problematic techniques&#8212;and two situational&#8212;definitional ambiguity and reporter aversion to attribution. What became clear in these analyses was that, though all news media organisations view plagiarism very seriously, few if any acknowledge their own role in perpetrating the practice, that journalism is an industry that proceeds from an ideology of matching and copying.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">news media</field><field name="subject">New Zealand journalists</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::359900 Other Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1022</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teachers' conflicting responses to change: an evaluation of the implementation of senior social studies for the NCEA, 2002-2006 : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the degree of Doctor of Education (EdD), Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Taylor, Rowena Margaret</field><field name="description">The thesis provides a socio-historical perspective through which to evaluate the first five years of implementation (2002 to 2006) of social studies within the National Certificate of Educational Achievement [NCEA] in New Zealand secondary schools. The experiences of both lead educators, with responsibilities at a national level, and classroom teachers provide insights into the personal, contextual and institutional factors which have enabled and constrained the implementation process, especially at NCEA level one. The inclusion of social studies as a subject for the new qualifications and assessment system in New Zealand, the NCEA, heralded a significant opportunity for this integrated subject to gain academic status and acquire a unique identity within the senior secondary school curriculum. Paradoxically it set a relatively strongly framed assessment system beside a curriculum that has traditionally been weakly classified and framed (Bernstein, 1971). This paradox has created tensions for teachers who have responded in different ways, from full implementation to a more functional approach. Two groups of teachers were identified in the course of this study. The idealists are passionate advocates for senior social studies and are likely to implement it to all three NCEA levels in their school. The pragmatists, on the other hand, are more likely to offer only level one social studies, typically to their more academically able year 10 (Form 4) students for extension purposes, and also to induct them into the assessment requirements of the NCEA system before they study the traditional social science subjects at levels one, two and three. This pragmatic approach reflects past practices of the pre- NCEA, School Certificate era (1945-2001). It continues to reinforce the low status and unclear identity of senior social studies within the social sciences as well as within an already overcrowded senior school curriculum. At the end of this first five year period of implementation the viability of senior social studies is at a critical juncture, with its on-going success not yet assured.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">National Certificate of Educational Achievement</field><field name="subject">New Zealand secondary schools</field><field name="subject">teachers' attitudes</field><field name="subject">social sciences</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330200 Curriculum Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1023</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Designing application-specific processors for image processing : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Computer Science, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Bishell, Aaron</field><field name="description">Implementing a real-time image-processing algorithm on a serial processor is difficult to achieve because such a processor cannot cope with the volume of data in the low-level operations. However, a parallel implementation, required to meet timing constraints for the low-level operations, results in low resource utilisation when implementing the high-level operations. These factors suggested a combination of parallel hardware, for the low-level operations, and a serial processor, for the high-level operations, for implementing a high-level image-processing algorithm. Several types of serial processors were available. A general-purpose processor requires an extensive instruction set to be able to execute any arbitrary algorithm resulting in a relatively complex instruction decoder and possibly extra FUs. An application-specific processor, which was considered in this research, implements enough FUs to execute a given algorithm and implements a simpler, and more efficient, instruction decoder. In addition, an algorithms behaviour on a processor could be represented in either hardware (i.e. hardwired logic), which limits the ability to modify the algorithm behaviour of a processor, or &#8220;software&#8221; (i.e. programmable logic), which enables external sources to specify the algorithm behaviour. This research investigated hardware- and software- controlled application-specific serial processors for the implementation of high-level image-processing algorithms and compared these against parallel hardware and general-purpose serial processors. It was found that application-specific processors are easily able to meet the timing constraints imposed by real-time high-level image processing. In addition, the software-controlled processors had additional flexibility, a performance penalty of 9.9% and 36.9% and inconclusive footprint savings (and costs) when compared to hardwarecontrolled processors.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">serial processor</field><field name="subject">algorithm behaviour</field><field name="subject">high-level image processing</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280200 Artificial Intelligence and Signal and Image Processing::280203 Image processing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1024</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Epidemiological investigations of surveillance strategies of zoonotic Salmonella : a dissertation presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Benschop, Jacqueline</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the application of recently developed epidemiological and statistical tools to inform the optimisation of a national surveillance strategy of considerable importance to human health. The results of a series of epidemiological investigations of surveillance strategies for zoonotic Salmonella are presented. Salmonella are one of the most common and serious zoonotic foodborne pathogenic bacteria globally. These studies were motivated by the increasing focus on the cost-effectiveness of surveillance while maintaining consumer confidence in food supply. Although data from the Danish Salmonella surveillance and control programme has been used in these investigations, the techniques may be readily applied to other surveillance data of similar quality. The first study describes the spatial epidemiological features of Danish Salmonella surveillance and control programme data from 1995 to 2004, using a novel method of spatially adaptive smoothing. The conditional probability of a farm being a case was consistently high in the the south-west of Sonderjylland on the Jutland peninsula, identifying this area for further investigation and targeted surveillance. The identification of clustering of case farms led into the next study, which closely examines one year of data, 2003, for patterns of spatial dependency. K-function analyses provided evidence for aggregation of Salmonella case farms over that of all farms at distances of up to six kilometres. Visual semivariogram analyses of random farm-level effects from a Bayesian logistic regression model (adjusted for herd size) of Salmonella seropositivity, revealed spatial dependency between pairs of farms up to a distance of four kilometres apart. The strength of the spatial dependency was positively associated with slaughter pig farm density. We describe how this might inform the surveillance programme by potentially targeting herds within a four kilometre radius of those with high levels of Salmonella infection. In the third study, farm location details, routinely recorded surveillance information, and industry survey data from 1995 were combined to build a logistic seroprevalence model. This identified wet-feeding and specific pathogen free herd health status as protective factors for Salmonella seropositivity, while purchasing feed was a risk factor. Once adjusting for these covariates, we identified pockets of unexplained risk for Salmonella seropositivity and found spatial dependency at distances of up to six km (95% CI: 2&#8211;35 km) between farms. A generalised linear spatial model was fitted to the Jutland data allowing formal estimation of the range of spatial correlation and a measure of the uncertainty about it. There was a large within-farm component to the variance, suggesting that gathering more farm level information would be advantageous if this approach was to be used to target surveillance strategy. The fourth study again considers data from the whole study period, 1995 to 2004. A detailed temporal analysis of the data revealed there was no consistent seasonal pattern and correspondingly no benefit in targeting sampling to particular times of the year. Spatiotemporal analyses suggested a local epidemic of increased seroprevalence occured in west Jutland in late 2000. Lorelogram analyses showed a defined period of statistically significant temporal dependency, suggesting that there is little value in sampling more frequently than every 10 weeks on the average farm. The final study uses findings from the preceding chapters to develop a zero-inflated binomial model which predicts which farms are most at risk of Salmonella, and then preferentially samples these high-risk farms. This type of modelling allows assessment of similarities and differences between factors that affect herd infection status (introduction) and those that affect the seroprevalence in infected herds (persistence and spread). The model suggested that many of the herds where Salmonella was not detected were infected but at a low prevalence. Using cost and sensitivity, we compared the results with those under the standard sampling scheme based on herd size, and the recently introduced risk-based approach. Model based results were less sensitive, but showed significant cost savings. Further model refinements, sampling schemes, and the methods to evaluate their performance are important areas for future work, and should continue to occur in direct consultation with Danish authorities.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">foodborne pathogen</field><field name="subject">data analyses</field><field name="subject">high-risk farms</field><field name="subject">animal infection</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300400 Animal Production::300405 Animal production (pests and pathogens)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1025</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An analysis of the interval of observation and the risk in stocks : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Business Studies in Finance at Massey Unviersity, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Anderson, Luke William</field><field name="description">This research examines how the interval of observation affects the assessment of risk in stocks.

These experiences of embodiment are chiasmic, dialectical and dialogical, and underpin the narrative dilemmas we create through the storied nature of our attempts to make sense of them. In testifying my own embodiment this autobiographical form of sensual scholarship emphasizes the subjective basis for my body&#8217;s psychology. By developing the complicating action segments of my life story told through interview data into a chronologically-ordered and textually- layered account of personally significant memories, I craft a story of my panicking body. My upbringing was influenced by discourses that reinforced parental and family affiliation at the expense of my feeling body. Unravelling my need to exercise as a contingency of this affiliation provides retrospective meaning to the distress my panicking caused. Situating my feelings, thoughts, emotions and actions within the broader constraints of my family&#8217;s history, community, religion and culture reveals the contingent nature of my embodiment. Describing the shifting contingencies of a life lived since my upbringing in the small, rural town of Inglewood, New Zealand, provides the opportunity to recognize and to re-align the dialectics of identity that help to make up my body&#8217;s psychology. Juxtaposing this narrative meaning-making are my revelations of experiential integration achieved through the flow of exercise. Understood as an extension of my body&#8217;s fundamental sensuality, this evolutionally-refined capacity for engagement underpins my lived experiencing. Together these sentient and reflexive forms of testimony confirm the inherence of my sensuality and the circumstance of self-hood, and invite you, the reader, to explore the workings of your own body. By revealing the sensual and symbolic strands of my embodiment this story of human contingency reveals something of the fleshy consciousness that we all share, not by speaking for anyone else, but by calling attention to the taken-for-granted nature of its unfolding. By arguing for a psychology more relevant to lived experiencing, my thesis questions the body of Western science and, in particular, psychology&#8217;s version of it. Articulating the felt nature of my experiencing situates my mind back in my body and, in doing so, fleshes out its psychology. While the insights shared here are personal, the relevance of the felt-body is found in the ways it becomes discoursed and narrated.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">exercise psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">autobiographical</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380199 Psychology not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1027</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Trading volume and information asymmetry surrounding scheduled and unscheduled announcements : a thesis submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Finance, Massey University, Februrary 2009</field><field name="creator">Chi, Wei</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates abnormal trading volume around scheduled and unscheduled announcements. The research is an extension of Chae (2005), Journal of Finance, Vol 60, which tests corporate announcements in the US stock market. In this thesis, Australian stocks are used to establish whether market characteristics affect trading behaviour around announcements. In addition, I extend the traditional methodology to overcome possible shortcomings in the previous studies. This thesis also discusses how information asymmetry affects the abnormal trading volume on the announcement day. In contrast to earlier studies, I  nd abnormal trading volume does not change before either scheduled or unscheduled announcements, but, as expected, increases on and after the scheduled and unscheduled announcements. Information asymmetry increases trading volumes when unscheduled announcements are made, but has no effect for scheduled announcements. I show that the failure to adjust for the correlation between corporate events, results in abnormal trading volumes being detected prior to announcements. Differences between the Australian and US results can not all be explained by methodological differences. It appears that the underlying dynamics of the Australian market are different; casting doubts on the ability to generalize market characteristics from US based studies on abnormal trading volumes.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">effect of announcements on trading volume</field><field name="subject">Australian stock market</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics::340200 Applied Economics::340203 Finance economics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1032</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The economic determinants of entrepreneurial activity : evidence from a Bayesian approach : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Business Studies in Financial Economics at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Winata, Sherly</field><field name="description">In this paper we investigate the economic, political, institutional, and societal factors that encourage entrepreneurial activity.

Over this time it has become increasingly apparent that despite its usefulness, lead is one of the most highly toxic substances known to man. Current research into lead exposure of humans focuses on low-level chronic exposure and its effects on learning and behaviour. However, investigations into lead exposure of wildlife are still focussed on mortalities, particularly of waterfowl and raptors, with little known about low-level exposures or the effects on other species. This study examines the exposure of free-ranging kea (Nestor notabilis) from the Aoraki/ Mt Cook village and national park, takahe (Porphyrio hochstetteri) from Tiritiri Matangi, Kapiti and Mana Islands, and the lead associated syndrome of clenched-claw paralysis and leg paresis in harriers (Circus approximans) in New Zealand. Thirty-eight kea had detectable blood lead with concentrations ranging from 0.028 mg/L to 3.43 mg/L (mean = 0.428 mg/L &#177; 0.581). Analysis of tissue samples found that seven of 15 birds died with elevated tissue lead. Lead exposure may be an important contributing factor in kea mortality. As a result of these findings, lead abatement in areas frequented by kea is being considered. Eighteen of 45 takahe had detectable blood lead concentrations ranging from 0.015 mg/L to 0.148 mg/L (mean = 0.028 mg/L &#177; 0.042). Analysis of tissue samples from offshore island and Murchison Mountains birds found that all had detectable lead. Despite levels of lead exposure in the population being low and unlikely to result in overt clinical signs, it is widespread and there may be significant exposure of birds living around old buildings. An investigation into the clinical signs, pathology and response to treatment of clenched-claw paralysis and leg paresis in wild harriers was carried out. Harriers with clenched feet had significantly higher blood lead concentrations than those without. In conclusion, lead is a major factor in the expression of this clinical syndrome but other factors not yet identified are playing a role. This study demonstrates that lead is widespread in the New Zealand environment exposing a diverse range of avifauna, and has made some progress towards exploring some of its effects on health and survival.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">kea</field><field name="subject">takahe</field><field name="subject">Australasian harriers</field><field name="subject">Nestor notabilis</field><field name="subject">Porphyrio hochstetteri</field><field name="subject">Circus approximans</field><field name="subject">epidemology</field><field name="subject">lead poisoning</field><field name="subject">lead exposure</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300500 Veterinary Medicine::300503 Epidemiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1031</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cluster analysis of object-oriented programs : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Computer Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Yakovlev, Vyacheslav</field><field name="description">In this thesis we present a novel approach to the analysis of dependency graphs of object-oriented programs, and we describe a tool that has been implemented for this purpose. A graph-theoretical clustering algorithm is used in order to compute the modular structure of programs. This can be used to assist software engineers to redraw component boundaries in software in order to improve the level of reuse and maintainability. The analysis of the dependency graph of an object-oriented program is useful for assessing the quality of software design. The dependency graph can be extracted from a program using various different methods, including source code, byte code, and dynamic (behavioral) analysis. The nodes in the dependency graph are classes, members, packages and other artifacts, while the edges represent uses and extends relationships between those artifacts. Once the dependency graph has been extracted, it can be analysed in order to quantify certain characteristics of the respective program. Examples include the detection of circular dependencies and measurements of the responsibility or independence of units based on their relationships. Tools like JDepend1 implementing these principles have become very popular in recent years. Our work includes grouping types in dependency graphs using di erent clustering methods:  Grouping into namespaces;  Grouping into clusters using graph clustering algorithms;  Grouping into clusters using rules. The detected mismatches are candidates for refactoring. We have developed a tool for processing dependency graphs clustering and producing results where users can outline possible design violations.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">component based software development</field><field name="subject">object-oriented programmes</field><field name="subject">cluster analysis</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280300 Computer Software::280302 Software engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1030</field></doc><doc><field name="title">General biology and reproductive fitness of Tasmanian lacewing, Micromus tasmaniae Walker : a thesis presented in partial fulfllment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Plant Protection at the Institute of Natural Resources, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Yadav, Anand</field><field name="description">Tasmanian lacewing, Micromus tasmaniae Walker, is an important predator of a number of economically important pests such as aphids. This study was conducted to investigate some aspects of general biology and factors affecting the reproductive fitness of this species Emergence of M. tasmaniae peaked 3 h before light off and there was no significant difference in emergence patterns between males and females. Males became sexually mature earlier than females. Mating success significantly increased from the first to the eleventh hour after lights on. Predation, development and oviposition of M. tasmaniae were affected when reared under different photoperiods [i.e. 24:0, 16:8, 12:12, 0:24 h (light:dark)]. Results indicate that no individuals entered diapause at either an immature or adult stage. M. tasmaniae larvae could feed in both the photophase and scotophase and late instar larvae consumed significantly more aphids than early instar larvae. M. tasmaniae reared at 16:8 h developed faster and had lower mortality, heavier adult body weight and higher reproductive output in terms of fecundity and fertility rate. Therefore, mass-rearing programmes are recommended to be carried out at 16:8 h to obtain the higher quality of individuals and faster increase of populations. The larger-the better theory predicts that the reproductive fitness is positively linearly associated with body size or weight. However, the body weight of female M. tasmaniae had no effect on the reproductive fitness in terms of fecundity, fertility, fertility rate, oviposition period and longevity. The male body weight may contribute to the population growth of M. tasmaniae as the average females that mated with average or heavy males had significantly higher fecundity, fertility and fertility rate and longer reproductive period. These results suggest that development of any control method that should selectively mass-produce heavy and average individuals in the laboratory would help increasing M. tasmaniae quality and populations. M. tasmaniae is a polygamous species. Results indicate that female remating either with the same or different males was crucial for maximizing their reproductive success. Males could inseminate up to eight females and father about one thousand offspring during their life span.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tasmanian lacewing</field><field name="subject">Micromus tasmaniae</field><field name="subject">pest predators</field><field name="subject">plant protection</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300300 Horticulture::300303 Plant protection (pests, diseases and weeds)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1029</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Great transformations : Karl Polanyi and Nikolas Rose on the shifting fortunes of social strategies of government : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment for the degree of Master of Arts in Sociology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Wynyard, Matthew Adam</field><field name="description">This thesis seeks to make sense of the emergence of neoliberalism at the close of the twentieth century and the subsequent appearance of Third Way strategies of government in recent decades. In so doing it deals comparatively with the work of two very different, yet nevertheless both increasingly influential theorists of social change - Karl Polanyi and Nikolas Rose. In the middle decades of the twentieth century Karl Polanyi theorized what he held to be the inevitable shift from a market society to one in which the economy was embedded in a web of social relations. Some half century later in the 1990s, Nikolas Rose theorized the 'death of the social', the process by which the social logic that underpinned Western welfare states for much of the twentieth- century is giving way to a new formula for rule. Rose terms this new way of governing advanced liberalism. This thesis argues that an approach to neoliberalism and the third way that employs both Polanyi's analytical and critical tools as well as the insights gained from Nikolas Rose's governmentality studies can help to render neoliberalism both visible and contestable in new ways. Further such an approach might serve to illuminate potential paths forward.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">neoliberalism</field><field name="subject">Third Way</field><field name="subject">Karl Polanyi</field><field name="subject">Nikolas Rose</field><field name="subject">social policy</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370100 Sociology::370102 Social policy and planning</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1028</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The physiological and molecular response to repeated sprints in male and female team-sport athletes : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Sport and Exercise Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Dent, Jessica</field><field name="description">Background: Due to the unique demands of the sport, athletes playing football perform a variety of differing training methods to improve physiological performance. These include strength, endurance and sprint training. While the effects of strength and endurance training have been well researched, the effects of repeated-sprint training on blood and muscle variables in well trained males and females are not well known. An understanding of changes to the blood and muscle during and following an exercise bout are important, so to gain an understanding of the type of stress and resulting adaptations that may occur. Also, while a large volume of research in training adaptations has been performed on males; little has been done on females. To date, some research indicates metabolism during moderateintensity exercise may differ between males and females; however, no study has compared repeated-sprint exercise. Therefore, it is unclear as to whether males and females would have a differing physiological response to repeated-sprint training. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of a repeated-sprint bout on molecular signalling in muscle and blood measures and heart rate in well-trained footballers. Additionally, we compared running times and sprint decrement (%). Research Design: Eight female senior University football players (Mean &#177; SD, age, 19 &#177; 1 y, VO ? 2peak 53.0 &#177; 5.1 ml&#183;kg-1min-1) and seven male senior University football players (Mean &#177; SD, age, 19 &#177; 3 y, VO ? 2peak 59.0 &#177; 6.6 ml&#183;kg-1min-1) volunteered to participate in this study. Participants performed four bouts of 6 x 30 m maximal sprints spread equally over a 40 min period. Sprint time was measured (at 30 m) for each sprint and sprint decrement was also calculated for all bouts. Muscle biopsies were taken from the vastus lateralis muscle at rest, 15 min following exercise and 2 h into recovery. Venous blood samples were taken at the same time points as the biopsies while capillary blood lactate was measured at rest and 3 min following each sprint bout. Repeated measures ANOVA and Post hoc t-tests were performed to determine significant differences between the two groups (male vs. female) and time points. Findings: Both groups had a significant (P&lt;0.05) increase in blood lactate (mM) after the first bout of repeated sprints, with no differences between females (pre 0.9 &#177; 0.4 mM &#8211; post 10.0 &#177; 1.6 mM) and males (pre 0.8 &#177; 0.3 mM &#8211; post 10.0 &#177; 3.5 mM). Blood lactate remained elevated compared to rest (P&lt;0.05) following bouts 2, 3 and 4 for both females (12.0 &#177; 3.6, 12.0 &#177; 3.3, 12.2 &#177; 3.8 mM respectively) and males (11.9 &#177; 2.9, 11.6 &#177; 2.3, 11.5 &#177; 4.0 mM respectively), with no differences between groups or time points (P&gt;0.05). There were no differences (P&gt;0.05) between the female and male athletes in mean heart rate attained at the end of each bout of repeated sprints (187 &#177; 2 v 190 &#177; 2 bpm respectively) or during recovery between sprints (140 &#177; 2 v 130 &#177; 2 bpm respectively). There were no differences between groups or time points in blood insulin (P&gt;0.05). Fastest 30 m sprint time and mean 30 m sprint time during the repeated-sprint bout was faster for the males than females (4.58 &#177; 0.12 v 5.26 &#177; 0.27 s respectively; (P&gt;0.05)). However, there were no differences in running velocity during the sprints between the males and females (165 &#177; 0.4 % vs. 155 &#177; 0.05 %; P&gt;0.05) when expressed relative to velocity at VO ? 2peak (vVO ? 2peak). Also, mean % decrement during the repeated-sprint bout was lower in the males then females (4.9 &#177; 1.3 v 7.1 &#177; 1.9 % respectively; P&lt;0.05). No changes were observed in total or phosphorylated Akt at any time-point or between genders. However, while total 4E-BP1 was lower, the ratio of total to phosphoryalated 4E-BP1 at rest was greater in males than females (P&lt;0.05). Finally, there was also a significant decrease in 4E-BP1 phosphorylation post-exercise in males (P&lt;0.05), but not females. Conclusions: There were no sex differences in blood lactate or heart rate throughout the repeated-sprint bout. These findings suggest that there were no cardio respiratory or lactate production/clearance differences in the response to a repeated-sprint-training bout between sexes. However, while males were faster than their female counterparts, the average relative speed was similar between sexes, suggesting a similar relative volume of work was performed during the sprint bouts. However, the females did have a greater decrement in sprint performance indicating a greater ability to recover sprint performance in the males. Sex differences in resting total and phosphorylated 4E-BP1 may indicate greater potential for muscle growth in the male athletes during basal conditions. However, differences could be due to factors other than sex, including previous training history. There was a lack of change in plasma insulin or Akt, but, similar to resistance exercise, a significant decrease in post-exercise 4E-BP1 phosphorylation for the males, but not females. The sex differences in the 4E-BP1 phosphorylation response post-exercise could be due to differences in the metabolic disturbance in the muscle during and following maximal sprints.

Six youth aged 16-17 years have shared their experiences in several areas of Catholicism such as religious attendance, Catholic identity and Catholic faith, morals and values, peer group socialisation and religious commitment. Using a qualitative mixed-methodological approach with the underlying philosophical stance of interpretivism, the intent of the study is to discover ways in which these young Catholics integrate their faith into their daily lives and make meaning out of it. It also compares the religious beliefs and values of Catholic youth in Whangarei to those reported worldwide. The findings reveal many similar themes to those from international studies. Although all of the participants in this study possessed a distinct sense of &#8216;spirituality&#8217; and being &#8216;Catholic&#8217; was a very important part of their identity, not all of them seemed to consider it practical to live out their Catholic beliefs. Similarly, although they did not face any insurmountable challenges in practicing their faith in daily life, only a few of them had strong convictions about their faith and, like their peers in other countries, only a few could concretely list the core Catholic beliefs. Concepts of moralistic therapeutic deism were found to affect half the participants while nuances of moralistic relativism were also prevalent. Results also showed a growing disinterest in attending Mass, participating in the sacrament of Confession, leading an active prayer life, being a part of church youth activities and some difficulty in finding similar peer group support. Overall, the findings presented in this thesis suggested that the participants involved in the study could be separated into two groups on the basis of their differing spiritual levels and commitment to the Catholic faith The findings suggest a need for Catholic youth in Whangarei to be supported in their spiritual development in order to help them grow in their Catholic faith. Accordingly, the main recommendations are for community-based services such as providing a variety of youth programmes/groups to engage young people and finding ways to facilitate the secure engagement of youth in a dialogue about their faith and religion, in order to spiritually encourage, nourish and sustain them at whatever stage they might be at.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Catholicism</field><field name="subject">Catholic identity</field><field name="subject">religious commitment</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370200 Social Work::370299 Social work not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1036</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of fusion motion capture for optimisation of performance in alpine ski racing : a thesis presented in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Science at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Brodie, Matthew Andrew Dalhousie</field><field name="description">Fusion Motion Capture (FMC), a wearable motion capture system was developed, and applied to the optimisation of athlete performance in alpine ski racing. In what may be a world first, the three-dimensional movements of a skilled athlete (with less than 20 FIS1 points) skiing through a complete training giant slalom racecourse were analysed. FMC consists of multiple light weight sensors attached to the athlete including inertial measurement units (IMUs), pressure sensitive insoles and a global position system (GPS) receiver. The IMUs contain accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers. Limb orientation and location are obtained by mathematically combining the most reliable data from each sensor using fusion algorithms developed by the author. FMC fuses the signals from the IMUs and GPS without the need for the post filtering, usually applied to motion capture data, and therefore, maintains maximum bandwidth. The FMC results were stable and relatively independent of motion type and duration unlike other inertial systems available in 2005, when the research was initiated. Analysis of data collected from an athlete skiing giant slalom contradict the traditional &#8222;going straight turning short? race strategy. The shortest path may not always be the fastest. Instead each gate has a different optimum approach arc. Optimum turn radius increases with both increasing speed and increasing terrain slope. The results also contradict laboratory measurements of ski/snow sliding friction and suggest that snow resistance in giant slalom is of similar importance to wind drag. In addition to gravity, the athlete increased speed using the techniques of &#8222;lateral projection? and &#8222;pumping?. Race performance was determined from the analysis of the athlete skiing through the entire course. FMC proved, therefore, to be more suitable than traditional optical systems that are practically limited to capturing small sections of a race course. The athlete experienced high and rapidly fluctuating torques about all three axes of the lower joints. This information could be useful in designing training programmes racecourses and equipment to reduce knee injuries. Data driven animations and colour coded force vector diagrams were developed to enhance athlete feedback. Inline skating data was also analysed.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">alpine skiing</field><field name="subject">athlete performance</field><field name="subject">performance analysis</field><field name="subject">motion capture</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280200 Artificial Intelligence and Signal and Image Processing::280210 Simulation and modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1041</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Storytelling memories : a tangible connection to bomber command veterans : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Masters in Design at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Marriott, Tanya</field><field name="description">As we pass the 6oth anniversary of the end of World War Two (WW2) historians are diligently collecting the memoirs of veterans to preserve for future generations. Public archives of memorabilia, letters, photos and artefacts, in the process of digitisation are complimenting the stone memorials of the past. This material culture of memory discusses human interaction. &#8220;The poor, the rich, the brave and the afraid, the hero and the deserter&#8221; (Moriarty, 1999, p 654). In contemporary museum culture this digitised information is presented in either web-based systems, or interactive kiosks. However, this approach to packaging memories and historical data often leaves out much of the depth of the topic information, skimming the surface of the knowledge conveyed. New solutions to memory and artefact display have been developed effectively in the Churchill room&#8217;s exhibit designed by Small Design (Kabat,2008) and Memory Miner (Memory Miner, 2008), a home-based memory archive programme by John Fox. Both convey the memories and artefacts upon a mapped interface, using our desire to discover and connect with memories to navigate the narrative in a self-guided format. The Storytelling Memories project seeks to build on current research to formulate an interactive platform of memory immersion and experience within a museum environment. The project utilises a touch sensitive surface as an interface between the viewer and the memories. A physical controller, when placed near the interface surface will &#8220;unlock&#8221; contained memories, enabling an open-ended storytelling experience. The design encourages the user to interact directly with the memories to create their own dialogue, with the intention of developing a more emotive, personal connection to the Veteran.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">World War Two</field><field name="subject">museum exhibit design</field><field name="subject">war veterans</field><field name="subject">interactive platform</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410300 Cinema, Electronic Arts and Media Studies::410306 Communications and media studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1045</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Job design and wellness in New Zealand Contact Centres: a paradigm shift or same old management? : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the postgraduate degree of Master of Business Studies, Human Resource Management at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Boyte, Karen-Ann</field><field name="description">The impact of the Contact Centre workplace upon employee satisfaction or wellness is attracting the attention of researchers across the globe. Over 10 years of research has resulted in recommendations about how Contact Centres should be managed and how the jobs of Contact Centre agents should be designed. There is growing concern that the current practices result in significant psychosocial risk factors which are ultimately harming the Contact Agents and less obviously the bottom line of their organisations through emotional exhaustion, stress, employee absenteeism and turnover. The aim of this study was to explore whether Contact Centre managers were aware of these recommendations, in particular those relating to the design of motivating, satisfying and &#8220;healthy&#8221; jobs. Using an expanded Job Characteristic Model, this descriptive study explored the level of awareness of New Zealand Contact Centre managers (n=20) regarding the recommendations about the design of jobs, and what changes, if any, have occurred as a result. Where changes have not been forthcoming, the study explored the constraints which were preventing or limiting change. The results of this study indicated that there is a low level of awareness of the research recommendations, that approaches to improving the management and design of Contact Centre agents roles are ad hoc, and that there is a level of resistance in providing agents with autonomy to manage their day to day roles. Some efforts to increase task and skill variety have been made but these are also ad hoc rather than built into the job.

The aim of this study was to explore what was occurring amongst Maori mental health nurses and dual competencies. A grounded theory informed by a Maori centred research approach was adopted and conducted with three focus groups of ten Maori mental health nurses situated in one metropolitan and two provincial cities. The research design was informed by Mason Durie?s Maori centred concepts of whakapiki tangata (enablement), whakatuia (integration) mana Maori (control) and integrated with grounded theory to guide the collection and analysis of the data. Audio taping and field notes were used to collect the data and the processes of constant comparative analysis, theoretical sampling and saturation were used to generate a middle range substantive Maori centred grounded theory. One core category was identified as two worlds which describes the main issue that they are grappling with. The basic social psychological process of bridging of tension explains how the two worlds are managed through two subcategories of going beyond and practising differently. Going beyond consists of two components, being Maori and enduring constant challenge that set the philosophical foundation to practice. Practising differently describes three key components as kaitiaki of wairua, it?s about whanau and connecting each are blended into each other and fused into nursing practice. The impressions of the Maori mental health nurses have been interpreted and explained by this theory. The substantive grounded theory provides a model to guide health services appreciation of Maori mental health nurses, for professional development of Maori mental health nurses and to policy writers.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori nurses</field><field name="subject">mental health nurses</field><field name="subject">nursing practice</field><field name="subject">Maori concepts</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321100 Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1043</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A small drop of ink, falling like dew : an investigation into the process of interpreting the written word into an illustration : a thesis presented in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Education at Massey University, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">McAuley, Michael</field><field name="description">This investigation&#8217;s origin is one born of pragmatism. It seeks to improve the teaching and learning of illustration, a visual communication design discipline. The specific focus is text adaptation and the process involved in interpreting the written word into a visual image. Common characteristics of poor interpretation, identified after many years of teaching illustration, are the creation of images which are either based on relatively insignificant details from a text, or so removed from a text&#8217;s theme, that decoding an image&#8217;s intended meaning becomes extremely difficult. This study therefore seeks to provide insight into the process of interpreting written text into an illustration and offer some suggestions as to how novice illustration students can improve their skills in this process. The chosen methodology of this study is action research, and within a constructivistinterpretivist framework, work carried out with three groups of novice students, during three linked cycles of investigation has been analysed. Two separate, but linked learning strategies were developed incrementally. These can be thought of as thinking tools. The first one relates to comprehension of text while the second strategy focuses on analogical reasoning as an idea generation method. The data suggests that these learning strategies were successful, allowing students to develop more awareness of their design process and also create concepts which captured the essence of a text. This suggests that, while designing does involve tacit, intuitive thought, explicit methods of thinking can also assist design creativity. Much of the literature on design suggests that a paradigm shift is taking place within the field, in education as well as design practice. One of the characteristics of this change is a call for design educators to develop an epistemology of what constitutes design knowledge. This thesis is an addition to that ongoing search for understanding.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">illustration study and teaching</field><field name="subject">visual communication design</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330200 Curriculum Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1046</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Efficacy of cognitive behavioural therapy for clients who have sustained a traumatic brain injury (TBI) : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Psychology at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Christianson, Muriel Katherine</field><field name="description">While the focus of rehabilitation following traumatic brain injury (TBI) is often on management of physical and cognitive impairments, emotional and behavioural changes in the person with the injury may represent major hurdles in adjustment following injury. Mood, anxiety and adjustment disorders are common following TBI. A manualised cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) treatment programme was developed that incorporated provision of education on consequences of TBI, used cognitive and behavioural strategies to recognise and manage emotional reactions to injury, and promoted achievement of personal goals. Participants were nine people with TBI referred to Massey University Psychology Clinic Wellington, for psychotherapy to assist in managing symptoms of psychological distress or adjustment difficulties following injury. Measures used included the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) to monitor progress in reduction of symptoms of Anxiety and Depression; the Patient Competency Rating Scale (PCRS) to assess competency across areas of day-to-day living; and the Homework Rating Scale Second Edition (HRS-II) to assess the value of homework assignments for participants. Results were presented graphically in group format and in the form of individual case studies outlining progress in achieving individual goals. There was considerable variation in the responses of participants to treatment. When anxiety and depression were secondary to other referral issues such as fatigue and pain that remained high over treatment sessions, there was limited movement on HADS Anxiety and Depression scores. The small number of participants impacted on the ability to detect differences between Patient and Informant ratings on the PCRS or to demonstrate increased levels of awareness over treatment sessions. Consistent completion of Homework assignments proved difficult for participants. Factors that impacted on achievement of personal goals included ongoing levels of fatigue and pain, levels of personal expectation, interpersonal and organisational skills, insight into emotional reactions, and good family and social support. There is a part for a CBT approach in adjusting to changes following TBI, particularly in assisting with reassessing expectations following injury.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cognitive behavioural therapy</field><field name="subject">CBT</field><field name="subject">brain damage patients rehabilitation</field><field name="subject">traumatic brain injury</field><field name="subject">TBI</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380107 Health, clinical and counselling psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1044</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lineage specific evolution and phylogenetic analysis : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Biomathematics at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Grievink, Liat Shavit</field><field name="description">Phylogenetic models generally assume a homogeneous, time reversible, stationary process. These assumptions are often violated by the real, far more complex, evolutionary process. This thesis is centered on non-homogeneous, lineage-specific, properties of molecular sequences. It consist several related but independent studies. LineageSpecificSeqgen, an extension to the Seq-Gen program, which allows generation of sequences with changes in the proportion of variable sites, is introduced. This program is then used in a simulation study showing that changes in the proportion of variable sites can hinder tree estimation accuracy, and that tree reconstruction under the best-fit model chosen using a relative test can result in a wrong tree. In this case, the less commonly used absolute model-fit was a better predictor of tree estimation accuracy. This study found that increased taxon sampling of lineages that have undergone a change in the proportion of variable sites was critical for accurate tree reconstruction and that, in contrast to some earlier findings, the accuracy of maximum parsimony is adversely affected by such changes. This thesis also addresses the well-known long-branch attraction artifact. A nonparametric bootstrap test to identify changes in the substitution process is introduced, validated, and applied to the case of Microsporidia, a highly reduced intracellular parasite. Microsporidia was first thought to be an early branching eukaryote, but is now believed to be sister to, or included within, fungi. Its apparent basal eukaryote position is considered a result of long-branch attraction due to an elevated evolutionary rate in the microsporidian lineage. This study shows that long-branch estimates and basal positioning of Microsporidia both correlate with increased proportions of radical substitutions in the microsporidian lineage. In simulated data, such increased proportions of radical substitutions leads to erroneous long-branch estimates. These results suggest that the long microsporidian branch is likely to be a result of an increased proportion of radical substitutions on that branch, rather than increased evolutionary rate per se. The focus of the last study is the intriguing case of Mesostigma, a fresh water green alga for which contradicting phylogenetic relationships were inferred. While some studies placed Mesostigma within the Streptophyta lineage (which includes land plants), others placed it as the deepest green algae divergence. This basal positioning is regarded as a result of long-branch attraction due to poor taxon sampling. Reinvestigation of a 13- taxon mitochondrial amino acid dataset and a sub-dataset of 8 taxa reveals that site sampling, and in particular the treatment of missing data, is just as important a factor for accurate tree reconstruction as taxon sampling. This study identifies a difficulty in recreating the long-branch attraction observed for the 8-taxon dataset in simulated data. The cause is likely to be the smaller number of amino acid characters per site in simulated data compared to real data, highlighting the fact that there are properties of the evolutionary process that are yet to be accurately modeled.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">molecular sequences</field><field name="subject">tree estimation accuracy</field><field name="subject">Microsporidia</field><field name="subject">long-branch attraction</field><field name="subject">Mesostigma</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::239900 Other Mathematical Sciences::239901 Biological Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1048</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Malignant hyperthermia: allele specific expression and mutation screening of the ryanodine receptor 1 : a dissertation presented to Massey University in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Biochemistry</field><field name="creator">Grievink, Hilbert</field><field name="description">Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a dominant skeletal muscle disorder caused by mutations in the ryanodine receptor skeletal muscle calcium release channel (RyR1). Allele-specific differences in RyR1 expression levels might provide insight into the observed incomplete penetrance and variations in MH phenotypes between individuals. Firstly, an H4833Y allele-specific PCR (AS-PCR) assay was designed that allowed for the relative quantification of the two RYR1 mRNA alleles in heterozygous samples. In four MHS skeletal muscle samples and two lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), the wild type allele was found to be expressed at higher levels than the mutant RyR1 allele. These differences were not caused by variations in RYR1 mRNA stabilities. Secondly, high-throughput amplicon sequencing was employed for the quantification of both the T4826I and H4833Y causative MH mutations in heterozygous MHS samples. With the exception of one, all detected H4833Y and T4826I mutation frequencies were about 50%. This included a control, which was constructed and proven to have a 3:1 ratio of the wild type (H4833) versus the mutant (Y4833) RYR1 allele. This suggested that that the high-throughput amplicon sequencing approach as used here, was not suitable for accurate quantification of the two RyR1 alleles in heterozygous H4833Y MHS samples. To detect possible variations in RyR1 alleles at the protein level, the RyR1 was to be isolated from microsomes prepared from a H4833Y MHS frozen skeletal muscle tissue. Microsomes isolated from MHS skeletal muscle tissues lacked the immunoreactive band that was believed to be the full length RyR1. Poor muscle quality, due to long term storage was believed to be the main cause of RyR1 depletion. Faster and less expensive screening methodologies are required for the identification of genetic variants in MH research. Thus, in an additional project inexpensive and high-throughput high-resolution melting (HRM) assays were developed to allow screening of the RYR1 gene, for mutations associated with MH and/or central core disease (CCD).</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">skeletal muscle disorder</field><field name="subject">RYR1 gene</field><field name="subject">mutant allele</field><field name="subject">genetic variants</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology::270101 Analytical biochemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1051</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of a natural plant extract and synthetic plant growth regulators on growth, quality and endogenous hormones of Actinidia chinensis and Actinidia deliciosa fruit : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Horticultural Science at Massey University, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Childerhouse, Emma</field><field name="description">Kiwifruit are of huge economic importance for New Zealand representing 29 percent of total horticultural exports. Fruit size is the biggest determinant of what consumers are willing to pay, and there is also a positive relationship between consumer preference for flavour and percentage dry matter. The two main cultivars exported from New Zealand are Actinidia chinensis &#8216;Hort 16A&#8217; (gold kiwifruit) and A. deliciosa &#8216;Hayward&#8217; (green kiwifruit). Under current commercial practice the only product allowed for use on kiwifruit to increase fruit size in New Zealand is Benefit&#174;. Benefit&#174; has been shown to induce different results when applied to A. chinensis and A. deliciosa, whereas synthetic plant growth regulators such as the cytokinin-like substance N-(2- chloro-4-pyridyl)-N&#8217;-phenylurea (CPPU) have been found to promote similar increases in fresh weight of fruit in both cultivars. Final fruit size is determined by both cell division and cell enlargement. It was been shown that fresh weight can be increased in both of the major Actinidia cultivars even though their physiology differs. Hormonal control of fruit size in relation to cell division and cell enlargement phases of fruit growth was studied in both A. chinensis and A. deliciosa. CPPU was applied to both cultivars in a growth response experiment where fruit were collected throughout the growing season. The objective of this experiment was to create growth curves, to compare and contrast the effect on A. chinensis and A. deliciosa, and to provide material for hormone analysis. Application of CPPU was found to significantly increase the fresh weight of both A. chinensis and A. deliciosa fruit (46.98 and 31.34 g increases respectively), and alter the ratio of inner and outer pericarps of A. chinensis fruit. CPPU and Benefit&#174; were applied individually and together to both cultivars. It was found that only A. chinesis fruit were affected by the application of Benefit&#174;; fresh weight was increased by 26.38 g, and percentage dry matter was significantly reduced. There was a statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05) interaction between CPPU and Benefit&#174; when applied to A. chinensis. 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridyloxyacetic acid (3,5,6-TPA) was applied to A. deliciosa on two application dates at three concentrations and was found to decrease fresh weight of fruit, but significantly increase percentage dry matter regardless of application date or concentration. Lastly CPPU and 1-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) were applied to A. deliciosa at two application dates and in all combinations. Application date affected the response to both a low concentration of CPPU and NAA. A synergistic interaction was observed when CPPU was applied early plus NAA late (CPPU early (4.53 g increase) plus NAA late (13.29 g) &lt; CPPU early plus NAA late (33.85 g). Finally endogenous hormone content was studied. Methods were developed and tested for the simultaneous analysis of both indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and cytokinins. Freeze dried fruit were purified using Waters Sep-pak&#174; cartridges and Oasis&#174; columns then IAA was quantified by high pressure liquid chromatography. Preliminary results indicate a correlation between application of CPPU and endogenous IAA, high concentrations of IAA correlated well with periods of rapid fruit growth particularly for CPPU treated fruit.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Kiwifruit</field><field name="subject">fruit growth</field><field name="subject">fresh fruit weight</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300200 Crop and Pasture Production::300203 Plant improvement (selection, breeding and genetic engineering)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1052</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Detection of behavioural and cognitive dysfunction in mucopolysaccharidosis IIIA affected dogs : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Veterinary Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Erceg, Vicki Heather</field><field name="description">This study investigated whether behavioural and cognitive dysfunction caused by mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) IIIA can be detected early in affected dogs&#8217; lives, and to describe the behaviours of these dogs. No other scientific papers have been published on this topic and the population of dogs examined in this study are the only MPS IIIA affected dog colony available worldwide for study. Three main tests were performed on the population of MPS IIIA affected dogs. Physical behavioural assessment tests were performed at six and eight weeks of age and from twenty weeks of age a cognitive function task was taught and then tested to measure the dogs&#8217; performance. A previously validated questionnaire, the canine behavioural assessment and research questionnaire (C-BARQ), was completed at three, six and twelve months of age. The researchers in these studies were blinded to the MPS IIIA status of the dogs examined. The behaviours shown by the MPS IIIA puppies at six and eight weeks of age were not significantly different from the behaviours of the unaffected puppies. This finding supported the research of other MPS IIIA studies and suggests that clinical behavioural changes do not occur at such a young age. The behaviours shown by the MPS IIIA affected puppies appeared to be normal puppy behaviours similar to those described in previous research on puppies. The C-BARQ measured the behaviours shown by the MPS IIIA affected and unaffected dogs. Most of the MPS IIIA affected dogs&#8217; behaviours were not significantly different from the unaffected dogs&#8217; behaviours, but MPS IIIA affected dogs did retrieve significantly more than unaffected dogs at three months of age, and were less distractible at twelve months of age. It would be worth investigating these findings further to decide whether it suggests a subtle alteration in brain functioning. The cognitive function test showed a significant decrease in the success of the MPS IIIA affected dogs in the final maze test. This is the first study on dogs affected with MPS IIIA to find a decline in cognitive function before the occurrence of cerebellar clinical signs and this new knowledge may lead to future developments measuring therapy response and disease progression. The T-shaped maze testing may be valuable in future research on cognitive function in dogs with other diseases such as epilepsy. Thus this thesis provides valuable information on canine MPS IIIA and provides a foundation for future disease investigations.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">behavioural assessment</field><field name="subject">cognitive function</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300500 Veterinary Medicine::300501 Veterinary medicine</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1053</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Female authors and their male detectives: the ideological contest in female-authored crime fiction : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in English at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Redmond, Robert Stanley</field><field name="description">In the nineteen-eighties a host of female detectives appeared in crime fiction authored by women. Ostensibly these detectives challenged hegemonic norms, but the consensus of opinion was that their appropriation of male values and adherence to conventional generic closures colluded with a gender system of male privilege. Academic interest in the work of female authors featuring male detectives was limited. Yet it can be argued that these texts could have the potential to disrupt the hegemonic order through the introduction, whether deliberately, or inadvertently, of a female counterpoint to the hegemony. The hypothesis I am advancing claims that the reconfiguration of male detectives in works authored by women avoids the visible contradictions of gender and genre that are characteristic of works featuring female detectives. However, through their use of disruptive performatives, these works allow scope for challenging normal gender practices&#8212;without damage to the genre. This hypothesis is tested by applying the performative theories of Judith Butler to a close reading of selected crime novels. Influenced by the theories of Austin, Lacan and Althusser, Butler&#8217;s concept of performativity claims that hegemonic notions of gender are a fiction. This discussion also uses Wayne Booth&#8217;s concept of the implied author as a means of distinguishing the performative agency of the text from that of the characters. Agatha Christie, P.D. James, and Donna Leon, each with their male detective heroes, come from different generations. A Butlerian reading illustrates their potential for disrupting gender norms. Of the three, however, only Donna Leon avoids the return to hegemonic control that is a feature of the genre. Christie&#8217;s women who have agency are inevitably eliminated, while conformist women are rewarded. James&#8217;s lead female character is never fully at ease in her professional role. When thrust into a leadership she proves herself to be competent, but not ready or desirous of the senior position. Instead her role is to mediate the transition of her junior, a male, to that position. Donna Leon is different. The moral and emotional content of her narratives suggests an implied author committed to ideological change. Her characters simultaneously renounce and collude with illusions of patriarchal authority, and could lay claim to be models for Butler&#8217;s notion of performative resistance.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gender in fiction</field><field name="subject">crime novels</field><field name="subject">gender norms</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420200 Literature Studies::420220 Comparative literature studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1057</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tourism as a poverty alleviation strategy: opportunities and barriers for creating backward economic linkages in Lang Co, Vietnam : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of requirements for the degree of Master of Philosophy in Development Studies at Massey University, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Redman, David F.</field><field name="description">This thesis looks at the potential for using tourism as a poverty alleviation strategy in the context of Vietnam and the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS). The theoretical basis for this research stems for the growing recognition within development rhetoric of the place of tourism as a key industry in many developing nations, and the formation of a Pro-Poor Tourism (PPT) approach. The fieldwork section of this thesis looks at the barriers and opportunities for those in the poorer communities of Lang Co, a small town on the cental east coast of Vietnam, to supply the burgeoning tourism industry with locally produced products that are compatible with their current livelihood strategies. Results show that there are many opportunities for the poor to benefit from the rapidly growing tourism industry in Vietnam and the region. There is a strong recognition of tourism in national and regional development strategies, there is a rich cultural, environmental and social context driving the tourism industry and there are several initiatives taking place, such as the Vietnamese National Tourism Law, which include many elements of pro-poor tourism principles. However, this thesis has found many barriers also prevent poorer people from benefiting from tourism. In the case of Lang Co, the poor were often limited in their ability to participate in the industry by debt and lack of access to credit, lack of education and training opportunities, a declining natural resource base and by a lack of awareness and participation in the planning of the tourism industry. More widely, the tourism industry is centrally driven and focused on high growth and large infrastructure type developments which in some cases conflict with the principles of PPT and the ability of people at the ground level to participate. This research highlights the complexity of attempting to use tourism as a poverty reduction strategy given the wide range of stakeholders involved and various levels involved the planning and implementation of the tourism industry. The potential applicability of a concept of pro-poor tourism in a rapidly changing context such as Vietnam is contingent of the ability of the poor to have influence on an industry which is having an increasing effect on their lives and livelihoods.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pro-poor tourism</field><field name="subject">poverty reduction</field><field name="subject">citizen participation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350500 Tourism</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1059</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparison of two ultrafiltration membrane systems for whole milk feta cheese production : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Technology in Food Technology at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Chollangi, Anusha</field><field name="description">Cheese is one of the most well known food products in the world dating back to the 8th century B.C. There are more than 2000 varieties of cheese that are manufactured all over the world. Feta cheese is a soft white cheese with a salty and slightly acidic taste, which has originated from Greece. Most of the feta cheese manufactured in Greece is consumed locally, the migration of greeks to other parts of the world led to a demand for feta cheese outside of Greece. The spreading of the popularity of feta cheese to other ethnic groups in different parts of the world resulted in the high demand for feta cheese worldwide. The modern and most efficient method of feta cheese production involves a membrane filtration method, known as ultrafiltration. The ultrafiltration process utilises pressure as a driving force to concentrate milk by removal of water and small dissolved molecules. Hollow fibre and spiral wound ultrafiltration membranes are the two types of membranes that are commonly used for cheese production. An extensive amount of research exists on the implementation of ultrafiltration to improve the efficiency of the cheese making process and the performance of the membranes. However, limited research has been conducted on the comparison of the hollow fibre and spiral wound membrane performance in the cheese making process. The objective of the research was to determine if the hollow fibre membranes used at Puhoi Valley Cheese can be replaced with spiral wound membranes without compromising the quality of cheese produced. In order to achieve the objective, feta cheese was produced using hollow fibre and spiral wound ultrafiltration pilot plants. The operating performances of the hollow fibre and spiral wound membrane units were compared. To ensure that the quality of cheese is maintained, the cheese manufactured on the pilot plant units was analysed in terms of composition, microbiology, texture and sensory properties. The cheese made using the hollow fibre membrane pilot plant was compared with the reference sample from Puhoi Valley Cheese as they use hollow fibre membranes to produce feta cheese. The cheese made from the spiral wound membrane unit was also compared to that made by the hollow fibre membrane pilot plant unit. The operating parameters such as the inlet and outlet pressure, pressure difference along the membrane, transmembrane pressure, flow rate, recycle rate (bleed off rate), temperature and the run time were recorded. The operating parameters of the hollow fibre and spiral wound runs were compared with the data from Puhoi Valley Cheese. The quality of cheese made on the hollow fibre and spiral wound pilot plant units were evaluated in terms of composition, texture, microbiology and sensory properties. The composition was defined by the fat, protein, total solids and salt contents. The fat content was determined by utilising the modified Schmid-Bondzynski-Ratzlaff method, protein by the Kjeldahl method, total solids by using the air drying oven and salt percentage by the volhard method. The texture of the cheese was determined by the fracturability and hardness from the compression curve generated using the single bite compression test. The microbiological testing was performed according to New Zealand testing methods for E.Coli, Staphylococcus aureus, coliforms and yeast and mould. The difference from the control method was utilised for sensory evaluation. The acid degree value method was used to determine the lipase activity in feta cheese. It was found from the composition, texture and sensory analysis that the cheese from the hollow fibre pilot plant was different from the cheese manufactured at Puhoi Valley Cheeses (PVC). The spiral wound cheeses were also found to be different to PVC cheese, however the spiral wound cheeses and the pilot plant hollow fibre cheese were the same. The differences between both the pilot plant cheeses and PVC cheese were in terms of the fat, salt, moisture contents and the lipase activity in the cheeses. The fat content in the hollow fibre and spiral wound pilot plant cheeses are lower in comparison to the PVC cheese. This difference in fat content is considered to be due to the difference in the fat to protein ratio of the milk concentrated on the pilot plant and the PVC ultrafiltration system. The lower fat content resulted in firmer cheese than PVC due to more cross linking between the protein strands in cheese. The salt content in the cheeses made using the hollow fibre and spiral wound pilot plants was lower than Puhoi Valley Cheese. This is considered to be due to the low ratio of brine volume to cheese volume used for salting the cheese. The salt content of brine decreases during brining; hence a low ratio of brine volume to cheese volume causes a significant decrease in brine concentration. The decrease in brine concentration decreases the salt intake of the cheese. As salt diffuses in the moisture diffuses out, lower salt content results in higher moisture content in the cheese. As mentioned, the moisture content of the hollow fibre pilot plant cheese was higher than the PVC cheese. The moisture content is inversely proportional to the total solids, hence higher moisture in pilot plant cheeses implies lower total solids than the PVC cheese. The lipase activity results showed that the hollow fibre and spiral wound pilot plant cheeses had higher lipase activity than the Puhoi valley cheese. The differences in lipase activity of the pilot plant cheeses and Puhoi Valley cheese were considered to be due to the incomplete inactivation of lipase present in milk during pasteurisation. The results from texture and sensory evaluation support the above mentioned differences. The microbiology results for all pilot plant cheeses were within the trigger limits set by Puhoi valley cheeses. The results from monitoring the operating parameters of both the pilot plant data show that the permeate flux decreases while the total solids in milk increase with time, which was also observed from the Puhoi Valley Cheese data. However, the rate of decrease of the permeate flux and the increase of the total solids in milk are dependent on the membrane area, feed volume, transmembrane pressure, pressure drop across the membrane and the flow characteristics. The rate of decrease in permeate flux and the rate of increase in the total solids of the hollow fibre runs and spiral wound runs are slightly different. The difference is due to the availability of larger membrane surface area and processing of larger feed volume of milk in the spiral wound runs. The transmembrane pressure and the pressure drop across the membrane were maintained as close as possible to Puhoi Valley Cheese. In conclusion, spiral wound membranes can be used to achieve the desired total solids concentration and successfully make the same feta cheese as the hollow fibre pilot plant. In order to make the same quality of feta cheese as Puhoi Valley Cheese using the spiral wound membrane pilot plant, the same composition of milk used for concentration at Puhoi Valley Cheese needs to be used on the spiral wound pilot plant unit. It is recommended that Puhoi Valley Cheeses should be replaced with spiral wound membranes if they are more economical in terms of cost than the hollow fibre membranes.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ultrafiltration process</field><field name="subject">cheese production</field><field name="subject">Puhoi Valley Cheese</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290103 Food processing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1060</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of Leucocytozoon in the endangered yellow-eyed penguin (Megadyptes antipodes) : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Veterinary Science at Massey University, Turitea, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Hill, Andrew Gordon</field><field name="description">Yellow-eyed penguins have suffered major population declines and periodic mass mortality without an established cause. On Stewart Island a high incidence of regional chick mortality was associated with infection by a novel Leucocytozoon sp. The prevalence, structure and molecular characteristics of this leucocytozoon sp. were examined in the 2006-07 breeding season. In 2006-07, 100% of chicks (n=32) on the Anglem coast of Stewart Island died prior to fledging. Neonates showed poor growth and died acutely at approximately 10 days old. Clinical signs in older chicks up to 108 days included anaemia, loss of body condition, subcutaneous ecchymotic haemorrhages and sudden death. Infected adults on Stewart Island showed no clinical signs and were in good body condition, suggesting adequate food availability and a potential reservoir source of ongoing infections. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) survey of blood samples from the South Island, Stewart and Codfish Island found Leucocytozoon infection exclusively on Stewart Island. The prevalence of Leucocytozoon infection in yellow-eyed penguin populations from each island ranged from 0-2.8% (South Island), to 0-21.25% (Codfish Island) and 51.6-97.9% (Stewart Island). The high prevalence on Stewart Island represented the infection of 100% of chicks and 83% of adult yellow-eyed penguins when tested by PCR. Sequencing of Leucocytozoon sp. DNA found similarities between infections in yellow-eyed penguin adults and chicks, but differences to Leucocytozoon sp. DNA obtained from Fiordland crested penguins. These findings support the suggestion of cross infection between adults and chicks, and indicate that endemic infection in yellow-eyed penguins is unrelated to that in Fiordland crested penguins. Examination by histology and electron microscopy showed tissue megaloschizonts and circulating round gametocytes. Megaloschizonts up to 440&#181;m diameter showed an affinity for hepatic and splenic tissue and were observed releasing occasional intact cytomeres. Round gametocytes were observed within leucocytes in visceral sections, but not peripheral blood smears. The morphology of Leucocytozoon sp. in yellow-eyed penguins showed similarities to the pathogenic species L. simondi and L. sakharoffi but not L. tawaki. A successful treatment protocol for leucocytozoonosis has not been established, although treatment in a Fiordland crested penguin was able to suppress parasitaemia. The role of Leucocytozoon in yellow-eyed penguins as a cause of morbidity and mortality remains unclear. Further investigation into direct pathogenicity, and the interaction of concurrent disease and environmental influences is required. The findings of this thesis provide potential management recommendations and highlight areas requiring further investigation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mass mortality</field><field name="subject">endemic infection</field><field name="subject">Stewart Island</field><field name="subject">leucocytozoonosis</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300500 Veterinary Medicine::300503 Epidemiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1063</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An examination of culture as a protective mechanism against gender based violence: a case study in Mt Bosavi, Papua New Guinea : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Philosophy (Development Studies), Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Dogimab, Mirriam Adang</field><field name="description">Development literature has not accorded sufficient attention to culture as a positive aspect of development until recently. Hence, in terms of using culture as a protective mechanism against gender-based violence, not much has been investigated or reported, since most studies on gender-based violence have focused more on cultural influences as the cause or effect of violence against women. However, in the case of Papua New Guinea (PNG) culture has always been the focus in regards to genderbased violence, portrayed as the cause of violence against women. Occasionally sources state there are traditional customs or beliefs that protect women from violence, but further explanation is not provided. Hence, this research investigated the question, &#8220;How can culture address gender-based violence in contemporary, rural Papua New Guinea?&#8221; This study offers an opportunity to view PNG culture as a solution to a problem, instead of as merely a problem to be solved. To investigate how culture can be used positively as a strategy to address genderbased violence, a case study was conducted among the Sulamesi people of Mt Bosavi in the Southern highlands province of PNG. This research was conducted in a rural area because in general Papua New Guineans perceive people living in the villages as the ones living a traditional lifestyle, where established cultural norms and behaviours prevail. Using a qualitative research approach, the research investigated whether there were any traditional protective mechanisms in PNG used to address gender-based violence. This thesis concludes that through the identification of culture-driven protective mechanisms, it can be demonstrated that culture can be used as a strategy to address gender based violence. However, caution must be applied, since not all the protective mechanisms identified are desirable or constructive.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cultural influences</field><field name="subject">Sulamesi people</field><field name="subject">cultural norms</field><field name="subject">cultural behaviours</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370400 Human Geography::370402 Social and cultural geography</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1064</field></doc><doc><field name="title">When all roads lead to Rome: expatriate adjustment in a United Nations Organisation : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Organisational Psychology at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Caie, Linda Jayne Nelson</field><field name="description">Studies of expatriate adjustment have traditionally focused on corporate expatriate assignments where foreign employees are often the only expatriate, or one of a handful in a host organisation. Multicultural not-for-profit organisations such as United Nations organisations have largely been ignored. It was hypothesised that classic predictors of expatriate adjustment &#8211; Spousal Adjustment, Culture Novelty and Acculturation Style, and novel variables of Economic Adjustment and Stage in Assignment would predict Expatriate Adjustment and subsequent Cognitions to Withdraw prematurely from the assignment. 181 expatriates representing 38 countries from all economic levels completed an online survey investigating their experiences on assignment to a United Nations Organisation in Rome, Italy. Black &amp; Stephens (1989) classic scales of Expatriate Adjustment, Spousal Adjustment, Culture Novelty and Cognitions to Withdraw were employed along with Acculturation Style, Economic Adjustment and Stage in Assignment measures designed for this study. Qualitative data was also collected around expatriates&#8217; cognitions to withdraw from their assignment and reasons to stay in order to gain a richer understanding of the expatriate experience. The best predictors of Expatriate Adjustment and subsequent Cognitions to Withdraw for United Nations expatriate employees in Rome were classic predictor Culture Novelty and novel predictors Economic Adjustment and Stage in Assignment. Structural Equation Modelling indicated the best fitting model of Expatriate Adjustment and subsequent Cognitions to Withdraw demonstrated moderate fit (!2 = 1045.19, df = 486, p =.000, TLI = .80, CFI = .82, RMSEA = .08) with Culture Novelty predicting General and Interaction Adjustment; Economic Adjustment predicting General Adjustment; and Adjustment Stage predicting General, Interaction and Work Adjustment. General Adjustment was the only significant predictor of Cognitions to Withdraw. Qualitative analysis suggested that the classic adjustment measures used did not adequately capture the experiences of these expatriates and that caution should be taken in generalising the literature to not-for-profit populations. Furthermore the outcomes of this study suggest that the inclusion of novel variables of Economic Adjustment and Stage in Assignment as predictors of expatriate adjustment could be warranted for future research. Sample size and adequacy of measures both limited the extent to which analysis could be conducted and results generalised. More research into the expatriate experience in the not-for-profit sector is desperately needed.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">non-profit organisations</field><field name="subject">expatriates</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380108 Industrial and organisational psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1065</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Elder care, self-employed women and work-family balance: an exploration using work-family border theory : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Business Studies in Human Resource Management at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Bourke, Josephine Emily</field><field name="description">Despite work-life balance being an area of interest to many researchers, there is little reference to any effects related specifically to elder care. Current demographics indicate that the proportion of elderly in the community is increasing, and with greater workforce participation (particularly among women workers) the availability of family caregivers is less guaranteed. Women are more likely to be responsible for elder care, and as they seek to manage their work and life, are also more likely to seek workplace flexibility, sometimes through self-employment. The effect that elder care may be having on the work-life balance of self-employed women is the focus of this research project. Using work-family border theory as a lens, this research documented the effect that elder care had on the lives of a group of self-employed women who also had elder care responsibilities. Eight women from the Wellington region participated in this research, which was carried out from a broadly phenomenological perspective. Each participant shared information, using a case study approach, about their business and elder care responsibilities. The results of this research indicate the profound effect of emotions in the elder care situation, and also the effect of expectations from others whose influences affected the ability of the participants to achieve work-life balance.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">work-life balance</field><field name="subject">care of the elderly</field><field name="subject">family caregivers</field><field name="subject">self-employed women</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1066</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spatial pattern in macroinvertebrate communities in headwater streams of New Zealand and a multivariate river classification system : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Ecology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Chakraborty, Manas</field><field name="description">Macroinvertebrate data collected from 120 headwater streams in New Zealand were used to test the ability of the Freshwater Environments of New Zealand River Classification (FWENZ) to explain spatial variation in unimpacted stream invertebrate communities. FWENZ is a GIS based multivariate river environment classification of the sections of national river network. The classification performance of the FWENZ was examined to determine the optimum classification level which could be used for the purpose of conservation and biomonitoring of New Zealand rivers and streams. The classification performance of the FWENZ was also compared to those of two other river classification systems, the ecoregions and the River Environment Classification (REC). Results of the analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) test showed that discrimination of the study sites based on interclass differences in macroinvertebrate community composition was optimal at FWENZ 100 class level which classifies the New Zealand rivers and streams into 100 different groups. The FWENZ 100 class level distinguished the biological variation of the study sites at a finer spatial scale than the REC Geology level. Although performance of the ecoregions classification was stronger than both the river environmental classifications, the REC and the FWENZ, but it was unable to explain the variation in local assemblage structures. Multivariate analyses of the macroinvertebrate abundance data and the associated environmental variables at three different spatial scales (upstream catchment, segment, and reach) were used to identify environmental predictors of assemblage patterns. Catchmentscale measures of climatic, topographic and landcover factors were more strongly correlated with macroinvertebrate community structures than segment scale measures, whereas reachscale measures of instream physicochemical factors and riparian characteristics had the least association with assemblage patterns. Despite the strong influences of cathment-scale factors on macroinvertebrate communities, local factors like water temperature, stream velocity, reach elevation, percent canopy cover and percent moss cover were also involved in explaining the within-region variation in assemblage patterns, which indicates the importance of considering regional as well as local factors as surrogates of stream invertebrate communities to provide a base for stream bioassessment programmes at multiple scales.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Freshwater Environments of New Zealand</field><field name="subject">FWENZ</field><field name="subject">biomonitoring</field><field name="subject">River Environment Classification</field><field name="subject">bioassessment</field><field name="subject">assemblage patterns</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science::300802 Wildlife and habitat management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1067</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The days of our lives: deep acting, surface acting and actors' health : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Psychology at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Green, Mike</field><field name="description">Although emotional labour has been studied extensively among work populations such as doctors, detectives and adventure tourism guides, there has been no known research on the psychology of actors and acting within an emotional labour framework. This investigation had two purposes. The first was to extend what is currently known about two emotional labour strategies: surface acting, the regulation of observable expressions of emotions, and deep acting, the regulation of felt emotions, to include actual actors. The dependent variables used in this study were job and life satisfaction. The second purpose was to examine whether having a sense of community moderated the relationship between surface acting, deep acting and the dependent variables. Responses from 89 professional, amateur and community theatre actors were analysed. Pearson&#8217;s correlation coefficients showed a significant relationship between surface acting and the dependent variables. Hierarchical regression results showed a significant moderation effect for sense of community on the relationship between deep acting and life satisfaction.

These relationships were also tested via two alternative transactional models, with a sequential and simultaneous structure for the appraisal and coping processes. Employees (N = 297) from a range of large New Zealand organisations completed a questionnaire on hardiness, appraisal, coping, affect and the three distal outcomes. Bivariate correlations revealed significant positive relationships between hardiness and job satisfaction, hardiness and performance, and a significant negative relationship with intention to turnover. Structural equation modelling results revealed that the direct relationship between hardiness and job satisfaction was the strongest path, which indicates that the higher an employees level of hardiness the higher their likely level of job satisfaction. The simultaneous model provided best fit to the data, revealing a positive path from hardiness through challenge appraisals to positive affect, and a negative path through threat appraisal and emotion-focused coping. This study concludes that higher levels of hardiness are associated with more positive situational appraisals and more effective coping responses.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">job satisfaction</field><field name="subject">coping processes</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380108 Industrial and organisational psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1069</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Engaging practices : re-thinking narrative exhibition development in light of narrative scholarship : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of Arts in Museum Studies at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Lambert, Stephanie Jane McKinnon</field><field name="description">This thesis bridges narrative theory and the practice of developing narrative exhibitions in museums. It aims to show how an understanding of narrative theory provides a dynamic context for evaluating ongoing exhibition practices and adapting them to changing attitudes and aspirations. For practitioners within the museum sector it introduces a rich body of previously under-utilised scholarship along with a method of interfacing it with museum practice. The idea of deriving ideas for museums from other sectors is not new. Museums increasingly embraced narrative in the 1980s after seeing its value in attracting audiences to film, theatre and theme-parks. Then it was assumed that what was relevant in one sector would be equally relevant in another. However, the interim upsurge of Media Studies suggests that rigorous examination of how each medium operates is necessary in order to identify similar constraints and affordances before scholarship from one area of practice can be appropriately applied in another sector. In opening a path for museum practitioners to gain insight from narrative practitioners in other sectors, the thesis intends also to open the way for knowledge to flow from the discipline of museum studies out into other areas of narrative practice, where cross-disciplinary approaches have already gained ground. At the outset, a context is established through a review of narrative literature. Two different approaches are used. Firstly a broad review of different ways to approach narrative is carried out and a typology of narrative is developed. Secondly commonalities are identified between narrative in exhibitions and narrative practice in other media. Exhibition practices are then described in detail, focusing on experience at the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, where research was enriched by in-depth interviews with exhibition development staff. Te Papa&#8217;s development of narrative exhibitions is traced, and two case studies demonstrate how their model is put into practice to achieve narrative delivery within the museum galleries. For museum professionals and narrative practitioners in other fields, this thesis provides an opportunity to examine processes of narrative delivery against a backdrop of theory. It makes a useful link between the museum sector and other areas of narrative practice.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">museum exhibition practices</field><field name="subject">narrative theory</field><field name="subject">narrative practice</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Te Papa museum</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::419900 Other Arts::419999 The arts not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1082</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards a better understanding of the polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase from Ralstonia eutropha : protein engineering and molecular biometrics : a thesis presented to Massey University in partial fulfilment of the requirement for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Microbiology</field><field name="creator">Jahns, Anika Carolin</field><field name="description">Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are polyesters composed of (R)-3-hydroxy-fatty acids. A variety of gram-positive as well as gram-negative bacteria and some archaea are able to produce these biopolymers as energy and carbon storage materials. In times of unbalanced growth, when carbon is available in excess but other nutrients are limited, PHA inclusions are formed. These granules are water-insoluble, stored intracellularly and can be maintained outside the cell as beads. The key enzyme for the formation of PHA inclusions is the PHA synthase PhaC, which catalyses the polymerization of (R)- 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA to PHA with the concomitant release of CoA. The PHA synthase from Ralstonia eutropha (currently Cupriavidus necator), which is covalently bound to the PHA granule surface, tolerates fusions to its N terminus without loss of activity. In this study it was investigated if it would also tolerate translational fusions to its C terminus. A specially designed linker was employed, aiming at maintaining the hydrophobic surroundings of the R. eutropha synthase C terminus to allow proper folding and activity. Two reporter proteins were tested as fusion partners, the maltose binding protein MalE and the green fluorescent protein GFP. As GFP is a hydrophobic protein itself, no additional linker between the PHA synthase and the reporter protein was necessary to produce PHA granules displaying the functional fusion protein on the surface. Principally, the PHA synthase PhaC tolerates translational fusions to its C terminus but the nature of the fusion partner influences the functionality. Recently, PHA granules have often been acknowledged as bio-beads. A one-step production allows the formation of functionalised beads without the need for further cross-linking to impart desired surface properties. PHA beads displaying a gold- or silica-binding peptide at the N terminus of PhaC were constructed and tested for their applicability. Additionally, these beads were able to bind IgG due to the ZZ domain of the IgG binding protein A, which was employed as a linker sequence. These functionalised beads can be used as molecular tools in bioimaging and biomedicine, combining organic core with inorganic-binding shell structures. In a different biomimetic approach, the display of ten lysine residues at the granule surface was achieved using the phasin protein PhaP as the anchoring matrix. Extensive work was performed in an attempt to also employ the synthase protein, but was unsuccessful. These positively charged bio-beads can be used for dispersion or crosslinking experiments as well as silica binding.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">PHA granules</field><field name="subject">bio-beads</field><field name="subject">polyesters</field><field name="subject">biopolymers</field><field name="subject">Ralstonia eutropha</field><field name="subject">PHA synthase</field><field name="subject">molecular biomimetics</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290105 Other industrial biotechnology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1081</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The genesis and early evolution of New Zealand income tax : an examination of Governer Fitzroy's experiments with taxation, 1843-1845 : a thesis presented in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Economics, Massey University, Turitea Campus, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Heagney, Kevin John</field><field name="description">This thesis focuses on the genesis and development of direct taxation in early New Zealand. During the study period (1843-45), both taxpayers and tax were new to the colonial settlement and this study traces the early history of the two trying to accommodate each other. Between 1843 and 1845, subject to the politics of tax, the fiscal future of the colony was decided. The thesis begins by contextualising the study. It critically examines the revenue and expenditure record of the Crown Colony period and then details the antecedents of New Zealand fiscal policy in general and specifically tax policy (our shared English heritage). Thereafter, four interesting events in New Zealand tax law are discussed: (1) Schedule E of the British Land and Income Tax Act, 1842 (arrived in New Zealand 1843); (2) The Property Rate Ordinance, 1844; (3) the proposed Amendment to the Property Rate Ordinance, 1844; and, (4) the proposed Dealers&#8217; Licensing Ordinance in 1845. After analysing the period&#8217;s individual direct tax laws, the thesis elaborates on the political process which determined the development of this body of tax laws. Thereafter, the thesis develops a conceptual model to explain the tax reform process of the study period. The thesis finds that tax policy during the study period was driven by four key influences: crisis (internal/external and economic); political considerations; the application of sound nineteenth-century economic policy; and importantly, the precedent of another nation&#8217;s experience with tax policy development. To have knowledge of such events in economic history (the past record of tax law), how and why they occurred, matters. Just as a nation&#8217;s financial accounts are built on the foundations of the previous fiscal year, future taxation policy will be based on current taxation policy; tax laws which were developed from past (historic) tax practices. Therefore, knowledge of how New Zealand formulated tax policy in the past and why it did so, is of interest to fiscal policy makers today. Future tax policy is simply a derivation of past tax laws; the development of New Zealand&#8217;s taxation policy began in New South Wales in 1839, and thereafter began, what this thesis suggests, was a predictable, evolutionary process.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">income tax</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">Governor Fitzroy</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics::340300 Economic History and History of Economic Thought::340301 Economic history</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1076</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Applying marketing theory in educational settings : a study of communication processes within school-based health promotions : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Hawkins, Jacinta Carol</field><field name="description">School-based health promotions targeted at improving nutrition and increasing physical activity are seen by governments and public health experts as integral to reducing obesity among children even though such promotions often produce disappointing results. This mixed methods research involving six case schools explored the application of marketing theory in educational settings and postulates that marketing communications processes are relevant when facilitating school-based health promotions. The research intention was to determine the impact of communication processes on the implementation of school-based health promotions by investigating children&#8216;s exposure to promotions and outcomes of promotions. Hence stakeholder perceptions and expectations of promotions were analysed. Additionally, communication enhancers and inhibitors for promotions were identified and communication approaches used by Health Promoting Schools (HPS) were compared with those used by non-HPS. Principals and teachers were interviewed to discover selection, implementation and health promotion outcomes while parents were surveyed about the influence of school-based health promotions on their children&#8216;s eating and exercise behaviours. Children participated in focus groups to determine their perceptions of health promotions, issues and behaviours. Data were analysed using a blended models framework combining best practice principles from marketing communications theory and behavioural theory. The framework was used to explore communication processes within school-based health promotions and behavioural outcomes of those promotions. It was discovered, first, that government policy and community priorities impact upon which health messages are promoted and why. Second, it was found stakeholder roles and relationships impact upon when and where health is promoted and by whom. Third, the extent to which health concepts are integrated into school life highlighted the importance of how health is promoted. Finally, it was established that communication processes and related behaviours, which take place within different environmental contexts, are influenced by communication noise, the skills and abilities of parents and children, and environmental conditions. Future research directions include examining how health priorities of school communities can be combined into a shared vision for health promotions. Clarifying stakeholder roles and examining formation, strength and success characteristics of stakeholder relationships in health promotions is a possibility too. Exploring the HPS initiative and environmental influences on healthy behaviours also warrants further investigation.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">educational health promotions</field><field name="subject">marketing communications processes</field><field name="subject">school children</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1071</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Crystallographic determination of wild type, mutant and substrate-analogue inhibited structures of bacterial members of a family of superoxide dismutases : submitted as part of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, Institute of Fundamental Sciences, Chemistry, Massey University, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Oakley, Simon Hardie</field><field name="description">The iron and manganese superoxide dismutases are a family of metallo-enzymes with highly conserved protein folds, active sites and dimer interfaces. They catalyse the elimination of the cytotoxic free radical superoxide to molecular oxygen and hydrogen peroxide by alternate reduction then oxidation of the activesite with the concomitant transfer of protons from the solvent. There are many key aspects of enzymatic function that lack a structural explanation. The focus of this study is on three crystal structures. The iron-substituted manganese superoxide dismutase from Escherichia coli complexed with azide, a substrate-mimicking inhibitor, was solved to 2.2 &#197;. This &#8220;wrong&#8221; metal form shows a binding pattern seen previously in the manganese superoxide dismutase from Thermus thermophilus. Wild-type manganese specific superoxide dismutase from the extremophile Deinococcus radiodurans was solved to 2.0 &#197; and has an active site reminiscent of other solved manganese superoxide dismutases despite a lack of product inhibition. The azide-inhibited manganese superoxide dismutase from Deinococcus radiodurans was determined to a resolution of 2.0 &#197; and showed binding of azide, and by inference superoxide, different to that seen in Thermus thermophilus, but reminiscent of that seen in azide-inhibited iron superoxide dismutases. These results indicate that the azide ion, and by inference superoxide, bind to the metal centre of manganese superoxide dismutases in two modes, and transition between the two modes may be entropy dependent. These structures, integrated with knowledge from other structures, known biochemistry and various spectra, provide insight into catalytic function. An outer-sphere mechanism of proton transfer that does not rely on through-peptide proton uptake is proposed and compared to a previously proposed inner-sphere mechanism. This is based on the observation that a water molecule moves into the active site of the manganese superoxide dismutase from Deinococcus radiodurans upon azide binding, providing a Gr&#246;tthus pathway for rapid proton transfer to the active site from the bulk solvent. Also presented in this study are the partially refined structures of four point mutants (S82T, L83M, L133V, and M164L/L166V) of the manganese superoxide dismutase from Escherichia coli all solved to roughly 2 &#197; resolution, designed to investigate product inhibition which varies across species.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">crystal structures</field><field name="subject">azide</field><field name="subject">catalytic function</field><field name="subject">product inhibition</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences::250300 Organic Chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1072</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Enhancing the SME NPD process through customer focused design activities: a New Zealand case study</field><field name="creator">McIntyre, James</field><field name="description">Small to Medium Enterprises (SMEs) face enormous financial risk when embarking on a new product launch. SMEs are less likely to implement more formal risk minimization strategies for new product development (NPD) such as StageGate, often citing reasons of resource constraints or the more prevalent notion that &#8220;this stuff doesn&#8217;t apply to us&#8221;. Two key elements of any such risk minimization strategies are an early emphasis on benchmarking competitors and a thorough study of the attitudes and behaviours of potential customers. The SME&#8217;s investment of time and resource in early acquisition of this knowledge is a critical factor for success (Cooper 2001). Armed with this information, the SME is able to adopt a Customer Focused Design (CFD) strategy, whereby the product development effort is remains focused on the external customers wants and needs through all phases. SMEs that are able to satisfy these needs more effectively enjoy an obvious competitive advantage (Matzler and Hinterhuber 1998; L&#252;thje 2004). SMEs are often challenged by these tasks (Freel 2000; Larsen and Lewis 2007; Owens 2007). They may be overwhelmed by the prospect of expected costs, lack of expertise, and financial pressures to rush to market. Too often the more conventional path is chosen, whereby a solution is proposed, developed and tested in the market to &#8220;see if it sticks&#8221;. Such methodologies are less effective and subject the SME to increased financial risk. International studies of SMEs attitudes and behaviour towards NPD reveal common challenges of resource limitations, skills deficiencies and organizational issues (Xueli, Soutar et al. 2002; de Jong and Vermeulen 2006; Siu, Lin et al. 2006; Murphy and Ledwith 2007; Owens 2007). New Zealand firms are no exception, and are burdened with similar challenges as their international counterparts. This study aims to propose a simple framework for small firms who wish to acquire knowledge about their target markets and potential customers with limited time and resources. The framework enables SMEs to incorporate customer focused design principles into their product definition phase, and better orient themselves to the consumer marketplace. The study makes use of a New Zealand based case study to evaluate how the framework may be employed to identify quick and inexpensive efforts that can reproduce some elements of more sophisticated CFD and benchmarking methods. The obtained results are incorporated into a product design specification and embodied into a physical prototype to further illuminate the process. In addition to the primary area of study, prospects for new adjacent product lines and new potential markets for future development are also gained from the research.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">small business</field><field name="subject">new product development</field><field name="subject">market research</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1073</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structural and biochemical analysis of HutD from Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 : a thesis submitted in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Molecular Biosciences at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Liu, Yunhao</field><field name="description">Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 is a gram-negative soil bacterium capable of growing on histidine as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen. Expression of histidine utilization (hut) genes is controlled by the HutC repressor with urocanate, the first intermediate of the histidine degradation pathway, as the direct inducer. Recent genome sequencing of P. fluorescens SBW25 revealed the presence of hutD in the hut locus, which encodes a highly conserved hypothetical protein. Previous genetic analysis showed that hutD is involved in hut regulation, in such a way that it prevents overproduction of the hut enzymes. Deletion of hutD resulted in a slow growth phenotype in minimal medium with histidine as the sole carbon and nitrogen source. While the genetic evidence supporting a role of hutD in hut regulation is strong, nothing is known of the mechanism of HutD action. Here I have cloned and expressed the P. fluorescens SBW25 hutD in E. coli. Purified HutD was subjected to chemical and structural analysis. Analytic size-exclusion chromatography indicated that HutD forms a dimer in the elution buffer. The crystal structure of HutD was solved at 1.80 &#197; (R = 19.3% and Rfree = 22.3%) by using molecular replacement based on HutD from P. aeruginosa PAO1. P. fluorescens SBW25 HutD has two molecules in an asymmetric unit and each monomer consists of one subdomain and two &#223;-barrel domains. Comparative structural analysis revealed a conserved binding pocket. The interaction of formate with a highly conserved residue Arg61 via salt-bridges in the pocket suggests HutD binds to small molecules with carboxylic group(s) such as histidine, urocanate or formyl-glutamate. The hypothesis that HutD functions via binding to urocanate, the hut inducer, was tested. Experiments using a thermal shift assay and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) analysis suggested that HutD binds to urocanate but not to histidine. However, the signal of HutD-urocanate binding was very weak and detected only at high urocanate concentration (53.23 mM), which is not physiologically relevant. The current data thus does not support the hypothesis of HutD-urocanate binding in vivo. Although the HutD-urocanate binding was not confirmed, this work has laid a solid foundation for further testing of the many alternative hypotheses regarding HutD function.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">soil bacteria</field><field name="subject">histidine utilization</field><field name="subject">urocanate</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270300 Microbiology::270301 Bacteriology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1074</field></doc><doc><field name="title">High-pressure-induced starch gelatinisation and its application in a dairy system : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the Doctor of Philosophy in Food Science at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Oh, Hyunah Eustina</field><field name="description">This study investigated pressure-induced starch gelatinisation in water and milk suspensions. A rheological method, termed &#8216;pasting curves&#8217;, provided an objective and analytical means to determine the degree of pressure-induced starch gelatinisation. In addition, a polarised light microscope was used to observe birefringence of the starch granules and the degree of starch swelling was measured. The preliminary investigation into pressure-induced gelatinisation of six different starches showed that potato starch was the most pressure resistant and was not gelatinised after a pressure treatment of 600 MPa for 30 min at 20 &#176;C. Waxy rice, waxy corn and tapioca starches showed complete gelatinisation after the same treatment while normal rice and normal corn starches were only partially gelatinised despite the disappearance of birefringence. Based on the preliminary study, two starches (normal and waxy rice starches) were selected for more detailed studies. The effects of treatment conditions (pressure, temperature and duration) on the gelatinisation were investigated with these selected starches. The degree of gelatinisation was dependent on the type of starch and the treatment conditions. The results also indicated that different combinations of the treatment conditions (e.g. high treatment pressure for a short time and low treatment pressure for a longer time) could result in the same degree of gelatinisation. Both starch types exhibited sigmoidal-shaped pressure-induced gelatinisation curves and there was a linear correlation between the degree of swelling and the apparent viscosity of the starch suspension. After treatments at =500 MPa for 30 min at 20 &#176;C, both starches lost all birefringence although the apparent viscosity and the degree of swelling of normal rice starch did not increase to the same extent as observed in waxy rice starch. Pressure-induced gelatinisation of starch was retarded when starch was suspended in skim milk. This was attributed to the effect of soluble milk minerals and lactose present in the milk whereas milk proteins (casein and whey) did not affect the degree of gelatinisation at the levels present in 10% total solids skim milk. The presence of soluble milk and/or lactose may lead to less effective plasticising of starch chains by the suspension medium. Interactions between milk components and starch molecules may also play a role in retarding gelatinisation by reducing the mobility of starch chains. The functionality of starch in a dairy application was tested using acid milk gels as a model system. Skim milk with added starch (waxy rice or potato starch) was either pressure treated (500 MPa, 20&#176;C, 30 min) or heat treated (80&#176;C, 30 min) and subsequently acidified to form acid milk gels. The addition of waxy rice starch resulted in firmer acid milk gels, and increasing the amount of starch caused an increase in the firmness of both pressure-treated and heat-treated samples. However, pressure-treated samples with added potato starch did not show significant changes in the firmness whereas the heat-treated counterparts showed a marked increase in the firmness as the level of potato starch increased. The difference between the effects of the two different starches can be explained by the extent of starch gelatinisation in skim milk. Starch granules absorb water during gelatinisation whether induced by pressure or heat which effectively increases milk protein concentration in the aqueous phase to form a denser protein gel network on acidification. The firmness of acid milk gels can be increased by adjusting the pH at pressure or heat treatment to higher than the natural pH of milk. The effect of pH at pressure or heat treatment and addition of starch on the acid milk gel firmness was additive and independent of each other up to a starch addition level of 1%. This study provided an insight into pressure-induced gelatinisation of starch by showing gelatinisation properties of starches of different botanical origins and the effects of the treatment conditions (treatment pressure, treatment temperature and duration) on the degree of gelatinisation. Furthermore, the results from the pressure treatments of starch in dairy-based suspensions showed that pressure-induced gelatinisation was affected by other components in the system. These results demonstrate the importance of understanding the gelatinisation properties of starch in complicated food systems in which a number of other components are present. In terms of the application of starch in dairy systems, when starch was added to milk and gelatinised by pressure treatment, the acid milk gel produced by subsequent acidification was firmer than the acid milk gel made from skim milk alone.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">birefringence</field><field name="subject">skim milk</field><field name="subject">rice starch</field><field name="subject">potato starch</field><field name="subject">acid milk gel</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290103 Food processing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1075</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"The map, the navigator, and the explorer": evaluating the content and quality of CBT case conceptualization and the role of self-practice/self-reflection as a training intervention : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements of the Doctor of Philosophy in Psychology at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Haarhoff, Beverly Ann</field><field name="description">Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) leads the way as an evidenced based psychotherapy, and the evaluation of CBT training programs is increasingly seen as important if this position is to be maintained. In this dissertation, CBT case conceptualization, as a core psychotherapeutic competency, acquired in training, is evaluated. Case conceptualization, integrates precipitating, predisposing, maintaining, and protective factors, functioning as an explanatory and prescriptive roadmap for therapy. Gaining self-knowledge through exposure to some form of personal therapy is cited as important in gaining psychotherapeutic competency. Self-practice/ self-reflection, show promise as a form of personal therapy compatible with the principles of CBT. This study evaluates the content and quality of CBT case conceptualizations produced by a sample of 26 participants who have completed the Massey University Post Graduate Diploma, using three case conceptualization rating scales. In addition, the impact of a self-practice/self-reflection manualised training intervention designed to improve the quality of case conceptualization in trainee cognitive behaviour therapists, is explored using thematic analysis. The evaluation of the CBT conceptualizations showed predisposing factors and psychological mechanisms as receiving the most attention from participants. However, the majority of participants failed to pay attention to socio-cultural, biological, protective factors and factors pertaining to the therapeutic relationship. The majority of the participants were able to produce a 'good enough' CBT case conceptualization, however the &#8216;problem list&#8217; was not well developed, and the conceptually relevant aspects of the therapeutic relationship and protective factors were given less attention. The effect of a self-practice/self-reflection training intervention on the quality of CBT case conceptualizations produced by the intervention group (n = 16) drawn from the main participant sample, was qualitatively evaluated using thematic analysis. Theoretical understanding of the model, self awareness, empathy, conceptualization of the therapeutic relationship, adaptation of clinical interventions, and clinical practice were all subjectively perceived by participants to have increased as a result of the intervention. An inferential analysis compared the performance of the intervention group (n=16) that of a comparison group (n=10), made up of the remainder of the larger sample described in the context of the first question. The comparison group had not been exposed to the manualised intervention. The comparison was both within, and between the two groups. The quality of the intervention group showed an improvement on one of the rating scales, indicating a possible link between the training intervention and case conceptualization competency, however, the improvement was not replicated by the other two rating scales. The findings are discussed in the context of improving CBT training with regard to case conceptualization.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cognitive behaviour therapy</field><field name="subject">psychotherapy</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380107 Health, clinical and counselling psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1077</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Wireless vehicle presence detection using self-harvested energy : a thesis in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Engineering in Mechatronics, Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Noble, Frazer K.</field><field name="description">Rising from the &#8220;excess demand&#8221; modern societies and economies place on limited road resources, congestion causes increased vehicle emissions, decreases national efficiency, and wastes time (Downs, 2004). In order to minimise congestion&#8217;s impacts, traffic management systems gather traffic data and use it to implement efficient management algorithms (Downs, 2004). This dissertation&#8217;s purpose has been the development of a distributable vehicle presence detection sensor, which will wirelessly provide vehicle presence information in real time. To address the sensor&#8217;s wireless power requirements, the feasibility of self-powering the device via harvested energy has been investigated. Piezoelectric, electrostatic, and electromagnetic energy harvesting devices&#8217; principles of operation and underlying theory has been investigated in detail and an overview presented alongside a literature review of previous vibration energy harvesting research. An electromagnetic energy harvesting device was designed, which consists of: a nylon reinforced rubber bladder, hydraulic piston, neodymium magnets, and wire-wound coil housing. Preliminary testing demonstrated a harvested energy between 100mJ and 205mJ per axle. This amount is able to be transferred to a 100O load when driven over at speeds between 10km/h and 50km/h. Combined with an embedded circuit, the energy harvester facilitated the development of a passive sensor, which is able to wirelessly transmit a vehicle&#8217;s presence signal to a host computer. The vehicle detected event is displayed via a graphical user interface. Energy harvesting&#8217;s ability to power the embedded circuit&#8217;s wireless transmission, demonstrated the feasibility of developing systems capable of harvesting energy from their environment and using it to power discrete electronic components. The ability to wirelessly transmit a vehicle&#8217;s presence facilitates the development of distributable traffic monitoring systems, allowing for remote traffic monitoring and management.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">remote traffic monitoring</field><field name="subject">traffic data</field><field name="subject">self-powered device</field><field name="subject">wireless sensor nodes</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290900 Electrical and Electronic Engineering::290903 Other electronic engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1078</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of music sharing at work on social relationships between colleagues : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Management in Communications Management at Massey University, Wellington</field><field name="creator">Nikorowitsch, Johannes</field><field name="description">This study explores the influence of music sharing at work on social relationships between colleagues. Music sharing has been proven to facilitate friendship and maintenance in various social environments (Brown, Sellen, &amp; Geelhoed, 2001; Voida, Grinter, &amp; Ducheneaut, 2006). However, music sharing at work in its influence on friendships between colleagues has never been explored, even though establishing and strengthening social relationships within the workplace have become increasingly important within organisations (Berman, West, &amp; Richter, 2002). Informal relationships are beneficial for the overall well-being of an organisation as they increase the exchange of resources between colleagues. For the individual workers these relationships satisfy their need for social interaction. The study applied a mixed methods approach involving quantitative as well as qualitative methods. Twenty-nine employees from design agencies throughout New Zealand participated in an online survey and seven in semi-structured interviews. Both online survey and interviews were used in combination in order to achieve complementarily and triangulation between quantitative and qualitative data. The results suggest that music sharing contributes to the development of social bonding that occurs in the workplace. On the basis of the music that was shared through various technologies colleagues appeared to form impressions of each other. This involved determining each others&#8217; music preferences and associating other personality aspects with those music preferences. It appeared that the more similarly colleagues perceived each others&#8217; musical tastes, the more likely they were to become friends and/or to form informal music taste groups at work. The degree of reciprocity of music predicted the degree of intimacy between colleagues. When colleagues who were friends shared music with each other, they were much more concerned about reciprocating the music adequately than when they shared with colleagues they knew only superficially. The findings of this study are relevant for employers who want to promote relationship development between colleagues in a work environment where employees are passionate about music.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">workplace relationships</field><field name="subject">social interaction</field><field name="subject">social bonding</field><field name="subject">job satisfaction</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1079</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Economic integration in the Commonwealth of Independent States: perspectives, problems, solutions : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Public Policy at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Nashiraliyev, Yeldos</field><field name="description">It has been 17 years since the Soviet Union broke up and its constituent countries gained their independence. In the beginning years the sovereignty was considered an indisputable priority, resulting in economic matters being put off. However, in the light of slow economic development in the area, it seemed to be imperative for these countries to pursue economic integration. Backed up by political will, several attempts had been made to establish various integration groupings, one of them being the Commonwealth of Independent States. The established organisation&#8217;s main aim was to assist countries in preserving the connecting links inherited from the former Soviet Union. Some of the countries in the region managed to achieve relatively high growth rates mainly due to their individual efforts. Unfortunately, so far, none out of a number of proposed integration projects has proven to be an effective and binding tool in the political and economic development of the region. This thesis aims to identify problems standing in the way of economic integration of the Commonwealth of Independent States. As of now, a free trade area &#8211; the initial form of economic integration &#8211; has not been established. Although trade ties between the member states function, the main export destination of these states is outside the Commonwealth. It is recommended that the initial steps in setting up a free trade area in this territory should begin with developing integration within regional associations, due to smaller numbers of participants and their common interests.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">former Soviet Union</field><field name="subject">economic development</field><field name="subject">Russian trade</field><field name="subject">Russian economy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1080</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The life of freelance film production workers in the New Zealand film industry : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Psychology at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Rowlands, Lorraine</field><field name="description">Eleven male and 10 female freelance production workers were interviewed about their experiences of life within the New Zealand film industry. Respondents&#8217; accounts contrast sharply with glamorous images of the industry portrayed in the media. Respondents enjoyed the creative challenges, camaraderie, excitement, and intensity of their working lives and identified strongly with their work. However, they also experienced continual financial insecurity, unpredictable and demoralising periods of unemployment, and recurrent problems maintaining a reasonable work-life balance. Many of the older respondents cited these factors as their main reason for attempting to find work outside the industry. Female production workers appeared to pay a particularly high price for their involvement in the industry and often sacrificed other areas of their lives for their careers. Women frequently compensated for this imbalance by becoming even more career focussed, thus compounding the problems in non-work areas of their lives. Respondents&#8217; accounts are interpreted in relation to current structural conditions, working practices, and power imbalances within the New Zealand film industry. It is argued that freelance production workers&#8217; complex psychological relationship with their work is simultaneously a product of their work environment and helps to perpetuate industry conditions which disadvantage the workforce.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">work-life balance</field><field name="subject">career-focussed</field><field name="subject">work environment</field><field name="subject">power imbalances</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380108 Industrial and organisational psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1083</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dispositional coping styles and adult literacy : exploring stress and coping in adult vocational training environments : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements of the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Psychology at Massey University, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Murray, Nicola Sheree</field><field name="description">Since the publication of the International Adult Literacy Survey (IALS) findings in 1996, governments internationally have been cognisant of the need for functional literacy skill training for large segments of the New Zealand working-age population (Culligan1, Arnold, Noble, &amp; Sligo, 2004; Ministry of Education, 2001; OECD, 2000). Individuals with low literacy levels generally report negative prior experiences of formal learning environments that are due to and have contributed to their current functional literacy capability (for example, see Neubauer &amp; Dusewicz, 1988; Ross, 1987, 1988; Tilley et al., 2006). The present study aimed to systematically investigate and measure the dispositional coping styles and strategies associated with differing prose literacy capabilities. The purpose of this project was to provide an understanding of the coping-literacy relationship as a first step toward the development of coping strategy training interventions specifically targeted at improving the educational experience (current and future) of low literacy individuals. Secondary aims of the current study included exploring the relationship between persistence and coping style, adaptability, and prose literacy; determining whether and how coping styles, adaptability, and prose literacy changed over time; and, assessing the relationship between prose literacy, coping style, adaptability, and post-course goal achievement. Fifty-six students in adult vocational programmes were interviewed pre- and post-course. At each time point assessments of dispositional coping style and strategies via use of the COPE tool (Carver, Scheier, &amp; Weintraub, 1989) were gathered, as were measures of emotional intelligence (including adaptability), and prose literacy score. Participants also took part in a semi-structured qualitative interview which gathered information on their educational and employment history, and goals post-course. Situational assessments of coping behaviours outside of the course were also gathered as part of a larger study for future analysis purposes and are outside the scope of this thesis. Respondents were also interviewed at three and six months post-course to determine achievement or non-achievement of post-course goals. Low prose literacy scores were significantly associated with more frequent use of emotionfocused coping strategies (particularly avoidance). Higher prose literacy scores were significantly associated with more frequent use of problem-focused coping strategies. Indicative data showed that non-persisting participants showed higher emotion-focused coping strategy use than their persisting counterparts alongside lower prose literacy scores. Further, emotionfocused coping, adaptability, and prose literacy score were found to change significantly over time. However, post-course goal achievement was not significantly associated with any of the variables of interest except bivariately with prose literacy. The model of transactional stress and coping (Lazarus, 1966; Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1984) and the control theory of self-regulation (Carver &amp; Scheier, 1981, 2000) provided a framework for the discussion of the dispositional coping styles and strategies used by individuals of differing prose literacy ability. It was argued that a negative self-schema of the individual as a learner is developed through prior negative experiences of formal education. It was hypothesised that this negative self-schema, built from a low self-confidence and fear of educational failure and rejection, predisposed the individual to a heightened negative self-focus. This in turn was proposed to direct attention to the self and the associated emotional aspects of a response to a stressor, leading to a bias towards habitual coping strategies of avoidance and less frequent use of problem-focused strategies by this group. These findings and the associated interpretations have implications for the future development of coping strategy training interventions for individuals with low functional literacy competencies who wish to re-engage with formal education.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">adult literacy</field><field name="subject">coping styles</field><field name="subject">adult education</field><field name="subject">emotional intelligence</field><field name="subject">prose literacy</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330101 Educational psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1088</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the antioxidant activity of milk proteins in model oil-in-water emulsions : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Food Technology, Riddet Institute, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ries, Daniel</field><field name="description">The present study was aimed at extending our knowledge of the antioxidative properties of the milk protein products, whey protein isolate (WPI) and sodium caseinate (NaCas), in oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). In particular, the objective was to contribute to our understanding of the compositional and processing factors that influence the oxidative stability of protein-stabilised O/W emulsions. Linoleic acid (approximately 60 %) was used as the lipid for the oil phase (10.6 %). The emulsion samples were usually incubated at 50 &#176;C to accelerate lipid oxidation. Lipid oxidation indicators were lipid hydroperoxides and headspace hexanal, determined by solid phase microextraction (SPME) combined with gas chromatography (GC). WPI- or NaCas-stabilised emulsions were prepared using a wide range of protein concentrations (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 7.0 or 10.0 %) at two droplet sizes (d32 = 0.31 and 0.65 &#181;m). In general, higher lipid oxidation levels were found for the larger droplet size. Increasing protein concentration led to a decrease in the lipid oxidation rate. The greatest decrease in lipid hydroperoxide levels (values after 4 h) occurred at up to 4.0 % protein concentration. The greatest decrease in hexanal levels (values after 24 h) occurred at up to 4.0 % protein concentration in WPI emulsions (0.31 &#181;m). The hexanal levels were more independent of the protein concentration in the other emulsion types. The hexanal level decreased at protein concentrations &gt; 4.0 % in NaCas emulsions (0.31 and 0.65 &#181;m) and at protein concentrations &gt; 7.0 % in WPI emulsions (0.65 &#181;m). The difference between lipid hydroperoxide generation in emulsions with small and large droplet sizes decreased with increasing protein concentration. This effect was more pronounced in NaCas emulsions. In general, NaCas was a better inhibitor of lipid oxidation than WPI, but WPI appeared to be the better antioxidant at some droplet size/protein concentration combinations. The protein in the continuous phase, i.e. the unadsorbed protein, played an important role in lipid oxidation. In principal, the lipid hydroperoxide and hexanal levels showed the same development over the continuous phase protein concentration as over the protein concentration in WPI and NaCas emulsions (d32 = 0.31 &#181;m). A low NaCas level in the continuous phase already led to a relatively low hexanal level, whereas a higher WPI level was required. When NaCas solution was added to a WPI emulsion or WPI solution was added to a NaCas emulsion, a synergistic antioxidative effect was observed. The high molecular weight fractions (molecular weight = 12000-14000) of WPI and NaCas contained pro-oxidative metal ions that contributed to lipid oxidation in the emulsions. An enrichment of NaCas emulsions with the low molecular weight fraction of NaCas (with a molecular weight = 12000-14000) notably inhibited lipid oxidation. An enrichment of WPI emulsions with the low molecular weight fraction of WPI (with a molecular weight = 12000-14000) also seemed to inhibit lipid oxidation, but the effect was not significant. The protein solutions were enriched with these fractions before emulsion preparation. Pure WPI solution or mixed WPI/NaCas (1:1, weight/weight) solution with 1.12 or 2.24 % protein concentration was heated at 84 &#176;C for up to 40 min, cooled and then used to prepare emulsions. Lipid oxidation was generally not affected by the heat treatment or the degree of whey protein denaturation. However, at the lower WPI concentration, more hexanal was produced for the longer heating times (20, 30 and 40 min) and this appeared to be connected with the physical instability of the emulsions. Greater oxidative stability was found at the higher protein concentration and when the proteins were mixed, pointing to a possible synergistic antioxidative effect of WPI and NaCas. The addition of the free radical source 2,2&#8217;-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH) greatly increased the oxygen uptake and the generation of lipid hydroperoxides in the emulsions. The oxidative stability increased with increasing protein concentration (1.0, 4.0 and 7.0 %). NaCas had a greater antioxidative effect than WPI. The inhibition of oxygen uptake appeared to be largely influenced by the free-radical-scavenging activity of the system, determined by the protein type and the protein concentration, as the radicals were produced linearly over time and oxygen was consumed linearly over time. It can therefore be concluded that free-radical-scavenging activity represents a major antioxidative mechanism of the milk proteins. Oxygen was consumed much faster in emulsions than in protein solutions when the same level of AAPH was incorporated. In a WPI (1.0 % protein) emulsion, much lower levels of protein hydroperoxides than of lipid hydroperoxides developed. This pointed to a much greater reactivity of linoleic acid than of the milk proteins with oxygen. In contrast, the exposure of WPI to oxidising linoleic acid in an emulsion (1.0 % protein) or to AAPH in aqueous solution led to oxidative damage of the whey proteins, indicated by the loss of amino acids. The loss of specific amino acids was different for proteins in the continuous phase or cream phase of an emulsion or in WPI solution. The present study confirms the antioxidative potential of WPI and NaCas and gives new insights into their functionality as oxidative stabilisers in O/W emulsions.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">whey protein isolate</field><field name="subject">sodium caseinate</field><field name="subject">lipid oxidation</field><field name="subject">oxidative stabilisers</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290101 Fermentation, biotechnology and industrial microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1084</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Recovering voices in mental health, families and anthropology : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of Arts in Social Anthropology, Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">McCormick, Rowan</field><field name="description">This essay discusses some experiences of families, carers and people with experience of mental ill-health and recovery in New Zealand, focussing on &#8216;recovering moments&#8217; in social exchanges, families, mental health settings and in anthropological research. It draws comparisons between phenomenological approaches in anthropology and practices promoted in recent mental health recovery philosophy, with a particular focus on the production and exchange of particular local expertise, much of which resists academic appropriation or definition. The value, currency and relevance of these &#8216;recovering voices&#8217; relates to their being privileged, validated and transmitted in ethical exchanges in a range of social settings that exemplify aspects of Marcel Mauss&#8217; discussion of the act of giving, receiving and repaying (1980:34).</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mental health recovery</field><field name="subject">social anthropology</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370300 Anthropology::370302 Social and cultural anthropology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1087</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The genetics of Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 : adaptation to a spatially structured environment : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Genetics at Massey University, Auckland Campus</field><field name="creator">McDonald, Michael Joseph</field><field name="description">Experimental microbial populations provide powerful models for testing the most challenging problems in evolutionary biology. In the midst of the genome sequencing revolution microbial evolutionary genetics has flourished; promising high-resolution explanations for the underlying causes of evolutionary phenomena. This thesis describes four investigations into the adaptation of Pseudomonas fluorescesns SBW25 to a spatially structured environment. The first builds upon a large body of experimental work characterising the genetic and phenotypic causes of the ability of divergent Wrinkley Spreader (WS) types to colonise the air-liquid interface in spatially structured microcosms. The mws and aws genetic loci are described, which together with the previously described wsp locus, account for the location of the causal mutation for all known WS genotypes. It was found that if these loci were deleted from the P. fluorescens genome, it could still evolve the WS phenotype via a previously undiscovered locus (sws). This study provides the first explicit evidence that genetic biases can influence the outcome of evolution. The second study used a novel method to sample WS genotypes without the biasing effects of natural selection; the distribution of the fitness effects of these genotypes was measured and analysed from a unique perspective. The distribution of fitness effects of new mutations is found to best fit the normal distribution, facilitating the extension of the mutational landscape model of adaptation to include all possible adaptive walks. The third study investigates the underlying causes of genetic biases on evolution; many WS genotypes are obtained at different time points during colonisation of the air-liquid interface (including WS obtained without selection) and the causal mutations of many of these mutants determined. Together these results allowed the elucidation of the relative effects of natural selection, genetic architecture and mutation rate on evolutionary outcomes. The final study considers the WS mat as the product of cooperative interactions, and uses a group selection experiment to investigate the potential of WS mats to evolve group level adaptations. A novel strategy is developed to overcome cheating types, considered the main barrier to the evolution of group level complexity. Furthermore, WS groups evolved specialised cell types, the first example of a de novo evolution of a division of labour, a hallmark of complexity.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pseudomonas fluorescens SWB25</field><field name="subject">evolutionary genetics</field><field name="subject">genetic biases</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270200 Genetics::270208 Molecular evolution</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1086</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling infectious disease epidemiology and vaccination impact : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Mathematics at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Mann, Joanne L</field><field name="description">This thesis presents mathematical models for the dynamics of vaccine preventable diseases, specifically looking at the New Zealand situation. Through the use of integral and differential equations, we develop models and compare the results of these to known data. Using game theory analysis we determine and compare the proportion of the population that needs to be vaccinated in order to minimise the expected costs to the individuals in the population and to the community. Two different scenarios and methods are considered, where the effects of vaccination last only one epidemic cycle (using an integral equation method) and where vaccination is effective over an entire lifetime (using a differential equation method). For both scenarios, we find that the minimum cost for the individuals is reached when a lower proportion of the population is vaccinated than needed for the minimum cost to the community. We then elaborate on the integral equation method to produce a model for repeated epidemics of measles in a population, where a discrete mapping is used to include the year to year demographics of the population. The results of this model show a different epidemic pattern then that produced from a differential equation model, with numerical problems encountered. From here on, we use differential equation models in our analysis. A critique and extension to an existing model for the dynamics of the hepatitis B virus is presented, with discussion on the appropriateness of the model&#8217;s construct for predicting the incidence of infection. Alternative differential equation models for hepatitis B virus and immunisation that include splitting the population into age groups with nonhomogeneous mixing are presented. The results of these models are compared with the known data on incidence of infection and carriage in New Zealand, showing how affective different immunisation schedules may have been. Differential equation models are then presented for meningococcal B virus epidemiology in New Zealand, with the models incorporating different features of the virus until the best model is found that fits the New Zealand data. Each model is compared with the known incidence of infection, with the population being either treated as a whole or split into age groups with non-homogeneous mixing. The effect of vaccination is included in this model so that we can explore the future of the infection in the population, and how best to tackle any future epidemics. The model shows that the current vaccination campaign was the best solution for controlling the epidemic, but there will be epidemics in the future that will need subsequent vaccination campaigns to limit the number of infections.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">vaccination</field><field name="subject">mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::239900 Other Mathematical Sciences::239902 Actuarial Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1085</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Neospora caninum : studies toward isolation in New Zealand : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Veterinary Studies at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Walton, Julie K</field><field name="description">Background: Neospora caninum is a parasite that causes disease, largely in cattle and dogs. It is a disease of significant interest within New Zealand due to its association with bovine abortion. The economic impact of bovine abortion justifies the development of a bovine vaccine against N. caninum. Aim: To develop and optimise diagnostic procedures for the detection of Neospora from a variety of blood and tissue samples and to isolate a New Zealand strain of Neospora caninum. Methods: A local strain of Toxoplasma gondii and an imported Neospora caninum strain, Nc-Liverpool, were used to optimise tachyzoite growing conditions in bovine endothelial (BE) cells and Vero host cell cultures. A serum study using 112 tissue culture flasks was performed to determine whether foetal bovine serum or horse serum supplemented media provided the optimal growing conditions for Nc-Liverpool tachyzoites. Nc-Liverpool tachyzoites were also used to determine the optimal growth period between passage, and harvest for cryopreservation and cryopreservation conditions. Percoll gradients were also tested using Nc-Liverpool tachyzoites. A known Neospora positive canine sample and murine tissues infected with Toxoplasma, were used during the development of the immunohistochemical diagnostic technique. Antibody concentrations and incubation temperatures were tested to reduce cross-reactivity and increase specific stain intensity. Immunohistochemistry was performed on sections of all tissue samples used for N. caninum isolation and experimentally infected murine tissue. Several PCR techniques were developed, the final PCR used being a combination of the different techniques, which produced a 250kb band. PCR-3 used the NF6/GA1 primer combination for Neospora detection and TF6/GA1 for Toxoplasma detection, additional Mg2+ and an annealing temperature of 55&#176;C were required. Whole tissue was processed via DNA elution whereas cell culture and Percoll purified tachyzoites were used following crude lysis techniques. All bovine and canine tissues used for parasite isolation as well as all experimentally infected mouse tissues were tested for N. caninum using PCR. An immunoblot technique was developed for the detection of N. caninum antibodies in murine blood samples. Lysed Nc-Liverpool tachyzoites were used as antigen with varied results. The primary and secondary antibodies were commercially available and used at concentrations of 1:1,000 and 1:25,000 respectively. BALB/c and CF1 mice were experimentally infected with Toxoplasma gondii and Nc-Liverpool. Forty female BALB/c and 40 female CF1 mice were used in 2 studies to determine the optimal Nc-Liverpool inoculation dose and immunosuppression requirements. Mice were immunosuppressed with 2.5mg of methylprednisolone acetate (MPA) and Nc-Liverpool inoculation ranged from 1.3x106 to 5x103 tachyzoites. Upon death, the brain and blood was harvested from the mouse carcases. Attempts were made to isolate a New Zealand strain of N. caninum from bovine and canine central nervous system (CNS) tissue, and to maintain the parasites in cell culture and by small animal passage, in order to attenuate the parasite strain for use as a live large animal vaccine. Twenty one bovine tissue samples were used for N. caninum isolation attempts, 18 of which were positive for Neospora antibodies using a commercial IFAT. Isolation tissues were purified using a 30% Percoll gradient and inoculated onto 8 cell culture flasks and into 8 immunosuppressed mice (BALB/c and CF1). Results: Nc-Liverpool tachyzoites were found to be viable when grown at 37&#176;C in antibiotic-MEM supplemented with either FBS or ES and grew optimally in FBS despite Neospora antibodies being detected using an IFAT. Passaging cultures at approx. 4 day intervals resulted in the greatest parasite growth. However, cryopreserved parasites should be harvested 2 days post inoculation (PI) for optimal viability. Viable parasites could be isolated using a 30% Percoll gradient and centrifuged at 2,700 x g (3,400 rpm) in a bucket centrifuge for 10 minutes. Tissue cysts could be detected using immunohistochemistry but some degree of cross reaction remained despite optimisation. Cysts were not found in tissues used for isolation attempts or in mouse brains following inoculation with Nc-Liverpool, however cysts were commonly found in mice experimentally infected with T. gondii tachyzoites. PCR-3 was successfully used to detect N. caninum and T. gondii infected tissue and tachyzoites from tissue culture. PCR-3 could detect N. caninum DNA in the brain tissue of 9/24 mice experimentally infected with Nc-Liverpool, even though most mice were culled within 1 week. Although production of N. caninum antigen was only moderately successful, N. caninum antibody detection in mouse blood using one specific antigen batch was reliable and specific. The immunoblot could only detect N. caninum antibody approximately 14 days PI, but was sensitive enough to detect 100% of mice experimentally infected with Nc-Liverpool tachyzoites. PCR-3 strongly correlated with the immunoblot results from 14 days PI. BALB/c mice were found to be far more sensitive to Nc-Liverpool than CF1 mice and developed severe disease at concentrations of approximately 1x106 Nc-Liverpool tachyzoites. Neither BALB/c nor CF1 mice developed peritoneal exudate, irrespective of the parasite inoculation concentration. Despite Neospora DNA being present in the brains of experimentally infected mice, re-isolation and continuous parasite passage from the brains could not be achieved. No mice experimentally infected with either Nc-Liverpool or isolation attempts were found to have brain cysts when tested using immunohistochemistry. Only 1 mouse inoculated with bovine isolation material was found to have a Neospora positive PCR. Through the detection of DNA, antigens and antibodies, parasites were determined to have been present in 10 of the 18 IFAT positive bovine isolation samples, indicating that 55% of calves born to seropositive dams were infected with N. caninum. However, despite numerous attempts to isolate Neospora parasites from naturally infected canine and bovine tissue and culturing using the optimised Nc-Liverpool technique, maintenance of a live culture of a New Zealand strain of N. caninum could not be established. Conclusions: Findings from this study could be used to assist in the maintenance of Neospora caninum and Toxoplasma gondii parasite strains and for detection or diagnosis of these parasites in host tissues.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Neospora caninum</field><field name="subject">pathogenic protozoa</field><field name="subject">Toxoplasma gondii</field><field name="subject">cattle parasites</field><field name="subject">cattle diseases</field><field name="subject">veterinary parasitology</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300500 Veterinary Medicine::300508 Parasitology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1089</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Popular geographies: celebrating the nation in Canadian Geographic, Australian Geographic and New Zealand Geographic, 1995-2004 : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Geography at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Wilson, Andrew Charles Bruce</field><field name="description">Popular geography magazines like National Geographic (NG) provide readers with a lens of the world around them. Yet sadly they often only serve a limited utilitarian purpose as dust collectors on coffee tables of hospital waiting rooms or doctors&#8217; practices. It should be of little surprise then that the relative importance of geographic magazines as a representational forum has been underestimated historically. The importance of geographic magazines as an outlet for creating and disseminating preconceived visions of what may be termed &#8216;popular geographies&#8217; has only become the subject of scrutiny in the last two decades. Authors including Lutz and Collins (1993) and Rothenberg (1994, 2007) have reflected critically upon the place of NG as a powerful ideological institution for legitimating particular visions of the world in the wider corpus of the discipline of geography. Yet while there has been a substantial volume of work dedicated to unravelling the situated lens of NG there has been no research devoted to deciphering the lenses of other geography magazines such as Canadian Geographic (CG), Australian Geographic (AG) or New Zealand Geographic (NZG). These magazines also embody the ideals of adventure, discovery and nature made famous by NG but purvey geography through distinctively national narratives. Through discourse analysis the thesis examines these three magazines in order to unravel geographic imaginations of nationalism in CG, AG and NZG and in the process challenge divergent conceptions of geography itself as both an academic discipline and popular subject.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">popular geography</field><field name="subject">imaginative geographies</field><field name="subject">geography magazines</field><field name="subject">national geography</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::269900 Other Earth Sciences::269901 Physical geography</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1090</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cultural competency in New Zealand industrial and organisational psychology and human resource management professionals and students: is personality or experience a better predictor? : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Psychology at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Williams, Tania Marie</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the relevance of Bio Data verses Personality for predicting Cultural Competence among Industrial and Organisational Psychology and Human Resource Management professionals and students in New Zealand. It also explores the relevance of the model (D.W.

The sample consisted of 113 participants drawn from a population of Industrial and Organisational Psychology, and Human Resource Management professionals and students. A questionnaire which measures the predictors of the Big Five Personality Factors (Goldberg, 1999), and Bio Data, and the criterion variables of Cultural Intelligence (Earley &amp; Ang, 2003) and questions constructed specifically for this thesis was distributed online. The criterion variables were based on an existing three part (Awareness, Knowledge and Skills) Multidimensional Model for Developing Cultural Competence by D.W. Sue (2001). The results of this research were obtained through exploratory factor analysis and subsequent multiple regression analysis. A new model was constructed to represent the tested predictor and criterion relationship. Results suggest that overall Personality is a better predictor of Cultural Competence, with the Personality Factor of Agreeableness being the highest weighted Personality Factor. D.W Sue&#8217;s (2001) Multidimensional Model for Developing Cultural Competence maintained its three part structure in the analysis and consequently seems relevant to the unique socio-cultural, organisational and professional setting of the tested group.

To understand how older individuals make sense of a disaster, nine older adults in Kaitaia, New Zealand were interviewed about their experience of a flood they experienced in July 2007. These interviews were conducted with four residents living in a rest home and five pensioners living independently who were evacuated from their homes. The two groups differed in the levels of support and assistance received before, during, and after the disaster. The rest home residents experienced little disruption and did not require relocation; the pensioners experienced major disruption and relocation. Thematic analysis was used to describe how these older adults&#8217; accounted for their experiences of the flood. The narratives were influenced by the participants&#8217; identity as either dependent rest home residents or pensioners living independently in the community. The analysis revealed that their accounts of the disaster were incorporated and integrated into the personal and social context of each person&#8217;s life story. Narrative themes that emerged from the analysis for the pensioner group were: coping with limited assistance, the importance of treasured possessions, and social support and community. The pensioner themes reflected their vulnerability to a disaster and the challenges they faced during the post disaster recovery phase. Themes for the rest home residents were ageing and dependency, and the importance of protection, care, and trust. These themes reflected the dependent world of the rest home residents and the security of being cared for.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">floods psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">disasters psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">older people psychology</field><field name="subject">elderly psychology</field><field name="subject">disaster victims psychology</field><field name="subject">Kaitaia New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380107 Health, clinical and counselling psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1094</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of corporate leadership succession planning and implementation : the Malaysian experience : a thesis submitted to the University in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Management, Massey University</field><field name="creator">Tan, John P G</field><field name="description">Leadership succession, and especially that of the CEO, has attracted considerable interest amongst management and social researchers. Most of the research has been conducted in Western organisations and from specific vantage points such as understanding the financial impact of CEO succession and successor origins. However, there is currently little research on the actual process of leadership succession, and especially so in the Malaysian context. This research uses qualitative research methods to investigate leadership succession (which in this thesis means both CEO and upper-echelon managerial succession) in Malaysian organisations. The research reveals that most Malaysian companies are not engaged in leadership succession planning and implementation and the few that have such processes report low success rates. The research shows that leadership succession planning and implementation is in its infancy among Malaysian companies. Where upper-echelon manager succession is concerned, companies commonly practise leadership replacement rather than succession. However, with family-controlled publicly listed companies &#8211; and such companies constitute the majority of publicly listed companies in Malaysia and in most of Asia &#8211; dynastic succession is the predominant form of CEO succession and the CEO&#8217;s position is the preserve of members of the founding family. In investigating the factors that either enhance or inhibit leadership succession processes, a form of inhibitor that this thesis calls organisationally generated entrenchment was identified. Organisationally generated entrenchment appears to be common in Malaysian companies and has the effect of stifling smooth leadership succession. This research also shows that leadership succession processes are greatly influenced by cultural factors and that leadership succession models must take into account cultural effects. This thesis offers the Succession Development Pathway model as a means of facilitating leadership succession in organisations in Malaysia.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">succession planning</field><field name="subject">corporate leadership</field><field name="subject">Malaysia</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1095</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Finding near optimum colour classifiers : genetic algorithm-assisted fuzzy colour contrast fusion using variable colour depth : a thesis presented to the Institute of Information and Mathematical Sciences in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Computer Science at Massey University, Albany, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Shin, Heesang</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a complete self-calibrating illumination intensity-invariant colour classification system. We extend a novel fuzzy colour processing tech- nique called Fuzzy Colour Contrast Fusion (FCCF) by combining it with a Heuristic- assisted Genetic Algorithm (HAGA) for automatic fine-tuning of colour descriptors. Furthermore, we have improved FCCF&#8217;s efficiency by processing colour channels at varying colour depths in search for the optimal ones. In line with this, we intro- duce a reduced colour depth representation of a colour image while maintaining efficient colour sensitivity that suffices for accurate real-time colour-based object recognition. We call the algorithm Variable Colour Depth (VCD) and we propose a technique for building and searching a VCD look-up table (LUT). The first part of this work investigates the effects of applying fuzzy colour contrast rules to vary- ing colour depths as we extract the optimal rule combination for any given target colour exposed under changing illumination intensities. The second part introduces the HAGA-based parameter-optimisation for automatically constructing accurate colour classifiers. Our results show that for all cases, the VCD algorithm, combined with HAGA for parameter optimisation improve colour classification via a pie-slice colour classifier.For 6 different target colours, the hybrid algorithm was able to yield 17.63% higher overall accuracy as compared to the pure fuzzy approach.

This has resulted in an increased corpus of related literature overseas, which includes studies in which facticity as well as aetiology, symptomology and treatment are debated. This present study focuses on a New Zealand context, and examines the talk of New Zealand counsellors in relation to their views regarding RA and the counselling of RA clients. Social constructionist and positivist epistemologies were evaluated in terms of their suitability for this research, and the discourse analytic method developed by Potter and Wetherell (1987) chosen as the means by which participants&#8217; talk might be analysed in such a way as to allow the inclusion of multiple constructions and the emergence of the many discourses and conflicting ideas which occur in overseas literature. A broad selection of the literature was first critically analysed to give an understanding of the topic. Nine counsellors gave interviews, eight women and one man, all Pakeha, six of whom were ACC-registered (Accident Compensation Commission, 2009). The participants constructed RA as a physical reality, which was justified by the use of the credible client discourse. A traditional linguistic repertoire furnished a discourse of government backing, which was employed to warrant voice. A moral stake in counselling, named concern for the client, was shown to be present in all arguments. The participants constructed three truths relative to context: a legal truth, the counsellor&#8217;s truth, and the client&#8217;s truth. Recovered memories were given a dual construction which legitimised correct and incorrect recall. DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association, 2000) labelling was debated in a discourse of ambivalence. Finally in a discourse of preparedness, the participants constructed the therapeutic skills needed to treat RA clients. The thesis concludes by highlighting the participants&#8217; comments regarding the need for openness and awareness, and specialised literature and training for counsellors treating RA clients.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ritual abuse</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Counselling</field><field name="subject">Counsellors</field><field name="subject">Satanic</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380107 Health, clinical and counselling psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1098</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Whanau/family meetings in the paediatric intensive care unit: content, process, and family satisfaction : a thesis presented in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Philosophy, Social Work, Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand.</field><field name="creator">Thompson, Andrew Paul</field><field name="description">Family Meetings occur frequently in the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) yet little data existed to guide clinicians in the conduct of these meetings. The medical team is required to deliver complex medical information and navigate complex decision-making with a traumatised family during a meeting. The objectives of this study were to describe the content and process of 15 whanau/family meetings in the PICU, identify family meeting characteristics and patient and family attributes that influence family satisfaction and recommend guidelines for health professionals working in the PICU. The study was conducted in a PICU in a university-affiliated children&#8217;s hospital in New Zealand (NZ). The process and content of 15 family meetings were analysed using a coding framework previously developed through a qualitative study of family meetings in the adult intensive care unit (Curtis, 2002a). A questionnaire providing a quantitative assessment of family satisfaction drawn from the same study was administered to 30 family members. Demographic data for the study were collected from the patient&#8217;s hospital record and these were combined with data relating to the meeting recording and transcript to identify family meeting characteristics and attributes that might influence family satisfaction. The content and process of family meetings in the PICU were described using a framework detailing 28 codes from the six domains: introductions, informational exchange, discussions of the future, decisions, discussions about death and dying, and closings. A comparison of family meeting characteristics and patient and family attributes revealed that longer meetings (40 minutes plus) were associated with lower family satisfaction and should therefore prompt clinicians to consider whether there are unresolved conflicts, difficulties or misunderstandings between the medical team and the family. Recommendations are proposed to guide health professionals in family meetings in the PICU. This is the first study to record and code the content of family meetings in the PICU. The findings from this study will assist clinicians in their meetings with families. The description of the family meeting content will also provide a foundation for future communication training and research in the health environment.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">PICU</field><field name="subject">intensive care</field><field name="subject">informational exchange</field><field name="subject">families of sick children</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370200 Social Work::370299 Social work not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1102</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The rural home front : a New Zealand region and the Great War 1914-1926 : a thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in History at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Hucker, Graham</field><field name="description">New Zealand&#8217;s First World War studies have traditionally focused on the soldier and battlefield experiences. &#8216;The Rural Home Front&#8217; breaks with that tradition and focuses on the lives of people and the local communities that the soldiers left behind in the predominantly rural region of Taranaki in New Zealand. &#8216;The Rural Home Front&#8217; is essentially a study of the impact and effects of the First World War on rural society. By focusing on topics and themes such as &#8216;war enthusiasm&#8217;, the voluntary spirit of fund raising and recruiting, conscription, attempting to maintain normality during wartime, responses to war deaths, the influenza epidemic, the Armistice and the need to remember, this thesis argues that civilians experienced the Great War, too, albeit differently from that of the soldiers serving overseas.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">World War One</field><field name="subject">Taranaki</field><field name="subject">The Great War</field><field name="subject">'War enthusiasm'</field><field name="subject">Patriotism</field><field name="subject">Volunteering</field><field name="subject">Conscription</field><field name="subject">'Business-as-usual'</field><field name="subject">War-deaths</field><field name="subject">Armistice</field><field name="subject">Influenza epidemic</field><field name="subject">Remembrance</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::430000 History and Archaeology::430100 Historical Studies::430101 History: New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1103</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of the military within Official Development Assistance : policies, parameters and procedures : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Philosophy in Development Studies at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Bennett, Vernon Noel</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the relationship between development, Official Development Assistance (ODA) and the military in order to determine both the nature and effects of that relationship, and how the involvement of the military within ODA can be conducted in the most appropriate manner to support development. This study was conducted with regard to the current links between security and development within international relations and concerns that ODA is being drawn from a primarily development role to one that more explicitly supports national foreign and security policy ends instead. This issue is explored by defining development, ODA and the military as separate variables and then employing a grounded theory approach to develop an understanding of the relationship between them. The results of the study show that the involvement of the military within ODA and development may occur throughout the full range of operational contexts in which the military may be employed and can encompass activities throughout the scope of the functions of development. This involvement can in turn create a range of positive and negative impacts upon the conduct of ODA and development as the military serves to moderate the direction and strength of the relationship between the two. From this, the role of the military within ODA is identified as potentially an enabling, implementing and coordinating agency &#8211; primarily during times of crisis and conflict. The study then relates this role back to the wider context through considering the management of the military&#8217;s role and identifying the policies, parameters and procedures that may help to ensure that this role is conducted in the most appropriate manner for development.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Official Development Assistance</field><field name="subject">ODA</field><field name="subject">civil-military relations</field><field name="subject">humanitarian assistance</field><field name="subject">foreign policy</field><field name="subject">role of military</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360200 Policy and Administration::360204 Defence studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1105</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'A kind of ritual Pakeha tikanga'-- Maori experiences of hospitalisation : a case study : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Philosophy in Nursing at Massey University (Albany), New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Barton, Pipi</field><field name="description">Minimal literature exists relating to the experiences of Maori within the New Zealand public hospital system. Maori are highly represented in morbidity and mortality statistics and are high users of the secondary health care system. A Case Study methodology with a Maori centred approach was used to describe Maori experiences of hospitalisation. Multiple sources of evidence were gathered, including participant interviews, statistical data from the New Zealand Health Information Service, and international literature relating to indigenous experiences of hospitalisation. Eleven people (nine female and two males) identifying as Maori, of various iwi (tribal) affiliations and from a range of regions, participated in the interviews. All participants had either been admitted, or cared for by a family member who had been admitted to a medical or surgical ward in a public hospital anywhere in New Zealand within the last 15 years. Participants were aged between 20 to 75 years. All interviews were audio recorded, transcribed and then thematically analysed. A retrospective interrupted time series design was used to examine length of stay for Maori patients receiving treatment in the secondary medical and surgical setting, from 1989-2004. The data included the records of all medical and surgical discharges for Maori and non-Maori from the New Zealand public hospitals. Medical and surgical admissions were screened to include those over the age of 17 years and who had a length of stay greater than 1 day and less than 90 days. From the analysis of all the data three key interpretations emerged: 1. Maori are marginalised within the mainstream health system. 2. Maori believe that the hospital environment is not conducive to healing. 3. Maori experiences in hospital contribute to their decision to leave as soon as possible. The recommendations include the integration of more culturally acceptable and appropriate interventions within secondary and tertiary health services, and a review of the effectiveness of cultural safety education in practice and inclusion/revision of the cultural competence for all health care workers.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori health</field><field name="subject">hospitalisation</field><field name="subject">cultural safety</field><field name="subject">nursing</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321100 Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1104</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification of genes regulating the plant-specific expression of the ItmM gene in Epichloe festucae : this thesis is presented as a partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science (Msc) in Genetics at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Brasell, Emma</field><field name="description">The fungal endophyte Epichlo&#235; festucae forms a largely mutualistic association with the ryegrass species Lolium perenne. E. festucae produces a range of bio-protective alkaloids that protect the host grass from herbivory by both mammals and insects. One such alkaloid, Lolitrem B, is a potent mycotoxin and the causative agent of ryegrass staggers in livestock. Ten genes required for biosynthesis of lolitrem B are encoded in the ltm gene cluster. The ltm genes are expressed in a plant-specific manner, with high levels of expression in planta and very low levels of expression in culture. The mechanism regulating ltm gene expression is unknown but it is predicted to involve signalling from the host plant. The ltmM gene was chosen for use in the investigation of ltm gene regulation because the flanking regions do not contain retrotransposon sequence, which surrounds much of the ltm gene cluster. To identify fungal genes involved in the plant-induced expression of ltmM, a mutagenesis and screening system was developed using a PltmM-gusA &#8216;knock-in&#8217; construct to detect expression from the ltmM promoter. Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated T-DNA mutagenesis was used to create a set of mutants with random insertions in the genome. Mutants were then screened for altered PltmM-gusA expression, both in culture and in planta. Three mutants were identified with increased PltmM-gusA expression in culture, however, no mutants were identified with loss of PltmM-gusA expression in planta. This indicates that a mechanism of repression is involved in the plant-induced expression of ltmM, either directly or indirectly. TM mutants of interest were also observed for altered symbiosis phenotypes. Mutants were identified with reduced colonisation rates and altered hyphal growth in planta. Integration sites were identified for two colonisation mutants and the disrupted genes are predicted to be the CTP:cholinephosphate cytidylyltransferase (CCT) gene PCT1 and the mitogen-activated protein kinsase kinase (MAPKK) gene mkk2.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">endophytic fungi</field><field name="subject">Lolium perenne</field><field name="subject">ryegrass</field><field name="subject">gene expression</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270200 Genetics::270201 Gene expression</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electronic clinical decision support (eCDS) in primary health care: a multiple case study of three New Zealand PHOs : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Information Systems at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Engelbrecht, Judith Merrylyn</field><field name="description">Health care providers internationally are facing challenges surrounding the delivery of high quality, cost effective services. The use of integrated electronic information systems is seen by many people working in the health sector as a way to address some of the associated issues. In New Zealand the primary health care sector has been restructured to follow a population based care model and provides services through not-for-profit Primary Health Organisations (PHOs). PHOs, together with their District Health Boards (DHBs), contributing service providers, and local communities, are responsible for the care of their enrolled populations. The Ministry of Health (MoH) is streamlining information sharing in this environment through improvements to computer based information systems (IS). By providing health professionals with improved access to required information within an appropriate time frame, services can be targeted efficiently and effectively and patient health outcomes potentially improved. However, the adoption of IS in health care has been slower than in other industries. Therefore, a thorough knowledge of health care professionals&#8217; attitudes to, and use of, available IS is currently needed to contribute to the development of appropriate systems. This research employs a multiple case study strategy to establish the usage of IS by three New Zealand PHOs and their member primary health care providers (PHPs), with a focus on the role of IS in clinical decision support (CDS). A mixed method approach including semi-structured interviews and postal surveys was used in the study. Firstly, the research develops and applies a survey tool based on an adaptation of an existing framework, for the study of IT sophistication in the organisations. This provides the foundation for an in-depth study of the use of computerised CDS (eCDS) in the PHO environment. Secondly, a conceptual model of eCDS utilisation is presented, illustrating the variation of eCDS use by member general practitioner (GP) practices within individual organisations. Thirdly, five areas of importance for improving eCDS utilisation within PHO&#8217;s are identified, contributing information of use to organisations, practitioners, planners, and systems developers. Lastly, the research provides a structure for the study of the domain of eCDS in PHOs by presenting a research approach and information specific for the area.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">information systems</field><field name="subject">health care</field><field name="subject">primary health organisations</field><field name="subject">clinical decision support</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280100 Information Systems::280109 Decision support and group support systems</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1107</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Switching costs in the New Zealand banking market : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Banking at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand / Claire Dianne Matthews</field><field name="creator">Matthews, Claire Dianne</field><field name="description">This thesis explores issues related to bank switching costs, in the context of the New Zealand banking market. Switching costs comprise the range of economic costs faced by customers changing bank, including monetary switching costs, the loss of the relationship with bank staff, and needing to learn new systems. An important effect of switching costs is customers become locked in to their bank, which has implications for market competition, and this raises questions about the need for a regulatory response. The study comprised a mail survey to 2983 people drawn from New Zealand electoral rolls, with a response rate of 34%. The survey instrument was a questionnaire of 70 questions in four sections: banking relationships, switching behaviour, switching costs, and demographic information. Nine categories of switching costs were used: Learning, Search, Monetary Loss, Benefit Loss, Personal Relationship, Brand Relationship, Service Disruption, Uncertainty, and Hassle. These categories are found to be appropriate. Furthermore, the three higher order categories of Procedural, Financial and Relational found by Burnham, Frels and Mahajan (2003) are confirmed. Although prior studies have recognised different switching costs, there has been limited work to understand whether they differ in their impact on attitudes and behaviour around switching. Different switching costs are found to have different effects. The study also examined whether the experience of switching matches the perception, and found switching is easier than expected. Furthermore, customers who have switched banks have different perceptions of switching costs to those who have not. Customers are different, and their attitudes and needs should therefore vary. Prior research has found differences in attitudes towards financial issues based on the family life cycle, but the relationship between switching costs and family life cycle has not been explored. This thesis finds perceptions of switching costs and switching behaviour vary significantly between life cycle groups, which appears in part to be related to associated changes in the complexity of the banking relationship. Four recommendations for regulators are generated from the results of the study. These include recommending greater acknowledgement of the existence and effect of switching costs, and investigation of bank account number portability.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">banking</field><field name="subject">switching costs</field><field name="subject">changing bank</field><field name="subject">market competition</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350300 Banking, Finance and Investment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1108</field></doc><doc><field name="title">W&#257;hine kaihaut&#363;, w&#257;hine whai mana navigating the tides of change : Whakat&#333;hea women and tribal socio-politics : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Philosophy in M&#257;ori Studies at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Hayes, Dorothy Maora</field><field name="description">This thesis explored the socio-political experiences and views of seven Maori women from the tribe of Whakatahea. The project adopted a Maori-centred theoretical and research approach that included the researcher as a member of the researched group. It aimed to draw out the common themes, from the women's recollections of their experiences and views of the socio-political decision-making affairs within whanau, hapu, and iwi. The women identified barriers to participation and strategies to overcome these barriers. Qualifications reflected traditional Maori values and practices. Rights according to whakapapa, and the principle "he kanohi kitea", being seen, were the obvious criterion. Poor information channels, minimal consultation, gender bias, age and time constraints were some of the issues identified as barriers to participation. It was found that whanau governance committees more closely reflected traditional values and customs that saw women and men as sharing power, more so than hapu and iwi organisations. The gender imbalance was viewed, by the women participants, as problematic. They concluded that better gender balance at all levels of the socio-political affairs of Whakatohea would ensure greater informed decision-making for the social, educational, economic, and spiritual well-being of the tribe today and for future generations.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Women</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Opotiki District</field><field name="subject">Politics and government</field><field name="subject">Public leadership</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370300 Anthropology::370302 Social and cultural anthropology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1111</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Music performance anxiety in adolescent student singers : a thesis submitted to the Victoria University of Wellington in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Music [in Performance]</field><field name="creator">Corby, Megan</field><field name="description">This project seeks to sidestep the debilitating effects of music performance anxiety by cross-referencing knowledge from the areas of adolescent psychology with literature on MPA in singers in general in order to target adolescent singers early in their training.

Metheny is a recognised innovator in technique and uses a wide range of instruments in the guitar family, both traditional and radically new. The use of such instruments frees Metheny from some restrictions and the possibility that this freedom is a major influence in his improvisation and composition is remarked on.

Primarily a source study, the thesis makes a survey of all known copies of Bousset's published works, addressing questions of dates, reprints and corrections. Historical context and musical style are also discussed. Particular emphasis is given to Bousset's sacred music in the French language two volumes of sacred cantatas and eight settings of Odes sacrees by Jean-Baptiste Rousseau - and its place within the French tradition of Psalm paraphrase settings. The figure of J.B. Rousseau is also examined, as the librettist of Bousset's Odes, and as an important literary contributor to French music at the turn of the eighteenth century. The source study is supplemented by a catalogue in the style of the Philidor Oeuvres database produced by the Centre de Musique Baroque de Versailles, containing all Bousset's known works, extant and lost. This exposition of Bousset's compositional output is prefaced by a biographical overview assembled principally from eighteenth century publications and archival documents.

There is a large body of literature showing that experiences of hospitalisation are often unpleasant and that the challenges adolescents encounter during hospitalisation can also be detrimental to their development. The researcher employed an action research model of cycles of planning, action and reflection to explore the potential for practice improvement in meeting the needs of hospitalised adolescents. In addition, young people's feedback on the sessions and input from supervisors also contributed to the researcher's planning. Personal goals in clinical practice and specific planning for the needs of individual participants were the starting points of each cycle. Subsequently, each cycle had a learning analysis to relate planning to action and to collect the knowledge for the next cycle or future practice. The researcher found that through scrutiny of her clinical work she was able to improve her professional practice.

The music and dance practices of the region are examined in the context of the wider social and cultural setting. Lak performance realities, are indivisible from kinship structures, ritual proceedings and spirituality. By contextualising Lak music and dance within the frame of the extensive and socially defining mortuary, rites my intention is to show how music and dance not only reflect but also create Lak realities.

Multiple studies have described in detail the mechanism of most of the steps carried out by DHQS with the exception of the final cyclisation step.  In this study, (3S)-3-fluoro-DAH7P and (3R)-3-fluoro-DAH7P (fluorinated analogues of DAH7P) were produced and assayed across three phylogenetically distinct sources of DHQS in order to determine the role of the enzyme during the cyclisation step of the reaction. Incubation of (3S)-3-fluoro-DAH7P with DHQS from Escherichia coli, Pyrococcus furiosus, and Kiwifruit resulted in the production of different ratios of (6S)-6-fluoro-DHQ and 1-epi-(6S)-6-fluoro-DHQ for each enzyme. In addition, enzyme catalysis showed a slowing of reaction rates when (3S)-3-fluoro-DAH7P was used, suggesting that the fluorine at C-3 is stabilising the enol pyranose. An increase in the stabilisation of the fluoro-enol pyranose would allow release of this substrate intermediate from the enzyme to compete with the on-going on-enzyme reaction. The differences in the ratio of products formed suggest that the cyclisation occurs in part on the enzyme and that the epimeric product arises only by an abortive reaction pathway where the (3S)-3-fluoro-enol pyranose is prematurely released and allowed to cyclise free in solution. Once in solution, the (3S)-3-fluoro-enol pyranose could undergo a conformational change in the ring leading to the formation of the epimeric product. Furthermore, it is suspected that the position of fluorine influences the likely transition-state in carbacycle formation leading to the production of the epimeric product. This research has illuminated the role of the enzyme in guiding the correct stereochemistry of the product and illustrates the important molecular interplay between the enzyme and substrate.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">antimicrobial agents</field><field name="subject">bacterial enzymes</field><field name="subject">enzyme reaction</field><field name="subject">lyases</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences::250100 Physical Chemistry (Incl.

EFA is employed in this study to assess the resource utilisation of international tourists visiting New Zealand. Tourism is one of the fastest growing industries in the world and the ecological sustainability of tourism is becoming more important term for managing tourism. This is becoming increasingly important with tourism identified as particularly as a significant contributor to carbon emissions. This study uses EFA to assess whether international tourists visiting New Zealand behave in a sustainable manner. Tourists are surveyed and classed into high, mid and low budget tourist types to gain a detailed account of their behaviour with particular reference to food, accommodation, transport, services, activities attractions, goods and waste. The EFA helps to identify areas of a tourist&#8217;s trip that have the greatest impact on the environment, thereby identifying ways to improve the sustainability of tourism in New Zealand. It was found that tourists generally consume more whilst on holiday than they do at home and more than New Zealand residents. The results show that international tourists&#8217; behaviour is sustainable and New Zealand has the ecological carrying capacity to allow the number of international tourists to increase without incurring any significant ecological costs to the country. It was found that there is a positive relationship between &#8216;high&#8217; income tourists and their ecological footprint and that independent travellers have a larger ecological footprint than the package travellers; however, package travellers have a larger food and housing ecological footprint than independent travellers. The energy footprint was the largest out of the six land types of a tourist&#8217;s ecological footprint. Food is the consumption category that is the largest contributor to a tourist&#8217;s ecological footprint.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ecological footprint analysis</field><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="subject">environmental impact</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science::300803 Natural resources management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1124</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards Improving Volcanic Mass Flow Hazard Assessment at New Zealand Stratovolcanoes: A thesis presented in fulfillment of the requirements for the Doctor of Philosophy in Earth Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Procter, Jonathan</field><field name="description">The most common hazards for communities surrounding mountain&#8208;forming stratovolcanoes are mass flows of a range of types. Determining their frequency,characteristics and distribution is a major focus of hazard mapping efforts. Recent improvements in computer power and numerical models have meant that simulation of mass flow scenarios is a new tool available for hazard analysis. Its application to hazard mapping, land use planning and emergency management awaits robust evaluation of the conditions under which simulation tools are effective. This study focuses on this question in attempting to improve mass&#8208;flow hazard assessments at the typical stratovolcanoes of Mts. Taranaki and Ruapehu in New Zealand. On Mt. Ruapehu, Titan2D modelling was applied to forecast behaviour of non&#8208;cohesive lahars in the Whangaehu River, primarily produced by Crater Lake break&#8208;outs, such as on 18 March 2007. The simulations were accurate in predicting inundation area, bifurcation, super&#8208;elevation, hydraulic ponding, velocity and travel times of the lahar to 9&#8208;10 km. A 6 x 10[exponent 6] m&#179; simulated granular flow had a minimum discharge of 1800&#8208;2100 m&#179;/s at the apex of the Whangaehu Fan, 9&#8208;10 km from source, comparable to all historic information. The modelling implied that it was highly unlikely for a flow of this nature to overtop a lahar training dyke (bund) at the fan&#8208;apex location and avulse northward into a more vulnerable catchment. Beyond this point, the model could not cope with the rapid and complex changes in rheology of these non&#8208;cohesive lahars. At Mt. Taranaki chronostratigraphic grouping of mapped past lahar deposits often clouds the actual series of landscape forming processes and hence variations in hazard that occurred over time. Here, patterns of mass flows following emplacement of a 7 km&#179; debris avalanche deposit were examined from field geology and Titan2D modelling to define a three&#8208;stage recovery process, where lahars of different types and sources were focused initially beside and later on top of the debris avalanche deposit for up to 10 000 years. Results from Titan2D were used to identify source areas of mass flows at different stages and their probable rheologies. Debris avalanche emplacement at Mt. Taranaki was investigated on the c. 7 ka B.P. Opua Formation with the help of Titan2D simulations to identify initial collapse parameters and major flow paths. Once again, the simulations were reliable in proximal reaches, but could not reproduce the rheological transformations from an initial collapsing/sliding pile through to a cohesive clay&#8208;rich flow with long runout. In a further example, past block&#8208;and&#8208;ash flows (BAFs) and dense pyroclastic flow deposits northwest of the current crater were analysed to define the range of realistic model parameters for Titan2D simulations. These could be incorporated inside aGeographic Information System to produce a gradational map of relative probabilities of inundation by future BAF events that took both modelling and geological variability into account. This study highlights that computational models are now reaching the stage where a holistic approach can be taken to hazard analysis that combines both geological mapping and simulation of mass flow scenarios in a probabilistic framework to provide better tools for decision makers and land&#8208;use planners.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology::260103 Vulcanology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1125</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Signalized fuzzy logic for diamond interchanges incorporating with fuzzy ramp system : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Engineering in Mechatronics at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Pham, Cao Van</field><field name="description">New dynamic signal control methods such as fuzzy logic and artificial intelligence developed recently mainly focused on isolated intersection. In this study, a Fuzzy Logic Control for a Diamond Interchange incorporating with Fuzzy Ramp System (FLDI) has been developed. The signalization of two closely spaced intersections in a diamond interchange is a complicated problem that includes both increasing the diamond interchange capacity and reduce delays at the same time. The model comprises of three main modules. The Fuzzy Phase Timing module controls the current phase green time extension, the Phase Selection module select the next phase based on the pre-defined phase sequence or phase logics and the Fuzzy Ramp module determines the cycle time of the ramp meter bases on current traffic volumes and conditions of the interchanges and the motorways. The developed FLDI model has been compared with the traffic actuated simulation with respects to flow rates and the average delays of the vehicles. The model of an actual diamond interchange is described and simulated by using AIMSUN (Advanced Interactive Microscopic Simulator for Urban and Non-Urban Network) software. Simulation results show the FLDI model outperformed the traffic actuated models with lower system total travel time, average delay and improvements in downstream average speed and average delay.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">traffic flow</field><field name="subject">traffic intersections</field><field name="subject">traffic controllers</field><field name="subject">traffic signal control</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290800 Civil Engineering::290803 Transport engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1126</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Preservation of phase space structure in symplectic integration : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Mathematics at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">O'Neale, Dion Robert James</field><field name="description">This thesis concerns the study of geometric numerical integrators and how they preserve phase space structures of Hamiltonian ordinary differential equations. We examine the invariant sets of differential equations and investigate which numerical integrators preserve these sets, and under what conditions. We prove that when periodic orbits of Hamiltonian differential equations are discretized by a symplectic integrator they are preserved in the numerical solution when the integrator step size is not resonant with the frequency of the periodic orbit. The preservation of periodic orbits is the result of a more general theorem which proves preservation of lower dimensional invariant tori from dimension zero (fixed points) up to full dimension (the same as the number of degrees of freedom for the differential equation). The proof involves  first embedding the numerical trajectory in a non-autonomous flow and then applying a KAM type theorem for flows to achieve the result. This avoids having to prove a KAM type theorem directly for the symplectic map which is generally difficult to do. We also numerically investigate the break up of periodic orbits when the integrator's step size is resonant with the frequency of the orbit. We study the performance of trigonometric integrators applied to highly oscillatory Hamiltonian differential equations with constant frequency. We show that such integrators may not be as practical as was first thought since they suffer from higher order resonances and can perform poorly at preserving various properties of the di fferential equation. We show that, despite not being intended for such systems, the midpoint rule performs no worse than many of the trigonometric integrators, and indeed, better than some. Lastly, we present a numerical study of a Hamiltonian system consisting of two magnetic moments in an applied magnetic field. We investigate the effect of both the choice of integrator and the choice of coordinate system on the numerical solutions of the system. We show that by a good choice of integrator (in this case the generalised leapfrog method) one can preserve phase space structures of the system without having to resort to a change of coordinates that introduce a coordinate singularity.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">geometric integrator</field><field name="subject">differential equations</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::230100 Mathematics::230107 Differential, difference and integral equations</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1127</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biological phosphorus removal by microalgae in waste stabilisation ponds : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Environmental Engineering at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Powell, Nicola</field><field name="description">Waste stabilisation ponds (WSP) are an important wastewater treatment technology used by thousands of communities around the world. Unfortunately, phosphorus removal in WSP is generally low and inconsistent. The aim of this work was to investigate biological phosphorus removal by microalgae in WSP. Luxury uptake of phosphorus, which is the accumulation of polyphosphate, is known to occur in microalgae in natural systems such as lakes; however, this mechanism has not previously been studied under WSP conditions. Three methods were used in the laboratory to investigate luxury uptake and it was shown for the first time that luxury uptake of phosphorus can occur in microalgae under typical WSP conditions. Acid-insoluble polyphosphate (AISP) is a form of phosphorus storage and acid soluble polyphosphate (ASP) is used for synthesis of cellular constituents. However, the findings of this thesis indicate that ASP may also act as a form of short term storage. The environmental factors influencing luxury uptake were investigated using laboratory experiments conducted under controlled conditions. The key environmental factors were the phosphate concentration in the wastewater, light intensity and temperature. A higher phosphate concentration increased the amount of ASP accumulation and also resulted in AISP being stored within the cells instead of being consumed for growth. Higher light intensity increased ASP accumulation, but as a consequence of elevated growth, the ASP was rapidly consumed. Temperature influenced the rate of AISP accumulation and little if any was accumulated at low temperatures. The fate of polyphosphate in the sludge layer was also studied and it was shown that polyphosphate was degraded resulting in phosphate release. Therefore, to maximise phosphorus removal the microalgae needs to be harvested. Field work showed that at times the biomass contained almost four times the amount of phosphorus required for growth which confirms that luxury uptake does indeed occur in full-scale WSP.

Bodybuilders have often been construed as being broadly similar &#8211; excessively muscular people, who build their physiques for sometimes questionable reasons, such as for a cover for internal insecurities. Bodybuilding is often considered acceptable for men because muscles are symbolic of masculinity &#8211; on women they are seen as unnatural and unfeminine. While external critiques have tended to portray bodybuilders in a negative light, phenomenological accounts have often emphasised participants&#8217; positive experiences. Existing research concerning the identity of bodybuilders has only scratched the surface. Identities reflect an understanding of &#8216;who one is&#8217; &#8211; the continuing meanings people associate with themselves and as members of social groups. Furthermore, bodybuilders are not just &#8216;bodybuilders&#8217;, they are also people. Bodybuilding is not their only identity, it is one of their numerous identities. This research explored not only the meanings participants attribute to bodybuilding, but also how it is lived and experienced within the broader self. A phenomenological-inspired, mixed methodological approach was adopted using quantitative and qualitative methods. Participants were male and female competitive bodybuilders of varying ages residing in New Zealand. They were at different stages in their bodybuilding career and represented a range of competitive experience. A postal questionnaire was completed by 382 competitive bodybuilders, and in-depth interviews were conducted with 32 participants. Photo elicitation was also used. A key outcome of this research has been to highlight the changeable, complex, contradictory nature of bodybuilder identities. Fluidity, ambiguity and pluralism existed amongst the everyday practices and identities of participants. Although bodybuilders shared commonalities, their identities were not identical or stable: bodybuilding could be about transforming the body,looking good, being competitive, creative and/or healthy. It could be a lifestyle, involve personal challenge, self-development, social belonging and friendship. Identity experiences could be influenced by personality, background, gender, sexuality, age, ethnicity, work, family and church. The bodybuilder identities were also found to be closely connected to participant perceptions concerning their natural body, genetic advantages and limitations. Furthermore, their identities were not depthless but entailed commitment, passion, mental, social and emotional dimensions. Competitive bodybuilding was a meaningful activity, that often left an indelible mark and continued to shape participant lives even after they had ceased competitive bodybuilding.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bodybuilding</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::359900 Other Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1129</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of a reliable and valid netball intermittent activity test : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Sport and Exercise Science at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ryan, Helen Joanne</field><field name="description">The purpose of the present investigation was to identify the exercise intensity of netball match play in order to assist in the development of a Netball Intermittent Activity Test (NIAT). A further aim was to assess the criterion validity and the test-retest reliability of the NIAT.  Eleven female netball players (21.4 &#177; 3.1 years, 1.73 &#177; 0.06 m, 69.3 &#177; 5.3 kg and 48.4 &#177; 4.9 ml&#8226;kg-1&#8226;min&#8211;1 mean &#177; SD, age, height, body mass and  VO2max, respectively) volunteered to participate in the study.   Heart rate data was recorded for all participants from at least two full 60 minute games during Premier Club competition.  Individual maximum heart rate values were acquired for all subjects from the performance of the Multistage Fitness Test, and used to transform heart rate recordings into percent maximum heart rate (%HRmax).  Patterns in %HRmax were used to indicate positional grouping when developing the NIAT from time motion analysis data.  Subjects performed two trials of the NIAT separated by at least seven days. Physiological and performance markers were measured systematically throughout the NIAT.  Exercise intensity as denoted by %HRmax significantly decreased from the first half of match play to the second half (90.4 &#177; 2.7% v 88.3 &#177; 2.8%; p&lt;0.05).  Significant differences (p&lt;0.05) were observed between positional groups and led to the grouping of Defence (D), Centre Court (CC), and Attack (A) players for NIAT performance.  Comparisons of %HRmax between match play and NIAT performance indicated that the NIAT had good criterion validity for D (match Mdn = 92.52% vs. NIAT Mdn = 86.27%, p&gt;0.05) and A (match Mdn = 86.95% vs. NIAT Mdn = 82.93%, p&gt;0.05) players, but that %HRmax during the NIAT (Mdn = 79.70%) was significantly lower than match play (Mdn = 89.70%) for CC group (p&lt;0.05).   Measures of 5 m sprint performance (1.27 &#177; 0.06 s v 1.25 &#177; 0.06 s; p&gt;0.05; r=0.66, p&lt;0.001), vertical jump height (29.12 &#177; 4.17 cm v 28.82 &#177; 3.60 cm; p&gt;0.05; r=0.91, p&lt;0.001), circuit time (107.49 &#177; 3.22 s v 107.89 &#177; 4.27 s; p&gt;0.05; r=0.72, p&gt;0.001) and %HRmax (82.56 &#177; 4.66% v 81.03 &#177; 4.13%; p&gt;0.05; r=0.82, p&lt;0.001) for NIAT1 vs. NIAT2 indicated good test-retest reliability.  These data suggest that netball players experience a reduction in exercise intensity over the duration of a game, with exercise intensity being related to on-court position.  Whilst the NIAT appears to be a repeatable activity pattern, it is not a good simulation of physiological strain for all positional groups.  More work is required in order to create a netball simulation that is both reliable and valid for all players.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">netball</field><field name="subject">exercise intensity</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321400 Human Movement and Sports Science::321401 Exercise physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1130</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Conservation issues for Hochstetter's frog (Leiopelma hochstetteri): monitoring techniques and chytridiomycosis prevalence in the Auckland region, New Zealand : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Conservation Biology at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Puig, Virginia Moreno</field><field name="description">Amphibians are suffering extinctions and range contractions globally. This is caused by numerous factors and most of them are related to human activities. The overall aim of this thesis was to make a significant contribution to the conservation of the endemic amphibian Leiopelma hochstetteri through research. This was achieved by focusing in two of the main conservation issues for this species, the need for standardised and robust monitoring techniques to detect trends and changes in populations, and the determination of the prevalence of chytridiomycosis, caused by the amphibian chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis). Two populations of the Auckland Region were selected for this study, one on the mainland (Waitakere Ranges) and the only known offshore island population of this species (Great Barrier Island). For both study sites different monitoring methods were used to obtain some population parameters. Site occupancy models of MacKenzie et al. (2002) gave reliable site-specific estimations of occupancy and detection probability using covariate information and presence-absence data collected from 50 sites in the Waitakere Ranges and four repeated visits during 2008. Elevation and distance searched were found to have an important effect on occupancy levels, while time taken to search the site was important variable determining detection probabilities. Also, parameters were estimated for three age classes separately. Statistical models were used to infer abundance from occupancy analysis, and results were compared with the distribution of relative abundances obtained from repeated transect counts and an established sight/re-sight criterion. In addition, the use of surrogate measures for relative abundance was explored. Detection probability and the distance to first frog found were found to have a significant correlation with relative abundance. These measures can be used to infer relative abundance in future site occupancy surveys. Two surveys and a pilot site occupancy survey were conducted on Great Barrier Island, and presence of frogs was confirmed atthe northern block, and in a small seepage in the central block. No new locations were found. Waitakere Ranges and Great Barrier Is. populations were tested for the presence of chytridiomycosis, and all frogs sampled tested negative (n = 124) which means that if present chytridiomycosis prevalence is lower than 5% with a 95% confidence interval. This and previous evidence suggests that L. hochstetteri may be resistant or immune to the disease. However, to confirm this additional studies are needed.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Frogs</field><field name="subject">endangered species</field><field name="subject">environmental monitoring</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science::300804 Environmental impact assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1132</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthetic test patterns and compression artefact distortion metrics for image codecs : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Engineering at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Punchihewa, Amal</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a framework of test methodology to assess spatial domain compression artefacts produced by image and intra-frame coded video codecs. Few researchers have studied this broad range of artefacts. A taxonomy of image and video compression artefacts is proposed. This is based on the point of origin of the artefact in the image communication model. This thesis presents objective evaluation of distortions known as artefacts due to image and intra-frame coded video compression made using synthetic test patterns. The American National Standard Institute document ANSI T1 801 qualitatively defines blockiness, blur and ringing artefacts. These definitions have been augmented with quantitative definitions in conjunction with test patterns proposed. A test and measurement environment is proposed in which the codec under test is exercised using a portfolio of test patterns. The test patterns are designed to highlight the artefact under study. Algorithms have been developed to detect and measure individual artefacts based on the characteristics of respective artefacts. Since the spatial contents of the original test patterns form known structural details, the artefact distortion metrics based on the characteristics of those artefacts are clean and swift to calculate. Distortion metrics are validated using a human vision system inspired modern image quality metric. Blockiness, blur and ringing artefacts are evaluated for representative codecs using proposed synthetic test patterns. Colour bleeding due to image and video compression is discussed with both qualitative and quantitative definitions for the colour bleeding artefacts introduced. The image reproduction performance of a few codecs was evaluated to ascertain the utility of proposed metrics and test patterns.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">image quality</field><field name="subject">image compression</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280200 Artificial Intelligence and Signal and Image Processing::280203 Image processing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1131</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Expression of ACC oxidase genes in white clover (Trifolium repens L.) roots in response to phosphate supply : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Plant Molecular Biology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Roldan, Marissa B.</field><field name="description">The differential expression of members of the Trifolium repens ACC oxidase (TR-ACO) gene family and accumulation of TR-ACO proteins in white clover roots, and the temporal TR-ACO gene expression and TR-ACO protein accumulation in response to phosphate (Pi) stress has been investigated. Four-node stolon cuttings of wild type and transgenic white clover (designated TR-ACOp::GUS and TR-ACO1p::mGFP5-ER) plants were rooted and acclimatised in Hoagland&#8217;s solution, and then subjected to either a Pi sufficiency (1 mM Pi) treatment or a Pi depletion (10 &#181;M Pi) treatment over a designated time course. Using semi quantitative Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (sqRT-PCR) and gene-specific primers it has been determined that the TR-ACO genes are differentially expressed in the roots of white clover. The TR-ACO1 transcript abundance was greater in the lateral roots when compared to the main roots. By immunodetection analysis using antibodies raised against TR-ACO1, recognition of a protein of expected size (ca. 36 kDa) was also greater in the lateral roots. The tissue-specific localisation of TR-ACO1 promoter activity was investigated first by light microscopy using a single genetic line of white clover transformed with a TR-ACO1p::GUS gene construct, and results then confirmed by confocal microscopy using several genetically independent lines of transgenic plants transformed with a TR-ACO1p::mGFP5 ER gene construct. In these lines, the TR-ACO1 promoter activity was primarily located in the meristem of the main and lateral roots, lateral root primordia as well as in the pericycle of the root with nodes of expression in the emerging lateral roots, suggesting a role for ethylene in the development of young tissues where cells are actively dividing. In terms of TR-ACO2, greater transcript abundance and protein accumulation of TR-ACO2 were also observed in the lateral roots when compared to the main roots. Histochemical GUS staining of roots of a single genetically-independent line transformed with a TR-ACO2p::GUS construct showed predominant promoter activity in the mature tissues of both the main and lateral roots but not in the meristematic tissues. In contrast, TR-ACO3 showed greater transcript abundance in the main roots relative to the lateral roots, and the promoter activity, as determined using a single genetically- independent line of TR-ACO3p::GUS transformed plants was predominantly in the mature tissues of the main roots In response to Pi depletion, the members of TR-ACO gene family were temporally expressed in the white clover roots. Using sqRT-PCR, the TR-ACO1 transcript abundance was greater in Pi depleted roots at 12 h and 24 h after Pi depletion in both wild type plants and in the one genetically-independent line of white clover transformed with the TR-ACO1p::mGFP5-ER construct examined. Similarly, by western analysis using both a-TR-ACO1 and commercially available a-GFP antibodies (for the transformed line), a greater accumulation of proteins was consistently observed in Pi depleted roots from the first up to the seventh day after Pi depletion. By confocal microscopy, it was determined for several genetically-independent line of white clover transformed with TR-ACO1p::mGFP5-ER that under Pi depletion more intense GFP fluorescence over a time course of 1 d, 4 d, and 7 d was observed, when compared to plants grown under Pi sufficiency. For TR-ACO2, there was no significant difference in transcript accumulation and protein accumulation in response to short term Pi depletion of up to seven days. However, at 15 d and 21 d after Pi depletion there was a greater protein accumulation in the roots of Pi depleted plants relative to the Pi sufficient roots. Further, when main and lateral roots were compared, a greater protein accumulation occurred in the lateral roots. For TR-ACO3, there was no consistent trend of transcript accumulation in response to Pi depletion over a 24 h period. While a marked reduction in transcript accumulation was noted in Pi depleted roots at 1h, 12 h, 24 h, there was an increase in transcript accumulation at 6 h and 18 h after Pi depletion, indicating that factors other than Pi supply may be affecting gene regulation. Root morphological studies revealed an increase in the main root length and lateral root production in white clover in response to Pi depletion with a greatest growth rate noted between the sixth and ninth day after Pi depletion, and this period overlapped with accumulation of TR-ACO1 protein suggesting a role for ethylene in the Pi stress induced lateral root production in white clover. The differential regulation of the three TR-ACO genes in white clover roots in response to Pi depletion further suggests the divergence in terms of regulation of the ethylene biosynthetic pathway, which may play an important role in fine tuning the responses of plants to particular environmental cues.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">white clover</field><field name="subject">gene expression</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany::270402 Plant physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1133</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding the experience of high workplace engagement in a team environment: workplace contributors and influences : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Psychology at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Ralph, Kirsten</field><field name="description">This research endeavors to understand people's experience of working in a highly engaged team, and specifically to understand the aspects of the work environment that contribute to their engagement. As participants' own perspectives and views are central to gaining a rich insight, a qualitative approach is taken. Twenty-five participants from a large government agency who had worked in highly engaged teams took part in five focus group discussions. The discussions were analysed following thematic analysis techniques, and a thematic network of three interrelated layers was developed to explain the findings. This thematic network focuses more on people's experiences of working in an engaging environment and the feelings associated with these experiences, whereas the literature focuses more on describing engagement and the aspects of the environment which contributes to engagement. At the base of the engagement model, developed from this research, are the seven aspects of the workplace that contribute to people's engagement: leadership; challenging and or varied work; access to knowledge; latitude and responsibility; social atmosphere; safety, trust and support; and respect. Above this are the feelings people connect with working in this environment: feeling at ease and relaxed, having a sense of achievement and satisfaction, and being valued or validated. The top layer of the model is the overall sense of what working in an engaging environment is about: feeling good in one's self. Three further observations are made. Firstly, the team is an important aspect in people's engagement, and a duality exists where the person and the team simultaneously influence each other. Secondly, engagement is an active process; it changes over time, has a lifecycle over people's careers, actively transfers between people and exists within a reinforcing loop. Lastly, engagement within this organisation, refers to a connection to the work or workplace: people were interested, participated, enjoyed and were connected to their work, but maintained a separation. There was no sense of merging one's identity with the work as noted within some of the literature on engagement.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">teamwork</field><field name="subject">workplace engagement</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380108 Industrial and organisational psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1134</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of migration on development in Tuvalu : a case study of PAC migrants and their families : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Philosophy in Development Studies at Massey University, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Simati, Sunema Pie</field><field name="description">International migration and development have been traditionally treated as separate policy portfolios; however, today the two are increasingly viewed as interlinked. While the development status of a country could determine migration flows, migration can, in turn, contribute positively to national development, including economic, social and cultural progress. Consequently, if migration is not well managed, it can pose development challenges to a country&#8217;s development and progress. Therefore, partnership through greater networking between countries of origin and destination is needed to fully utilise the development potential of migration. For Tuvalu, migration has remained a vital ingredient for economic development and more importantly, the welfare of its people. The implementation of New Zealand&#8217;s Pacific Access Category (PAC) scheme in 2002 offered for the first time a formal migration opportunity for permanent or long-term migration of Tuvaluans. The PAC scheme allows 75 Tuvaluans per year to apply for permanent residence to work and live in New Zealand, provided they meet the scheme&#8217;s conditions. The goal of this research is to investigate, more than five years after PAC&#8217;s implementation, the ways in which long-term migration of Tuvaluans, through the PAC scheme, has benefited Tuvalu. To give a broader perspective on the issues explored in this study, the views of Tuvaluan leaders, as significant players in traditional Tuvaluan society, are included, in addition to the perspective of migrants&#8217; families in Tuvalu and the migrants themselves in New Zealand. Combining transnationalist and developmental approaches as a theoretical framework, this thesis explores how Tuvalu&#8217;s mobile and immobile populations, through articulation of transnationalism, enhance family welfare, and grassroots and national development. The eight weeks&#8217; fieldwork in Tuvalu and Auckland demonstrated that the physical separation of Tuvaluans from one another through migration does not limit the richness of the interactions and connections between them. In fact, the existence of active networking between island community groups and other Tuvaluan associations in Auckland and in Tuvalu strengthens the Tuvaluan culture both abroad and at home, thus ensuring strong family and community coherence. Maintaining transnational networks and practices is identified as of great significance to grassroots and community-based development in Tuvalu. However, the benefits of long-term migration can only be sustained as long as island loyalty, or loto fenua, and family kinship stays intact across borders, and networking amongst families, communities and church remains active.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Emigration and immigration</field><field name="subject">Economic development</field><field name="subject">Tuvalu</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics::340200 Applied Economics::340213 Economic development and growth</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1140</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Monthly house price indices and their applications in New Zealand : a thesis presented in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, Department of Economics and Finance, College of Business, Massey University</field><field name="creator">Shi, Song</field><field name="description">Developing timely and reliable house price indices is of interest worldwide, because these measures influence consumer behaviour, inflation targeting, and spot and futures markets. Several techniques for constructing a constant quality price index are available in the literature, but these methods are difficult to apply in localities where market transaction data is limited. Since house price movements are a local phenomena, improving the timeliness of a quality controlled price index at local housing market levels in small countries like New Zealand is a challenge. This thesis comprises three essays that focused on improving the timeliness of reported house price indices at the local market levels. The timeliness issue examined in this thesis has not previously been rigorously investigated and this makes the results of this thesis both important and unique for the benefit of both academic research and practical application. Essay One reviews the sale price appraisal ratio (SPAR) method, which has been applied since the 1960s for producing local house price indices at a semi-annual and quarterly basis in New Zealand. Utilizing a variety of statistical tests and comparing this index with the repeat sales and median price index result in the study highlighting the potential of, as well as the problems associated with, a price index produced by the SPAR method at a monthly level. In the following two essays, monthly price indices are tested using empirical real estate research methods in order to examine their usefulness in exploring the research questions as well as revealing the statistical differences between them. Essay Two studies the relationship between sale price and trading volume, and the ripple effect of local house price comovements. The results show that the trading volume generally leads the sale price in the long-run and the ripple effect is most likely constrained within regions. In Essay Two, the monthly SPAR index produces similar statistical results to those estimated by the repeat sales index for large cities. Essay Three is a study on the market efficiency of housing markets. It is found the local housing market is neither weak-form nor semi-strong form efficient. Local house price movements are strongly correlated and are mean reverting towards their long-run equilibrium. It is further concluded that monthly price indices for small cities are problematic due to the problem of small sample size. Overall, the findings in this thesis show monthly house price indices can be generated by using the SPAR method at local market levels. However, this potential is limited to large cities. Further research can focus on improving the quality of monthly price indices for large cities.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Housing prices</field><field name="subject">Price indices</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics::340200 Applied Economics::340203 Finance economics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1136</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The physiological basis of vigour control by apple rootstocks - an unresolved paradigm : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Plant Physiology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">van Hooijdonk, Benedict Michael</field><field name="description">For millennia, scions have been grafted onto dwarfing apple rootstocks to reduce final tree size. However, it is unclear how scion architecture is first modified by the dwarfing apple rootstock, the time from grafting when this occurs and the endogenous hormonal signalling mechanisms that may cause the initial modifications in growth that then define the future architecture of the scion. In this study, the dwarfing (M.9) rootstock significantly decreased the mean total shoot length and node number of &#8216;Royal Gala&#8217; apple scions by the end of the first year of growth from grafting when compared with rootstock(s) of greater vigour (MM.106, M.793 and a &#8216;Royal Gala&#8217; rootstock control). Similarly, the auxin transport inhibitor 1-N-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) applied to the stem of vigorous rootstocks significantly decreased mean total shoot length and node number of the scion, and the architectural changes imposed were generally similar to those imposed by M.9. For example, both treatments decreased the mean length and node number of the primary shoot, reduced the formation of secondary axes on the primary shoot and caused a greater proportion of primary and secondary shoots (if present) to terminate growth early. Decreased formation of secondary axes imposed by both treatments was reversed by applying the cytokinin benzylaminopurine (BAP) repeatedly to the scion, whilst applications of gibberellins (GA4+7) reduced the proportion of primary and secondary shoots that terminated growth early, therefore increasing the final mean length and node number of these shoot types. Both M.9 and NPA also significantly decreased the final mean dry mass and length of the root system. Given these general similarities, it is proposed that the basipetal IAA signal is of central importance in rootstock-induced scion dwarfing, and that a shoot/root/shoot signalling mechanism may exist whereby the stem tissue of the M.9 rootstock decreases the basipetal transport of IAA to the root during summer, thereby decreasing root growth and the amount of rootproduced cytokinin and gibberellin transported to scion. Reduced amounts of cytokinin transported to the scion may decrease branching, whilst reduced amounts of gibberellins may decrease the duration for which a large proportion of primary and secondary shoots grow. Analysis of endogenous hormones for newly grafted composite &#8216;Royal Gala&#8217; apple trees on rootstocks of different vigour provided some additional support for these ideas. It is recommended that future studies elucidate what unique properties of the M.9 bark act to restrict IAA transport, whilst it is concluded that gene(s) regulating rootstock-induced scion dwarfing are likely to control processes within the rootstock that modify the metabolism of IAA, its basipetal transport and the subsequent synthesis of root-produced vigour-inducing hormones including cytokinins and gibberellins.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">scions</field><field name="subject">grafting</field><field name="subject">Royal Gala apple</field><field name="subject">dwarfing</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300300 Horticulture::300302 Plant growth and development</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1137</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Challenges in communication : a critical analysis of a student music therapist's techniques in working with special needs children : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of Music Therapy at the New Zealand School of Music, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Savaiinaea, Chelsea Makere</field><field name="description">This paper describes the processes under taken by a student music therapist to improve her clinical practice and enhance the quality of service provided to children with profound and multiple disabilities.

Using Self-Determination Theory, I argued introjected and identified motivations were applicable to this occupational domain, and have differential effects on well-being. Introjected motivation would be positively related to hedonic well-being and burnout, while identified motivation would be positively related to eudaimonic well-being and vitality. Orientations to happiness and passion were proposed as mediating these relationships. An online quantitative questionnaire was used in the first phase of data collection. Respondents were N = 82 humanitarian health workers. A semi-structured interview methodology was used in the second phase. Participants were N = 5 humanitarian health workers. Path analyses revealed neither introjected nor identified motivation was significantly related to vitality or hedonic vs. eudaimonic well-being. Both motivations had significant direct effects on burnout, albeit in the opposite direction to hypotheses. Passion moderated the relationship between motivation and burnout. Additional path analyses showed obsessive passion mediated the path between introjected motivation and emotional exhaustion. Harmonious passion mediated the path between identified motivation and diminished personal accomplishment. Both obsessive and harmonious passion mediated the paths between each motivation and depersonalisation, although identified motivation had the strongest relationship with this aspect of burnout. Interview data supported the majority of quantitative findings. The results suggest the motivations underlying engagement in humanitarian work, are related to the development of burnout. The mediational effect of passion determines which aspect of burnout will be most prevalent. The findings have applicability to the design and implementation of recruitment strategies, and programs aimed at the treatment and prevention of burnout in workers, both pre- and post-deployment to humanitarian situations.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">introjected motivation</field><field name="subject">identified motivation</field><field name="subject">humanitarian work</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380108 Industrial and organisational psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1138</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A high frequency change, which is both inducible and reversible, results in altered colony morphology of a fungal symbiont (Neotyphodium lolii) and dwarfing of its grass host (Lolium perenne) : this thesis is presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science (MSc) in Microbiology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Simpson, Wayne Roydon</field><field name="description">Fungal endophytes of the genus Neotyphodium form stable symbiotic associations, with grasses, that are symptomless and generally considered to be mutualistic. The benefits that these fungi confer to their grass hosts are exploited in pastoral agriculture systems. The production of a range of secondary metabolites, specifically alkaloids including peramine and ergovaline can give their host plants an ecological advantage in certain environments. Neotyphodium endophytes are asexual and have lost the ability to transfer horizontally between hosts making seed transmission a vital feature of the association. This thesis reports the occurrence of phenotypically different perennial ryegrass plants (Lolium perenne) in a population infected with Neotyphodium lolii. Here we show that the change in the plants is directly attributable to a variant endophyte that they host. Isolation of the variant endophyte reveals a change in colony growth compared to the wild-type resident endophyte in the population, which has a white and cottony phenotype. Colonies of the variant endophyte are smaller than wild-type colonies and mucoid, with hyphal filaments forming aggregates. Evidence shows that the switch between colony morphologies occurs at a very high frequency, is reversible, and appears to be environmentally induced. This suggests that the switching phenomenon involves gene regulation rather than mutation. When endophyte-free plants are infected, with either white and cottony (wild-type) or mucoid (variant) fungal colonies, they assume a morphology consistent with the state of the fungus at the time of inoculation, that is normal or dwarfed, respectively. In addition, re-isolation of endophyte from either normal or dwarfed plants always yields white and cottony or mucoid colonies, respectively, suggesting that the host environment stabilizes the state of the fungus. Proteomic profiling revealed differences in protein expression between plants infected with either the wild-type or mucoid fungus. Furthermore, host plants containing the mucoid fungus have never flowered or produced seed. Thus, if this change in the fungal symbiont occurs in a competitive natural environment the mucoid fungus and its host plant may not persist beyond the first generation. This thesis provides insights into the plastic nature of fungal endophyte/grass symbiota and discusses possible mechanisms for the observed morphological switching in culture and host dwarfing.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">perennial ryegrass</field><field name="subject">endophytes</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270300 Microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1139</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Strategies for New Zealand manufacturing small and medium sized enterprises going global : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Business Studies in Management at Massey University, Turitea, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Watts, Tony</field><field name="description">The strategies to employ when a small to medium sized enterprise (SME) enters the international market are important issues for a business to consider.  This research study addresses the question &#8220;What strategies will position New Zealand manufacturing small and medium sized enterprises for international markets?&#8221;  It is intended to compare various strategies for going global, discovering these through a literature review and personal interviews with New Zealand businesses who have successfully globalised.  The research studies globalisation within manufacturing small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) in New Zealand.  It explores strategies available in order to discover their advantages and disadvantages, and suggests key strategic directions for New Zealand manufacturing SME&#8217;s to use when entering into international markets.  The research is intended to benefit New Zealand SME&#8217;s considering entering the international market place, which in turn will contribute towards benefiting New Zealand as a whole as it endeavours to position itself in the international competitive arena.  Specific strategies for New Zealand manufacturing SME&#8217;s wishing to establish global markets are explored with implications for theory, research, and business practices.  A case study approach was adopted, with multiple research methods used to gather information for the study.  An experience survey in the form of personal interviews was used to gather a range of views from people with knowledge and experience in exporting to international markets.  Documents were analysed, together with information gained through the interviews to compile case histories of the businesses that participated in this research.  Strategies relevant to going global were identified in a literature review and these strategies were compared with actions and directions taken by the businesses interviewed.  The analysis of the findings reveals congruence with theoretical strategies for globalisation of SMEs identified in previous studies; however it was found that decisions made when going global were highly dependent on the individual circumstances that a business finds itself in, rather than committing to strategies based on assumptions from academic studies.  The businesses involved in this study went global through opportunities more so than strategic purpose.  They had not set out to be a global enterprise, however when the opportunities arose their globalisation effort needed total commitment.  Their experiences are discussed in this study and have relevance for other firms looking to go global.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">International markets</field><field name="subject">small businesses</field><field name="subject">globalisation strategies</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1141</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of isolation from mammalian predators on the anti-predator behaviours of the North Island robin (Petroica longipes) : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Conservation Biology at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Whitwell, Sarah Margaret</field><field name="description">Conservation in New Zealand has begun to focus heavily on the restoration of degraded mainland ecosystems and the reintroduction of native species that have become locally extinct. In many cases the individuals that are selected for reintroduction are harvested from &#8216;mammal-free&#8217; offshore islands. This thesis examines the effects of isolation from mammalian predators on the predator avoidance behaviours and predator recognition abilities of New Zealand birds using the North Island robin as a model. It also investigates whether any effects of isolation from mammalian predators has a lasting impact on mainland populations founded by individuals from offshore islands. Nest site selection behaviours were compared across three populations that are exposed to different suites of predators and have differing translocation histories; Benneydale, Tiritiri Matangi and Wenderholm. Point height intercept and point-centred quarter surveys were used to compare habitat availability between the sites and to compare nest sites with the available habitat. Eight nest characteristic variables were also compared across the three sites using a principle component analysis. Benneydale nests were located higher in the trees and were more concealed than nests at the other two sites. Nests on Tiritiri Matangi were supported by large numbers of thin branches and were located toward the periphery of the nest tree. Unfortunately these differences are very difficult to interpret due to a high degree of variation in the habitat types present at the three sites. The anti-predator behaviours initiated in response to a model stoat, model morepork and control were used to test the ability of nesting robins to recognise the threat that each of these treatments might pose to nest success. Behavioural variables were compared between Benneydale, Tiritiri Matangi and Wenderholm using a response intensity scoring system and a principle component analysis. The results indicated that isolation from mammalian predators on Tiritiri Matangi has suppressed the ability of robins on the island to recognise the predatory threat posed by a stoat. They also suggest that the intense mammal control carried out at Wenderholm may have inhibited the ability of local robins to produce strong anti-predator responses when faced with a stoat.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">predator recognition</field><field name="subject">predatory threats</field><field name="subject">island bird sanctuaries</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science::300802 Wildlife and habitat management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1142</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effectiveness of a brief psychoeducational intervention for people with schizophrenia and their families : a dissertation presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Psychology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Moxon, Alicia M.</field><field name="description">In an attempt to replicate and extend previous research, the present study conducted a brief psychoeducational intervention through community organisations designed to overcome methodological shortcomings of past studies. The two session intervention (one session with follow-up phone call) sought to establish if a brief community intervention was effective in both improving family members&#8217; knowledge about schizophrenia and various other indicators linked to improved client functioning. People with schizophrenia and their family members (N = 50) were recruited into a controlled trial of a brief educational intervention. Clients and their corresponding key family members were randomly allocated to a treatment group or a wait-list control group. Measures included those reflecting knowledge about schizophrenia, expressed emotion, perceived coping ability, burden of care and distress. Analyses showed that knowledge increased significantly after the intervention and not after the control condition and was maintained at a nine-month follow-up. Family members&#8217; and clients&#8217; expressed emotion ratings significantly decreased from pre- to post-test with changes in total expressed emotion scores improving across treatment by over twice the magnitude compared to the control condition. All gains were maintained at the nine-month follow-up, with continuing improvement seen in family members&#8217; intrusiveness ratings. A similar pattern of findings was reflected on other indices, with significant improvements in burden of care, coping and distress that were more a function of intervention than the control condition. All gains were maintained at the nine-month follow-up. Additionally, assessment of relapse rates at this follow-up interval indicated that no client had relapsed. Overall the results suggested that although knowledge increased as a result of education, the improvements in all indicators other than knowledge appeared to be due to education combined with some non-specific factors. These non-specific factors may have included expectancy effects, setting effects, sampling bias and other possibilities. These issues are considered in terms of implementation of brief programs in supportive community settings and in terms of future research.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">psychoeducation</field><field name="subject">patient education</field><field name="subject">coping ability</field><field name="subject">burden of care</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380107 Health, clinical and counselling psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1143</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling avian influenza in bird-human systems : this thesis is presented in the partial fulfillment of the requirement for the degree of Masters of Information Science in Mathematics at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Zhao, Yue</field><field name="description">In 1997, the  first human case of avian influenza infection was reported in Hong Kong.

Because of its capability to handle nonlinear and non-stationary problems, fuzzy logic based ramp metering algorithms have been always considered as an extremely suitable control measures to handle a complex nonlinear traffic system. This thesis proposes a genetic fuzzy approach to design a traffic-responsive ramp control algorithm for an isolated onramp. For a local ramp meter algorithm, the problem could be described as the inflow optimization of on-ramp, based on the evaluation of motorway traffic condition. If the inflow of on-ramp is considered as the decision variable, the ramp control problem could be treated as a nonlinear optimization problem of maximizing the evaluation function. The adaptive genetic fuzzy approach is actually a control approach to maximize the inflow of on-ramp under the restriction of evaluation function. In this thesis, a well-known fuzzy logic based ramp metering algorithms developed by Bogenberger is introduced and implemented with an on-ramp congestion model of Constellation Drive Interchange in a stochastic microscopic traffic simulator, Aimsun. To improve the performance of fuzzy control system, genetic algorithm is applied to tune the parameterized membership function of each fuzzy input to maintain the flow density of motorway blow the estimated congestion density. The performances of the genetic fuzzy logic control ramp metering are compared with FLC (fuzzy logic control) ramp metering by means of the percentage change of TTT (Total Travel Time) based on no control condition in Aimsun. The simulation results show the genetic fuzzy ramp metering has a more significant improvement on TTT and more strong stability to maintain system flow density than FLC ramp metering.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">traffic flow</field><field name="subject">ramp meter</field><field name="subject">traffic control</field><field name="subject">motorway ramps</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290800 Civil Engineering::290803 Transport engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1146</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fairness, forgiveness and grudge-holding: experimental studies with primary school children in New Zealand : thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Psychology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Yamaguchi, Tomoko</field><field name="description">Fairness, forgiveness and grudge-holding are concepts which underlie many aspects of our interpersonal relationships. Fairness is the foundation of our day-to-day communication with others and forgiveness is concerned with a positive strategy used to manage negative emotional experiences of underserved [i.e. undeserved] unfair treatment. Grudge-holding results as an accumulation of negative feelings, which are associated with the original experience of unfairness. Two experimental studies investigated children&#8217;s perceptions of, feelings about, and reactions towards the unfair behaviour of a mother and a friend, by individually inviting the children to scenario-based interview sessions, which included three imaginary tasks. The children were asked to judge the fairness of a mother and a best friend&#8217;s treatment towards a child protagonist and to report their associated feelings, after listening to a scenario that described an interaction between a child and a mother and an interaction between a child and a friend. They further responded to three scenario-based experimental tasks, regarding their willingness to grant forgiveness, as opposed to expressions of hostility. In the first study, the children&#8217;s willingness to forgive, as a result of unfairness, was explored with 82 local primary school children in Palmerston North, New Zealand, whose ages ranged from 8- to 11-years-old, in addition to 50 parents of these participating children. The parents also completed a questionnaire about their approaches to their children&#8217;s common misbehaviours. The study found that the children were typically willing to grant forgiveness to a mother, even though she had been unfair. Their forgiveness tendencies were not related to aspects of parental disciplinary behaviour. However, an examination of the children&#8217;s verbatim responses through the use of thematic analysis revealed the complex nature of the relationship between parent and child concerning tolerance for mistakes. In the second study, I explored on whether the children&#8217;s repeated exposure to unfairness would contribute to their display of grudge-holding against a mother or a best friend in the scenarios and this investigation involved 55 local primary children, whose ages ranged from 8- to 12-years-old, in Wellington, New Zealand. The children participated in individual scenario-based interview sessions, which included three imaginary tasks over the two time periods, one week apart from each other. The children&#8217;s levels of grudge-holding was measured by analysing the possible increase in hostility, which the children expressed from Time 1 to Time 2. The study showed that a repeated experience of unfairness had a noticeable effect on the children&#8217;s level of hostility towards the person who was unfair and especially towards the best friend. The children&#8217;s verbatim comments also suggested some evidence of accumulated negativity in their responses to an unfairness experience. Thus, this study proved to be a suitable paradigm for operationalising grudge-holding in children.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">interpersonal relationships</field><field name="subject">negative feelings</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380104 Personality, abilities and assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1147</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of vitamin D in metabolism and bone health : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Nutritional Science at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">von Hurst, Pamela Ruth</field><field name="description">Background  Hypovitaminosis D is becoming recognised as an emerging threat to health, even in countries like New Zealand which enjoy plentiful sunshine. The evidence for a role for vitamin D deficiency in the aetiology of a plethora of diseases continues to accumulate, including type 2 diabetes, and the preceding insulin resistance.  Objectives  The primary objective of the Surya Study was to investigate the effect of improved vitamin D status (through supplementation) on insulin resistance. The secondary objectives were to investigate the vitamin D status and bone mineral density of South Asian women living in New Zealand, and to investigate the effect of vitamin D supplementation on bone turnover as measured by biochemical markers of bone resorption and formation.  Method  Women of South Asian origin, &#8805;20 years old, living in Auckland (n = 235) were recruited for the study. All were asked to complete a 4-day food diary, invited to have a bone scan, and were screened for entry into the intervention phase which required insulin resistance (HOMA-IR &gt;1.93) and serum 25(OH)D &lt; 50 nmol/L. Eighty-one completed a 6-month randomised controlled trial with 4000 IU vitamin D3 (n = 42) or placebo (n = 39). Primary endpoint measures included insulin resistance, insulin sensitivity (HOMA2%S), fasting C-peptide and markers of bone turnover, osteocalcin (OC) and collagen C-telopeptide (CTX). Ninety-one of the 239 had a bone scan and bone mineral density (BMD) was measured in the proximal femur and lumbar spine.  Results  Adequate serum 25(OH)D concentrations (&gt;50 nmol/L) were observed in only 16% of subjects screened. Median (25th, 75th percentile) serum 25(OH)D increased significantly from 21 (11,40) to 75 (55,84) nmol/L with supplementation. Significant improvements were seen in insulin sensitivity and insulin resistance (P = 0&#183;003, P = 0&#183;02 respectively), and circulating serum insulin decreased (P = 0&#183;02) with supplementation compared to placebo. There was no change in C-peptide with supplementation. Insulin resistance was most improved when endpoint serum 25(OH)D =80 nmol/L. In post-menopausal women OC and CTX levels increased in the placebo arm but CTX decreased from 0.39&#177;0.15 to 0.36&#177;0.17 (P = 0.012) with supplementation. Osteoporosis (T score &lt;-2.5) was present in 32% of postmenopausal, and 3% of premenopausal women. Women 20 &#8211; 29 years (n=10) had very low BMD, calcium intake and serum 25(OH)D  Conclusions  Improving vitamin D status in insulin resistant women resulted in improved insulin resistance and sensitivity but no change in insulin secretion. Optimal 25(OH)D concentrations for reducing insulin resistance were shown to be &#8805;80 nmol/L. The prevalence of low 25(OH)D concentrations in this population was alarmingly high, especially in younger women. In post-menopausal women, vitamin D supplementation appeared to ameliorate increased bone turnover attributed to oestrogen deficiency.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Vitamin D supplementation</field><field name="subject">insulin sensitivity</field><field name="subject">insulin resistance</field><field name="subject">osteoporosis</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321205 Nutrition and dietetics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1148</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Are radio markets Dirichlet? A study into the NBD/Dirichlet, its empirical generalisations and their extension to radio listening patterns : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Marketing at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Lees, Gavin</field><field name="description">The well recognised and parsimonious Dirichlet model of buyer behaviour (Goodhardt, Ehrenberg and Chatfield 1984) has summarised a number of empirical generalisations about market structures and buyer behaviour. These generalisations have been described by Sharp, Wright and Goodhardt (2002) as:  Differences in market share can be attributed largely to differences in market penetration  A double jeopardy pattern emerges, with smaller brands having a lower average purchase frequency, share of category requirements, and proportion of sole buyers  A brand&#8217;s customers buy from other brands more frequently  Sole buyers tend to be very rare, and are also very light buyers  Heavy buyers buy more brands and are very unlikely to be sole buyers  Brands share their customers in proportion to their market share (Duplication of Purchase Law). Of these empirical generalisations, double jeopardy, polygamous loyalty and the duplication of purchase law are amongst the better known. They have been observed across an increasing number of product categories, countries and differing market conditions. This thesis considers whether the Dirichlet and its accompanying empirical generalisations also hold true for radio markets. Whilst Goodhardt, Ehrenberg and Collins (1975) and Barwise and Ehrenberg (1988) have considered television and its audiences there has been very little study into radio audience patterns. Perhaps this is because many researchers consider radio to be more like television than any other media. However, Lees (2003, 2006) has started to address the issues of radio market structures and radio audience patterns. This thesis adopts an empirical generalist approach showing the Dirichlet model of consumer behaviour and its associated empirical generalizations appear to apply to radio markets in that they:  Show a high correlation between market share and the brand performance measures of: cumulative audience, average time spent listening, share of category requirements and exclusive audience  Reflect the double jeopardy pattern with those stations that have a higher market share also having a higher penetration or cumulative audience and a higher average weekly time spent listening. Conversely those stations with a low market share having a lower cumulative audience and a lower average weekly time spent listening  Show audience duplication between radio stations that varies according to each stations&#8217; market cumulative audience, in accordance with the Duplication of Purchase Law  Have the percentage of listeners loyal to one radio station reflecting the Dirichlet&#8217;s expectation of low exclusive audience. These exclusive listeners also reflect a double jeopardy pattern with the bigger stations having more exclusive listeners than the smaller stations.  The most compelling result of this thesis is the apparent ability of the Dirichlet to describe a radio market place. Thus has managerial implications &#8211; especially to what extent a manager should take the patterns as &#8216;normal&#8217; or seek to &#8216;buck the trend&#8217;. The conclusion is that radio station managers need to carefully manage their station working with the market rather than trying to &#8216;buck the trend&#8217;. This is likely to involve station managers actively promoting their stations to ensure that their station remains salient to its current listeners while also trying to increase its awareness amongst non listeners. This thesis has also made several contributions to knowledge about the Dirichlet. First, it has extended knowledge about the model to a new area &#8211; that of radio listening. Second, it has shown that while some radio listening seemingly violates some of the assumptions behind the model it is still robust enough to account for variations in multivariate count data in a manner that is parsimonious. Third, it has confirmed the known boundary condition that the Dirichlet does under-predict sole loyal purchase frequency. This thesis also calls for further research into both the Dirichlet model with further extensions to differentiated product categories; and into the question of radio audience measurement. It calls for the New Zealand Radio Broadcasters Association to commission a report into the effect of introducing portable people meters as a form of audience measurement.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">consumer behaviour</field><field name="subject">brand choice</field><field name="subject">marketing</field><field name="subject">customer loyalty</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1149</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Governance inertia &amp; performance in a micro-sized single desk seller : a 120 point thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirement for the degree of Master of Management at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">King, Colville</field><field name="description">Single Desk Seller (SDS) firm structures dominate the agribusiness sector in many developing countries, and were created to resolve export market failure and achieve performance efficiency and effectiveness. Many of these SDSs are also state owned enterprises and have been perceived to be inefficient and a drain on the public purse, as well as no longer having a raison d'&#234;tre in the face of the World Trade Organization&#8217;s  anti-competition open markets policies. However, unlike in developed countries, SDSs are likely to remain a significant feature in small developing countries due to their inherent problem of small scale and undeveloped equity markets.  It therefore beholds researchers and practitioners to correct inefficiencies of these structures in order to achieve optimal performance. The Arrowroot Industry Association, with a record of disastrous performance makes an ideal case to explore this governance-performance relationship. A holistic case study research methodology was used to carry out this study  The main finding was that the governance structure of the Arrowroot Industry Association (AIA) was unresponsive to and did not co-evolve with its environment over the last (20) twenty years. As a result it increasingly became an inefficient mechanism for solving governance according to the normative prescriptions of property rights, transactions cost, agency, resource based view, resource dependency theories, stakeholder, and stewardship theories. Consequently, and despite having a rare and valuable starch product, the AIA was unable to meet demand or secure sufficient rents from the value chain to meet the revenue objectives of itself or of its members. The most significant causes of inertia in the AIA&#8217;s strategy and structure were caused by two exogenous variables (a fixed legislation and significant politically influence in the strategic process), and two endogenous variables (poor cognitive ability of management and directors and the limiting effects of its eroded resource base). The combination of poor performance and inertia of the AIA over the years resulted in various forms of escalating commitments, debt accumulation and a shrinking supply base upstream as producers sought alternative means of income. Furthermore, the absence of markets for managerial talents, corporate control and arrowroot production, harvesting and processing technologies restricted alternatives available to the AIA of Government in resolving the perceived problems. Research implications and recommendations for the AIA are subsequently discussed.  The major recommendations proposed to reverse the performance problem of the AIA were  (1) tighter vertical integration of the AIA to internalise of downstream inefficiencies, (2) efficient allocation of property rights along the entire value chain, (3) clearly defined roles and boundaries for key stakeholders, (4) increasing managerial, technological and financial capacity, and (5) reducing Government control by making influence-cost significantly prohibitive.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">small-scale operators</field><field name="subject">governance structure</field><field name="subject">arrowroot industry</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1150</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysing project management culture and practice of public managers in Papua New Guinea: a case study of the National AIDS Council Secretariat : a thesis presented in the fulfilment of Master of Philosophy in Development Studies at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Kaule, Ralph Dungit</field><field name="description">This thesis analyses and explores the Culture and Practices of Public Managers involved in implementing projects in Papua New Guinea. Project Implementation is an integral part of the overall project management cycle that has received a great deal of attention as a major development problem. In order for us to gain an insight of the theme of the thesis, the National AIDS Council Secretariat (NACS) was selected as the site for this case study. To investigate'how things were done in NACS', a variety of approaches were used to gauge the views, perceptions and experiences of programme and project managers in NACS, to help us understand the factors that affect staff practices. Poor management practice and the lack of a sound management culture and work ethic in PNG, is often blamed for the break down in the state?s capacity to deliver public goods and services to its citizens. Performance culture and good practice by public managers employed in State Institutions to handle projects have regressed in the last three decades, and as a result, projects are seen as failing to meet the goals and objectives of the state. The research question which the case study had to answer was: What is the nature of project management culture and practice among public sector managers in the National AIDS Council Secretariat? The study sought to investigate the extent to which the areas of command and control, project training, project knowledge and staff motivation were important integral managerial qualities in the attitudes and practice of public managers. The study showed that, of the four elements of managerial practices investigated, the inability of public managers to assume leadership, command and control and motivate their staff, were the most important elements missing among managers in NACS. Based on the findings and the evidence collected during the research, this thesis argues for substantial capacity building programmes to be designed and conducted around 'programme and project management' roles in state institutions and agencies in PNG, as the way to improve staff capabilities so as to enable project managers and their staff to efficiently implement projects.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">project implementation</field><field name="subject">project management</field><field name="subject">public sector management</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1151</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Youth development, Maui styles : Kia tipu te rito o te pa harakeke, Tikanga and ahuatanga as a basis for a positive Maori youth development approach : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Maori Studies at Te Kunenga ki Purehuroa Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ware, Felicity Jane Rachel</field><field name="description">The Youth Development Strategy Aotearoa has been seen as an innovative approach to youth development. The E tipu e rea &#8211; Rangatahi Development Package was particularly useful for organisations implementing the strategy with Maori youth. There have been successful Maori youth development initiatives, though these have been ad hoc. Nonetheless, the realities and experiences of Maori youth are still not being fully addressed in national policy. This has implications for the support and resourcing of Maori youth development initiatives. Maori youth are members of a range of groups including whanau, hapu, iwi and Maori communities in te ao Maori as well as the wider youth population and New Zealand society. The histories, experiences and viewpoints of each distinct group contribute to diversity in the Maori youth population which presents challenges for Maori youth development. Maori development goals do not adequately focus on Maori youth and youth development theory does not fully consider culture. The challenge is to successfully integrate Maori culture and youth culture in a relevant and meaningful manner so that Maori youth can positively contribute to Maori development and wider New Zealand society. This study examines purakau (narratives) about Maui (Polynesian ancestor) as a template for the analysis of Maori youth development. Interviews were undertaken with a group of Maori youth from the Manawatu region. The research showed tikanga and ahuatanga were relevant to the contemporary daily lives of the participants. The study found that positive development and the realisation of potential for Maori youth was affected by individual and environmental influences. This thesis concludes by making recommendations for policy, practice and further research. Finally, it offers a culturally appropriate theoretical approach for positive Maori youth development.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori youth</field><field name="subject">purakau</field><field name="subject">narratives</field><field name="subject">youth policy</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370100 Sociology::370102 Social policy and planning</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1152</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Barriers to affordable housing for mental health service users : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements of the degree of Master of Public Policy at Massey University, Albany Campus, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Andrew, Colwell</field><field name="description">Housing is both a social issue and a determinant for well being and is an integral component of social policy. The research specifically looked at the barriers for mental health service users to accessing affordable housing. Previous studies have identified affordability, lack of choice and discrimination as specific issues in relation to people with mental illness and housing. While previous studies focussed on housing affordability in relation to the individual, this research considered the barriers to affordable housing for mental health service users in relation to the capitalist structure of society. The research utilised a Marxist theoretical perspective that views housing in terms of the social structures of society and the relationship to class. This approach was supported by the social model of disability, a social construct where those with disabilities are oppressed by the social structures of society. Another element of the research provided a history of government housing policy in New Zealand. A quantitative and qualitative approach was used to collect data which consisted of statistical information and information gained from interviews with the relevant participants. Analysis from a Marxist perspective explained, from the findings, that there are systemic barriers in accessing affordable housing for mental health service users within a capitalist system. From the findings, the social model of disability explained that there are structural disadvantages for mental health service users that result in barriers to accessing affordable housing. An analysis of the history of government housing policy in New Zealand, which has continually promoted the commodification of housing, also explained from the findings that there are systemic barriers to accessing affordable housing for mental health service users within a capitalist system.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mentally ill</field><field name="subject">public housing</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">public policy</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360200 Policy and Administration::360201 Public policy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1153</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mammalian ADP-dependent glucokinase : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirement for the degree of Master of Science in Biochemistry at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Hole, Rebecca</field><field name="description">The mammalian ADP-dependent glucokinase is the most recent mammalian glucokinase to have been discovered, and is unique in its ability to catalyse the phosphorylation of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate using ADP as the phosphoryl donor. Up until the discovery of this enzyme, the traditional biochemical view was that the first step of glycolysis was solely catalysed by ATP-dependent hexokinases, types I-IV. The particular role played by ADP-GK in the mammalian cell and the significance of this role has not yet been determined, although it is hypothesised that the ADP-dependent glucokinase could be potentially significant in contributing to the survival of cells under low energy and hypoxic or ischemic conditions. By using ADP as the energy investment in phase one of the glycolytic cycle instead of ATP, it is predicted that glycolysis could be sustained for longer during lower energy conditions (conditions of high ADP:ATP ratios). Since the phosphorylation of glucose by ADP-GK results in the production of AMP, it may also be possible that this has a direct effect on the energy charge of the cell. The AMP produced could lead to the regulation of cellular metabolism during hypoxia and/or ischemia via the activation of the cell-energy regulator AMPK. The study of mammalian ADP-dependent glucokinase is a very new area, and prior to this no investigation of the human ADP-GK enzyme had been undertaken. The main objective of this project was to clone, express and purify the recombinant ADP-GK so it could be kinetically characterised and directly compared with the recombinant mouse kinetic characteristics, the only other mammalian ADP-GK to have been studied. Unfortunately, due to complications in the expression and purification of soluble recombinant human ADP-GK, the project did not incorporate the kinetic characterisation of the enzyme. Acquiring data on the kinetic characteristics of the human ADP-GK will, in the long term, assist in the elucidation of the metabolic role of this enzyme, so the continuation of this project would be worthwhile.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">glycolysis</field><field name="subject">nucleotides</field><field name="subject">enzymes</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology::270108 Enzymes</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1154</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Action research: an exploration of a music therapy student's journey of establishing a therapeutic relationship with a child with autistic spectrum disorder in music therapy : a research dissertation presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the Master of Music Therapy at New Zealand School of Music, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Gang, Na-Hyun</field><field name="description">This action research project examines the researcher&#8217;s journey of establishing a therapeutic relationship with a child with autism spectrum disorder during her practicum. Children with ASD present difficulty in communication and social relationship skills. As a student in training with a limited experience, the researcher had uncertainty and low confidence with regard to her clinical and professional skills which affected her work. In this project, the researcher has examined her own process of music therapy with a child with ASD and shows how she was able to improve her practice and therefore establish meaningful and effective therapeutic relationships with this client population and obtain valuable learning through the training. The study was conducted at a dedicated therapy centre in New Zealand where the researcher was in placement. A total of seven, thirty-minute weekly individual music therapy sessions and four supervision sessions were employed. This process was adapted into the design of action cycles which involved the repeated process of planning, action and evaluation. In-depth analysis of the researcher&#8217;s work was carried out throughout the cycles, using clinical notes, journal excerpts, supervision notes and video recordings of the sessions. The findings suggest that the researcher was able to improve her practice while attempting to build a therapeutic relationship with the client. Various clinical and personal issues arose such as uncertainty about improvisation, and lack of confidence in professional skills including communicating with parents, which led to disjunction and burnout symptoms. Discussions in supervision aided in in-depth reflection of the researcher&#8217;s work as well as emotional support. The researcher could ultimately develop &#8216;internal supervisor&#8217; and was able to use independent strategies to help develop her work. Implications for training include making personal therapy a compulsory course requirement, providing training on professional skills, and student support groups. Future research may investigate the effectiveness of verbal input in music therapy and the emotional stages of parents.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Music therapy training</field><field name="subject">communication</field><field name="subject">personal therapy</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321300 Complementary/Alternative Medicine::321399 Complementary/alternative medicine not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1155</field></doc><doc><field name="title">0027: the EU : an international agent in Palestine? : a thesis presented in fulfilment of the requirements of the degree of Master of Arts in Politics at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Lyons, Katherine</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the ability of the European Union (EU) to impact on the Palestinian people and their institutions. Before using the formal concept of actorness to examine the extent of this impact, it presents a model of actorness that synthesises aspects of Bretherton and Vogler&#8217;s and Sj&#246;sjedt&#8217;s models. It uses the components of this model as a series of lenses through which to focus on and examine various facets of the EU&#8217;s influence. The analysis deals with diplomacy, aid, and the effects of the unexpected Hamas victory in the 2006 Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC) elections. The thesis finds that the EU&#8217;s early lack of diplomatic direction improved for a period but was limited by its consistent inability to have an effect if it ignored the US. In the field of aid, the EU has been a more successful actor. However, the EU&#8217;s best efforts in these spheres have been undone by two EU blunders. First, it classified Hamas as a terrorist organisation and subsequently felt unable to provide aid to a Hamas-run government. Second it joined the Quartet in the hope of increasing its own diplomatic clout, but found that it had given the US the opportunity to erode its ability to act as an independent financial agent.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">European Union</field><field name="subject">EU actorness</field><field name="subject">Hamas</field><field name="subject">Palestinian politics</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360100 Political Science::360105 International relations</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1156</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Impacts of imposed polychronic behaviour upon performance and well being in academic work environments : a 90 point thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Management in Management at Massey University, Turitea, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Love, Laurna M.</field><field name="description">In the contemporary workplace individuals differ considerably in the manner they approach their work and achieve outcomes. This thesis examined the construct of polychronicity (preference for undertaking multiple tasks simultaneously) within two intellectually intensive academic work environments. The impacts of imposed polychronicity on performance, job satisfaction, perceived stress and wellbeing were explored. Data was collected from 116 lecturers, teachers, supervisors and managers working in Northern Queensland, Australia. A quantitative approach was taken to data collection. Existing scales were used to measure a range of variables including preferred polychronicity, experienced work unit polychronicity, organisational commitment, job satisfaction, and perceived stress. To provide a qualitative perspective, respondents were asked for comments which were used to add depth and breadth to the study. The findings indicated that preferred polychronicity and experienced work unit polychronicity did not differ over genders or occupations which suggests that polychronicity is likely to be a personal trait. Responses were divided into polychronic, neutral or monochronic preference categories. The findings indicated that when polychronicity was high organisational commitment was high, but when monochronicity was high organisational commitment was lower. Further the findings indicated that when organisational commitment was high, job satisfaction was high and when organisational commitment was low stress was high, although polychrons relationship with stress was lower than that of monochrons. This may suggest that polychrons work better in an imposed polychronic environment than monochrons which supports previous research. The implication for employers is that through understanding the tasking preferences of employees they may be able to tailor strategies to improve and enhance personal wellbeing which in turn may increase job satisfaction, performance, wellbeing and reduce turnover.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">polychronicity</field><field name="subject">job satisfaction</field><field name="subject">time management</field><field name="subject">job performance</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1157</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Talking about end-of-life care for older people in a rural New Zealand community : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Psychology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Horrell, Barbara Mary</field><field name="description">Rural experiences are under-represented in the end-of-life care literature. In addition, population projections indicate that the numbers of older rural people are increasing. In an attempt to better understand their needs, this study considers how older people experience end-of-life (EOL) care in a rural New Zealand setting. Having responded to local media and community notices, seven participants, who in the last eighteen months had cared for someone over the age of 65 with a terminal illness, spoke about their experience of rural EOL care. Their stories were then transcribed and analysed, using narrative analysis. Participants spoke about similar issues, but from different, sometimes conflicting, perspectives. Positioning themselves primarily as carers, rather than as rural people, the participants&#8217; stories nevertheless reflected their social location for caring, as they talked about exhaustion and needing 24 hour support; limited access to specialist palliative care services; and the difficulties of caring for people with complex needs. At the same time they spoke of the joys and rewards of caring. The ambivalence and conflict evident in the stories indicates the participants&#8217; location in a particular place and time in the history of dying. Caught between two paradigms of care, these participants vacillate between the desire for the empathic, compassionate care of yesteryear and the best that modern medical technology can offer. Discussing when to continue and when to stop medical intervention produced the most conflicting perspectives. However, all agreed that having time to form therapeutic relationships is a key component of EOL care. Overall, the stories demonstrate that the multiple and complex experiences of older rural people render stereotypical assumptions about rural life and dying at home problematic. However, as this study demonstrates, simply talking with people provides access to and understanding of their lived realities. Incorporating this kind of approach in future rural EOL care planning will move us closer to achieving contemporary goals of positive ageing and dying well.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">palliative care</field><field name="subject">care of the elderly</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380105 Social and community psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1158</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The design of an electric fence fault-finder : a thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Engineering in Computer Systems Engineering at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">McGillan, Glen</field><field name="description">Electrified fencing is commonly used throughout the world to control animals with smaller and cheaper fence constructions than would otherwise be necessary with non-electrified wires.

Faults on electric fences can be difficult to locate, with the average fence using tens of kilometres of wire. Basic fault-finding tools allow an operator to read the peak fence voltage, requiring the user to decide whether a fault is present and to randomly search for the source of the problem.

Various approaches were taken to slow degreening including low temperature storage, use of controlled atmosphere (CA) environments, and treatment of fruit with physiologically active agents such as gibberellic acid (GA3). However, the cold storage life of lime fruit can also be restricted by a number of factors including chilling injury (CI) and rots. Various pretreatments such as the use of fungicide (thiabendazole, TBZ) and hot water dipping (HWD) and several postharvest regimes based on temperature conditioning (step down technique) and intermittent warming (IW) regimes were further investigated to protect the fruit against rots and CI during cold storage. The objective of this study was to determine what storage conditions and pretreatments would permit long term storage of NZ limes with minimal loss of quality. CA storage (10% O2 with 0 or 3% CO2) was compared to regular air storage (RA) and IW (varying durations) treatments across a range of temperatures. Although some CA storage regimes could assist in delaying degreening, none of the treatments provided protection against CI. CA storage at 3% CO2 delayed yellowing and gave better fruit quality than the low CO2 treatment. High CO2 CA treatments at 5 or 7&#176;C decreased the rate of colour change compared to other constant temperature treatments but did not protect against CI. CI limited storage of fruit under all conditions at constant low temperatures. Including fungicide (TBZ) in the dip water reduced the incidence of rots and had a secondary effect on protection against CI of lime fruit. However, fungicide use may sometimes exacerbate stresses such as heat injury on lime peel. Hot water dipping has been shown previously to hold potential as a storage pretreatment, but this technique may give risk of damage on produce if it is dipped at too high a temperature. Some HWD treatments did delay degreening, but there was no major effect on CI. HWD at &gt; 47&#176;C for = 4 min caused heat injury to NZ limes. All HWD treatments showed severe CI (&gt;15%) after 10 weeks of cold storage; and HWD fruit stored under RA at 13&#176;C did not show any CI but showed some pitting (= 10%) and degreened rapidly. Overall no suitable HWD treatment for limes was identified in this trial. This project identified the critical periods and temperature conditions for successful IW of limes. The IW conditions successfully delayed losses in quality of lime fruit provided the first warming period was applied within the first 20 days of storage. At least 2-cycle IW was required to maintain lime quality during long term storage. Some benefits were found after just one cycle of IW treatment but there were not enough to extend storage life. IW storage benefited fruit quality and provided the highest overall fruit quality of all postharvest treatments tested. The degreening of lime during cold storage at 5&#176;C could be delayed by IW treatments in which the fruit were stored at 5&#176;C for 12, 16 or 20 days then moved to 15&#176;C for 2 days. Both 2- and 6-cycle IW treatments proved satisfactory for maintaining colour on the green and yellow side of lime for 12 weeks of storage. IW treatments in which fruit were warmed within 20 day of cold storage did not show significant CI symptoms after 12 weeks of storage, and the 2-cycle IW treatment showed only a low percentage of CI fruit at this time. A 2-cycle IW treatment was almost as effective as 6 cycles, and a step down treatment also showed some promising results, indicating that it may be possible to further optimize the time and duration of variable temperature storage regimes to meet both quality requirements and the constraints of temperature management in commercial coolstores. The application of these regimes to other citrus species may also be beneficial. There are a number of physiological explanations that may account for the effectiveness of IW including positive effects on heat shock protein (HSP) and cell membranes. Nutritional factors such as vitamin C and flavonoid compositions were also investigated and fruit that did not show visible CI were found to retain at-harvest levels of these factors. Practical ways of implementing IW are discussed. In order to understand the effectiveness of IW on degreening, I used a logistic model to describe degreening of lime peel. This modelling approach demonstrated that IW did not change the mechanism of lime degreening based on the similarity between the hue values predicted by the model and the actual hue values measured during lime storage. The activation energy (Ea) for degreening based on either hue angle (H&#176;) or colour score (CS) during air storage was estimated to be ~53 and ~86 KJ.mol-1, respectively. Relationship between colour (H&#176; and CS) and chlorophyll content, relationship between reflectance spectra (%), chlorophyll content and H&#176; of lime fruit stored under different conditions are presented and discussed. This data allowed deduction to be made about the changes in individual pigments that are driving colour change during &#8220;good&#8221; and &#8220;bad&#8221; storage.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fruit colour</field><field name="subject">fruit storage</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290104 Other food sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1162</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Te huanga o te ao Maori : Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Maori clients with depression : development and evaluation of a culturally adapted treatment programme : a dissertation presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Psychology at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Bennett, Simon Te Manihi</field><field name="description">A manualised cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) programme was culturally adapted for use with adult Maori clients with depression who were receiving treatment from Te Whare Marie, a Maori Mental Health service that covers the greater Wellington region.

Case study and group analysis indicated that the adapted intervention was effective in reducing depressive symptomatology and negative cognition, and increasing general wellbeing in four culturally relevant dimensions.

Chemical composition and digestion kinetics were measured in fresh minced ryegrass as it matured and leaf, stem and inflorescence of several grass species. In sacco and in vitro incubations were used to define rates of degradation and nutrient release. Two short-term grazing trials were used to evaluate contrasting silages as supplements for cows fed restricted amounts of summer pasture. The minced preparation of ryegrass resulted in a similar distribution of dry matter (DM) between particle size fraction and rumen digesta from cows fed pasture. Mincing released 0.46 &#8211; 0.80 of crude protein into the soluble fraction, with highest proportions for mature grasses which had low CP concentrations (about 8 g CP/100 g DM). In contrast, the majority of fibre remained in the insoluble fraction but rates of degradation (k) approximately halved as grass matured. In vitro yield of VFA was similar for immature and mature minced ryegrass (after 12 hours VFA was equivalent to about 30% of DM), even though ammonia concentration declined to very low values for stem and mature grass. This suggests the rapid initial microbial growth was able to sustain a high level of DM degradation to VFA with mature grass. The summer pasture used for silage supplementation was of uncharacteristically good quality so the expected contrasts between maize, pasture, sulla (Hedysarum coronarium), lotus (Lotus corniculatus) and sulla/maize silage mixtures were less than expected. Milk responses to lotus silage supplements were greater than other silages (e.g.: 290 g milksolids from 54 MJ ME by lotus versus 110 g milksolids from about 50 MJ ME supplied by other silages). Pasture substitution was low (0.06 &#8211; 0.33). The Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System (CNCPS) was chosen for evaluation of cow trial data because it uses feed degradation parameters as input variables to estimate nutrient supply. Model prediction of milk yield matched observed values when cows maintained liveweight. Milk yield was underestimated at low intakes and overestimated at high intakes because no allowance is made for nutrient partitioning between milk production and liveweight change.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Forage plants -- Composition</field><field name="subject">Lolium perenne</field><field name="subject">Digestion</field><field name="subject">Feed utilization efficiency</field><field name="subject">Dairy cattle</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Feeding and feeds</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300400 Animal Production::300403 Animal nutrition</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1160</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Polar eveolution: molecular genetic and physiological parameters of Antarctic arthropod populations : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Molecular Biosciences at the Allan Wilson Centre of Molecular Ecology and Evolution, Institute of Molecular Biosciences, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">McGaughran, Angela</field><field name="description">This thesis is presented as a collection of research papers synthesising knowledge gained during the period of candidacy. Its underlying focus is the examination of evolution from a variety of perspectives for terrestrial arthropods (springtails) in an Antarctic setting. These perspectives include investigation of the ways in which springtail populations respond both physiologically and genetically to environmental variability over historical and contemporary time-scales. While the physiological and genetic may seem two worlds apart, this thesis recognises that, in reality the two are inextricably linked. Thus, when genetic differentiation between populations of the same species can be demonstrated, physiological differentiation of these populations may also be predicted (and vice versa). Therefore, across several locations and springtail species, physiological and genetic parameters of individuals and populations are examined both separately and, where possible, in concert. The physiological aspect of this thesis focuses on the springtail Gomphiocephalus hodgsoni from continental Antarctica. In addition to providing the first metabolic rate data for a continental Antarctic springtail, seasonal variation in metabolic rates is examined across multiple temporal and spatial scales to evaluate the ways in which individuals and populations respond to environmental variability. Metabolic activity in this species is intricately linked to a variety of factors, both intrinsic and extrinsic. These include biological function, temperature profiles in the local microclimate, and body mass and genetic differences among populations. In the genetically-focused aspect of this thesis, population genetic patterns of G. hodgsoni from several continental locations and Cryptopygus antarcticus antarcticus from locations across the Antarctica Peninsula are compared. Here, the importance of differing evolutionary histories in influencing patterns of contemporary genetic population structure is highlighted. While both species have been similarly affected genetically by Pleistocene (2 Ma &#8211; present) glacial cycling, it is clear that differences in timing of colonisation events and subsequent population expansions have left distinct genetic signatures in each species. In a separate molecular study, phylogenetic analyses are employed to study members of the circum-Antarctic springtail family Isotomidae. Thesis Abstract  The genetic ancestry among these closely related species is shown to reflect a diverse evolutionary origin in the Miocene (23 &#8211; 5 Ma), subsequent to which both vicariant and dispersal processes have been important. Phylogenetic re-constructions tease out the relationships among sister species, and the identification of several genetically distant lineages suggests that a revision of current species designations is required. Finally, two studies that integrate the physiological and molecular genetic are presented. First, metabolic rate variation across several locations on sub-Antarctic Marion Island in the springtail Cryptopygus antarcticus travei is examined. This variation is related to the genetic structure of populations to show that historical and contemporary environmental characteristics have left their trace in the expression of both genetic and physiological variability of these populations. Second, the perceived association between metabolic rate and genetic (mutation) rate is investigated more closely - a sophisticated Bayesian correlation analysis detects that there is an indirect relationship between metabolic rate and underlying species phylogeny in C. a. travei. Thus, the physiological and molecular genetic elements of this thesis test or advance important hypotheses within their own fields, and the integrated approach applied is a new step in interpreting evidence of physiological adaptation in Antarctic species. In its multi-faceted approach to evolutionary studies, this thesis enhances understanding of the current picture of springtail evolution in polar environments.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Springtail</field><field name="subject">Gomphiocephalus hodgsoni</field><field name="subject">physiological adaptation</field><field name="subject">Antarctic species</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270200 Genetics::270208 Molecular evolution</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1163</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Achieving a place: a communography of disabled postgraduates : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Social Anthropology at Massey University, Albany campus, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">McCool, Michael John</field><field name="description">This study is social anthropological insider research of disabled postgraduates, students and staff in tertiary educational institutions. This is also a study of enabling conditions for inclusion; and ways the participants build relationships between themselves and the wider community. I consider my participants as kin. This was a joint venture - we were related not by blood, but by the very fact that we share in communities of disabled people. We are connected even if not always interacting with each other; we seldom moved in the same circles on a day-to-day basis. These are stories of adversity, where the participants have developed successful coping strategies and made achievements, not despite their being ?othered?, but by living with and acknowledging their differences. These are reflections on our society where we compete in complex emotional relationships within employment and all other social institutions. The university seemed to be a psychologically safer setting probably because it is a place for higher learning and therefore all the people had a more highly developed consciousness. Even though in some cases there were some wider macro barriers, on the whole, the participants&#8216; experience was positive. We found what we as joint participants shared in that feeling of disability was just the same as the feeling of communitas as students. Thinking about communitas (Turner, 1967), the Latin for community, convinced me that community was the central theme of this whole thesis. There are communities of practice in all organisations and institutions in society and they are used by the participants in this study not only in developing strategies for inclusion, but also for learning. Because the university is a series of communities of practice a major theorist for this study is Vygotsky and his concept of a culture of learning. We are also indebted to the social anthropologist Lave and her colleagues for bringing his ideas to Western academia.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">disabled community</field><field name="subject">inclusion</field><field name="subject">relationships</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370300 Anthropology::370302 Social and cultural anthropology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1164</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Outcome evaluation of the Massey University Concussion Clinic: a pilot study : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Psychology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Rifshana, Fathimath</field><field name="description">The primary aim of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention provided by Massey University Concussion Clinic for individuals following Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (MTBI). Concussion Clinics were set up across New Zealand to provide early intervention and assessment for individuals with MTBI to prevent long term complaints. Treatment outcomes at these clinics have not been empirically examined before. The current study compared the levels of post concussion symptoms, anxiety, depression, and psychosocial functioning between an intervention and a control group using a quasi-experimental design. In addition, reasons for nonattendance to the clinic, and participants&#8217; perceptions of their recovery were also explored. The main outcome measures used were the Rivermead Postconcussion Symptoms Questionnaire, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and the Sydney Psychosocial Reintegration Scale-2. Outcomes were initially assessed soon after injury or referral to the clinic and then three months later. Participants were recruited from the Palmerston North Hospital Emergency Department and the Massey University Concussion Clinic. With 20 participants in the intervention group and 15 in the control group, the main results showed that the Concussion Clinic intervention significantly decreased the level of anxiety and depression reported by participants in the intervention group over the control group. Greater improvements in post concussion symptoms and psychosocial functioning were also indicated in the intervention group. Additional findings suggest difficulty with transportation as a reason for nonattendance, which could be a potential barrier to recovery. Furthermore, participants highlighted the benefits of attending the service and its role in their recovery. Important issues relating to the referral processes were also identified. Findings of the current study suggest that the Concussion Clinic intervention is effective in improving recovery for those accessing the service. Nevertheless, these results must be interpreted with caution due to the small sample size. Further research is warranted to examine the effectiveness of the Concussion Clinics with larger samples, and the current study may serve as a valuable pilot for these future investigations.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mild traumatic brain injury</field><field name="subject">post-concussion symptoms</field><field name="subject">psychosocial functioning</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380107 Health, clinical and counselling psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1165</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Business va'avanua: cultural hybridisation and indigenous entrepreneurship in the Bouma National Heritage Park, Fiji : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Social Anthropology, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Farrelly, Trisia Angela</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the ways community-based ecotourism development in the Bouma National Heritage Park was negotiated at the nexus of Western entrepreneurship and the vanua, an indigenous epistemology. In 1990, the Bouma tribe of Taveuni, Fiji established the Bouma National Heritage Park. A growing dependence on the market economy and a desire to find an economic alternative to commercial logging on their communally-tenured land, led to their decision to approach the New Zealand government for assistance to establish the Park. The four villages involved have since developed their own community-based ecotourism enterprises. Despite receiving first place in a British Airways Tourism for Tomorrow Award category in 2002, there was a growing sense of social dysfunction in Bouma during the research period. According to my participants, this was partly due to the community-based ecotourism development process which had paid little attention to the vanua. Largely through talanoa as discussion, the people of Bouma have become increasingly conscious of references to the vanua values in their own evaluation and management of the projects. This thesis draws on Tim Ingold&#8217;s (2000) &#8216;taskscapes&#8217; as, like the vanua, they relationally link humans with other elements of the environment within their landscape. This contrasts with a common Western epistemological approach of treating humans as independent of other cosmological and physical elements and as positioned against the landscape. Largely due to its communal nature, it may be argued that the vanua is incompatible with values associated with Bouma&#8217;s Western, capitalist-based ecotourism models. However, in this thesis I argue that despite numerous obstacles, the Bouma National Heritage Park is one example of a tribe&#8217;s endeavours to culturally hybridise the vanua with entrepreneurship to create a locally meaningful form of indigenous entrepreneurship for the wellbeing of its people. The Bouma people call this hybrid &#8216;business va&#8217;avanua&#8217;. Informal talanoa is presented in this thesis as a potential tool for political agency in negotiating issues surrounding community-based ecotourism and business va&#8217;avanua.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Taveuni</field><field name="subject">ecotourism</field><field name="subject">vanua</field><field name="subject">cultural values</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370300 Anthropology::370302 Social and cultural anthropology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1166</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evolutionary interactions of brood parasites and their hosts : recognition, communication and breeding biology : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Ecology at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Anderson, Michael Gareth</field><field name="description">Obligate brood parasites lay their eggs in nests of other species, relying on these host parents to care for their offspring. This phenomenon has been a curiosity amongst researchers since its first description and has become a model study system for testing such ideas as coevolution and species recognition. This thesis examines a few of the many questions that arise from this breeding system. The New Zealand Grey Warbler (Gerygone igata) and its brood parasite, the Shining Cuckoo (Chrysococcyx lucidus) are used as the main study species, although research on the eviction behaviour of Common Cuckoos (Cuculus canorus) has also been conducted. First, the current state of knowledge and recent discoveries regarding nestling rejection abilities of hosts is reviewed in chapter one. Second, a comparative study of New Zealand passerine begging calls has been conducted to test for begging call similarity between a brood parasite and its host, as well as developing a new technique for detecting the mode of coevolution that may be occurring in the parasite &#8211; host relationship. Parent-offspring communication in Grey Warblers is also examined to test for both parental and nestlings Parents use both alarm calls to warn offspring of potential danger, and also parental feeding calls to elicit a begging response from nestlings. By contrast, nestlings are able to signal both age and short term levels of need to parents through the acoustic structure of the begging call. The evolutionary costs and benefits of egg eviction behaviour in the Common Cuckoo are also tested. An experimental approach showed that egg eviction had a growth cost, but this cost was temporary and restricted to during and immediately after the egg eviction phase. A pattern of compensatory growth was observed after the eviction period, so that during the later nestling stages there was no difference in mass, and no difference in fledging age. Finally, variation in the Grey Warbler breeding biology and Shining Cuckoo parasitism rates are examined through both time and across latitudes. This research has shown a counterintuitive pattern of breeding phenology across latitudes. These patterns have implications for Shining Cuckoos both in terms of timing of available nests and host selection.

An investigation into the possibility of moving past the limits of mechanistic and teleological descriptions of organisms : a thesis presented in partial fulfullment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Ecology at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Chetland, Christopher John</field><field name="description">The problem of how to explain the fundamental nature of organisms for biology commonly falls under two causal systems, mechanistic and teleological. These systems however, fall into fundamental logical problems when put to the test. Many biologists also claim that these systems miss the essential nature of organisms. Historically one of the most important discussions of this problem occurs in Immanuel Kant&#8217;s Critique of Judgment, and this work has been chosen as the basis for an investigation of possible ways to avoid the inherent problems that occur with mechanistic and teleological explanations in current biology. By evaluating Kant&#8217;s claim, that organisms are not accurately describable by our standard causal explanations, it could be assessed in light of current discoveries whether we have the ability to develop a new causal or acausal system by which to explain organisms. From this analysis, and in agreement with Kant&#8217;s investigations of the problems of &#8216;design-like&#8217; characteristics in organisms, both causal mechanistic and teleological explanations were found to be inapplicable for use in any comprehensive and accurate understanding of organisms and evolution. They are recommended at best to be considered as heuristics. Following this, an investigation of alternate methods of explanation apparently not prone to the problems of mechanistic and teleological causal explanations were characterised and assessed. This lead to the uncovering the system of extremal principles, a system that claims to be acausal and seems to have direct application to fundamental aspects of biology and evolution. This acausal system of extremal principles can for example, be used to describe the class of solitons. Types of solitons (biosolitons) exist in organisms and are important aspects of processes such as morphogenesis, DNA replication, self organization in the cytoskeleton, and locomotion to name a few. They also exhibit the properties of the quantum wave-particle fermions. It is proposed that further investigation of the system of extremal principles and their influence in biology through phenomena such as biosolitons can provide the basis for the development of a new acausal system of explanation or an extra aspect for standard causal models. This, it is concluded, will allow a potential avenue for creating a new and logically more consistent explanatory system in relation to fundamental aspects of the phenomenon of evolution, organisms and the environment.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">acausal system</field><field name="subject">biosolitons</field><field name="subject">description of organisms</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1169</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Italian identity and heritage language motivation : five stories of heritage language learning in traditional foreign language courses in Wellington, New Zealand : a thesis presented in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Linguistics and Second Language Teaching at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Berardi-Wiltshire, Arianna</field><field name="description">The study explores the motivational role of the personal constructions of Italian identity (Italianit&#224;) of five learners of Italian descent studying their heritage language by means of traditional foreign language courses in Wellington, New Zealand. By adopting a social constructivist perspective on both language learning and the motivational processes underlying it, and by applying such concepts as investment (Norton, 2000), ideal L2 self (D&#246;rnyei, 2009) and language learning as identity reconstruction (Pavlenko &amp; Lantolf, 2000), the study aims to further our understanding of heritage language learning motivation as a socially mediated process (Ushioda, 2003). Qualitative data was collected through waves of semi-structured interviews from five case-study participants over the course of several months of learning. Responses were used to map the influence that the participants&#8217; constructions of their own Italianit&#224; exerted on three aspects of their language learning motivation: their reasons for learning the language, the decision to embark on the study of it, and the maintenance of their interest and learning efforts throughout the learning process. Detailed observations of learning sites, classes and materials, and interviews with teachers provided rich contextual data concerning key episodes identified by the students as relating to different aspects of motivation. The findings suggest that Italianit&#224; is heavily implicated in the initial stages of motivation, but that its influence is mediated by the learners&#8217; personal constructions of a multitude of internal and external factors, through which they come to personalise and prioritise their own objectives and identity ambitions in ways that guide their motivational arousal, their decision to pursue the language and their creation and visualisation of learning goals. Italianit&#224; is also found to have an influence on the maintenance and shifts in the participants&#8217; motivational states throughout their learning, supporting a socially mediated view of L2 motivation in which motivational fluctuations are explained as the result of the learners&#8217; own processing of and reaction to elements of their context, including critical events inside and outside the classroom, exchanges with teachers, peers and speakers of Italian, and ongoing developments of opportunities and challenges for the achievement of the personal goals and identity ambitions driving their learning.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Italian identity</field><field name="subject">learning motivation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420100 Language Studies::420110 Italian</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1170</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of the relationship between students' perceptions of workload and their approaches to learning at a regional polytechnic : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Education, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Giles, Laraine</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates students? perceptions about their workload and their approaches to learning, employing a regional polytechnic as a case study. Data was collected using a mixed methods approach. The convenience sample consisted of 269 full-time undergraduate students who completed a questionnaire indicating whether they perceived the workload to be heavy or unmanageable at times, and those who did specified the reasons for their perceptions. All respondents also completed a modified ASSIST instrument to indicate the approach to learning they adopted. Analysis of the questionnaire data indicated that the majority of students perceived their workload to be heavy or unmanageable at times with the main reason given as too many assessments due around the same time. The issues raised from the data confirmed the results of other studies and pointed to a range of issues both internal and external to the institution. Thirty follow-up interviews were conducted to further investigate the issues raised in the questionnaire. A complex picture emerged from the interview data of a number of inter-related aspects in the teaching-learning environment that impacted on perceived workload and approach to learning, including assessment and overloaded curricula, motivation, time management problems resulting from part-time jobs or family commitments, and lecturer support. Trends or patterns signalled by the data provided an important first step to assist in planning changes in the teaching-learning environment at the regional polytechnic. The main recommendations were centred on a long term, collaborative action-research project to be set up within a programme, to review curricula, create a more stimulating and responsive teaching-learning environment, foster learning communities, and ensure a consistent approach to developing generic skills. The aim of the recommendations was to ensure students are motivated to learn, engaged, and have the skills and information needed to be effective learners, which in turn has the potential to change perception of workload and impact on approach to learning.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">time management</field><field name="subject">teaching-learning environment</field><field name="subject">learning motivation</field><field name="subject">approach to learning</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1171</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Promoting sociability : staff perceptions of music therapy as a way to enhance social skills : a project presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Music in Music Therapy, New Zealand School of Music, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Boniface, Emma Jane</field><field name="description">This thesis is the result of working with nine students and one teacher aide in group music therapy in special education.

It is both a social movement and an economic approach that aims to make trade fair for the many small scale producers disadvantaged in international trade. This thesis explores the discursive devices used by fair trade organisations to promote fair trade. These devices have two roles: to promote an ethical connection from consumer to producer and to involve the consumer in the work of fair trade through purchasing behaviour and political action. This second role refers to the politicisation of consumption whereby shopping becomes an act of political solidarity with disadvantaged producers. I explore these devices through narrative analysis, focusing on a thematic analysis of Trade Aid&#8217;s publication, Vital. My research is framed by Michael Goodman&#8217;s (2004) work on the semiotic production of fair trade. The concept of a reflexive consumer is explored. This is the idea that consumer awareness of the conditions surrounding production can lead to purchasing decisions that reflect care for the distant producer. This opening up of the concept of consumption involves an active and engaged consumer who chooses to purchase fair trade because they feel a connection to the work of these organisations. I am interested in the particular form this information takes in Vital. I apply narrative research methods to explore the meta-narrative of fair trade promoted in Vital that tells the reader about the work of fair trade organisations, the impact this has on the lives of producer and how they can be involved in the story as a consumer and as a global citizen.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ethical consumerism</field><field name="subject">Trade Aid</field><field name="subject">consumer awareness</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370100 Sociology::370199 Sociology not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1174</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Navel orange blemish identification for quality grading system : a thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Computer Science at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Liu, MingHui</field><field name="description">Each year, the world&#8217;s top orange producers output millions of oranges for human consumption. This production is projected to grow by as much as 64 million in 2010 and so the demand for fast, low-cost and precise automated orange fruit grading systems is only deemed to become more increasingly important. There is however an underlying limit to most orange blemish detection algorithms. Most existing statistical-based, structural-based, model-based and transform-based orange blemish detection algorithms are plagued by the following problem: any pixels in an image of an orange having about the same magnitudes for the red, green and blue channels will almost always be classified as belonging to the same category (either a blemish or not). This however presents a big problem as the RGB components of the pixels corresponding to blemishes are very similar to pixels near the boundary of an orange. In light of this problem, this research utilizes a priori knowledge of the local intensity variations observed on rounded convex objects to classify the ambiguous pixels correctly. The algorithm has the effect of peeling-off layers of the orange skin according to gradations of the intensity. Therefore, any abrupt discontinuities detected along successive layers would significantly help identifying skin blemishes more accurately. A commercial-grade fruit inspection and distribution system was used to collect 170 navel orange images. Of these images, 100 were manually classified as good oranges by human inspection and the rest are blemished ones. We demonstrate the efficacy of the algorithm using these images as the benchmarking test set. Our results show that the system garnered 96% correctly classified good oranges and 97% correctly classified blemished oranges. The proposed system is easily customizable as it does not require any training. The fruit quality bands can be adjusted to meet the requirements set by the market standards by specifying an agreeable percentage of blemishes for each band.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pixels</field><field name="subject">colour images</field><field name="subject">RGB colour</field><field name="subject">grading algorithms</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280200 Artificial Intelligence and Signal and Image Processing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1175</field></doc><doc><field name="title">School decline : predictors, process and intervention : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Education at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Hawk, Kay</field><field name="description">The ramifications of school decline are profoundly serious for the students, staff and community of a school. School decline is the steady downwards spiral that some schools experience when a complex set of influences interact with negative and unresolved outcomes. This study explored the largely unresearched area of school decline and developed a set of potential predictors of decline that could assist in understanding, preventing or dealing effectively with school decline in the future. Grounded theory, selected as a methodology appropriate for exploratory research, was used to guide the process of data collection and theory development. Three schools, labeled by agencies and the media as being in serious decline or &#8220;failing&#8221;, were selected for the study. Adults who were in significant roles in the schools during the decline periods were interviewed about their experiences. As part of the data analysis and interpretation a set of propositions was drafted and was sent to these interviewees and to fourteen educational advisors who work with schools at risk and in decline. The advisors&#8217; feedback on the propositions, analysis of school related documents, Education Review Office reports and Ministry of Education file documents provided rich additional data. The factors associated with the lead up to school decline, and the process of decline, are multilayered, contextual and complex. Each study school&#8217;s experience of decline involved a unique combination and order of occurrence of common factors and influences. Many of the issues that predispose schools towards decline are associated with, and are exacerbated by, unethical or unprofessional attitudes or behaviour by individuals, and unprofessional practices within the schools and between neighbouring schools. Once decline begins it escalates and is difficult to stop. This thesis contributes towards the development of a theory of school decline by identifying potential predictors of school decline and by describing how decline begins and escalates. It also identifies factors that are associated with interventions being insufficient or ineffective. The theory of school decline provides insights for school leaders and educational agencies that may assist in the prediction and prevention of school decline in the future.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">failing schools</field><field name="subject">unprofessional practices</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330104 Educational policy, administration and management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1176</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Being Anglo-Indian : practices and stories from Calcutta : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Social Anthropology at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Andrews, Robyn</field><field name="description">This thesis is an ethnography of Anglo-Indians in Calcutta. All ethnographies are accounts arising out of the experience of a particular kind of encounter between the people being written about and the person doing the writing. This thesis, amongst other things, reflects my changing views of how that experience should be recounted. I begin by outlining briefly who Anglo-Indians are, a topic which in itself alerts one to complexities of trying to get an ethnographic grip on a shifting subject. I then look at some crucial elements that are necessary for an &#8220;understanding&#8221; of Anglo-Indians in Calcutta: the work that has already been done in relation to Anglo-Indians, the urban context of the lives of my research participants and I discuss the methodological issues that I had to deal with in constructing this account. In the second part of my thesis I explore some crucial elements of the lives of Anglo-Indians in Calcutta: the place of Christianity in their lives, education not just as an aspect of socialisation but as part of their very being and, finally, the public rituals that now give them another way of giving expression to new forms of Anglo-Indian becoming.

It has an unknown aetiology and is generally unknown by most people, including medical professionals. When a person who has had GBS is asked to speak about their experience, they are likely to talk about aspects of it that are personally meaningful. Their account can be likened to a story in that it collates seemingly unconnected facts, episodes of activity and emotional attributions into a sequence that provides knowledge and understanding. A story is a powerful form for expressing suffering and experiences and so is particularly suitable for the study of trauma and illness. The actual process of creating the story, plus its presentational and organisational forms, provides sources for uncovering the identities authors choose to create and present of themselves. Six people who have had GBS were interviewed about their experience, and their stories were analysed using a narrative inquiry to discern the meanings attributed to GBS from the participants&#8217; own understandings and perspectives. The intended focus of the research was holistic and content based. The result of the narrative inquiry was a plot common to all six narratives. Namely, GBS is an inexplicable condition, during which horrendous things happen, but people do recover with time and it is likely their life view will be changed in the process. Four fundamental issues, identity, meaning, making sense and meaningfulness were drawn from the stories and configured into a narrative of the researcher&#8217;s making. What the participants chose to speak about became the meanings, or themes, major and minor, of their stories. No event has meaning in itself, however traumatic events can precipitate crises of meaning. When these crises are viewed within the context of other events, and are perceived to add value to life, then they have meaningfulness. In the telling of meanings and meaningfulness, the purpose for storying and the audience to whom the story is directed are the criteria for which the storylines are chosen. Both the story and the storying provide opportunities for the authors to create and offer images of themselves, that are then open to interpretation by an audience. As a traumatic experience, GBS enabled six people to tell their stories. In doing so they were able to make sense of important issues for themselves, and re-examine the way they saw themselves and the world.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">paralysis</field><field name="subject">narratives</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380107 Health, clinical and counselling psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1180</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Working well : women's experience of managing psychological wellbeing as sex workers : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Psychology at Massey University, Aotearoa/New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Marie, Janet</field><field name="description">Despite evidence to the contrary, policy makers, some researchers and many who provide health and social services to sex workers continue to reflect and reinforce the notion that sex workers are dysfunctional and constitute a threat to public health. This thesis presents the results of a study which explicitly examined how indoor sex workers look after their psychological wellbeing. Twelve participants (who had worked as sex workers for at least 3 years) took part in semi-structured interviews and discussed how they looked after themselves both at work and in their wider social context. Interviews were transcribed and analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis. Two main themes emerged from the data. The first, &#8220;doing sex work&#8221;, relates to workplace practices. The second theme, &#8220;being a sex worker&#8221;, relates to how the women understand their experience of being a sex worker in their social context and how they care for themselves in this arena; also apparent in this theme are aspects related to entry and exit of the industry. All participants took part in the study to increase understanding of and social justice for sex workers. Most of the participants see sex work as having a positive contribution to their personal growth. The findings show that participants are resilient and employ self-care practices that are commonly used by many in occupations that deal with people or who are stigmatised in some way. Major conclusions drawn from the study are that working in a supportive environment, prior understandings of sex work, personal traits and reasons for entering the sex industry are closely related to positive psychological wellbeing.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sex industry</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380105 Social and community psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1181</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Origins and dispersal of the sweet potato and bottle gourd in Oceania : implications for prehistoric human mobility : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Plant Biology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand.

The recombinant protein was expressed in the milk of transgenic cows and was found exclusively associated with the casein micellar phase. Binding of milk calcium to the active sites of a cation exchanger resin was used beneficially in this study in order to gently disrupt the casein micelles and liberate the recombinant protein. This approach was found superior to the conventional micelle disruption procedures with respect to product recovery, resin fouling due to milk components and column hydrodynamic properties. Further purification was carried out using Ni2+ affinity chromatography and resulted in purity more than 90% and a total recovery of 78%. A capillary electrophoresis total protein assay employing large volume sample stacking and a microsphere-based, sandwich-type immunoassay were developed and validated. Both methods were successfully integrated with the downstream purification protocol in order to evaluate various quality attributes of the recombinant protein. A onestep capillary isoelectric focusing protocol was developed in order to monitor the recombinant protein in milk samples. The results showed extra protein bands in the transgenic milk that had isoelectric points significantly lower than the theoretically calculated one which indicated that the protein had been modified during expression. The association between the recombinant protein and bovine milk caseins was explored at the molecular level using the surface plasmon resonance technique. Results showed a calciummediated interaction between the recombinant protein and the phosphorylated caseins. This selective interaction was not noted between the human myelin basic protein and milk caseins which indicated mammary gland-related posttranslational modifications, most likely phosphorylation. The co-expression of the recombinant protein and caseins in the mammary gland, along with the ability of the recombinant protein to form calcium bridges with caseins explained its association with the casein micellar phase in the transgenic milk. Despite this and owing to the low expression levels of the recombinant protein in milk, light scattering investigations using diffusing wave spectroscopy showed no significant differences between the transgenic and the non-transgenic milk samples with respect to the average micelle size and the micelle surface charges.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">myelin basic protein</field><field name="subject">transgenic cows</field><field name="subject">genetic recombination</field><field name="subject">casein</field><field name="subject">milk proteins analysis</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences::250300 Organic Chemistry::250302 Biological and medical chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1186</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigations of dothistromin gene expression in Dothistroma septosporum and the putative role of dothistromin toxin : a thesis presented in the partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Molecular Biology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand.</field><field name="creator">Schwelm, Arne</field><field name="description">Content removed from thesis due to copyright restrictions: Schwelm, A., Barron, N.

To date there has only been two published studies that have used New Zealand relevant ethnic groups when analysing whether personality measures used in pre-employment settings exhibit different mean scores. The present thesis performed a systematic evaluation on the impact of ethnicity on personality traits. The study examined the impact of ethnicity on NZ Army Officer applicant personality assessment scores measured by the EPQ-R and GPP-I. Four ethnic groups (NZ Europeans, M&#226;ori, Pasifika, and Asian) were analysed for mean trait score differences among ethnic groups, the stability of these differences across different personality inventories and models, the variance of personality traits, the impact of ethnicity on age and gender relationships with personality traits, and how these differences were related to employment selection outcomes. The analyses revealed that ethnicity did have some impact on mean personality assessment scores used in the study. However, these were mostly small differences among ethnic groups. In addition, most of these differences found on the EPQ-R and the GPP-I were not consistent across inventories and models. There were no significant variance differences found on personality traits among ethnic groups. While initial analysis suggested that ethnicity did not influence the relationship between age and gender on personality assessment, further examination suggested that the relationship between gender and personality was impacted on by ethnicity. There were reassuring results found for New Zealand psychologists and HR specialists, as only two of the twelve traits analysed showed moderate differences on traits that were related to selection outcomes. However, for the NZ Army OSB selection process the findings in the present study indicate that the Lie scale on the EPQ-R and the Vigor trait on the GPP-I may need to be interpreted with caution for Asian and Pasifika groups. These results are discussed in terms of implications for personality theory, measurement, and the direction of future research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">personality assessment</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised</field><field name="subject">EPQ-R</field><field name="subject">Gordon Personal Profile - Inventory</field><field name="subject">GPP-I</field><field name="subject">ethnic status</field><field name="subject">ethnicity</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380104 Personality, abilities and assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1188</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Careers in cross-cultural context : a study of Sri Lankan immigrants in New Zealand : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Management at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Tharmaseelan, Nithiyaluxmy</field><field name="description">This study considered migrants&#8217; career outcomes as the result of their adjustments in terms of culture and career adaptation along with other positive attributes they brought on their arrival as well as developing in their new country.  It considered that career is the property of individuals and managing it successfully is the responsibility of individuals themselves.  Prior research into migrants&#8217; issues and careers was used as the basis of this study and a model for analysis was developed using such issues. The resultant model included the wider life of migrants.  A questionnaire including reliable measures of key variables was developed based on the literature. Two hundred and twenty-one Sri Lankan migrants completed the pilot tested survey. The results were analysed using factor analysis, tests of association and multiple regression analysis at the first stage to formulate a less complex model. Structural equation modelling was then used to confirm the relationships assumed between different variables. Although some of the relationships and/or variables assumed initially were removed from the model, the final model explained strong links between the variables that remained.  Qualification gained before migration and career self-efficacy were found to be the most significant variables in explaining job satisfaction before migration. Usefulness of prior knowledge, skills and habits, efforts made towards career, education in New Zealand, information seeking, length of time in New Zealand and overseas experience had the greatest influence on current job level.  Current job level, length of time in New Zealand and overseas experience were found to be the most significant variables explaining subjective career success after migration.  Adapting to New Zealand culture was found to be significant in explaining only the career satisfaction after migration.  It was also found that migrants&#8217; career outcomes (success and satisfaction) after migration were  significant variables in explaining overall career satisfaction of this migrant group: however, with the exception of job satisfaction, career outcomes before migration did not play a significant role in determining overall career satisfaction.  The implications of the present study were considered, from both migrants&#8217; perspective and that of New Zealand as the host society.  A number of possible practical strategies relevant to migrants, community organisations and policy makers and authorities were suggested.  Several potential avenues for future researches were identified and discussed.  Thus, it is expected that this study will contribute to better career outcomes of migrants in New Zealand.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Career success</field><field name="subject">Career satisfaction</field><field name="subject">Acculturation</field><field name="subject">Migration</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1189</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Me aro ki te ha o hineahuone : women, miscarriage stories, and midwifery : towards a contextually relevant research methodology : a thesis presented in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Midwifery at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Kenney, Christine M</field><field name="description">Professional ethics and legal competencies require midwives practising in New Zealand to provide care for childbearing women in a partnership characterised by continuity, equality, mutual respect, trust, shared responsibility and decision making. New Zealand is culturally and legislatively a bi-cultural environment and the cultural safety of Maori (indigenous peoples) are prioritised within health legislation. The midwifery philosophy of partnership and bi-cultural legislation, have provided a foundation for developing a research methodology for the profession. This thesis stories the interweaving of multiple epistemologies, theoretical tenets, philosophical concepts, indigenous and Western European world views as well as women&#8217;s narratives in creating and implementing a contextually relevant qualitative research methodology, &#8216;Te Whakamaramtanga&#8217;. The methodology was trialled in the field of miscarriage; a practice issue for midwives in New Zealand. Research participants were recruited through &#8216;word of mouth&#8217; and snowballing methods. Twenty women participated in the research project and of these nine identified as midwives. Twelve participants were of Non Maori descent, including four women who were immigrants to New Zealand, and eight participants identified as Maori. Participants&#8217; stories were gathered through dialogical interviews, which recognised the co-construction and exploration of knowledge. Ethical tenets outlined in the methodology involved the use of extensive, ongoing consultation with Maori, midwifery and local communities. Maori, women, and midwives share an oral culture that values narratives as facilitating the constitution of identities, creation and transmission of knowledge, and the development of social relationships. Whole narrative, thematic and narrative elements analyses of participants&#8217; miscarriage-related talk have been developed through drawing on kaupapa Maori philosophy, the social theories of Pierre Bourdieu, Michel Foucault, Bruno Latour, Paul Ricouer, and Rom Harre as well as the narrative concepts of Arthur Frank and Margaret Somers. Substantive chapters explore whakapapa, corporeal temporalities, narrative silences and women&#8217;s desires for recognition and relationships. A new theory is advanced that methodologies, narratives, genealogies, temporalities, silences and women voices are simultaneously co-constituted metaphysical and material technologies. These heterogeneous and relational entities are collectively perceived as actants, hybrid actors, actor networks as well as technologies, which exist within a range of dynamic and hierarchical networks and/or fields in which this thesis is also embedded. My development of a multicultural midwifery research methodology informed by multidisciplinary theoretical approaches is innovative for midwifery research and theory, and potentially other health disciplines.

We enter the world via our parents; we learn what it is to be a child, a human being in that particular time-space-people context. We carry our parents' legacy from conception to death. The questions central to this research concern the concept and praxis of parenting. Why is parenting so important for human being? What do terms such as loving, caring, nurturing, mean? What does it mean to be a 'family', a 'mother', a 'father'? What of power in families? How do parenting relationships differ from other forms of relationship? How does parenting 'fit' in society? The task I set myself was the comprehension of parenting. I wanted to grasp as much as I could about the definitions, ideas, practices which people use in their everyday lives, and I wanted to understand these in society. The work is a theoretical one. The phenomenological method underpins the total process; the introduction, the field research, the analysis of data, the writing. Phenomenology, as I understand it, is concerned essentially with uncovering meaning. I wanted to learn the meaning of parenting praxis in society in order to develop a theory of parenting which could be used as a catalyst, and provoke questions which I believe are critical for human being. The thesis is divided into three parts. The first is the preparation or journey into the research. Time is spent on defining such basic terms as 'body', 'self', 'perception', in building an ontological and methodological framework sufficient for my needs. Portraits of the six families with whom I lived are presented in triptych form in the middle part of the thesis. I wanted, needed, to immerse myself in people's lives, not simply to visit and ask questions which they may/may not have been able or willing to answer, but I wanted to become part of their lives, albeit for a short time. Then I could hear, see, taste, feel .. what it is like to be in their family. People are revealed warts and all, and parenting shown to be complex, ambiguous, tedious, awesome In the third part of the thesis focus is on parentingin-society. C. Wright Mills' questions anchor the discussion of the history of parenting, and on parenting in Australian society. The concept and praxis of parenting is un-covered, and shown to be an ongoing social construction. I argue that the particular construction, this ordering of power, this definition and conceptualisation of parenting, is brought about by a systematic orchestration, an ordering of people's lives which inhibits full realisation of human being. The liberal democratic ideology fuels this construction, and contradictions inherent in parenting praxis are denied, deflected, dismissed by reference to this ideology.</field><field name="date">1984</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Parenting</field><field name="subject">Australian society</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370100 Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1193</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hyperspectral proximal sensing of the botanical composition and nutrient content of New Zealand pastures : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Earth Science</field><field name="creator">Sanches, Ieda Del'Arco</field><field name="description">The potential of hyperspectral proximal sensing to quantify sward characteristics important in making critical decisions on the management of sheep and dairy pastures in New Zealand has been investigated. Hyperspectral data were acquired using an ASD FieldSpec&#174; Pro FR spectroradiometer attached to the Canopy Pasture Probe (CAPP). The CAPP was developed to enable the collection of in situ reflectance data from New Zealand pasture canopies independent of ambient light conditions. A matt white ceramic tile was selected as a reflectance standard to be used with the CAPP, after testing a variety of materials. Pasture reflectance factor spectra between 350-2500 nm (with spectral resolutions of 3 nm between 350-1000 nm and 10 nm between 1000-2500 nm) and pasture samples were collected from six hill country and lowland areas, across all seasons (August 2006 to September 2007) in a number of regions in the North Island of New Zealand. After pre-processing (e.g. spectral averaging, de-stepping, elimination of noisy wavelengths, smoothing) the spectral data collected from sites were correlated against pasture botanical composition (expressed as proportions of grass, legume and weed) and pasture nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, sodium and sulphur) expressed in percentage of dry matter (%) and amount (kg ha-1) using partial least squares regressions (PLSR). The accuracy and precision of the calibrations were tested using either the full cross-validation leave-one-out method or testing datasets. Regressions were carried out using the reflectance factor data per se and after mathematical transformation, including first derivative, absorbance and continuum-removed spectra. Overall best results were obtained using the first derivative data. The quality of predictions varied greatly with the pasture attribute, site and season. Some reasonable results were achieved for the prediction of pasture grass and legume proportions when analysing samples collected during autumn (grass: R2 &gt; 0.81 and SD/RMSEP 2.3 and legume: R2 &gt; 0.80 and SD/RMSEP 2.2), but predicting pasture weed content was poor for all sites and seasons (R2 = 0.44 and SD/RMSEP = 1.2). The inaccurate predictions might be explained by the fact that the diversity found in the field and observed in the pasture spectral data was not taken into account in the pasture botanical separation. The potential for using proximal sensing techniques to predict pasture nutrients in situ was confirmed, with the sensing of pasture N, P and K increased by the procedure of separating the data according to the season of the year. The full potential of the technology will only be realised if a substantial dataset representing all the variability found in the field is gathered. The importance of obtaining representative datasets that embrace all the biophysical factors (e.g. pasture type, canopy structure) likely to affect the relat ionship, when building prediction calibrations, was highlighted in this research by the variance in the predictions for the same nutrient using different datasets, and by the inconsistency in the number of common wavelengths when examining the wavelengths contributing to the relationship. The ability to use a single model to predict multiple nutrients, or indeed individual nutrients, will only come through a good understanding of the factors likely to influence any calibration function. It has been demonstrated in this research that reasonably accurate and precise pasture nutrient predictions (R2 &gt; 0.74 and SD/RMSEP 2.0) can be made from fresh in situ canopy measurements. This still falls short of the quality of the predictions reported for near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) for dried, ground samples analysed under controlled laboratory conditions</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">reflectance</field><field name="subject">pasture nutrients</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::269900 Other Earth Sciences::269999 Earth sciences not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1194</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The use of semi-anaemic piglets to investigate the effect of meat and LSF diets on iron bioavailability : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Veterinary Science in Clinical Nutrition at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Flores, Josephine A. Rapisura</field><field name="description">Anaemia, which is caused by iron deficiency, is a global nutritional disorder of utmost concern. It has been assumed that meat, which contains haem as well as non-haem iron, enhances non-haem iron absorption due to the presence of the &#8220;meat factor&#8221;. In the experiment reported here, 24 semi-anaemic, 3-week-old piglets were utilised as human nutrition models to assess the effects of dietary lactoferrin, meat and LSF (Low Molecular Weight Sarcoplasmic Fraction) on iron bioavailability during a 4-week feeding period. The parameters that were used as measurements of iron bioavailability were changes in haematological indices, haemoglobin iron repletion efficiency, intestinal morphology and mineral balances. Non-significant (p &gt; 0.05) dietary effects were observed for growth performance and for all the haematological and some histological parameters (small intestine villi height, crypt depth and mucosal thickness). Haemoglobin iron repletion efficiency was highest for the control group and was not significantly different between the other 3 diets. The superiority of the control diet in this respect was not consistent with previous trials and can not be explained. Results suggested that increased retention of calcium, magnesium, phosphorous and manganese tended to inhibit iron absorption. However, the LSF and meat diets significantly (p = 0.003) increased the number of goblet cells/100 &#181;m suggesting that mucin secretion was favoured by these two diets. Additionally, all immunological parameters were significantly (p &lt; 0.05) improved by the LSF diet. As such, the LSF diet can be a potential immunobooster feed ingredient for weanling piglets. Overall, the level of LSF in the LSF diet was insufficient to exert a desirable enhancement of iron bioavailability and betterment of 3 iron status of the semi-anaemic piglets relative to the control group. However, the diet containing LSF was as effective as the meat diet with respect to these characteristics.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">piglets as human nutrition models</field><field name="subject">dietary lactoferrin</field><field name="subject">meat</field><field name="subject">LSF</field><field name="subject">Low Molecular Weight Sarcoplasmic Fraction</field><field name="subject">iron bioavailability</field><field name="subject">anaemia</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300400 Animal Production::300403 Animal nutrition</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1196</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A lean approach to product development in small and medium manufacturing enterprises in New Zealand : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Engineering in Product Development at Massey University.

For countries such as New Zealand, where 99.54 % of firms belong to the SME category, the significance of improving the PD system is enormous. These firms have to &#8216;do a great deal with very little&#8217;. The various PD management solutions that have been successfully deployed in large companies require &#8220;alterations&#8221; or customisation for application in SMEs. The research work presented in this thesis addresses the growing interest in the application of a distinctive best practice, one of the most recent, and promising solutions to product innovation in SMEs: (Toyota&#8217;s) &#8216;Lean Product Development System&#8217;. The Lean philosophy has proven time and again as a holistic system to enhance efficiency of the entire supply chain by optimising all internal processes; in addition to bringing about responsiveness to external environment. According to studies conducted by prominent research institutes across the world, Toyota&#8217;s excellence is equally seen in its PD as in manufacturing, where projects take half the time of its US equivalents, with four times the productivity, and consistent top quality. In line with the industry trend in exploration of Lean system to PD across the world, this study focuses on: "Evolving a broad framework for PD that incorporates Lean principles for application in Small and Medium Enterprises."  In-depth action research within a SME environment showed that Lean Product Development Systems is one solution that provides ideal balance of being a systems based, process oriented, interactive expert managed approach with a clear customer / value focus for these firms. Aspects such as flexibility of engineering infrastructure, the CAD/CAM proficiency, flat organisation structure aiding better communication, and the continuous learning attitude prevalent within SMEs corresponds closely to that in Toyota, and were identified to be great enablers for Lean deployment. On the other hand, few areas were found to pose challenges to the Lean approach within SMEs: including resource scarcity, the dependency on suppliers, and lack of concept reuse, among others. On the whole, the findings have led to the development of a customized framework for Lean innovation in SMEs that addresses the knowledge, people, process, leadership, management, and planning elements, topped with measures to minimize effects of the identified obstacles.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">product development</field><field name="subject">small business</field><field name="subject">Lean Product Development System</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290300 Manufacturing Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1197</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analyzing volatile compound measurements using traditional multivariate techniques and Bayesian networks : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Statistics at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Baldawa, Shweta</field><field name="description">i Abstract The purpose of this project is to compare two statistical approaches, traditional multivariate analysis and Bayesian networks, for representing the relationship between volatile compounds in kiwifruit. Compound measurements were for individual vines which were progeny of an intercross. It was expected that groupings in the data (or compounds) would give some indication of the generic nature of the biochemical pathways. Data for this project was provided by the Flavour Biotech team at Plant and Food Research. This data contained many non-detected observations which were treated as zero and to deal with them, we looked for appropriate value of c for data transformation in log(x+c). The data is &#8216;large p small n&#8217; paradigm &#8211; and has much in common with data, although it is not as extreme as microarray. Principal component analysis was done to select a subset of compounds that retained most of the multivariate structure for further analysis. The reduced set of data was analyzed by Cluster analysis and Bayesian network techniques. A heat map produced by Cluster analysis and a graphical representation of Bayesian networks were presented to scientists for their comments. According to them, the two graphs complemented each other; both graphs were useful in their own unique way. Along with clusters of compounds, clusters of genotypes were represented by the heat map which showed by how much a particular compound is present in each genotype while the relation among different compounds was seen from the Bayesian networks.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">multivariate analysis</field><field name="subject">Bayesian networks</field><field name="subject">volatile compounds in kiwifruit</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::230200 Statistics::230204 Applied statistics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1198</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"Diabetes?

Evaluations of these programmes allow for a better understanding in regard to their impact and whether outcomes are met. Very little research has used qualitative methods to capture participants&#8217; experiences of these programmes and their perception of psychological outcomes. This is the first qualitative evaluation of the Type 2 Diabetes Self-Management Programme in Whangarei. It has adopted an interpretative-phenomenological approach to explore participants&#8217; experiences of the programme and participants&#8217; perceptions in regard to their self-efficacy and quality of life after attending a course. A sample of 7 participants with diabetes provided data via interviews 4 weeks and 3 months after attending the course. The themes that emerged from the initial interview were separated into three evaluation components. In &#8220;6 weeks sounded very long but it was worth the time&#8221;, participants discussed enrolment, benefits of the course and suggestions for future participants. In &#8220;I know what I need to do and I&#8217;m confident to do it&#8221;, participants linked the gained knowledge from the course to improvements in their self-efficacy regarding self-management behaviours, education and control of own life. In &#8220;Life is good, diabetes is just another thing to handle&#8221;, participants reflected on the impact of living with diabetes and changes to their life. An overarching theme of settling into a comfortable routine emerged from the follow-up interview. Participants reflected positively on their course and research participation. The programme was perceived to be beneficial to participants, impacting positively on increasing knowledge, self-efficacy development, behaviour changes and quality of life. The participants maintained these benefits in the short-term. These results are discussed in terms of the need for further research to evaluate if benefits are maintained in the long-term, referral process to the programme, decision-making process in regard to enrolment and impact of a support person attending the programme. Practice implications for the programme are discussed in regard to incorporating a follow-up phone call to participants after they attended a course and offering follow-up sessions with the latest information on diabetes care.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">programme evaluation</field><field name="subject">self-efficacy</field><field name="subject">diabetes care</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380107 Health, clinical and counselling psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1199</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reflecting diversity or selecting viewpoints : an analysis of the GM debate in New Zealand's media 1998-2002 : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of PhD in Communication at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ashwell, Douglas James</field><field name="description">The advent of genetically modified (GM) food in New Zealand in 1998 saw the beginning of a highly politicised debate about GM use in the country. The concern over GM and the political situation after the 1999 general election saw the Government establish a Royal Commission of Inquiry on Genetic Modification in May, 2000. The Royal Commission and strong public opposition to GM, evident in large public protests and other actions, made the issue highly newsworthy. The aim of this study was to explore how newspapers reported the GM debate, in particular, examining whether the reportage facilitated greater public debate and awareness about GM through journalists adhering to the ideals of the theory of social responsibility and enacting their watchdog role as encapsulated in the Fourth Estate tradition of the media. To achieve these aims the overall tone of the reportage and also which news source types and themes were most frequently reported were examined. In addition, the relationship and perceptions of scientists and journalists involved in the reporting were explored to examine how these relationships may have influenced the reportage. Content analysis showed the reportage had a pro-GM bias with policy-makers, scientists and industry spokespeople the most frequently cited news sources. The themes of Science, Economics and Politics dominated the reportage. Other source types and themes were less represented, especially themes dealing with ethical and environmental arguments. This lack of representation occurred despite the Royal Commission offering a space for all interested parties to speak. The interviews illustrated that scientists believed the quality of newspaper coverage of GM lacked depth and that important issues were unreported. Journalists found the issue complex to report and said they took care not to oversimplify the science and issues surrounding GM. The relationship between scientists and journalists indicated particular tensions existing between the two groups. The thesis concludes that if robust public debate is to occur within New Zealand regarding GM and other scientific developments, then the media should reflect a greater diversity of opinion by citing other potential news sources offering alternative arguments based on, for example, ethical or environmental grounds.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">journalism viewpoints</field><field name="subject">newspaper report evaluation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::289900 Other Information, Computing and Communication Sciences ::289999 Other information, computing and communication sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1200</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Crazy in love : concepts of morbid love in western medicine from 1951 to the present : a masters thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the Master of Arts in History at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Berks, John</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">lovesickness</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::430000 History and Archaeology::430100 Historical Studies::430199 Historical studies not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1201</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Volatility, price-discovery and trading volume in Australian equity index and option markets : a dissertation presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Finance at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Buhr, Klaus</field><field name="description">This dissertation investigates the information considerations of volatility, pricediscovery and the relationship change in volume and volatility resulting from index derivatives transactions on financial markets in Australia. The impact of information on volatility was investigated in the essay one, as volatility is a key factor for accurately pricing derivative securities. I assessed the forecast accuracy, unbiasedness and information content of volatility forecasts, based on implied volatility and conditional volatility models for the S&amp;P/ASX 200 Index Options market in Australia. The conditional volatility models produce the most accurate forecasts and are robust when forecasting into short time horizons. Essay two, investigates the information content of the index and option markets in the price-discovery process. Based on the above volatility results, the long-run equilibrium relationship between the share price index and the implied price of the share-price-index option was investigated. Causality was determined to show which market leads the other. Information share measures were used to gauge the contribution of the share price index and index option markets to the price-discovery process. Unambiguous evidence shows the index market leads the options market and the former contributes more to price-discovery than the latter. In essay three, I investigate the dynamic relationship between the future price volatility of the S&amp;P/ASX 200 Index and the trading volume of the S&amp;P/ASX 200 Index Options to explore the informational role of option volume in predicting price volatility. I found the contemporaneous call options volume have a significant strong positive feedback effect on the implied volatility, but the contemporaneous feedback effect of volume on the TARCH volatility is insignificant. The contemporaneous feedback effects from the implied volatility and the TARCH volatility to the call options volume are positive, significant and strong.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian financial markets</field><field name="subject">volatility forecasts</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350300 Banking, Finance and Investment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1202</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Creating new standards : jazz arrangements of pop songs : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Music in Jazz Performance, New Zealand School of Music, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Lile, Trudy</field><field name="description">This study involves the research, analysis, and performance of existing arrangements of songs that have been played and recorded by jazz musicians, and are identifiable as pop songs of the last thirty years.

The sets are related to the residue difference sets that were first discussed in detail in 1953 by Emma Lehmer. Qualified difference sets consist of a set of residues modulo an integer v and they possess attractive properties that suggest potential applications in areas such as image formation, signal processing and aperture synthesis. This thesis outlines the theory behind qualified difference sets and gives conditions for the existence and nonexistence of these sets in various cases. A special case of the qualified difference sets is the qualified residue difference sets. These consist of the set of nth power residues of certain types of prime. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of qualified residue difference sets are derived and the precise conditions for the existence of these sets are given for n = 2, 4 and 6. Qualified residue difference sets are proved nonexistent for n = 8, 10, 12, 14 and 18. A generalisation of the qualified residue difference sets is introduced. These are the qualified difference sets composed of unions of cyclotomic classes. A cyclotomic class is defined for an integer power n and the results of an exhaustive computer search are presented for n = 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12. Two new families of qualified difference set were discovered in the case n = 8 and some isolated systems were discovered for n = 6, 10 and 12. An explanation of how qualified difference sets may be implemented in physical applications is given and potential applications are discussed.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">residue difference sets</field><field name="subject">cyclotomic class</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::230100 Mathematics::230102 Number theory and field theory</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1204</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Self-reported oral health and access to dental care among pregnant women in Wellington : a thesis presented in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Public Health at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Claas, Bianca Muriel</field><field name="description">Pregnancy can have important effects on oral health and pregnant women are a population group requiring special attention with regard to their oral health and their babies? health. International research shows that oral health care for pregnant women has been inadequate, especially in relation to education and health promotion and there is some evidence of disparities by SES and ethnicity. Improving oral health is one of the health priorities in the New Zealand Health Strategy (Ministry of Health, 2000) and the Ministry of Health (Ministry of Health, 2006a) has recently identified a need for more information on the oral health and behaviour of pre-natal women. The aims of this study were to gain an understanding of pregnant women?s oral health care practices, access to oral health care information and use of dental care services and to identify any difference by ethnicity and socio-economic position. A self-reported questionnaire was completed by 405 pregnant women (55% response rate) who attended antenatal classes in the Wellington region. The questionnaire was broadly divided into four parts: (1) care of the teeth when the woman was not pregnant; (2) care of the teeth and diet during the pregnancy; (3) sources of oral health information during pregnancy and; (4) demographic information . Data were analysed by age, ethnicity, education and income and odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were calculated using logistic regression. The majority of women in this survey were pakeha (80.2%), compared to 19.7% &#8222;Others? (8.8% Maori, 1.9% Pacific, 8.6% other). Most of the subjects were aged 31-35 years (34.5%), of high SES (household income and education level). Half of the women reported having regular visits to the dentist previous pregnancy while a significant percentage of women saw a dentist basically when they had problems. The usual dental hygiene habits were maintained during pregnancy. However, during pregnancy more than 60% of women reported bleeding gums. Just 32% of women went to see the dentist during pregnancy and less than half had access to oral health information related to pregnancy. &#8222;Others? (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.15-0.91) and low income (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.10-0.76) groups were significantly less likely to report access to oral health information compared to pakeha and high income groups (respectively). Women who went to see the dentist during pregnancy were more likely to receive information on dental health. However, low income women were more likely to report the need to see a dentist (OR 2.55, CI 1.08-5.99). Information on dental health and access to oral care should be prioritised to low income women, Maori, Pacific and other ethnic groups. Little attention has previously been given to oral health for pregnant women in New Zealand and there is a need to increase awareness of the importance of this area amongst health practitioners particularly Lead Maternity Carers and Plunket and tamariki ora nurses.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dental care services</field><field name="subject">maternity services</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1205</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Balanced parenting with young children : relationship focused parent training within a dialectical framework : a thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Clinical Psychology at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Couch, Clare Mary</field><field name="description">While traditional behavioural parent training programmes have assisted families with concerns of child behaviour problems, they have not kept abreast with recent conceptualisations of the development of problematic behaviours in the parent-child relationship. Research has indicated that understanding of this relationship needs to go beyond bidirectional explanations and that a dialectical framework better describes the complexity of this relationship, which, in turn, should be reflected in the parent training programmes offered. Therefore, this study provided a parent training programme focused on balance in the parent-child relationship, which encapsulated the complex, dialectical nature of this intimate relationship. A central implication when adopting this notion of balance was that all aspects of the programme were addressed at the parent and child level. In addition, multiple factors were addressed that included mindfulness and acceptance, dealing with emotions, understanding development, and addressing parental attributions. It was only within this overarching concept of balance and relationship factors that behavioural skills were introduced. Mechanisms of change were identified by investigating parental emotional schemas through their narratives about themselves, their child, and the programme. This research involved 23 parents with their 3-4 year-old children in a parent training programme where both the parent and child met weekly with a therapist in group parent training. The groups involved 2-hourly sessions for 5 weeks, modelled on a &#8220;coffee morning&#8221; where parents met and discussed issues and the children played alongside in the same room. A research assistant was available to play with and tend to basic needs of the children. Measures at pre-, post-treatment, and at follow-up targeted child behaviour problems, how much of a problem these were for the parents, parents&#8217; sense of competence, parental attributions, and what was useful for parents in the programme. Results indicated that at post-treatment parents were able to address and maintain balance in their parent-child relationship and this reflected multiple dimensions of a dialectical understanding that had not been evident prior to the intervention. There was an increased mindfulness of both parent and child&#8217;s needs with a strong emphasis on an increased understanding of the child as an individual in their own right. Parents reported an increased recognition of the importance of dealing with emotions, with improved skills to be able to do this, an increased understanding of accommodating development, and an appreciation of needing to address parental attributions. In addition, there was a decrease in parent-reported intensity of child behaviour problems and how problematic these were for the parents, which were corroborated with parental verbal reports of improved child behaviour. Mechanisms of change that were identified included changes in parental attributions, parents being able to share with other parents, accessing &#8220;expert&#8221; knowledge from the programme facilitator, and gaining parental strategies. Implications for practice were discussed with suggestions for behavioural parent training programmes. In conclusion, limitations of the research and directions for future research were indicated.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">parent child relationship</field><field name="subject">behavioural training</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380105 Social and community psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1206</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spatial ecology, habitat use, and the impacts of rats on chevron skinks (Oligosoma homalonotum) on Great Barrier Island : a thesis submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Conservation Biology, Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Barr, Benjamin Philip</field><field name="description">The chevron skink (Oligosoma homalonotum) is one of the largest, yet least observed skink species in New Zealand. The species was thought to have once been widespread in Northern New Zealand, however currently it is only found on Great Barrier and Little Barrier Islands. Great Barrier Island is the apparent stronghold for the species although it appears to be in decline there, despite a net increase in habitat. Recent studies have increased the understanding of the general ecology of the species, however little is known about the threats to the survival of this species. This study had two main objectives; the first was to establish if rats are a threat to chevron skinks, and the second was to increase current knowledge of the species ecology. The research was undertaken in an area of extensive rodent control (Glenfern Sanctuary) and an adjacent unmanaged reserve in Port Fitzroy, on Great Barrier Island in 2008. The first objective of this study involved confirming that rat densities in the treatment (Glenfern Sanctuary) were sufficiently different to allow meaningful comparisons of chevron skink population characteristics between sites. This was achieved by determining absolute rat densities using Zippin&#8217;s removal method at four sites, and correlating these with a relative abundance measure (tracking rates) to give confidence in the observed trends. Rat densities were high (1.94 - 3.00 rats ha-1) in the control, and low (0.00 and 0.06 rats ha-1) in the treatment sites, and these correlated well with tracking rates. In light of these clear differences between the treatment and control, the population structure and condition of chevron skinks were compared between sites. The population structure showed erosion of juvenile and sub-adult size categories, which indicated differences in vulnerabilities between size categories. Physical evidence of failed rat predation was also observed in adult skinks in the unmanaged control, which confirmed that rats were interacting with chevron skinks. Although the adults survived the attacks they suffered injuries including eye damage, punctures, cuts and tail loss. Smaller skinks would be unlikely to survive such attacks due to the severity and scale of the injuries, supporting the assertions of the population structure that smaller skinks may be more vulnerable than adults. The extent of tail loss was converted to a condition index to determine if failed rat predation was more widespread in the population, than was observed by conspicuous injuries. This condition index (body-tail condition index) was stable through all size categories in the treatment, but significantly reduced in adults in the unmanaged sites. That there was no reduction in the condition of smaller skinks in the unmanaged control sites despite high rat densities suggests that interactions between rats and smaller skinks are fatal, and thus not represented in the data. Nine chevron skinks were radio-tracked to determine habitat use, home range and ranging behaviour. Habitat use of chevron skinks was similar to a previous study and demonstrated that trees, crevices and logs were important refuge sites. Chevron skinks were more likely to be found at sites with trees, crevices and debris dams. Chevron skink home ranges indicated that adults moved further away from streams than previously anticipated at this time of year, and skinks demonstrated site fidelity. There was also overlap in home ranges between individuals, and skinks with overlapping home ranges shared common refuges. During flooding events, chevron skinks exhibited an arboreal response that appears to be a behaviour specific to stream associated animals, which allows them to avoid being taken by floodwaters.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Oligosoma homalonotum</field><field name="subject">chevron skink</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">rat predation</field><field name="subject">conservation biology</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270708 Conservation and biodiversity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1210</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of music therapy on self-reported affect in hospitalised paediatric patients : a thesis submitted to the New Zealand School of Music in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Music Therapy</field><field name="creator">Armstrong, Ruth Elizabeth</field><field name="description">The present research examines the effect of music therapy on the affect of hospitalised children. It took place on a paediatric ward of a New Zealand public hospital. This study aimed to investigate the role of music therapy in addressing patients&#8217; psychosocial needs. Literature on the impact of hospitalisation, and on the use of music therapy in hospitals and paediatrics was reviewed. The research involved an audit of the therapist&#8217;s clinical notes from music therapy sessions over the course of seven months. The clinical notes included measurements of children&#8217;s mood from the beginning and end of sessions, using McGrath&#8217;s (1990) Affective Facial Scale. It was hypothesised that mood measures following music therapy would be higher than pre-music therapy scores. Statistical analysis of the facial scale data did not show a significant difference between &#8216;before&#8217; and &#8216;after&#8217; measures. These results were discussed with regard to a ceiling effect (this is, the measurements indicated patients were at the happy end of the scale before the music therapy session, so there was little room on the scale for mood to improve following music therapy). The measurement of emotion did not prove to be straightforward. The hospital environment may have influenced the patients&#8217; responses in a number of ways. These environmental influences are discussed with reference to examples from the clinical notes. The usefulness of facial scales in this context is discussed, as well as other limitations of the research. Suggestions for future research include the use of other mood measures, and the inclusion of measurements of parental mood and how this affects the child.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">music therapy for children</field><field name="subject">children hospital care psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410100 Performing Arts Studies::410101 Music studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1208</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of single sessions of music therapy on the level of anxiety in older persons with psychiatric disorders : a pilot study : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Music Therapy at the New Zealand School of Music, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Castelino, Ajay</field><field name="description">This pilot study examined the effects of single sessions of music therapy on the level of anxiety in older persons with psychiatric disorders. The studied intervention was a 30 minute music therapy group and the control intervention was a verbal therapeutic intervention in the form of a reminiscence group. Participants acted as their own control. The measurement tool was the state part of a &#8220;State Trait Anxiety Inventory&#8221;. It was administered a total of four times, pre- and post- the music therapy intervention and preand post- the reminiscence therapy (control) group. A total of 9 participants were recruited for the study. The results indicated that single sessions of music therapy significantly reduced the level of anxiety for older persons with psychiatric disorders [t(8)=4.626, p&lt;0.0017] as compared to the control intervention as measured by the state part of the &#8220;State Trait Anxiety Inventory&#8221;. There was no evidence for a significant carryover effect since the baselines prior to each intervention did not differ significantly (p=0.55). These results can be considered to be a part of a pilot study and early inquiry into this field since methodological difficulties and the time limitation of the research resulted in some necessary deviations from the original protocol. A major limitation of the study was the choice of a measurement tool, which required the client to be cognitively high functioning. Thus these results are limited to cognitively able clients, which is a relatively small proportion of this client group that could potentially benefit from music therapy. It is suggested that for future research with this client group the measured variable be physical relaxation, rather than anxiety.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">music therapy for older people</field><field name="subject">anxiety treatment</field><field name="subject">mental illness treatment</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410100 Performing Arts Studies::410101 Music studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1207</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigations of the behaviour of pectin in casein micelle systems and their analogues : thesis presented for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Physics</field><field name="creator">Cucheval, Aurelie Suzanne Bernadette</field><field name="description">Firstly, the effect of pectin on acid milk gels in concentrated, quiescent systems was investigated by passive microrheology using two complementary techniques: diffusive wave spectroscopy (DWS) and multiple particle tracking (MPT). DWS, by allowing probing the mechanical properties of the network at high frequency, gave information on its microstructure. The addition of high methoxyl pectins was shown to change the network structure which has been explained by bridging of the casein micelles by the polymer as the system was undergoing acidification. On the other hand, the presence of low methoxyl pectin in the acid milk gel was shown to have no effect on the microstructure of the network at low concentration of polymer (0.1%w/w) which has been attributed to the sensitivity of this low DM pectin to calcium: LM pectin are trapped by calcium and not able to interact with casein micelles anymore. Multiple particle tracking was used to probe the effect of pectin on the heterogeneity of the system by following the distribution of the displacements of added micro beads at a given time lag during the gelation using the Van Hove distribution. Furthermore, the surface chemistry of the probes was modified in an attempt to control their location in the system. Finally, the mean square displacements of the casein micelles obtained by DWS and, of k-casein coated particles obtained by MPT were shown to give good agreement for the same acid milk system. Having established that the interaction between casein micelles and low methoxyl pectin is prevented by the pectin sensitivity to calcium, the effect of the pectin fine structure was investigated on the interaction between k-casein and pectin by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). The amount of pectin binding on a k-casein coated gold surface was shown to be strongly dependant on the pectin fine structure. It was concluded that small negative patches on the pectin backbone, likely to comprise of around two consecutive unmethylesterified galacturonic acid, are the most effective for pectin binding to k-casein. The effect of the direct interaction between pectin and k- casein on &#8216;calcium-free casein micelle mimics&#8217; in pectin solution was then investigated using coated latex beads. A pectin structure with a limited number of negative patches on its backbone was also shown to limit the potential for destabilization via bridging.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">acid milk gels</field><field name="subject">pectin casein interaction</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences::249900 Other Physical Sciences::249901 Biophysics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1209</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Trading off : a grounded theory on how M&#257;ori women negotiate drinking alcohol during pregnancy : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Public Health at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Stuart, Keriata</field><field name="description">This study aimed to understand how Maori women negotiate decisions about alcohol and pregnancy. It was based in the recognition that Maori women?s decisions about drinking alcohol when pregnant are shaped by social and cultural expectations about gender roles, as well as their knowledge about alcohol and pregnancy. Maori attitudes to alcohol have also been influenced by colonisation and Maori responses to it. Alcohol use in pregnancy also exists in the context of potential impacts, including fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. There is little knowledge about how and why women may or may not drink during pregnancy. The research used grounded theory methods. Information was gathered through in-depth interviews with ten Maori women. The information they provided was analysed using constant comparative analysis, and a series of categories was generated. The grounded theory proposes that Maori women manage decisions about drinking alcohol when pregnant using a process of Trading off. Trading off is supported by three key processes: drawing on resources, rationalising, and taking control of the role. Maori women start by learning the rules about alcohol, get messages about alcohol and pregnancy, change their alcohol use while making role transitions, and use alcohol in the processes of fitting in where you are, releasing the pressure, and carrying on as normal. Trading off is an individual process, but exists in a complex social context. The process is fluid, conditional, and continues throughout pregnancy. The theory must be recognised as my interpretation, although I believe it is grounded in the data, accounts for the data, and offers a new, modifiable and potentially useful interpretation. While the body of theory that can be compared to the theory of Trading off is limited, the interpretation is consistent with several models of health behaviour, including Maori health models. This research has implications for future research, and for the development of programmes to support Maori women.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori women</field><field name="subject">alcohol use</field><field name="subject">pregnant women</field><field name="subject">pregnancy</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321207 Indigenous health</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1211</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An analysis of polyphenolic blackcurrant (Ribes nigrum) extracts for the potential to modulate allergic airway inflammation : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Nutritional Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Taylor, Janet Lynley</field><field name="description">The allergic disease of asthma is characterized by an infiltration of inflammatory cells to the lung, a process co-ordinated by T-helper (TH) cells. The TH2 cytokine Interleukin (IL)-4 promotes infiltration of eosinophils to sites of inflammation. Eosinophil-selective chemoattractant cytokines (eg. eotaxins) are synthesized by lung epithelial cells. Eotaxin-3 is expressed at high levels in the asthmatic lung, predominantly after IL-4 stimulation. Eotaxin-3 is therefore a marker of inappropriate airway inflammation. Polyphenolic (PP) compounds found in high concentrations in berries may have beneficial effects in inflammatory conditions. Plant and Food Research produced high-PP extracts of blackcurrant (BC) cultivars that were tested for inflammation modulating effects. Since high doses of PPs have been shown to cause cell death, we tested two BC cultivars at a range of concentrations in a cell viability (WST-1) assay. While no toxic effects were attributable to the BC extracts (1-50&#181;g/ml), a dose-related trend in cell death was observed and therefore 10&#181;g/ml was chosen for further experiments Ten BC cultivars were compared for efficacy by measuring eotaxin-3 production in IL-4 stimulated human lung epithelial (A549) cells in vitro. Cells were incubated with BC extracts (10&#181;g/ml) and IL-4 (10ng/ml) for 24 hours. The supernatants were then quantified for eotaxin-3 levels by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). All ten BC extracts reduced eotaxin-3 levels after stimulation with IL-4, and six BC extracts were effective by statistically significant levels (P&lt;0.05), (BC cultivars -01, -02, -03, -05, -09 &amp; -10). Of those, BC extracts of four cultivars demonstrated a reduction of more than 65% from the IL-4 stimulated control. In addition, a positive trend in inflammation modulation vs. one anthocyanin (ACN) in the BC extracts was shown. This study has demonstrated the beneficial inflammation modulatory effects of polyphenolic BC extracts, which could be related to cyanidin 3-O-rutinoside content. These results may have therapeutic potential for asthma.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">blackcurrant</field><field name="subject">European black currant</field><field name="subject">Ribes nigrum</field><field name="subject">polyphenols</field><field name="subject">asthma</field><field name="subject">airway (medicine) inflammation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321205 Nutrition and dietetics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1212</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The diet of moreporks (Ninox novaeseelandiae) in relation to prey availability, and their roost site characteristics and breeding success on Ponui Island, Hauraki Gulf, New Zealand : a thesis presented in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Ecology at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Denny, Kirsty Marie</field><field name="description">The ecological importance of introduced mammalian predators is well acknowledged in New Zealand, however, little research has focused on the ecology of native avian predators and their role in communities. This study investigated the ecology of moreporks (Ninox novaeseelandiae) on Ponui Island, Hauraki Gulf, New Zealand between August 2007 and April 2008. The primary aim was to investigate the functional response of moreporks to availability of their prey. The contents of regurgitated morepork pellets were compared with relative abundance of prey taxa (invertebrates, small birds and rodents) over the study period. The diet consisted primarily of a range of invertebrate prey, particularly weta (Anostostomatidae and Raphidophoridae) and beetles (Coleoptera). Small numbers of vertebrate prey were recorded including rodents and birds. A positive relationship between the percentage contribution to pellet samples of certain taxa and their relative availability was found, and there were peaks in the occurrence of seasonally abundant taxa including cicadas (Cicadidae), and huhu beetles (Prionoplus reticularis). The tendency of moreporks to prey on abundant taxa indicates that they are unlikely to depress prey populations to low levels, and may have some degree of stabilising influence. A significant increase in the rodent component of the diet in April indicated that the risk to moreporks of secondary poisoning during mammalian pest control operations may vary considerably with the time of year. The secondary aims were to collect data on roost site characteristics and breeding success. Moreporks roosted at a mean height of 4m, and foliar cover at the 4-6m height tier appeared to be the most important characteristic of roost sites when compared with control sites. These findings suggested that moreporks were selecting roost sites with high overhead cover. Possible reasons for this include predator avoidance, avoidance of mobbing passerines, and the microclimate provided. None of three established pairs and two other birds were observed to establish a nest or breed successfully. Additionally, only three juvenile moreporks were sighted or heard across the 90ha study area suggesting low breeding success in 2007-08. This may have been influenced by a range of factors including 1), predation by the high densities of ship rats on Ponui, or other predators 2), a lack of suitable nest sites such as tree hollows in some areas or 3), competition for invertebrate prey with high densities of ship rats and North Island brown kiwi (Apteryx mantelli).</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">predator-prey interactions</field><field name="subject">avian predators</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270799 Ecology and evolution not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1213</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of black swan foraging on seagrass and benthic invertebrates in western Golden Bay : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Ecology, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Dixon, Henry David John</field><field name="description">Waterfowl are known to be capable of influencing wetland ecology in a number of ways, sometimes to the detriment of other species that also inhabit this type of environment. Western Golden Bay including Farewell Spit is one of the largest areas of intertidal sand flat habitat in New Zealand and supports a wide array of species including internationally important populations of bar-tailed godwits (Limosa lapponica) and red knot (Calidris canutus). These species, particularly red knot, have declined in number over the last the 25 years at this site. Another numerous species at this site, the black swan (Cygnus atratus), has been suggested as a possible contributor to the observed decline in wader numbers through their impact on the habitat. This thesis presents the findings of a research project on the role of black swans in the tidal seagrass (Zostera muelleri) ecosystem in western Golden Bay carried out between October 2007 and October 2008. In an effort create a clear picture of what role the black swans play in this environment the project focused on four major aspects of swan-ecosystem interactions. The first of these looked at the activity patterns of black swan. This showed the swans&#8217; activity is largely dictated by the tidal cycle with foraging occurring during the intertidal period when the seagrass is accessible while roosting is mostly confined to around high and low tides. The second part of the project explored the influence black swans have on the tidal seagrass landscape through their foraging habits. This showed that while swan foraging occurs across the tide flats it is concentrated on denser patches, on both small (meters) and large (hectares) scales. Experimental grubbings showed that the grubbing activity of swans is capable of forming and expanding bare sand patches within seagrass beds and that these bare patches can persist for at least two months. The third part of the project focused on the direct impacts of swan foraging on the seagrass and associated benthic invertebrates. Exclusion plots showed that at some sites swan foraging can significantly reduce Zostera biomass and invertebrate biodiversity. The final aspect examined was the role of swan in biomass and nutrient cycling. A faecal deposition survey showed swans consume 23.40 g DW ha-1 day-1 of Zostera. The average intake rate was 27.25 g DW ha-1 day-1. Nutrient analysis of seagrass 4 showed that shoot material has significantly higher N, P, Ca and fibre than rhizome and that rhizome has significantly more soluble carbohydrates than shoots. On the basis of the swans&#8217; direct and/or indirect influences on Zostera muelleri beds and the associated invertebrate fauna, swans could arguably be considered to be a major ecosystem engineer in the intertidal sandflats of Golden Bay.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand waterfowl</field><field name="subject">tidal ecosystem</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1214</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evolutionary and molecular origins of a phenotypic switch in Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 : a thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Ph.D. in Evolutionary Genetics at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Gallie, Jenna</field><field name="description">Survival in the face of unpredictable environments is a challenge faced by all organisms. One solution is the evolution of mechanisms that cause stochastic switching between phenotypic states. Despite the wide range of switching strategies found in nature, their evolutionary origins and adaptive significance remain poorly understood. Recently in the Rainey laboratory, a long-term evolution experiment performed with populations of the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 saw the de novo evolution of a phenotypic switching strategy. This provided an unprecedented opportunity to gain insight into the evolution and maintenance of switching strategies. The derived &#8216;switcher&#8217; genotype was detected through colony level phenotypic dimorphism. Further microscopic examination revealed the cellular basis of phenotypic switching as the bistable (ON/OFF) expression of a capsule. Transposon mutagenesis demonstrated that the structural basis of the capsule was a colanic acid-like polymer encoded by the Pflu3656-wzb locus. Subsequently, whole genome re-sequencing enabled elucidation of the series of mutational events underlying the evolution of capsule bistability: nine mutations were identified in the switcher. Present in both forms of the switcher, the final mutation &#8211; a point mutation in a central metabolic pathway &#8211; was shown to be the sole mechanistic cause of capsule switching; it &#8216;set the stage&#8217; for a series of molecular events directly responsible for bistability. Two models were proposed to explain capsule switching at the molecular level: the genetic amplification-reduction model, and the epigenetic feedback model. Collective results of biochemical and genetic assays proved consistent with the epigenetic model, whereby a decrease in flux through the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway activates an already-present feedback loop. Subsequent analysis of a second switcher (evolved independently of and in parallel with the first) revealed a radically different genetic route leading to phenotypically and mechanistically similar capsule switching. In addition to providing the first empirical insight into the evolutionary bases of switching strategies, the work presented in this thesis demonstrates the power of natural selection &#8211; operating on even the simplest of organisms &#8211; to forge adaptive solutions to evolutionary challenges; in a single evolutionary step, selection took advantage of inherent intracellular stochasticity to generate an extraordinarily flexible phenotype.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">evolutionary strategies</field><field name="subject">phenotypes</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270200 Genetics::270208 Molecular evolution</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1215</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation into the relationship between aluminium treatment and the superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzyme system in Lolium perenne (L. perenne cv. Nui) : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science (with Honours) in Plant Biology at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Gregory, Samuel James</field><field name="description">Lolium perenne cv. Nui is a cultivar of ryegrass grown throughout New Zealand in pastures due to favourable traits such as high palatability for livestock and its ability to withstand intensive grazing. However, the productivity of pastures is reduced when levels of aluminium and other metals accumulate in soils to toxic levels, a phenomenon referred to as the &#8216;acid soil syndrome&#8217;. In response to this toxicity, plants activate a series of antioxidant reactions, with one catalysed by the superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzymatic system. The enzyme system comprises three isoenzymes, a Cu/ZnSOD, FeSOD and a MnSOD which catalyse the same reaction but differ in amino acid sequence, molecular mass and the metal ion co-factor (hence Cu/ZnSOD, FeSOD and MnSOD). Together these isoenzymes combat the damaging effect of superoxide radicals which accumulate due to metal toxicity. In this thesis, the isolation of genes encoding isoenzymes of the SOD enzyme from L. perenne cv. Nui is described. As well, the growth of L. perenne cv. Nui and changes in expression of the SOD genes encoding each isoenzyme in response to aluminium treatment (0.2mM AlCl3) is investigated. A 1072 bp FeSOD gene sequence and a 705 bp MnSOD gene sequence were isolated from shoot tissue of L. perenne cv. Nui using a combination of RT-PCR with degenerate primers and 3'-RACE. The FeSOD gene comprised 572 bp of the coding sequence and 500 bp of 3'-UTR while the MnSOD gene comprised 508 bp of coding sequence and a 197 bp 3'-UTR. By alignment of each sequence with the gene from the database with highest identity it was predicted that the translation start codon (ATG) is located a further 196 bp upstream for the FeSOD gene (aligned with an Oryza sativa FeSOD sequence as a reference) and a further 152 bp upstream for the MnSOD sequence (aligned with a Triticum aestivum MnSOD sequence as a reference). Using RT-PCR with degenerate primers, a 313 bp CuSOD sequence was predominantly cloned from shoot tissue of L. perenne cv. Nui, but it was not possible to generate the 3'-UTR using 3'-RACE. For growth analysis, seedlings of L. perenne cv. Nui were germinated and acclimatised in Hoagland&#8217;s solution, and then subjected to either aluminium treatment (0.2mM  AlCl3) or no treatment to act as a control over a designated time course of 0, 4, 8, or 24 hours. Two growth trials were conducted that differed in the age of seedlings used and plant tissues were separated into root and shoot tissues. Similar growth trends were observed in both trials, but the sampling regime in the second growth trial meant that statistical analysis could be carried out. In this trial, analysis revealed that over a time course of 24 hours exposure to 0.2mM aluminium, both root and shoot tissue fresh weight did not significantly differ when compared to the control (no aluminium). A general trend of an increase in root and shoot fresh weight was observed in plants treated with aluminium, but this trend was not significant at P=0.05. No significant change in fresh weight partitioning from shoot to root, or root to shoot in response to aluminium was also observed. Using semi-quantitative Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (sqRTPCR) and primers based around the 3'-UTR with RNA isolated from plants grown in the second hydroponic trial, it was determined that under the conditions used, expression of the FeSOD and MnSOD genes isolated in this study were neither up-regulated or downregulated in response to aluminium treatment in both shoot and root tissue. Further, using degenerate primers to detect expression of one or more genes encoding the Cu/ZnSOD isoenzyme, total expression of the Cu/ZnSOD isoenzyme was also unresponsive to aluminium treatment.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ryegrass</field><field name="subject">acid soil syndrome</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1216</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of proximal sensing methods for soil mapping and monitoring, and their application to precision irrigation : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Soil Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Hedley, Carolyn B</field><field name="description">The potential of proximal soil sensing methods for high resolution investigation of soils in the landscape has been investigated. This addresses the need for improved environmental monitoring and management of soils within their environs. On-the-go electromagnetic (EM) mapping has been used to map soils, providing a high resolution (&lt; 10m) spatially defined soil apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) datalayer. Vis-NIR field spectroscopy has been trialled for in situ analysis of soil carbon, nitrogen and moisture. The portable spectroradiometer has been used at 6 sites in the Taupo-Rotorua region for rapid, field analysis of soil carbon (R2 calibration = 0.95, R2 prediction = 0.75,) soil nitrogen (R2 calibration = 0.95, R2 prediction = 0.86) and moisture (R2 calibration = 0.96, R2 prediction = 0.70) by collecting reflectance spectra from the flat surface of a soil core; and at one Manawatu site for soil moisture (R2 calibration = 0.79, R2 prediction = 0.71), where the reflectance spectra were collected directly from a freshly cut in situ soil surface. EM mapping and Vis-NIR field spectroscopy were used in combination to spatially characterize soil moisture patterns at the Manawatu site. Soil available water-holding capacity (AWC) of ECa-defined zones has been assessed at six irrigated production farming sites. Two methods (predicted AWC v ECa; estimated AWC v ECa) have been used to relate soil ECa to soil AWC to predict spatial AWC (R2 = 0.8 at 5 sites). Site-specific soil water balance models have been developed at all sites; and a wireless real-time soil moisture monitoring network has been trialled at two sites, to be used with the ECa-AWC prediction model for the development of daily soil water status maps, for variable rate irrigation (VRI) scheduling. This digital, spatially defined soil water status information is available for upload to a sprinkler system modified for variable rate application. The calculated water savings with VRI were 926% with equivalent energy savings and improved irrigation water use efficiency. Drainage and runoff were reduced by 055% during the period of irrigation, with the accompanying reduced risk of nitrogen leaching. The reduction in virtual water content of product has also been assessed for VRI and compared with uniform rate irrigation (URI) at three study sites. This study suggests that these proximal sensing methods provide a new improved way of monitoring and mapping soils. This facilitates soil inventory mapping, for example soil moisture and carbon mapping. In addition, these high resolution environmental monitoring and mapping techniques provide the information required for optimizing site-specific management of natural resources at the farm scale. On-the-go electromagnetic (EM) mapping has enabled a step change in the pedological investigation of New Zealand soils. Resulting soil ECa maps provide a tool for improving traditional soil map boundaries because they delineate soil zones primarily on a basis of soil texture and moisture in non-saline soils. In this study the maps have been used for site-specific irrigation management at the farm-scale, aiming to increase the energy efficiency of this land management operation. The study has developed a method for improved use of freshwaters by more accurate irrigation scheduling, based on high resolution characterization of spatial and temporal soil differences.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">soil testing</field><field name="subject">soil moisture</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300100 Soil and Water Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1217</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing a low pressure blow molding machine for demonstration purposes and production of plastic bottles : a thesis presented in p artial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Engineering in Mechatronics at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Hugener, Bruno</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the research of packaging beer into plastic bottles and the design and manufacture of a low pressure bottle blow moulding machine for demonstration purposes. The machine will be used for the production of plastic bottles suitable for bottling brewed beer at the microbrewery at Massey University Palmerston North. Premanufactured PET preforms have proven to be the most convenient and promising choice for the fabrication of blown bottles. Basic tests to understand the behaviour of the preforms and the challenges of the blowing process have been carried out. A special focus has been placed on the different circumstances at University in contrast to industrial bottle production in particular the needed air pressure to form the bottles. The following step was to find the ideal method and principle to handle the preforms and to transform them in the desired shape. Finally the design, drawing of the parts and assemblies were carried out with the 3-D CAD software Solidworks. The designed parts for the bottle blower have been manufactured at the mechanical Workshop at Massey University. To control the bottle blower, the National Instruments USB interface was selected which required the design and manufacture of an additional driver interface card to protect the USB interface and convert the TTL levels into higher voltage. The final assembly and testing of the blower then concluded the practical work for this master project. A suitable design for the bottle production was found and the assembled Bottle Blower can now be used for the production of PET bottles.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bottle manufacture</field><field name="subject">PET bottles</field><field name="subject">beer bottles</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291400 Materials Engineering::291407 Plastics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1218</field></doc><doc><field name="title">VERTIPH : a visual environment for real-time image processing on hardware : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Computer Systems Engineering at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Johnston, Christopher Troy</field><field name="description">This thesis presents VERTIPH, a visual programming language for the development of image processing algorithms on FPGA hardware. The research began with an examination of the whole design cycle, with a view to identifying requirements for implementing image processing on FPGAs. Based on this analysis, a design process was developed where a selected software algorithm is matched to a hardware architecture tailor made for its implementation. The algorithm and architecture are then transformed into an FPGA suitable design. It was found that in most cases the most efficient mapping for image processing algorithms is to use a streamed processing approach. This constrains how data is presented and requires most existing algorithms to be extensively modified. Therefore, the resultant designs are heavily streamed and pipelined. A visual notation was developed to complement this design process, as both streaming and pipelining can be well represented by data flow visual languages. The notation has three views each of which represents and supports a different part of the design process. An architecture view gives an overview of the design's main blocks and their interconnections. A computational view represents lower-level details by representing each block by a set of computational expressions and low-level controls. This includes a novel visual representation of pipelining that simplifies latency analysis, multiphase design, priming, flushing and stalling, and the detection of sequencing errors. A scheduling view adds a state machine for high-level control of processing blocks. This extended state objects to allow for the priming and flushing of pipelined operations. User evaluations of an implementation of the key parts of this language (the architecture view and the computational view) found that both were generally good visualisations and aided in design (especially the type interface, pipeline and control notations). The user evaluations provided several suggestions for the improvement of the language, and in particular the evaluators would have preferred to use the diagrams as a verification tool for a textual representation rather than as the primary data capture mechanism. A cognitive dimensions analysis showed that the language scores highly for thirteen of the twenty dimensions considered, particularly those related to making details of the design clearer to the

organises my work in four sections: Between Practice and Research; Between Practice and Clinical/Operational Management; Between Practice and Policy; and Between Practice and the Public. A context-setting introduction puts the work in the temporal frame of the 1960's through 2001 and announces the point of view taken on nursing: the reason for the existence of the modern health care delivery system is to provide nursing care. In the first section, the publications deal with the development of clinical nursing research methods.  My particular effort was to conceptualise the relationship between nursing practice and research.  The publications show how that relationship was actualised. The second section contains work done 20 years or so after that reported in the first section, but the work is closely related.  Here, the publications deal with the extension of the notion of nursing practice research to clinical/operational management using the rich administrative data produced by casemix (Diagnosis Related Groups - DRGs). This body of work reveals nursing as resource.  The third section holds literature review and policy analysis that provide the contexts for nursing practice.  Publications deal particularly with the 'expanded role' of nursing as nurse practitioner, nurse-midwife and nurse anesthetist.  Research and policy are knit together in this section. In the fourth section, I connect nursing to public forums. The concluding section draws together the themes that have occurred throughout: valuing nursing and making the discipline visible and credible in terms the world understands.  The thesis ends with a metaphor that makes research, operations and policy one with public practice: nursing as craft.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nursing research</field><field name="subject">Nursing history</field><field name="subject">Nursing literature</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/233</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hello, ruel World</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">The analytic component of the thesis approaches major questions in Cultural Studies, Philosophy and Social Theory through an investigation of various forms of creative practice.  I approach the question of agency, for instance, through a study of stage actors, who must recite set lines, and yet feel empowered precisely by the opportunity to act through them.  Investigation of the author's own work as a poet and novelist serves to cast light upon ideology, ie. how one might use a constrained language and yet feel empowered to speak new things through it.  I apply these investigations to Althusser, whose famous essay on the total power of ideological interpellation is permeated  with theatrical metaphor.  I suggest that Althusser is repressing the creative component of everyday life, something social theory has ever found hard to theorise.  I proceed to suggest that the place where such processes are analysed is in the philosophy of science. The work of Charles Saunders Peirce on the experimental method is, my investigation uncovers, surprisingly geared toward the investigation of creativity.  In science one has a method for, and an extensive literature on, discovering new phenomena.  My thesis is that the experimental method of modern scientists, and the creative method of modern writers, both geared toward the production of things that are at once new and true, is largely the same.  I use Peircean semiotics to argue that creative composition is about listening to the languages spoken all round you, and transcribing their objective contours.  So as to have effect on others.  Which is just like science.  And in both instances we are endlessly spoken through at every moment by the myriad languages which interpellate us.  Whence creativity (for those who are open to it).  My three portfolio pieces are:  Cube Root of Book: a series of one hundred and thirty two poems set at intervals along the descending spiral of a Fibonacci number sequence.  The 14th Floor, an Hypothesis, an experimental novel, written quite literally as an experiment; i.e. having written the novel, I then wrote up a prac-report detailing what I had learnt about the performance of writing, including the above.  Unaustralia, a Study of Heads, an attempt to show the relevance of these findings to Cultural Studies and other related practices.  It centres on my new reading of Althusser, and is flanked by mini-ethnographies of creative practice, including the above.  The poetry is presented as a major new creative work. The experimental novel/ book of philosophy as a substantial contribution to knowledge.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cube root of book -- The 14th floor</field><field name="subject">an hypothesis -- Unaustralia</field><field name="subject">a study of heads</field><field name="subject">prefaced and postfaced by Leninheads</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/234</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Integrating Business Strategy and Enterprise Resource Planning Systems</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">'Half of all technology projects fail to meet CEO expectations'. CSC Index study (in CIO Enterprise, July 1998) Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Systems promise to revolutionise the way a business operates: allowing greater flexibility, market responsiveness, customer service, management information and reduced costs. However experiences and opinions vary dramatically as to whether ERP systems deliver on these promises. Certainly ERP systems customer demand remains strong, with major ERP systems vendors experiencing several years of double-digit growth and better, with a whole sub-industry of consultants and systems integrators growing around ERP system. This study examines the strategic nature and implications of the ERP systems decision: in reality a multitude of decisions, which together have drastic and lasting effects on nearly all aspects of an organisation. As with all strategic issues, there is no `step-by-step recipe for success' with ERP, but rather a successful approach depends on the specific organisation and its environment. Therefore what is required is an assessment and analysis of these, the results of which are combined with established knowledge about IT systems development and implementation to determine the most suitable approach. In this way ERP is integrated with organisational strategy and therefore can achieve maximum benefit. If ERP is not viewed and managed as a strategic project, it is likely, at best, to be a massive waste of resources and, at worst, may cripple an organisation.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Business planning</field><field name="subject">Manufacturing resource planning</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/235</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Friend or Intruder? Living with an Implantable Defibrillator: Patients' and Partners' Experiences.</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">The implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is a reliable, cost-effective implanted device designed to terminate life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias and prevent sudden death. The recent exponential increase in implantation rates emphasises the need for nurses, doctors and other clinicians to understand the experience of living with an ICD for patients and partners. Current knowledge of patient experiences is mostly derived from overseas studies of specific variables, including physical problems, psychosocial outcomes, ICD shocks and quality of life issues. Studies of partner experiences focus on psychosocial concerns. Using van Manen's (1990) hermeneutic phenomenological approach, this study describes the experience of living with an ICD for seven Australian patients and six partners.  Experiential descriptions, obtained in tape-recorded conversational interviews, were subjected to three levels of analysis. The first descriptive analysis summarised individual experiences of living with an ICD. The second, thematic analysis phenomenologically described the collective lived experience of being a patient, and of being a partner. Each description identified a challenging and changing experience through the themes of Being Disrupted and Distressed, Reconstructing Life, Appreciating and Celebrating Life, and Accommodating the ICD. For the patient, various everyday interactions, events and activities meant either being able to trust the ICD as a reassuring protection or experiencing it as an inescapable intrusive object. For the partner, a trusting reliance on the ICD's protective security eased the vulnerability and onerous perceived responsibility for the patient's survival and well-being. Threats to the partner's restored sense of normality, security and hope occurred when the patient wanted the ICD removed or discontinued. The third hermeneutic analysis specifically explored how the ICD, as an implanted biomedical device, was perceived, embodied and comprehended by patients. This analysis disclosed the varied, ambiguous existential meanings derived from and accorded to the ICD's presence, power and potential. The interpretation concluded that the ICD was either embodied as a trusted and reassuring friend, or existentially rejected as an intruder that thwarted meaningful possibilities. Theoretical and practical implications of this understanding of living with an ICD included several recommendations for improving staff education, as well as practical interventions for informing and supporting patients and partners. A proposal for implementing these recommendations concluded with suggestions for future inquiries that would extend understanding of this increasingly common human phenomenon.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators</field><field name="subject">Psychological aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/236</field></doc><doc><field name="title">We Love To Hate Help Desk</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">Customer satisfaction with the Information Technology Help Desk is the focus of this study. Technology in the workplace has increased exponentially. Therefore customers are more reliant on the Help Desk then ever before. This has raised the importance of the role that Help Desk plays in the functioning of an organisation.  The fundamental aim of this study is to answer  the questions below;  1. Is dissatisfaction truly present for individual problems, or is it a generalisation or "urban myth"?  2. Which of the five hypotheses are the most significant in causing dissatisfaction amongst customers? The five hypotheses focus on the areas of Communication, Solutions, Service, Knowledge (up-to-date), and Morale.  A computer-based survey was used to query the customers. The survey questions linked back to the hypotheses. The customer was given the opportunity to make an optional comment to discover any sensitive issues that the survey did not address.  The average "overall satisfaction" rating for the survey suggested the general population is more satisfied then dissatisfied with the services of the Help Desk. From the study I was able to conclude that dissatisfaction is present for individual problems, but the dissatisfied customer only accounts for 8% of the surveyed population.  Having proven that customer dissatisfaction is present the next step was to determine the nature of the problem to provide useful information to reduce customer dissatisfaction. Investigating the surveys on the basis of problem category did this.  The results indicated that customer dissatisfaction was most prevalent in calls concerning changes made to PCs and server interruptions. Therefore the Help Desk needs to re-evaluate the processes for handling problems of this nature. In contrast customers were most satisfied with assistance for problems relating to desktop software and hardware. Therefore dissatisfaction is not an "urban myth".  Of all the five hypotheses, Help Desk morale stood out as producing more satisfaction than any of the other hypotheses including "overall satisfaction". Help Desk morale proved to be significantly different in nature when compared to the four other hypotheses. Therefore the moral of the Help Desk team is a fundamental ingredient for brewing a successful service. Get this wrong and all aspects of the team and the service will decline.  The most important influence on "overall satisfaction" was "satisfaction with keeping up with technological change", and the least important factor was "satisfaction with ability to predict problems through good communication". This would indicate an up-to-date Help Desk is more likely to have satisfied customers.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Information technology.</field><field name="subject">Computer industry.</field><field name="subject">Customer services.</field><field name="subject">Management.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/237</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Holistic aspects of rehabilitation post cardiac surgery in the Bonny method of guided imagery and music.</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This thesis has set out to investigate the role of music therapy in the form of the specialist Bonny Method of Guided Imagery and Music (GIM) with a view to exploring how meanings related to adjustment from a health crisis (such as cardiac surgery) are depicted in music-supported imagery. Factors shaping clinical interpretations of verbal and musical responses in music therapy practice are often unclear or undelineated. A systematic interpretive process relevant to clinical health care was developed using the Bonny Method of Guide Imagery and Music (GIM), providing a means for exploring the emotional difficulties of coronary bypass patients, who typically recover quickly from physical surgery but often experience residual symptoms such as depression, pain, and anxiety. The interpretive process accessed both verbal and non-verbal texts, playing them against each other in order to find significance for music therapy practice in rehabilitation. A Bonny Method of Guided Imagery and Music (GIM) series was undertaken by patients recovering from coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), with each session audiotaped and transcribed. This narrative data was analyzed thematically, and grand themes were used to focus further intertextual (semiotic) and Jungian perspectives, in the process of deriving substantial clinical meanings. Results suggested that participants used a wide range of personal, cultural and archetypal texts to convey meanings about their health care situation, including images of the music during the therapeutic process. Clinical change in the rehabilitative process was suggested by grand themes comprising 'Looking through the frame', 'Feeling the impact', 'Spiralling into the unexpected', 'Sublime plateau', and 'Rehearsing new steps' and the further music-related grand theme of 'Sounding the changes'. This project highlights the value of GIM as a vehicle to track clinical change with cardiac patients, based on a systematic interpretive process sensitive to the interweaving verbal and nonverbal texts evident in the music therapy context.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Music therapy</field><field name="subject">Postoperative care</field><field name="subject">Heart</field><field name="subject">Diseases</field><field name="subject">Patients</field><field name="subject">Rehabilitation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/238</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Variation and change in university teachers' ways of experiencing teaching</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This thesis explores how university teachers'  ways of experiencing teaching change from teacher focused to student focused and why some teachers experience this change while others do not.  The exploration adopts the theoretical perspective of variation, learning and awareness (Marton and Booth, 1997) and is based on a two-year longitudinal interview study of 27 university teachers.  Classical and new phenomenographies were used to constitute teachers' ways of experiencing teaching and teachers' ways of experiencing change in teaching.  Changes in individual teachers' ways of experiencing were described and interpreted through focusing on teachers' awareness of critical aspects and related dimensions of variation, creating individual vignettes, and constituting themes in the critical experiences and orientations related to change.  The outcomes included six ways of experiencing teaching and their complementary patterns of critical aspects, a set of themes related to change in ways of experiencing and five ways of experiencing change in teaching.  Combining these outcomes resulted in four patterns which illuminated why some teachers' ways of experiencing teaching became student focused while others remained teacher focused.  Teachers who became capable of experiencing teaching in student-focused ways focused on understanding teaching in relation to students' learning.  They experienced change in teaching as becoming more student-focused or as relating teaching to development or change in student understandings, and were oriented towards putting teaching into focus and reflecting in ways informed by formal learning.  These teachers experienced relevance structures which brought the critical aspects of student-focused ways of experiencing teaching to the foreground of their awareness so that they experienced corresponding dimensions of variation.  Their awareness of teaching expanded and this corresponded to a shift in the focus and meaning of teaching.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">College teaching.</field><field name="subject">Teachers.</field><field name="subject">Methodology.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/239</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Working the knowledge game? The power of the everyday in managing truth in organsations.</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This thesis focuses on what I have called truth management.  First it traces how modernist and postmodern theorists play their versions of what counts as true.  A key critique I stage of modernist theorising is that it privileges decontextualised ways of knowing and silences agency.  Drawn from postmodern concerns and my critique of 'normal science', two maps of 'thinking tools' (Bourdieu 1992) are proposed as the basis of my theorising of how truth is managed in organisations.  The first map aims to position contextualism within the empirical gaze.  It is made up of three contingencies - discourses, time and space.  The second map of thinking tools aims to bring agency back into view.  It is made up of four contingencies - identity, capital, practices and power.  Each of the seven contingencies is used to frame the story of an inter-organisational partnership between an Australian university and a financial institution in part two of the thesis.  The story traces their engagement in a negotiated postgraduate degree program - the Work-Based Learning (WBL) program from 1996-2003.  In this way, I aim to demonstrate the power of everyday decision making in determining what counts as true.  The management of truth is seen to be dynamic, multiple and contingent rather than causal, singular and able to be plotted on a linear trajectory.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Truth</field><field name="subject">Knowledge Management</field><field name="subject">Organisational behaviour</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/240</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into the Erodibility of Earth Wall Units</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This investigation looked at the climatic variables affecting the durability of earth buildings and the relationship between these climatic variables and their laboratory counterparts, with the aim of providing a means whereby performance in the field under known climatic conditions can be predicted by performance in the laboratory.  The investigation showed that the major climatic factors influencing the erosion of earth walls due to wind-driven rain are impacting rainfall volume, drop impact velocity (as determined by wind conditions), raindrop size and duration of rainfall. A vertical rain gauge was calibrated with climatic conditions at a test site in Sydney to enable accurate prediction of the volume of water impacting test specimens. In the laboratory, a standard spray test was modified by introducing a commercially available nozzle, which produces a turbulent spray of individual drops, rather than a stream of water. Erosion rates using this apparatus were found to vary significantly with time, and a correction formula was derived from experimental results to enable comparison to be made between field and laboratory results. Erosion rates per unit volume of water were found to be proportional to impacting velocity raised to the power 2.5 and inversely proportional to the median drop diameter raised to the power 1.2. A material factor was defined as the 60 minute erosion mass loss divided by the 60 minute volume of impacting water spray. Field tests were carried out over a period of four years and analysed in relation to the associated laboratory test results. Laboratory testing was carried out on one half of split specimens, the other half being subjected to exposure to the weather at Sydney's International Airport, with regular monitoring of wind and rain records.  An empirical model was developed and was used to compare field and laboratory results.  This confirmed the importance of impacting volume of water and material factor but in this case the calculated correlation between field and laboratory erosions was not improved by the addition of impact velocity and drop size terms.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Earth Construction</field><field name="subject">Materials</field><field name="subject">Deterioration</field><field name="subject">Erosion</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/241</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gaseous Secondary Electron Detection and Cascade Amplification in the Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This thesis quantitatively investigates gaseous electron-ion recombination in an environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM) at a transient level by utilizing the dark shadows/streaks seen in gaseous secondary electron detector (GSED) images immediately after a region of enhanced secondary electron (SE) emission is encountered by a scanning electron beam. The investigation firstly derives a theoretical model of gaseous electron-ion recombination that takes into consideration transients caused by the time constant of the GSED electronics and external circuitry used to generate images. Experimental data of pixel intensity versus time of the streaks is then simulated using the model enabling the relative magnitudes of (i) ionization and recombination rates, (ii) recombination coefficients, and (iii) electron drift velocities, as well as absolute values of the total time constant of the detection system, to be determined as a function of microscope operating parameters. Results reveal the exact dependence that the effects of SE-ion recombination on signal formation have on reduced electric field intensity and time in ESEM. Furthermore, the model implicitly demonstrates that signal loss as a consequence of field retardation due to ion space charges, although obviously present, is not the foremost phenomenon causing streaking in images, as previously thought. Following that the generation and detection of gaseous scintillation and electro- luminescence produced via electron-gas molecule excitation reactions in ESEM is investigated. Here a novel gaseous scintillation detection (GSD) system is developed to efficiently detect photons produced. Images acquired using GSD are compared to those obtained using conventional GSED detection, and demonstrate that images rich in SE contrast can be achieved using such systems. A theoretical model is developed that describes the generation of photon signals by cascading SEs, high energy backscattered electrons (BSEs) and primary beam electrons (PEs). Photon amplification, or the total number of photons produced per sample emissive electron, is then investigated, and compared to conventional electronic amplification, over a wide range of microscope operating parameters, imaging gases and photon collection geometries. The main findings of the investigation revealed that detected electroluminescent signals exhibit larger SE signal-to-background levels than that of conventional electronic signals detected via GSED. Also, dragging the electron cascade towards the light pipe assemblage of GSD systems, or electrostatic focusing, dramatically increases photon collection efficiencies. The attainment of such an improvement being a direct consequence of increasing the `effective' solid angle for photon collection. Finally, in attempt to characterize the scintillating wavelengths arising from sample emissive SEs, PEs, BSEs, and their respective cascaded electrons, such that future photon filtering techniques can be employed to extract nominated GSD imaging signals, the emission spectra of commonly utilized electroluminescent gases in ESEM, such as argon (Ar) and nitrogen (N2), were collected and investigated. Spectra of Ar and N2 reveal several major emission lines that occur in the ultraviolet (UV) to near infrared (NIR) regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. The major photon emissions discovered in Ar are attributed to occur via atomic de-excitation transitions of neutral Ar (Ar I), whilst for N2, major emissions are attributed to be a consequence of second positive band vibrational de-excitation reactions. Major wavelength intensity versus gas pressure data, for both Ar and N2, illustrate that wavelength intensities increase with decreasing pressure. This phenomenon strongly suggesting that quenching effects and reductions in excitation mean free paths increase with imaging gas pressure.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">electron microscope</field><field name="subject">scanning</field><field name="subject">cascade</field><field name="subject">signal loss</field><field name="subject">gaseous</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/242</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Strategic Management of International Entrepreneurial Activities at Australian Universities</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">Universities around the world are increasingly focusing on entrepreneurial activities.  In Australia, the growth of international entrepreneurial activities has resulted in the creation of a billion-dollar export-oriented sector.  These activities include the recruitment of international students to Australian campuses, the development of Australian university campuses in offshore locations, and the delivery of Australian degree programs at both onshore and offshore locations in partnership with universities, professional associations and private corporations.  Australian universities currently receive on average around seven percent of revenues from these sources, with some depending on international entrepreneurialism for as much as one-third of revenues.  Managing these activities in an efficient, effective and sustainable manner has thus become critically important to virtually every institution in the Australian higher education sector.  Long dependent on government funding, Australian universities have found the rise of international entrepreneurialism a significant shift.  As is the case when businesses become international, universities are faced with the need to manage the complexities, risks and challenges associated with international operations.  To date, little empirical work has been undertaken which explores and examines how Australian universities are managing their international entrepreneurial business operations.  The aim of this study is thus to respond to this research gap by exploring how Australian universities, particularly in terms of their Faculties of Business, organise and manage international entrepreneurial activities.  The research examines management approaches, practices and processes at five Australian universities.  Two are highly international, metropolitan universities recognised around the world as leaders in international entrepreneurialism.  Two are smaller, regional institutions, while the fifth  university is a medium-sized metropolitan institution which had in recent times moved aggressively to develop its international activities.  Document analysis, observation and interviews with senior institutional managers, academic managers and academics at each university revealed several common themes arising in institutional approaches.  These included an emphasis on diversified, offshore growth; a degree of movement towards structural centralisation, particularly in the highly international universities which had been historically highly decentralised; the presence of generally supportive organisational cultures; a perception among academic managers and academics that most international activities remain driven by financial imperatives; the perceived potential for detrimental impacts on academic research arising from increased involvement in international activities; the existence of a common concern among senior institutional managers for the effects of Faculty of Business dominance of international programs in their institutions; a tendency for most organisational learning to be informal, except in the highly international institutions; and a preference for decentralised strategic leadership which included a degree of oversight by internationally experienced senior institutional managers.  A Strategic Advantage Model of Internationalisation is presented representing a theoretical and conceptual synthesis of the findings.  Building on previous work undertaken in the field, the model focuses on the need for institutions to achieve best practice and competitive advantage through the leveraging of organisational and strategic competencies, the pursuit of executional advantages, the implementation of strategically decentralised leadership and the development of international business competencies.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Universities and colleges</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Management</field><field name="subject">International Business Enterprises</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/243</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Negotiating Place in Colonial Darwin. Interactions between Aborigines and Whites 1869-1911</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This thesis draws on the documentary historical record to examine the interactions between the indigenous Larrakia people and the white settlers in the colonial township of Darwin between the years 1869 and 1911.  The colonial recognition of the Larrakia as the traditional owners of lands in the Darwin region and the historical question of their land rights is discussed in some detail.  Rather than seeing interactions between the Larrakia and the colonisers as polarised into either accommodation or resistance, this thesis looks at various interactions to highlight the complexities of the encounter.  One of the more complex of their interactions was the negotiation of what is best described as an abstruse alliance which benefited both the Larrakia and the colonisers in various ways.  The colonisation of the Darwin region had a considerable impact on the Larrakia people's ability to live on their country as they had done prior to the invasion.  This thesis seeks to understand the negotiations, compromises and decisions the Larrakia made to survive in their changing landscape.  Another complexity that is highlighted in this thesis is the tension within the white settler population about how to deal with what was presented as the 'Aboriginal problem'.  This thesis shows that the ideology of compensating Aboriginal people for having invaded their land and undermining their means of subsistence was understood and condoned by the colonisers.  The distribution of government rations, the allocation of reserves and the ongoing recognition of the Larrakia's right to be within the township were all ways that some colonisers attempted to compensate Aborigines for invading their land.  This thesis shows that while the Larrakia people were recognised as the prior occupants of Darwin and, as such, accorded a distinct status within the township in the whole period under study, the colonisers ultimately failed to give tangible expression to the Larrakia's land rights.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">History</field><field name="subject">Northern Territory</field><field name="subject">Darwin (N.T)</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/244</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contingency planning models for Government agencies</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This report describes a research study into the current situation within Federal, State Government and selected private sector agencies, assessing contingency plans for Information Systems and suggests models for state-wide planning against Information Systems disasters. Following a brief look at various phases of contingency plan development, the study looks into the factors that prompt organisations to prepare contingency plans. The project involved a survey of current Information Systems contingency plans in the government agencies in the states of Victoria, Western Australia, South Australia, New South Wales and in the Australian Capital Territory. It also included two major banks, an insurance company and two computer services bureaux in the private sector within New South Wales. The survey determined that particular factors play important roles in the decision by organisations to commence contingency planning. These include actual disaster experience, senior management support, auditor's comments, legal requirements, risk analysis and business impact study, economic considerations, insurance requirements, contract commitment, new staff and introduction of new hardware and software. The critical success factors in contingency planning include regular maintenance and testing of the plan. The project also discusses the current contingency planning environment within New South Wales Government agencies and suggests cost-effective models for state-wide adoption.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Information resources management</field><field name="subject">Security measures</field><field name="subject">Emergency management</field><field name="subject">Business enterprises</field><field name="subject">Computer networks</field><field name="subject">Administrative agencies</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/245</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Daunorubicin Kinetics and Drug Resistance in Leukaemia</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">The aims of this thesis were to examine: (1) plasma and cellular pharmacokinetics of daunorubicin and its major metabolite daunorubicinol in patients with acute leukaemia, and the relationships between pharmacokinetics, patient response and the presence of P glycoprotein; (2) actions of the multidrug resistance reversing agents cyclosporin A and trifluoperazine, at clinically achievable concentrations, on daunorubicin accumulation and retention in human leukaemia cell lines and patients with acute leukaemia; and (3) effect of daunorubicin on the cell membrane of both sensitive and resistant cell lines, with and without the multidrug resistance reversing agents. Twenty-seven patients with acute leukaemia received daunorubicin as part of induction therapy. The plasma and cellular levels of daunorubicin and its metabolite daunorubicinol were determined using HPLC. There were no significant differences between patients who went into complete remission (12 out of 23) compared to those who did not respond for any of the plasma pharmacokinetic parameters. There was a significant difference in the cellular daunorubicin and daunorubicinol area under the concentration-time curve between responders and non responders (p less than 0.02), as well as in cellular Cmax, cellular clearance and cellular volume of distribution. Eleven patients were P glycoprotein positive and 10 P glycoprotein negative (no sample available for 2 patients). There was no correlation between patient response and the presence of P glycoprotein; nor a correlation between the cellular concentration of daunorubicin or daunorubicinol and P glycoprotein. Patients responding to chemotherapy had higher cellular daunorubicin and daunorubicinol compared to non responders. In contrast to in vitro studies, overexpression of P glycoprotein was not the reason for the lower cellular daunorubicin levels. Cyclosporin A was capable of increasing both cellular accumulation and retention in the drug resistant CEM/VLB and HL 60/ADR cell lines, but not in the drug sensitive CEM and HL 60 cell lines. Trifluoperazine had no effect in any of the four cell lines. In contrast to the cell line findings, only the combination of cyclosporin A and trifluoperazine were able to increase both accumulation and retention in the blast cells of patients at initial presentation. The multidrug resistant reversing agents alone had no effect in increasing accumulation or retention in the blast cells of P glycoprotein positive patients, nor patients in relapse. The cell line studies show that at clinically relevant concentrations only cyclosporin A is capable of increasing daunorubicin accumulation in both the drug resistant P glycoprotein positive (VLB) and P glycoprotein negative (ADR) cell lines. Thus, cyclosporin A does not work only by inhibiting the actions of P glycoprotein. Trifluoperazine was unable to reverse drug resistance at clinically relevant concentrations in either cell lines or patient blast cells. However, the combination of cyclosporin A and trifluoperazine increased accumulation in patient blast cells at initial presentation, suggesting that these agents may be more useful in patients at initial presentation than relapse.  Daunorubicin was immobilised by linking it to poly vinyl alcohol and the effect of immobilised-daunorubicin was studied on the four cell lines above. The immobilised-daunorubicin was able to decrease cell growth in the drug sensitive HL 60 cell line but not in the drug resistant VLB or ADR cell lines. Poly vinyl alcohol itself was cytotoxic to the CEM cell line. The multidrug resistance reversing agents cyclosporin A and trifluoperazine were only capable of increasing cytotoxicity in the HL 60 cell line, with no effect in the drug resistant VLB or ADR cell lines.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pharmacokinetics</field><field name="subject">Acute Leukaemia - Treatment</field><field name="subject">daunorubicin</field><field name="subject">cyclosporin</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/247</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Numerical Study of a Rotary Valve Internal Combustion Engine</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">A Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation of the Bishop Rotary Valve (BRV) engine is developed. The simulation used an existing commercial CFD code, CFX 4.3, with a number of new routines written to allow it to simulate the conditions and motions involved in an internal combustion engine. The code is extensively validated using results from other researchers, and several new validations are performed to directly validate the code for simulating internal combustion engine flows. Firstly, tumble vortex breakdown during the compression stroke of a square piston model engine is modelled. The results of the simulation are validated against published high quality experimental data. Both two- and three-dimensional models are tested, using the k-e and Reynolds stress turbulence models. The Reynolds stress turbulence model simulations successfully predicted the tumble break down process during the compression stroke. A simple three-dimensional Large Eddy Simulation model is also presented. The numerical simulation is then applied to the BRV engine. An in-cylinder flow field not previously described is discovered, created by the unique combustion chamber shape of the BRV engine. The flow field is not adequately described by the traditional descriptions of engine flows, being squish, swirl and tumble. The new flow structure is named 'dual cross tumble', and is characterised by two counter-rotating vortices in the cross tumble plane on either side of the inlet air jet. Analysis of the dual tumble structure indicates that it is most beneficial in high bore to stroke ratio engines. This flow structure has been predicted or visualised by a small number of previous researchers, however no published research has recognised its significance or potential benefits. The validated code is then used to predict the effect of modifying the valve cross sectional area, the effect of the inlet manifold wave, the effect of heat transfer from the inlet manifold walls, the effect of bore to stroke ratio, and the effect of engine speed. This work presents a numerical simulation of a new rotary valve engine technology. This opens up a whole new area of engine aerodynamics research as no detailed examination of the flows in a rotary valve engine have been presented previously. In the process, it discovers a new compression stroke turbulence generation mechanism, 'dual cross tumble', which offers the potential of performance levels not possible using poppet valve engines.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Internal Combustion Engines</field><field name="subject">Mathematical Models</field><field name="subject">Fluid Dynamics</field><field name="subject">Valves</field><field name="subject">Design and Construction</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/248</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Glittering Thread: The 1954 Royal Tour of Australia</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This thesis is a broadly-based historical study of the 1954 Royal Tour of Australia. In presenting an anatomy of this important but neglected event, it attempts to restore its place in history, to explain the nature of the enduring popular attachment to the British Royal Family, to examine the self-portrait that Australia presented to its Royal visitors in the post-war era and to investigate the political and cultural processes by which it did so. The primary theoretical aim of this detailed case study is to interrogate the means by which the State (represented by the Parliament and the state and federal bureaucracies, with the cooperation of the media) was able to secure the willing participation of an overwhelming majority of the population. The elements of this study are drawn principally from government archives, the vast media coverage of the day, extensive oral history interviews with participants, and academic literature in the areas of Australian history (with particular reference to the nineteen-fifties), popular royalism, popular culture, public memory, civic ritual and spectacle. It was my final objective that these elements and aims might be synthesised into an enjoyable, 'popular' account of this chaotic, surprising and memorable event.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Visits of State</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Royal Visitors</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/249</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Eye of The Storm. An Integral perspective on  Sustainable Development and Climate Change Response</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">In this thesis, I explore the implications of integral theory for sustainable development and climate change response. Integral theory seeks to integrate objective and subjective perspectives using a developmental orientation. It addresses issues of subjectivity that have received inadequate attention in mainstream approaches to sustainable development, while also providing theoretical grounding for the developmental aspect of sustainable development. According to integral theory, there are four main epistemological approaches to any problem: behavioural, systemic, psychological and cultural. The first is objective and individual, the second objective and collective, the third subjective and individual and the fourth subjective and collective. Development occurs within each of these realms. To test the value and implications of integral theory for sustainable development, I adopt a case study on climate change response in Australia. I begin the case study by using the four perspectives of integral theory to guide a review of the energy and climate change literature. I follow the literature review with a critical review of Australian energy and greenhouse policy, providing the starting point for development of an integral climate change response. While there is attention to subjectivity in the literature, it is not reflected in Australian policy practices. An objective perspective and an instrumental form of rationality dominate policy. In the literature review, I identify two gaps in the literature that deserve attention. The first is the role of public subsidies in creating the observed cost differential between renewable energy sources and fossil fuel energy. I examine the relative magnitude of subsidies to fossil fuels and renewable energy in the Australian energy and transport sectors and conclude that the distribution of these subsidies distorts the market in favour of fossil fuels, particularly in the transport sector. The second is the application of a developmental perspective to cultural theories of climate policy discourse. I introduce a method called meta-discourse analysis to identify consistencies and relationships across discourse descriptions by different authors and demonstrate that aspects of each discourse can be related developmentally.  Drawing on the literature review, policy review and other work, I propose an integral policy response to climate change that could be applied in Australia. The policy response combines participatory integrated assessment, normative futures work, a modified version of the cooperative discourse model for public participation, an evolutionary policy orientation and several methods to promote subjective development. The proposed policy approach should be equally applicable to other sustainable development issues.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sustainable Development</field><field name="subject">Climate Response Change</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/250</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Aristotelian Construction of the Social Economy of Land</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">Aristotle's metaphor for economic relations was the household. Although the household is engaged in the material activities of internal production, consumption and exchange which are economic, its fundamental connections are social. Social dynamics, including care, respect, authority, loyalty, charity and self-restraint are the motivations within the household. These are all virtues in Aristotelian terms and can be grouped under the more general social virtue of solidarity which is the intention to act in support and draw closer to the other in relationship in such a way as to become more perfectly human. An economics based on this family metaphor will be socially grounded, it is social economics. A key identifier of social economics is its capacity to realise the common good. This thesis is an examination of the contribution of property in land to the common good leading to the identification of the location of land within social economics.  An Aristotelian methodology has been adopted for this thesis, following an examination of its component parts and comparison with alternative methodologies. While the defense of the methodology is not exhaustive, it is sufficient to provide reasonable justification of Aristotelian realism and point out some of the shortcomings of competing approaches. Aristotelian realism is accepted as employing an acceptance of essences, the validity of abstraction, and the importance of observation. Contrasted to positivism, Aristotelian realism accepts knowledge that is not simply observation-based, especially the possibility of the knowledge of essences.   Property theory has been reviewed. This includes ancient positions on property as well as modern. Islamic property theory has been included in the review in order to broaden the cultural base. Ancient  Western property theories have been been shown to be divided between simple acceptance of the fact of private ownership, especially evident in Roman law and early modern practice, and a more complex theory of ownership first articulated by Aristotle. Aristotle's theory of ownership was a dual principle of private ownership but common use. The Aristotelian position was developed by St. Thomas Aquinas in the Medieval period. St. Thomas recognised that property in external property was naturally for common use but privately owned by convention. John Locke attempted a labour based theory of absolute private property and Adam Smith returned to the positive fact of possession. The Islamic position straddled the Lockean and Thomistic. Modern property theory is a development of the Smithian identification property as a fact of society.  Apart from the institution of individual private property in land, several other economic institutions mark modern Western economics. The most important of these is the free market. The theoretical foundations of the free market have been examined and have been found to be based on moral foundations. The components of market theory have been reviewed and significant shortcomings have been revealed. The theory of supply has been found to contradict practice and the commonly portrayed market functions that are asserted to depict market behaviour in efficient circumstances have been shown be in error. Capitalisation has also been reviewed and its dependence on the risk-free real rate of return on money loans has been explored. The moral problem of usury has been introduced and linked to capitalisation, but not taken beyond recognition and defense of the fact that it is a social artifact rather than a product of economic forces.  The critical factor in the operation of the market was shown to be its inclusion of demand in the development of prices. In the absence of theoretical support, the acceptability of the market was tested empirically by surveying attitudes to demand based pricing. Three hundred and forty Sydney home-owners were asked ten questions regarding situations where prices and profits were linked to demand or price. The data was analysed and found to lend support to the hypothesis that demand-based pricing did not have community support. A general theory of property was constructed from human nature and the nature of land. It was then used to develop an ethical structure for the pricing of wages, land and products. It was argued that property rights in labour were fundamentally different to property rights in land, the former being natural and the latter being conventional. It was also evident that the market was an inappropriate instrument for the determination of wages, but appropriate for the determination of commodity prices. Land was recognised to be the gap between wage price and commodity price.  Ricardo's rent theory was reviewed as a mechanism for pricing land income. Various aspects and implications were considered and it was recognised that in a closed land market the returns to land competed with the return to labour in a manner that was better explained in political terms than economic. Despite its importance in social economy, the operation of Ricardian rent theory is obscured other mediating factors. It has also been used as the central theory in a protracted political debate over the taxation of land. Both of these issues have contributed to the the marginalisation of interest in rent theory and a degree of suspicion as to its validity.  A behavioural experiment was run to examine the validity of Ricardian rent theory within the confines of its own assumptions, which are basically those of an efficient market and the recognition that land has varying productivity. The results of the experiment lent strong support to the theory but highlighted the conventional nature of the return to labour. One of the shortcomings of Ricardian rent theory is its assertions regarding subsistence wages, and there was evidence in the experiment that did not support this aspect of the theory. The significance and construction of subsistence wages were specifically reviewed and also other sources of economic rents. An analysis of non-land economic rents revealed that they were either land-like, transient or politically maintained. A theory of supply was developed from a rent base that was argued to be causally accurate and returned a monotonic upward curve consistent with practical observation.  The implications of the political economy of the findings were reviewed. Some major traditions in economics interpreted in terms of the ethical issues revealed. The thesis concluded that many cultural resolutions of the property problem are possible, however they must conform to ethical fundamentals that may be paraphrased in the notion of solidarity. Suggestions for possible corrections or improvements to specific existing practices and policies were developed.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Economics</field><field name="subject">History</field><field name="subject">Land Use</field><field name="subject">Social Aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/251</field></doc><doc><field name="title">History of the Sydney Film Festival 1954-1983</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This study is intended to provide a record of the founding and development of one of Australia's oldest and longest surviving film festivals and to determine the nature and impact of the Festival in its engagement with other cultural, social, and political institutions over the thirty years from 1954 to 1983. I have taken my research from a variety of sources, primarily the archive of Sydney Film Festival papers and ephemera lodged at Mitchell Library, Sydney. I have utilized a number of publications from the period, including daily newspapers, trade papers and specialist film and art journals. These give some indication of the Festival's influence and impact within the wider community and help position it in terms of predominant cultural and social values. I conclude that the Sydney Film Festival has played a significant, and so far somewhat underestimated, role in the development of Australian film culture and industry, and has influenced the nature and reception of films in commercial distribution within the country. In a pedagogical sense, it has influenced contemporary understanding of film and film history, in part by privileging particular movements and filmmakers over others and in part by creating a communal and interactive environment in which films, filmmaking and other aspects of film culture can be discussed, analysed and celebrated. This is a history of an organisation whose membership included some of the major figures in Australian film and related media and I have been committed to bringing a human element to the events and issues explored. To this end, I have utilized the extensive Oral History archive created in 1992 by the Sydney Film Festival in order to commemorate its fortieth anniversary. As is often the case with historical research, some of these personal memories are in conflict with one another and with the documentary record. By a process of referencing and cross referencing, I hope I have arrived at an approximation of a truth about a moment in the life of an Australian cultural icon.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">History</field><field name="subject">Sydney Film Festival</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/252</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Policies and Discourses of Vocational Education and Training : and their impact on the formation of teachers' identities.</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">Education and training, in Australia, has experienced unprecedented levels of change in recent times. Government educational policies are now dominated by economic discourses that point to the need for all educational systems to contribute to economic development, by increasing the knowledge and skill levels of the present and future workforce. The twin discourses of new vocationalism and economic rationalism have now transformed Australian educational systems. But the effects of this transformation on the identities of teachers working in this changed environment have not been adequately examined. This study examines the impact of government policies on teachers' identities by investigating a particular group of teachers working in Technical and Further Education (TAFE) in Australia. The study has chosen teacher identity as its focus, because much of recent research has involved investigating the new knowledge and skills required of teachers working in this changed environment. However, this can be seen as making an overly instrumental means-ends connection between teachers' knowledge and skills and the professional practice of teaching. It fails to appreciate that when teachers are asked to 'do things differently' in their everyday teaching practices they are also being called on to become different teachers. That is, to have different understandings of their role in education, to have different relationships with students, to conceptualise their professional and vocational knowledge differently. In short, to change their identity. In order to investigate the impact of the policies and discourses of VET on TAFE teachers' identities the study locates itself, in part, within the interpretivist tradition of social research and uses the methods and methodologies of critical policy analysis, phenomenology and ethnography to investigate the research questions. It then uses a number of diverse theoretical perspectives to challenge and interrogate the interpretation made of the data gathered. The study undertakes a critical analysis of contemporary VET policies utilising a 'policy -as-discourse' approach to the analysis and draws on the methods of phenomenology and ethnography in order to generate situated discourses that are often overlooked in critical policy analysis. The study also uses the perspective offered by poststructuralism, which foregrounds the power of discourse in the formation of both the social world and individual identity. The conclusions reached suggest that TAFE teacher identity is an ambiguous discursive achievement constructed out of the multiple, historical organisational and individual discourses that all circulate in teachers' life worlds. These discourses now interact in complex and contradictory ways with the contemporary policies and discourses of vocational education and training resulting in teachers experiencing a degree of doubt and uncertainty concerning their identification with the new institution of TAFE.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Vocational education</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Teachers.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/253</field></doc><doc><field name="title">School-Museum Integrated Learning Experiences in Science: A learning journey</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">The focus of this dissertation is my investigation into how primary school teachers can be guided to provide effective conditions for student learning on teacher-led school excursions to museums.  The dissertation follows my learning journey, beginning with my entering experiences as a teacher, museum educator and teacher educator and then following stages of literature search, questions, action and reflection.  The research design has affinity with action research and utilises an assemblage of methodologies which are empathetic with the study itself, principally observations and interviews.  My thesis is that a framework based on strategies which reflect informal learning behaviours of family groups, learner-centred teaching approaches, and meaningful integration of school and museum studies, can create favourable conditions for student learning on excursions.  Further, with minimal professional development, classroom teachers can implement such a framework.  The first of three field studies tested my understandings about current practices on teacher-led school excursions to museums.  Observations of 12 school excursions in Sydney, Australia, revealed a strong teacher orientation toward task completion rather than learning, and underlined the need to search for an alternative approach.  Following a literature search on school visits to museums, social constructivist learning and teaching, and family visits, a School-Museum Learning Framework (SMLF) was designed. The SMLF was trialed in the second field study in which I was the principal teacher as well as researcher, working with a Year 5/6 class.  The most significant finding was the students' recognition and declaration of their own learning in an environment in which they had choice and ownership of their learning.  Consideration of the nature and measurement of learning in informal settings led to a tentative tool for indicating engagement in learning processes. In my third field study I investigated the broader application of the SMLF in four trials involving seven teachers.  The teachers participated in a one-day professional development seminar and then conducted their own school-museum programs.  The results showed the SMLF to be robust under a range of circumstances.  My findings from the trials led to a refined flexible framework: School-Museum Integrated Learning Experiences in Science, which is based on three Guiding Principles: integration of school and museum learning; provision of conditions for self-directed learning and facilitation of learning strategies appropriate to the setting.  The findings from this research have significance for students, teachers, teacher educators and museum educators.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Museums and schools</field><field name="subject">Science museums</field><field name="subject">Museums educational aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/254</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Communication in Effective and Ineffective Teams: A Longitudinal study investigating Team Members' Task and Socio-Emotional Verbal Behaviors</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This study aims to contribute to a better understanding of communication differences in effective and ineffective teams. It investigates task and socio-emotional verbal behaviours over time and its relationship to team effectiveness and team members' self-perceived member viability. The author used an aural observational method to examine verbal communication of three teams. Participants were post-graduate students formed into teams, working on a complex and dynamic task over a project duration of five days in a classroom setting. Spoken interaction was audio recorded and analysed using Bales' (1950) Interaction Process Analysis (IPA). Three questionnaires were developed, mainly by combining existing measurement instruments from communication and small group research, measuring team effectiveness and member viability.  The analysis of selected team meetings with IPA displayed interesting task and socio&#172;emotional communication differences in effective and ineffective teams. These differences were more visible in socio-emotional interaction than in task-related interaction. Observed interaction patterns changed over time, although communication behaviours were more stable in the effective teams. Findings indicate that a consistently high level of positive socio-emotional communication in combination with a consistently low level of negative socio-emotional interaction seem to facilitate team effectiveness, while a high level of negative socio-emotional interaction or constantly changing socio-emotional behaviour seems to inhibit team effectiveness. It seems to suggest that communication behaviours impact upon team effectiveness and member viability. When communication behaviours could be described as task focused with a consistent level of positive reactions, outweighing negative reactions, effectiveness and member viability can increase. Opposite behaviours, shifting from task to interpersonal issues in combination with negative reactions outweighing positive reactions can lead to low levels of perceived member viability and a lack of effectiveness. The results lead to the suggestion that communication behaviours and member viability, particularly cohesion and willingness to continue as a member of this team, seem to be indicators for a team's 'well-being' and impact upon its effectiveness. These factors seem to be especially visible at the beginning and the temporal midpoint of a project. During these two periods, monitoring of the team process is recommended, either self-managed or with support from outside the team in order to prevent communication problems impacting on team effectiveness.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Teams.</field><field name="subject">Workplace.</field><field name="subject">Groups.</field><field name="subject">Communication</field><field name="subject">Team members.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/255</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Midwifery in New Zealand 1990-2003: the complexities of service provision.</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This Professional Doctorate in Midwifery explores the development of maternity services in New Zealand subsequent to legislative changes in 1990 enabling midwives to provide the same services as doctors and access the same funding for the provision of care for childbearing women. The papers in this portfolio describe and analyse challenges faced by New Zealand midwives in achieving their full potential as autonomous health professionals and the strategies they developed to survive within a healthcare environment that despite changes, remained medicalised. Throughout this portfolio, a theoretical framework based on complexity theory provides a lens for critique of the varying challenges to midwifery development and strategies to progress the profession. The seven papers that make up this portfolio were developed and written over a five-year period from 1999 to 2003. During this time I was involved in various activities supporting midwifery in New Zealand, including the establishment of a postgraduate midwifery programme and participation in the refocusing of both the New Zealand College of Midwives and the Midwifery and Maternity Provider Organisation. These activities took me to various parts of the country, enabling me to maintain contact with midwives from a variety of settings. The first paper sets the scene for the portfolio by exploring the socio-political context of contemporary midwifery in New Zealand. The second paper tracks the emergence of a theoretical framework out of Complexity theory and presents a set of principles, which guide the critique of midwifery services and professional development, explored in the subsequent papers. Part Three documents the development of a contextual scanning tool, used to analyse the organisation of maternity care by midwives in rural settings. Part Four presents the findings of the scan and strategies for consolidating the role of midwives as key providers of maternity services in rural localities. Part Five documents the development of a programme for optimising midwifery leadership within the health sector, while Part Six explores the risks and opportunities for midwives with the development of clinical governance strategies by District Health Boards. Part seven focuses on strategies to increase the potential for midwives to consolidate, maintain and further develop community-based maternity services throughout the country. This portfolio provides an organisational analysis of contemporary maternity services in New Zealand and presents a multifaceted approach to securing midwifery as a key health profession and midwives as the main provider of maternity services to women in this country. The findings of this collection of works, identified midwifery in New Zealand as precariously positioned within a rapidly changing health service environment. While appearing most vulnerable, midwifery within the rural and primary settings appeared to offer the most potential for innovative development in order to secure the place of midwives as the prime providers of health care for women in childbirth.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Midwives</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">History</field><field name="subject">20th Century</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/256</field></doc><doc><field name="title">LEDs and Doped Polymer Light Guides for Efficient Illumination and Colour Engineering</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This project involves the study of optical properties of polymers doped with TRIMM (transparent refractive index matched micro-particles), and their uses in light guides. The refractive index difference between dopant and host material is small (0.02), so forward transmittance is high, and losses due to backscattering are negligible. Flexible polymer optical fibre (POF) and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) rods are being incorporated into an increasing range of lighting and light mixing applications. For energy efficient mixing of red, green and blue (RGB) light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to produce white light and a range of other colours, light is transmitted from the end of a light guide ('endlight').  A major problem here is solved, namely the achievement of uniform illumination, simultaneously with low losses from scattering. Light output from RGB LEDs is shown to be completely mixed by short TRIMM-doped light guides. Alternatively, long lengths of TRIMM-doped POF can be used for 'side-light'. The concentration of TRIMM for these is chosen such that light is emitted from the side walls of the guide to give even illumination along its length.  A geometrical method of ray tracing in particle-doped rectangular and cylindrical light guides is derived, and Monte Carlo ray tracing simulations performed for undoped and TRIMM-doped light guides. The evolution of the distribution of ray angles, internal and external to a light guide, with propagation distance are studied. Computer simulations of angular distribution of light emitted from the wall of POF agree with measurements performed using a photogoniometer.  Simulations and measurements of light output intensity and colour from RGB LED arrays when projected from the end of a mixing rod, are also presented. Colour calculations agree with photometric measurements of RGB LED output from clear and TRIMM-doped PMMA mixing rods. Results of transmittance measurements and computer simulations show that light losses are almost entirely due to Fresnel reflectance from the entrance and exit surfaces of the rods. Photogoniometer measurements of the angular distribution of light from LEDs are used as a basis for LED source models used in ray tracing simulations. Results of an investigation comparing the effect of using a smoothed LED source model instead of measurement-based models on simulated light output distributions are presented. The light output from LEDs can have sudden peaks in intensity at certain angles, resulting in distinctive patterns with clear colour separation, after mixing in clear polymer mixing rods. These caustic patterns are eliminated by using TRIMM-doped mixing rods, with a transmittance of 90% after Fresnel losses, which can be readily reduced.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Optical Properties</field><field name="subject">Light Emitting Diodes</field><field name="subject">Polymers</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/257</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Working with Women in Childbirth.</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">The selected publications presented here are concerned with the development of practice and knowledge in midwifery. The thesis underlying the publications is that the development of a positive personal relationship between women and their midwives is fundamental to effective and sensitive midwifery care. The methodology used is essentially different to the thesis written prospectively. This is because the publications presented arise from years of work informed by 'hands on' practice, development of policy, leading change and development, supported by research and communicated and disseminated through writing. The work presented therefore could be viewed as a long research project, with these activities forming an iterative process in thinking through and writing for publication, as well as continuing practice development and research. The extended essay serves to introduce the publications and show how they are linked through common themes developed over time. It also demonstrates the originality, importance and contribution of the publications. The publications presented may be viewed conceptually in a number of different ways however these are all related to the relationship between women and their midwives. The essay is presented in sections. The first is the Introduction to key concepts and theories. The second is The Midwife with Woman Relationship. This introduces publications that describe the nature and purpose of the relationship. The third section, Changing Practice: the New Midwifery is concerned with what the midwife does in the context of that relationship. Publications introduced in this section propose ways of working in the best interests of women and their families. The fourth section, Influencing Policy Nationally and internationally, is concerned with the creation of national policy that has supported the development of what I have called the New Midwifery. The fifth section, Transformative Change and Rediscovering Midwifery is concerned with developing the organisation and culture of care, that is its context, to enable midwives to work in the best interests of women and their families. The sixth section Developing Patterns of Practice that Enable Personal Relationships Between Women and Midwives: One-to-One Midwifery introduces publications concerned with the development and evaluation of new structures that facilitate continuity of care and thereby relationship.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Midwifery.</field><field name="subject">Social aspects.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/258</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Disabling Journeys: the social relations of tourism for people with impairments in Australia - an analysis of government tourism authorities and accommodation sector practice and discourses</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This thesis explores the citizenship rights of people with disabilities and their experience in relation to one activity and industry - tourism. It is proposed that people with disabilities living in Australia have been excluded, oppressed and disadvantaged by government, tourism authorities (TA) and tourism industry (TI), practice and discourses. This exclusion, oppression and disadvantage has been perpetrated by the government, tourism authorities and tourism industry, whose practices and discourses do not provide an equality of service provision for the group. From this position the central question addressed is:  To what extent are the tourism patterns and experiences of people with impairments in Australia unduly constrained by tourism authorities and tourism industry practice and discourse?  In taking direction from the social model of disability (Oliver 1990), the proposition deliberately uses the word impairments rather than disabilities as both a definitional and conceptual approach to the research. This is because the question tests whether the social relations produce the constraints that people with impairments face in negotiating tourism experiences and, hence, create disabling journeys. In other words, the disabling social relations transform the impaired person to the person with a disability in the tourism context. 'Unduly' means that people with disabilities were not provided with an equality of service provision in comparison to the non-disabled.  The research design and methodology involves inductive inquiry utilising both quantitative and qualitative methodologies. This includes a multiple methodological approach involving secondary data analysis of major national and regional surveys, content/discourse analysis, in-depth interviews and a focus group. The secondary data sources involved the Disability, Ageing and Carers Survey (ABS 1993; 1998 n=42,000), National Visitors Survey (BTR 1998 n=78,000) and Anxiety to Access (Tourism NSW 1998 n=2647). A content analysis is undertaken of the HREOC (2002) complaint cases, public hearings, public inquiries, disability action plans and disability Standards projects relevant to tourism. A content analysis is also undertaken of tourism authorities' disability tourism initiatives from 1990-2000. In depth interviews are undertaken with three separate populations that include people with disabilities (n=15), accommodation managers (n=10) and responsible officers from tourism authorities (n=3). A focus group of accommodation managers (n=23) is also undertaken. The data are analysed and interpreted using binary logistic regression, ordinal logistic regression, phenomenology, grounded theory and discourse analysis.  The central argument to emerge from this thesis is that disability is a social relationship - or rather a complex set of social relationships - between people with disabilities, and the organisations that control and administer the institutional and social environments in which they live. Tourism represents an important arena for social and cultural participation. Given the commitment by governments to 'reduce disability' it is thus critical to consider whether the relationships in the area of tourism are disabling or enabling. The thesis shows that the practices and discourses of tourism authorities and the tourism industry unduly constrain the tourism opportunities and experiences of people with impairments in Australia and create disabling journeys.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">People with disabilities.</field><field name="subject">Government policy.</field><field name="subject">Tourism.</field><field name="subject">Discrimination.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/260</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of imagination in autobiography and transformative learning</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">By telling and retelling their life stories in everyday social interaction, adult learners describe times of continuity and change in their lives, and give an account of their self-formation. A disjuncture between the learners' life stories and events experienced either in their social context or in their inner life invites their reflection on its significance. Transformative learning occurs when reflection on such experience leads to interpretations which change the learners' meaning perspectives and their social practice. These changes are incorporated into a new version of the life story. Adult education approaches to perspective transformation have generally emphasised the interpretive role of critical reflection and thinking. Autobiography, as a metaphor for transformative learning, proposes that transformative learning also has the quality of a narrative constructed with imagination. Through ongoing interpretation of events in their inner and outer experience, learners compose their lives and their life stories. The social context is a dynamic setting for autobiographical learning. Its structures and institutions concretise the learners' social and cultural tradition, which has been shaped by design and historical circumstance. Through the prejudgments of their tradition, learners perceive reality and construct corresponding lives and life stories. Theoretical approaches to interpreting life experience differ in their estimation of the value of the learners' tradition. In adult education theory and practice, Habermas' critical theory has been enlisted as a conceptual basis for perspective transformation. Little attention has been afforded to either Gadamer's hermeneutic consciousness, or Ricoeur's critical hermeneutics as ways to understand the interpretive activity which leads to the learners' self-formation and the re-invention of their life story. Six former Roman Catholic priests participated in a cooperative inquiry, telling their life stories of remarkable change in life choice. They sought deeper self-knowledge, as well as an understanding of the widespread social phenomenon of Catholic priests choosing to marry. Their autobiographical accounts indicate that, as they gradually composed new life narratives, these learners gained personal authority as the authors of their lives. The stories also indicate that, at one time or other, a state of stagnation developed in the authors' lives. Despite the learners' lengthy periods of consciously attempting to resolve the stalemate, it was an act of spontaneous imagination which illuminated a way through. The explanatory understanding of autobiographical or transformative learning proposed here claims that imagination, which bridges the domains of conscious and unconscious knowing in the author, is a partner with critical reflection in interpreting the life in its social context. Through transformative or hermeneutic conversation, adult educators may foster and promote the formation of autobiography and transformative learning. Further research, linking autobiography and transformative learning, would purposefully explore the role of other internal processes in transformative learning, such as feeling, and examine their relationship with imagination. It is likely that the acknowledgment of imagination as integral to transformative learning would lead to research which considers models of personhood other than those which emphasise ego as the conscious director of knowing and learning.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Autobiographical memory</field><field name="subject">Imagination</field><field name="subject">Adult learning</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/261</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Combining Educational Aspects with New Technology: Teaching Basic Statistics Using Hypermedia</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">The increasing popularity and rapid development of the Internet and specifically the World-Wide Web in recent years has led to an exponential growth of users around the world in many different application areas. Following this growing trend, many eager educators have also embraced this new technology and have begun to use it as a tool in delivering education. A plethora of applications has already been developed in an attempt to implement educational content in this way. A general concern for many researchers is that most of these applications are not efficient in delivering educational outcomes and fail to achieve their educational goal. In the present project we propose that the present failure to deliver educational outcomes in an efficient way has its origins in the lack of concern and focus of developers on modern learning theory. Therefore, in this work we establish the foundations in terms of an interdisciplinary contribution from areas such as, educational learning theory, human-computer interaction and web design guidelines for the design and implementation of web pages aimed at facilitating the teaching and tutoring of basic statistics concepts. As a result of this work, a specific set of learning theories were researched and analyzed, the basic ideas of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) were explored and a set of appropriate principles from HCI were chosen. Furthermore, a selected group of Web design guidelines were researched, studied and selected to ensure that the final product contributes to the efficient delivery of subject content and effective achievement of learning outcomes. In addition, a number of parallels were formulated and discussed between the different areas of research. The establishment of a series of combined principles will not only contribute to the aims of the present project but also to further projects initiated by the Department of Econometrics at The University Sydney.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Statistics</field><field name="subject">Computer-assisted instruction</field><field name="subject">Interactive multimedia</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/262</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Theoretical Aspects Of The Continuously Varying Schedule Process For Timber Drying</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">Drying of timber increases its durability and strength. Therefore, timber should be dried to a moisture content close to the equilibrium moisture content it will attain in service. The drying of timber from its natural green state to the required moisture content is thus an important part of the production cycle. Hardwood species, due to their macroscopic structures, are more difficult to dry as compared to softwood.  A great deal of research has centred in recent years on developing a fast drying process for softwood; on the other hand, there is a need for a process to dry hardwood rapidly. A new drying technique, called Continuously Varying Schedule (CVS) was recently developed by the author for the purpose of rapidly drying the medium to high density hardwood.  The investigation described herein was carried out to compare the CVS process with the conventional drying process. The factors compared were drying time, quality of timber produced and the energy consumed.  It was found that the CVS process reduced the drying time by 34.5% and saved 30.7% of the energy. It produced also, a competitive dried timber quality. The process achieved highly efficient drying, as the rate of drying (MC%/h x 100) was 80.3% higher than the conventional process and also, the amount of water evaporated per unit of drying time (g/h) was 67.1% higher. The CVS drying performance has achieved a 71.9% increase in the amount of moisture content reduced per unit of energy (MC%/kWh x 100) and a 57.8% increase in the amount of water evaporated per unit of energy (g/kWh) as compared to the conventional process.  Much emphasis was placed on energy saving in the drying plant and it was suggested that a heat exchanger be used to recover waste energy from the exhausted air of the kiln. A dehumidifier coupled to a solar-powered system, backed up with an electric or wood waste booster, was recommended as a low-cost energy drying plant. An alternative source to the petroleum-based energy was also discussed.  The study of air flow through the timber stack in the kiln was a major part of this investigation as it is one of the principal features of the CVS process. A new technique was developed to measure the air velocity and the turbulence level %. The technique involves the integration of a hot wire anemometer, data logger, computer and computer peripherals. The air velocity profiles for twelve fan speeds, between 400 and 2200 rpm, were drawn by a computer graphical program, using data collected by the above circuit. It was obvious that the boundary layer which exists around the timber surface at the low air velocity protects the timber being processed against the high and continuously increasing temperature during the CVS drying process.</field><field name="date">1984</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Timber</field><field name="subject">Lumber</field><field name="subject">Drying</field><field name="subject">Forest Products Industry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Epiphanies: An Existential Philosophical and Psychological Enquiry</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">The purpose of this inquiry is to investigate the relatively under-researched and under- developed nature of positive change and transformation that is sudden and abrupt, as defined by the term epiphany. A review of the literature across the disciplines of sociology, literary studies, education and psychology pertaining to epiphanies revealed a modest and disparate body of knowledge. As yet only two studies to date have developed and tested a conceptual framework describing and explaining epiphanies, both situated in the theoretical perspectives of developmental, clinical, cognitive and behavioural psychology. Due to the sparseness of the epiphanic literature, a thorough review was undertaken, producing a set of six core characteristics, which were tested and interpreted from a self-identity existential perspective. Existential philosophy and psychology provide an understanding of human experiences based on personal meaning and the essential realities of the human condition. In order to encapsulate an existential theory of knowledge, a narrative approach to methodology was employed to collect, analyse and interpret participants' epiphanies, from which three main conclusions were drawn. Firstly, an epiphany is a profound illumination of the inauthentic and authentic modes of self-identity, which provide the impetus for a more honest and courageous encounter with the conditions of existence. Secondly, the participants' life-stories illustrate that an epiphany is a valid experience as indicated by support for the set of six core characteristics developed from the literature. Lastly, an epiphany is an intentional experience made significant and enduring by the ascription of personal meaning.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">epiphanies</field><field name="subject">change</field><field name="subject">psychology</field><field name="subject">existential</field><field name="subject">philosophical</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/264</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rhetoric and Reality: Narrowing the Gap in Australian Midwifery</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This study draws on multiple modes of expression in texts that have been generated by my experience of midwifery development since I moved from England to Australia in early 1997. The Professional Doctorate in Midwifery at the University of Technology, Sydney (UTS) has enabled me to produce and study my work as a midwifery practitioner, researcher, educator, writer and activist and to engage in a process of scholarship that both informs and is generated by practice. This has allowed me to analyse the complex issues that I, and other midwives in Australia, face as we strategise to narrow the gap between our ideals and the realities of the professional and political constraints that challenge midwifery. The study analyses the rhetorical communications I have employed as both carriers of 'vision' and 'means of persuasion' and the deliberate strategies to make changes that I believe will benefit childbearing women.   My portfolio challenges me and others, to explore how we are able to identify, enact, and convince others of the emancipatory potential of midwifery.  Rhetorical innovations are therefore linked to the exposition of woman centred midwifery care; an overall goal being to enable situations in which women can experience the potential power that transforms lives, through their experiences of childbirth. In the process, I aim to produce new knowledge that will equip midwives to understand practice, policy and political situations and see new possibilities for responding and taking action.  I have analysed and explained my work using a framework appropriated from rhetorical theory and drawing on a range of feminist perspectives. This involves identifying and critiquing the rhetorical innovations that I have used when trying to create possibilities and persuade others of the value of midwifery and the need to make changes happen in practice, education and regulation.  My study analyses the rhetorical nature of my own work as presented in my portfolio in a range of carefully selected texts that I have authored during my candidature. These include journal and newsletter articles, conference papers, research activities, policy submissions, education and training materials, the development of midwifery standards, formal and informal communications, and other documents, all aimed in one way or another at the rhetorical strategy of stimulating interest and action. The portfolio texts that arise from this work form the empirical data that is studied. However, in varying ways these texts elicit understandings about the rhetoric and reality of Australian midwifery and the deliberate strategies that are employed by midwives to make changes that will benefit childbearing women. They therefore stand in their own right as contributions to the thesis with their own discursive and epistemological intent. The reflexive process employed in this thesis highlights comparisons between what is being positioned as the potential of midwifery with what is also presented as the reality played out in contemporary Australian maternity service provision and in midwifery education and regulation. The thesis weaves its way around the portfolio documents, attempting to bring to life and discuss the culture in which rhetorical innovations and intentional strategies are aimed at narrowing the gap between 'rhetoric and reality'.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Midwifery</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Social Aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/265</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Impact of Village Midwives and Cadres in Improving the Nutritional Status of Pregnant Women in Selected Rural Villages in Two Districts, Banten Province Indonesia 2003: A Longitudinal Descriptive Study</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This study is a longitudinal descriptive study conducted in eight villages of Banten province, Indonesia. The research describes the nutritional status of two groups of pregnant village women and investigates the implementation and impact of an intervention to improve nutrition in pregnancy. The intervention aimed to improve the effectiveness of village midwives and cadres by improving the nutrition of pregnant women, particularly iron deficiency, through the use of a community development approach. The thesis identifies the importance of good nutrition during pregnancy and some of the factors, which influence it in the context of this study. It examines the health promotion programs for improving iron intake and nutrition in developing countries and specifically examines the programs that are used in Indonesia. A small decrease in the rate of anaemia appears to have occurred due to these programs, but the anaemia rate remains high. There has been little systematic examination of the cultural and social factors that may influence nutrition in pregnant women in Indonesia and few studies, which have measured the nutritional status of pregnant women. The goals of the study are to: *	Describe the social and cultural factors that influence nutrition, under nutrition and iron deficiency anaemia during pregnancy and to measure the nutritional status of rural women in Banten Province, Indonesia.  *	Improve the knowledge and skills of village midwives and cadres in using community development and effective communication to improve iron supplementation and nutrition. The conceptual framework for the study was derived from principles of health promotion, in particular the 'Proceed and Proceed' model (Green &amp; Kreuter 1991).  The study took place in eight villages in Banten province, Indonesia. Four of the villages received a community development intervention and four villages were used for comparison.  The study was undertaken in three stages: Stage 1 - Baseline Quantitative and Qualitative Data Collection; Stage 2 - Intervention; and Stage 3 - Follow Up Evaluation. The intervention was guided by the results of Stage 1 and consisted of a two-day workshop aimed to improve their knowledge, communication skills of the midwives and cadres and their ability to use a community development approach to improving nutrition in the villages. Qualitative and quantitative methods were used in the research at Stage 1 and Stage 3. Ethnographic methods of interview, observation, field notes and survey were used to collect information about the cultural and social factors that influence nutrition and nutritional practices during pregnancy. The knowledge and practices of midwives and cadres were also explored. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the data.  Forty pregnant women (20 from the intervention villages and 20 from the comparison villages) participated in the qualitative component of the research before the intervention (Stage 1). The follow up evaluation occurred 12 months later, and a different group of 35 pregnant women (20 from the intervention villages and 15 from the comparison villages) participated in the qualitative component of the research at Stage 3. The same eight midwives and 16 cadres participated in the qualitative research at Stage 1 and Stage 3. Quantitative data collected at Stage 1 and Stage 3 included socio demographic data, obstetric information and nutritional data (haemoglobin level, body mass index, and the weight gain of pregnant women).  Data was collected from 210 women before the intervention and 189 women after the intervention. Some changes in the practices of midwives and cadres were apparent after the intervention with midwives building better rapport, communicating more effectively and providing more information and support to pregnant women. Cadres also talked more about nutrition in community meetings. Changes in the behaviour and approach of village midwives and cadres' in relation to nutrition education resulted in improved nutritional behaviour of pregnant women to some extent, but poverty and culture restricted the ability of pregnant women to access better food. The intervention did not effect the overall nutritional status of the pregnant women. Because of time and logistical constraints, the intervention was not able to influence the community's health in the medium term in the intervention villages. The results of this study showed that the comparison villages sometimes had better results than the intervention villages.  A possible explanation is that the systematic evaluation of nutritional status may have increased the awareness and practice of the better-educated and more knowledgeable midwives who were located in the comparison villages. The comparison midwives had a better basic education in midwifery when compared to the intervention midwives. It appeared these better-educated workers responded positively to the research even without exposure to the intervention. The study showed that the position of the pregnant woman is low within the hierarchy of both the health care system and the power structures of the broader community. Husbands, mother-in-law, village midwives, cadres and village leaders all have more power to determine what pregnant women can and cannot eat and drink than women do themselves. However, some women tried to access better food after the intervention by subverting culture and the authority of husbands and mother-in-law and eating nutritious food in secret.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Midwifery</field><field name="subject">Indonesia</field><field name="subject">Java</field><field name="subject">Women</field><field name="subject">Nutrition</field><field name="subject">Pregnancy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/266</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Application of Anti-dumping and Countervailing Measures in Australia</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">The application of anti-dumping and countervailing measures has always been controversial, particularly, as they do not address the issue of the level of local value added in the production process.  Are these measures simply industry assistance measures under another guise, or are they to protect the 'fair trade' framework to further the opportunity for free trade?  All the indications are that these measures reflect the former option.  However, the global political climate as represented through the GATT and now the WTO Agreements is to tolerate the imposition of both anti-dumping and countervailing measures provided they are applied according to the provisions of the Agreements.  It is becoming increasingly more difficult for any nation state to abolish the right of their 'guest' industries to obtain anti-dumping or countervailing relief, given the economic power of multinational industries operating within their boundaries.  The practical issue is for each nation state to use these measures in a way which is of least detriment to their economy.  Gruen in 1986 reviewed the application of the then Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act 1975, and found that there needed to be a tightening-up of the injury test applied to anti-dumping cases.  It is recommended that Gruen's tougher injury standards be implemented forthwith.  He also recommended a continuing role for the Industry Commission as the appeal body for a review of the facts, and for there to be a continuing assessment of the effects of the measures imposed.  The government, however, created an Anti-Dumping Authority attached to the then Department of Industry Technology and Commerce (DITAC), whose member and officers came from that department.  The principal function of this body was to review the preliminary decisions of Customs, and to recommend the imposition of duties or acceptance of an undertaking to the Minister.  There was no provision for an independent review of facts.  One of the results of the increased complexity of the existing process and consequently the law, is a large increase in litigation before the Federal Court.  There is a need to simplify the administrative structure and the provisions of the domestic law.  The latter should be accomplished by the incorporation of the provisions of the WTO Agreements directly into domestic law.  The espoused policy objectives of the government have not been met.  The application of anti-dumping and countervailing measures favour import competing industries, and are against countries from which imports are growing.  Korea and China have been singled out, with these countries showing the highest incidence of import weighted of anti-dumping measures.  They also happen to be countries with which Australia has a trade surplus, a policy factor which is neglected by the administering authorities.  There is a need to redress this imbalance.  Predation identified by the government as a reason for taking anti-dumping action, has been shown not to be a reason for the application of anti-dumping duties in Australia.  As a small country, Australia should take advantage of the use of the WTO dispute settlement process in settling anti-dumping and countervailing disputes.  Consultations should commence at the earliest possible stage in inquiries, with the view to the settlement of the dispute by trade negotiation so that the outcome can be beneficial to both parties.  This may, for example, allow for the specialisation in production between the two Members.  WTO dispute settlement is seen as a positive approach to dispute settlement, whereas the use of the domestic courts tends to elevate the dispute between the parties.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade needs to take a leadership role in settling all anti-dumping and countervailing actions through the WTO dispute settlement process, with a view to a positive outcome for both Members.  Placing an anti-dumping import tax on intermediate products entering Australia is counter-productive, as it increases the cost of inputs to downstream users.  Temporary relief should be given by way of production subsidy, if the matter cannot be resolved through WTO trade consultations.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dumping (International trade) -- Law and legislation -- Australia.

I am primarily concerned with issues of agency in the processes which result in cultural change, and look at both historical and contemporary agents of change in order to determine who and what impacts cultural dynamism, and what implications this has for a newly independent country within a globalised world.  These issues are presented through the lenses of Identity, Power and Politics and Globalisation.   In this thesis, I posit that traditionally, Ovambo people have not been empowered in decisions regarding cultural change, which has resulted in a sense of cultural 'loss'.  This sense exists within the context of culture being seen as strongly associated with the past - past practices, activities, traditions and customs, as well as early development theory which insisted that such things were indicative of a backward and primitive society at odds with the principles of modernisation.  In order to progress, such practices were, with and without reticence, abandoned or changed.  Contemporary Ovamboland, however, represents a dynamic cultural m&#233;lange of traditional and modern life, which co-exist whilst negotiating issues such as the impact of HIV/AIDS and neo-liberal style of post-independence democracy.   Therefore, by investigating the cultural shortfall in traditional development theory, and using examples of different forms of cultural development, I suggest that when culture is seen as an important consideration of development, as well as supported as a field of development in its own right, cultural identity becomes clearer, and cultural futures are determined more democratically.  In order to demonstrate these ideas, I am drawing from a number of case studies in which I was professionally involved, as well as through interviews conducted in the field.  By presenting the differing agendas of international engagement in development work as well as different types of cultural development projects, I will highlight the complexities of development theory in practice, particularly when capital is involved, and how these relate to the wider issues of cultural preservation versus cultural change.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Social Change</field><field name="subject">Cultural Policy</field><field name="subject">Namibia.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/268</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Knowledge Management for SMEs with Particular Emphasis on the Tourism Industry</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">Knowledge Management has captured the attention of management and IT vendors are hastily bringing products to market.

Nowadays, the value of an organisation may be based on its intellectual capital and this is demonstrated by organisations being sold for many times its worth in terms of hard assets. The concept of being able to store and use the 'knowledge' that is generated inside an organisation has obvious appeal. However, the management of this 'knowledge' and the ability to use it for an advantage requires careful planning and an understanding of knowledge inside the organisation and its workers. This process requires a mix of organisational, cultural and technology understanding.  Current research and vendor interest is focussing on large organisations. However, Small to Medium size Enterprises (SMEs) also have an explicit need to manage their intellectual capital. Research interest in large organisations is strong, but SMEs cannot always use the findings that are targeted to large organisations and will probably be unable to afford the specific Knowledge Management tools offered by vendors.  Nevertheless, SMEs can use the knowledge in their organisations to gain an advantage. In particular, the tourism industry has a significant knowledge component and Knowledge Management could provide substantial benefits. Many Knowledge Management principles apply to organisations irrespective of their size. How these can be implemented within a SME is the subject of this thesis.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Knowledge management.</field><field name="subject">Small business management.</field><field name="subject">Tourism.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/269</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Construction of a Recombinant Immunotoxin</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">In recent years a number of therapeutically useful immunotoxins have been produced using recombinant gene technology. In general, this involves fusion of a toxin gene with sequence encoding a variety of clinically relevant proteins or peptides. Using these techniques a recombinant immunotoxin has been engineered by fusing the genes encoding an antibody fragment with the sequence of a small cytolytic peptide, melittin. The antibody fragment consists of the antigen binding site derived from a murine monoclonal antibody K- 1-21, which binds to human free kappa light chains and recognises a specific epitope (KMA) expressed on the surface of human myeloma and lymphoma cells. The toxic portion of the molecule is melittin, a 26 amino acid, membrane lytic peptide which is a major component of bee venom. Using PCR a single chain Fv (scFv) was constructed by linking VH and VL genes with an oligonucleotide encoding a flexible, hydrophilic peptide. The melittin gene was synthesised as an oligonucleotide and extended by PCR. Nucleotide sequence encoding a linker peptide was added to the 5' end and a primer encoding a FLAG peptide was used to extend the 3' end. This gene construct was then ligated into the recombinant expression vector, pPOW scFv, to create the fusion gene encoding the recombinant immunotoxin. The gene construct was expressed in the periplasm of E.coli (TOPP2) using the secretion signal pelB . Expression of the foreign protein was monitored by western blot using a monoclonal antibody which recognises the FLAG peptide encoded at the carboxy terminal region of the gene construct. Expression of the recombinant immunotoxin was optimised and the resulting protein was purified using anti-FLAG M2 affinity chromatography. Antigen binding activity was assessed by ELISA and flow cytometry using a human myeloma cell line, HMy2, which expresses the KMA antigen.Binding of the immunotoxin to a control human cell line, K562, which does not express KMA on the cell surface was also assessed. The results indicated that the recombinant immunotoxin retained antigen binding specificity and it was cytotoxic towards the target cell line (HMy2).</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">antibody-toxin conjugates -- theraputic use</field><field name="subject">antibody-toxin conjugates</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/270</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Resource Discovery and Fair Intelligent Admission Control over Scalable Internet</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">The Internet currently supports a best-effort connectivity service. There has been an increasing demand for the Internet to support Quality of Service (QoS) to satisfy stringent service requirements from many emerging networking applications and yet to utilize the network resources efficiently. However, it has been found that even with augmented QoS architecture, the Internet cannot achieve the desired QoS and furthermore, there are concerns about the scalability of any available QoS solutions. If the network is not provisioned adequately, the Internet is not capable to handle congestion condition. This is because the Internet is unaware of its internal network QoS states therefore it is not possible to provide QoS when the network state changes dynamically.  This thesis addresses the following question: Is it possible to deliver the applications with QoS in the Internet fairly and efficiently while keeping scalability?  In this dissertation we answer this question affirmatively by proposing an innovative service architecture: the Resource Discovery (RD) and Fair Intelligent Admission Control (FIAC) over scalable Internet. The main contributions of this dissertation are as follows: 1. To detect the network QoS state, we propose the Resource Discovery (RD) framework to provide network QoS state dynamically. The Resource Discovery (RD) adopts feedback loop mechanism to collect the network QoS state and reports to the Fair Intelligent Admission Control module, so that FIAC is capable to take resource control efficiently and fairly. 2. To facilitate network resource management and flow admission control, two scalable Fair Intelligent Admission Control architectures are designed and analyzed on two levels: per-class level and per-flow level. Per-class FIAC handles the aggregate admission control for certain pre-defined aggregate. Per-flow FIAC handles the flow admission control in terms of fairness within the class. 3. To further improve its scalability, the Edge-Aware Resource Discovery and Fair Intelligent Admission Control is proposed which does not need the core routers involvement.  We devise and analyze implementation of the proposed solutions and demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach. For the Resource Discovery, two closed-loop feedback solutions are designed and investigated. The first one is a core-aware solution which is based on the direct QoS state information. To further improve its scalability, the edge-aware solution is designed where only the edges (not core)are involved in the feedback QoS state estimation. For admission control, FIAC module bridges the gap between 'external' traffic requirements and the 'internal' network ability. By utilizing the QoS state information from RD, FIAC intelligently allocate resources via per-class admission control and per-flow fairness control.  We study the performance and robustness of RD-FIAC through extensive simulations. Our results show that RD can obtain the internal network QoS state and FIAC can adjust resource allocation efficiently and fairly.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Internet</field><field name="subject">Information retrieval</field><field name="subject">Computer networks</field><field name="subject">Scalability</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/271</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Qualities of Primary Art Teachers</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This study aimed to determine the qualities of beliefs and practices apparent in a group of accomplished primary art teachers to ascertain if these may be used to inform and improve design and practice in preservice primary art teacher education programs within Australia. The participants in this study were twenty-two accomplished primary art teachers who possessed a recognised ability to successfully teach primary visual arts and who included specialist and generalist primary art teachers.  Teachers were designated 'specialists' if they taught art across the school.  If they taught across disciplines within the primary curriculum and taught a single class they were referred to as 'generalist teachers.'  Primary school is the place in which Australian children aged four and twelve years old receive their education.  The accomplished art teachers met for four group discussion sessions termed 'critical friends groups.  These were facilitated by the researcher who then visited schools to observe the teachers in practice. Informal, reflective discussions involving the participants followed.  The teachers' conversations were transcribed and interpreted using a critical appreciative framework that used themes to highlight qualities of practice and beliefs.  These were presented as a collaged narrative including the voices of the accomplished teachers and my reflections as critic.  The analogy of quilting represented the piecing together of teachers' conversations to form blocks and the analysis of these blocks in larger patterns of analysis. This research was underpinned by the belief that teaching is an art, and that accomplished teachers are artists.  Models of criticism were applied to emphasise appreciation of the art teachers and their teaching. Observations, interpretation and presentation were viewed through the eyes of a critic who values the sensitivity and intuition of the creative mind. The results of the study indicated the importance of visual experiences and art appreciation in the formation of accomplished art teachers. These teachers valued individuality, creativity and ownership in children's art and respected the children as artists and visual communicators.    They defined art as a process, grounded in the human need to communicate and contended that this process is teachable and that preservice art education needs to be enhanced to more adequately train future generalist art teachers. The research raised challenges to shift the focus in preservice art teacher education from linear models of instruction to a conception characteristic of risk-taking and flexibility.  A stronger emphasis needs to be given to the place of art appreciation and significant visual encounters within preservice art education.  Similarly, resource and studio management require greater prominence. The accomplished art teachers stressed the need to improve the profile of art education; the need for networks to overcome the isolation characteristic of primary art teachers; and greater training for generalist teachers rather than the wider introduction of specialist art teachers in primary schools.  The art-based methodology of critical appreciation encouraged the development of an ethical and critical research community that enabled significant data to become apparent. The use of collaged narrative yielded a meaningful quilt that may be metaphorically moved and placed in a number of preservice art education contexts.  The critical appreciative method revealed that research could be conducted within a strong aesthetic paradigm.  The research indicated that accomplished primary art teachers possess considerable knowledge, skills and expertise that can be incorporated into preservice art education.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Art teachers.</field><field name="subject">Primary school teaching.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/272</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mentoring, women and the construction of academic identities</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">In this thesis I investigate the influence of mentoring on the formation of the identities of women academics in Australian universities. Many Australian and New Zealand universities have introduced some form of mentoring initiative for women academics over the last decade. The aim of these initiatives is usually expressed in terms of supporting women's career development in order to increase the representation of women in senior positions in universities. I take up Foucault's theory of governmentality together with feminist theories of subjectivity, to examine the ways in which mentoring contributes to 'producing' the women as academic subjects of the times. My analysis of the formation of the subjectivities of the women concerned is set in the context of a political economy of contemporary higher education accompanied by the changing nature of academic work. I argue that mentoring has found support in recent years because it responds to the concerns of 'the enterprise university' with improving performance while also being seen to respond to the problem of gender inequality. The thesis is based on interviews conducted with 17 women academics who have participated in a formal mentoring program or who have been mentored informally by a colleague in their universities, six of which are discussed in detail. I use a feminist interpretive framework to analyse the discourses through which the women and I construct their accounts at interview. I also highlight the parallels between the confessional aspects of feminist research interviewing and the confessional space of the mentoring relationship itself, particularly mentoring of women by women. On the basis of this analysis, I argue that mentoring has a number of productive effects, producing particular sorts of self-regulating subjects, together with new knowledges and discourses of work and of the self. In their engagement in mentoring, the women take up a project of self-review and self-regulation. This can be understood as a biographical project of the self. It is a project that is iterative and ongoing, as the women navigate the discourses of academic work, career, gender, mothering, sexuality, social class and ethnicity, amongst others. This process is frequently fragmented and contested as the women confront the contradictions within the combined positioning of themselves and their positioning by others. Rather than try to resolve the tensions and contradictions that characterise this process, these tensions might be better explored in terms of their productive potential for disrupting the gendered work order of universities.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Women</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">academia</field><field name="subject">identity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/273</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Making meaning through History: scaffolding students' conceptual understanding through dialogue</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This study aims to articulate a theory of teaching that accounts for both the cognitive development of the learner and the social context in which learning occurs. It contributes to discussions about a socially constructed theory of pedagogy that can inform classroom practice. It explores firstly the role of the teacher in supporting students' conceptual understanding and secondly the importance of dialogue as a means of apprenticing students into the discourse of a subject discipline. The sociocultural notion of 'scaffolding' and the way in which various 'scaffolding' strategies support students' learning are examined through the classroom data. This thesis also explores the classroom as a site of activity in which educational practice is enacted. The significance of language as a 'tool' for learning is central to this study, as is the notion of learning as a social process. Language is a mediating tool that enables a dialogic engagement that supports the development of thinking that is consistent with the goals of the teacher. Also investigated is the use of various semiotic modalities, in addition to language, to support the active co-construction of knowledge. The research is conducted in a Year 7 History class (the first year of high school) in an independent, secondary boys' high school using a case study approach. It uses observation in naturalistic settings, interviews and written documentation. A significant outcome of this research has been the identification of discourse strategies and other semiotic systems such as visual, gestural and actional cues, and examination of the ways in which they function in the discourse to support student learning in the local and immediate context. The importance of all aspects that constitute the context in which the students are learning is also affirmed in this study. Context is not merely a 'backdrop' or background to language, it is integral to the creation of meaning and field knowledge. Another major conclusion that can be drawn from this research is the distinction between scaffolding at a macro level, consisting of a planned, 'designed-in' approach to a unit of work in a subject discipline and the lessons that constitute it, and contingent scaffolding that operates at a micro level or 'at the point of need'. By applying a variety of linguistic tools drawing on Systemic Functional Linguistic theory, it has been possible to articulate the kinds of discourse and multimodal strategies that constitute the nature of scaffolding. A further finding in this research is the value of using detailed analysis of the data with different analytical tools to identify emerging patterns in the discourse and also to 'view' the same data through different 'lenses'. An additional finding is the significance of an Induction genre that provides foundational understandings about the study of History for apprentice historians. This is supported by two post-foundational lessons that form a Macrogenre. This macrogenre reinforces the application of focus questions that are fundamental to historical study and an approach to answering these questions that is consistent with the methodology of the subject. Another finding relates to the role the teacher adopts in the classroom. The classroom in this research is strongly teacher guided in terms of the development of content and ways of controlling the development of discourse. This research shows that this does not preclude the classroom from being dialogic. Even though there is a knowledge and status differential between the teacher as expert and the student as novice, the teacher provides opportunities for discussion and development of ideas about the topic. Finally, this study confirms the value of drawing on a broad range of theories to inform the research. These multiple perspectives draw from sociocultural approaches to a socially oriented theory of learning; Activity Theory, and the notion of language as a social semiotic. This range of perspectives allows for 'rich' descriptions from which to draw conclusions about effective teaching and learning practices.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Communication in teaching</field><field name="subject">Observation ( Educational method)</field><field name="subject">Educational Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/274</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Algorithms in the Study of Multiperfect and Odd Perfect Numbers</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">A long standing unanswered question in number theory concerns the existence (or not) of odd perfect numbers. Over time many properties of an odd perfect number have been established and refined. The initial goal of this research was to improve the lower bound on the number of distinct prime factors of an odd perfect number, if one exists, to at least 9. Previous approaches to this problem involved the analysis of a carefully chosen set of special cases with each then being eliminated by a contradiction. This thesis applies an algorithmic, factor chain approach to the problem. The implementation of such an approach as a computer program allows the speed, accuracy and flexibility of modern computer technology to not only assist but even direct the discovery process. In addition to considering odd perfect numbers, several related problems were investigated, concerned with (i) harmonic, (ii) even multiperfect and (iii) odd triperfect numbers. The aim in these cases was to demonstrate the correctness and versatility of the computer code and to fine tune its efficiency while seeking improved properties of these types of numbers. As a result of this work, significant improvements have been made to the understanding of harmonic numbers. The introduction of harmonic seeds, coupled with a straightforward procedure for generating most harmonic numbers below a chosen bound, expands the opportunities for further investigations of harmonic numbers and in particular allowed the determination of all harmonic numbers below 10 to the power 12 and a proof that there are no odd harmonic numbers below 10 to the power 15. When considering even multiperfect numbers, a search procedure was implemented to find the first 10-perfect number as well as several other new ones. As a fresh alternative to the factor chain search, a 0-1 linear programming model was constructed and used to show that all multiperfect numbers divisible by 2 to the power of a,  for a being less than or equal to 65, subject to a modest constraint, are known in the literature. Odd triperfect numbers (if they exist) have properties which are similar to, but simpler than, those for odd perfect numbers. An extended test on the possible prime factors of such a number was developed that, with minor differences, applies to both odd triperfect and odd perfect numbers. When applicable, this test allows an earlier determination of a contradiction within a factor chain and so reduces the effort required. It was also shown that an odd triperfect number must be greater than 10 to the power 128. While the goal of proving that an odd perfect number must have at least 9 distinct prime factors was not achieved, due to mainly practical limitations, the algorithmic approach was able to show that for an odd perfect number with 8 distinct prime factors, (i) if it is exactly divisible by 3 to the power of 2a then a = 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 or a is greater than or equal to 31 (ii) if the special component is pi to the power of alpha, pi less than 10 to the 6 and pi to the (alpha+1) less than 10 to the 40, then alpha = 1.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Algorithms</field><field name="subject">Perfect numbers</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/275</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Battered Body : A Feminist Legal History</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This thesis investigates a current debate within feminist theory, and specifically within feminist legal theory, about how to challenge the liberal construction of women's subjectivity. It contends that positioning women as either equal to or different from the universalised liberal subject (based on male experience) fails to recognise women's experience as diverse, and differentiated. This thesis explores this issue through the empirical area of the treatment in the public sphere (constituted by the state and the law) of domestic violence, and of domestic violence survivors who kill their abusive spouses. It argues that the current feminist jurisprudential responses to the battered woman who kills, articulated through criticisms of the Battered Woman Syndrome, identify the need to challenge the binary oppositional framework in which these cases are decided and discussed by liberal legalism. However, it suggests that these responses do not ground their discussion in the historical preconditions which gave rise to the debate and the feminist framework in which that debate is conducted. This thesis argues that an historical re-examination of the ways in which women's experience of domestic violence, as well as the law's reading of it, was constructed is an important contribution to feminist legal theory. It undertakes this historical re-examination by situating the Battered Woman Syndrome and domestic violence within the struggles and campaigns of feminism in the past, especially feminism as it developed through the Women's Liberation Movement of the 1970s. It argues that the understanding of women and women's experience as diversely constituted through this period is essential for an understanding of current debates. This thesis represents an interdisciplinary feminist legal history. It uses both the method and evidence of history to challenge the legal understandings of battered women who kill. It posits that an interdisciplinary engagement between postmodern legal and historical theories, which contest objective assessments of subjects' experience, allows for a more complex and comprehensive assessment of how to approach, and critique, the Battered Woman Syndrome. It suggests that this can be accomplished by applying the techniques of narrative developed in historical theory to feminist legal theory. It therefore posits that a postmodern methodological approach, realised through a genealogical investigation of the subjectivity of battered women, is of value in the current debate about how to deal with the paradox presented by feminism's engagement with liberalism, and evidenced through the law's assessment of the battered woman who kills.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Feminist theory</field><field name="subject">Feminist jurisprudence</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/276</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Information Utilisation: a Cognitive Analysis of How Girls Utilise Drug Information Based on Brookes' Fundamental Equation K[S] + &#8710;I = K[S + &#8710;S]</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">The central focus of this study is cognitive information utilisation. Research in information utilisation to date has largely focused on the organisational outcomes of the take up of scientific and professional information in the context of social practice, and the related political, cultural and economic factors affecting this.	Conceptualising information utilisation as a type of organisational change or end-state has tended to mask the complex cognitive exchanges that occur. While there has been increasing acknowledgement that information utilisation is a more holistic interactive change process involving cognitive strategies and transformations, very little research has focused on the cognitive dimension of information utilisation. Bertram Brookes claimed that the theoretical pursuit of information science should be the cognitive interaction between people and information. He explicated this as the Fundamental Equation of information science, most commonly expressed in his writings as K[S] + &#8710;I = K[S + &#8710;S]. By this equation, Brookes was stating that in the process of doing something with information, a person's existing knowledge structure K[S] is changed by an increment of information &#8710;I, and this modification has some effect, a changed knowledge structure K[S + &#8710;S] where &#8710;S indicates the effect of the modification. This equation is posited as an expression of cognitive information utilisation. The specific purpose of this study is to further understanding of cognitive information utilisation, employing Brookes' Fundamental Equation as a general framework for establishing research questions, operational rationalisations and procedures. With a group of four girls in their final year of secondary education, the study sought to: (a) establish the effects &#8710;S of exposure to information perceived by the girls; (b) establish how the perceived effects are associated with changes to their knowledge structures K[S]; and (c) establish the patterns, if any, within and between the girls in relation to changes in knowledge structures and perceived effects (K[S + &#8710;S]). The study employed a quasi-experimental repeated phase approach. The girls' existing knowledge structures about the drug heroin were mapped, and knowledge structures after each of three exposures to different information on heroin were also mapped. Eliciting the girls' knowledge about heroin was based on written discourse and question / answer protocols, and this knowledge was represented as conceptual graph structures, based on an analytical procedure developed by Graesser &amp; Clark (1985). The data were analysed qualitatively to establish indicators and conceptualisations of the perceived effects, and to identify and conceptualise the changed knowledge structures. The study found that the exposures to information and the deliberate consideration of this information had effects for all the girls. Five types of effects were perceived, these being: get a complete picture, get a changed picture, get a clearer picture, get a verified picture, and get a position in a picture. These effects are presented as types of cognitive information utilisation. The knowledge structures after each exposure were shown to change by cognitive strategies of appending, inserting and deleting. The analysis of the knowledge structures associated with these five effects showed that there was coherence between the effects and how these effects were manifested in changes to the girls' knowledge structures. A number of distinct patterns were evident, for example, get a complete picture was associated with revised knowledge structures that were more inclusive, elaborative and integrative. The study raises important implications for information practice, including data base design, information interviews, provision of information in media campaigns, and instructional design. The study also addresses methodological issues and identifies area for further research.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Drug abuse</field><field name="subject">Human information processing</field><field name="subject">Reasoning</field><field name="subject">Study and teaching</field><field name="subject">Cognitive psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/277</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aiding Aid: A monitoring &amp; evaluation framework to enhance international aid effectiveness</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This thesis aims to provide a coherent theoretical framework to guide the development of monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) information systems within international aid agencies. The thesis applies soft systems methodologies (SSM) to explore the research question and to develop conceptual models. The theoretical basis for the M&amp;E framework proposed is drawn from a transdisciplinary review of three academic fields: information systems,organisational effectiveness and project management. It is argued that inadequacies in the operationalisation of M&amp;E systems arise from divergent epistemological and ontological assumptions about the nature of information and its role within organisations that are concerned with effecting social change. The M&amp;E framework proposed seeks to resolve the dilemma posed by these divergent assumptions. This involves a M&amp;E information system (i.e.  MEIS) that is novel in terms of its scope, purpose and application. Firstly, the scope of the proposed MEIS takes in the entire aid organisation, going beyond the dominant, conventional approach, which is project-centric.  This enables alignment of project strategies with organisational mission. Further, it aims to promote the institutionalisation of lessons learned within projects (conceived as 'social experiments') for organisational learning, thereby enabling informed debate about the effectiveness of the organisation in fostering sustainable development. Secondly, the purpose of the proposed MEIS has been defined as being concerned with promoting organisational success. The critical success factors of learning and accountability are identified, and the role of M&amp;E in encouraging responsive management decision-making and critical inquiry and reflection is described. Thirdly, the application of the proposed MEIS involves a modified logframe.  The '3D-Logframe' serves as a conceptual basis to address limitations found with the conventional two-dimensional logframe matrix when employed for M&amp;E purposes. The proposed M&amp;E framework was developed out of iterations of action in the field and reflection. Further research will involve applying the framework in its entirety.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Developing countries.</field><field name="subject">Humanitarian assistance.</field><field name="subject">Nonprofit organizations.</field><field name="subject">Economic assistance.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/278</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New Dimensions in Water Conservation; An Inter-animation of Writing and Water</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">Water is a finite resource which is increasingly valued as a commodity.  This thesis explores the use and appreciation of water, in the context of community response and exchange.  Its focus is a community writing practice, and in particular a project entitled new dimensions in Water Conversation based in the Northern Rivers region of New South Wales.  This project was a non-crisis driven investigation into a wide range of interests in water.  The central proposition of the thesis is that techno-scientific and broader cultural world views on water rarely connect, and that bringing them together reveals awkward tensions between specialist and non-specialist standpoints.  These disparities are shown in the group writings and outcome of the project, which bring water provision into closer perspective.  A story emerges from the project and its influences.  It is one of material relationships to water over testings, tastings and visits to a water treatment works.  It suggests links which would not normally be anticipated, for example between a regional bulk water supplier and a group of water writers.  The study combines fiction and contemplation with critical analysis and the thesis crosses disciplinary boundaries, drawing on insights from critical cultural theory and the philosophy of science.  The writing is performative rather than accumulative in nature, yet is a concrete record of the interplay between water users and water specialists, in a local and global dimension which includes the Northern Rivers, Australia more generally and Varanasi in India.  Using this transcultural approach, it decentres theory and locates value in the situated contexts and views of different stakeholders in water, which range from sacred values to indifference.  The work calls out for a way of thinking about water that is not yet in the public discourse.  Through the practical connection of the project with an Australian water instrumentality, it draws in developments in contemporary water management, and raises questions and doubts about how instrumentalist and market values have come to dominate imaginings of a global water future.  At the same time it points to the importance of putting the values of the arts and humanities into practice in the increasingly inter-disciplinary environment in which the resource of water is managed and maintained.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cross-culture</field><field name="subject">northern rivers</field><field name="subject">conservation</field><field name="subject">water</field><field name="subject">community writing</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/279</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spiral Architecture for Machine Vision</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This thesis presents a new and powerful approach to the development of a general purpose machine vision system.

The importance of the hexagonal grid is that it possesses special computational features that are pertinent to the vision process. The fundamental thrust of this thesis emanates from the observation that this hexagonal grid can be described in terms of the mathematical object known as a Euclidean ring. The Euclidean ring is employed to generate an algebra of linear transformations which are appropriate for the processing of multidimensional vision data. A parallel autonomous segmentation algorithm for multidimensional vision data is described. The algebra and segmentation algorithm are implemented on a network of transputers.

Yet, in general, the construction industry continues to degrade the environment, exploiting resources and generating waste, and is reluctant to change its conventional practices to incorporate environmental matters as part of the decisionmaking process. Building development involves complex decisions and the increased significance of external effects has further complicated the situation. Cost benefit analysis (CBA) is one of the conventional tools used widely by public and private sectors when appraising projects. It sets out to measure and compare the total costs and benefits of different projects that are competing for scarce resources in monetary terms. However, there are growing concerns that the values of environmental goods and services are often ignored or underestimated in the CBA approach which has led to the overuse and depletion of environmental assets. Consequently, CBA's usefulness and relevance in this respect is increasingly controversial. Project development is not just concerned with financial return, but is also conscious of the long-term impacts on living standards for both present and future generations.  Sustainable development is an important issue in project decision-making and environmental effects need to be incorporated into the evaluation process. A multi- dimensional evaluation approach attracts increasing attention around the world as the way to incorporate environmental issues in the decision-making process. This approach uses the conventional market approach to monetarise economic aspects of a development, whilst using a non-monetary approach to evaluate the environmental matters. The purpose of this thesis is to critically examine the impact of construction activities on the environment and methods of quantifying environmental matters. This thesis also evaluates the principal sustainable development determinants for modelling, and evaluating long-term environmental performance of buildings during the project appraisal stage. Projects can be assessed using an index system that combines the principal determinants of sustainable development. The four criteria as identified in this research are financial return, energy consumption, external benefits and environmental impact. The derived sustainability index combines the four identified attributes into a single decision-making tool. The attributes are each expressed in units that are best suited to their quantitative assessment. The development of a sustainability index is a way of combining economic and environmental criteria into the decision-making framework. The sustainability index has also been developed into computer software called SINDEX to be used as a benchmarking tool to aid design and the sustainability assessment of projects. SINDEX is a sustainability modelling tool used to calculate and benchmark sustainable performance of proposed buildings, new and existing facilities.  Conventional project appraisal techniques measure net social gain to select a project, whilst the sustainability index measures the relative ranking of projects from a sustainable development view. Buildings have a long life, so any improvement in appraisal techniques for choosing the best option amongst the alternatives will significantly reduce their future environmental impact. As such, a methodology that embraces various criteria in relation to project development is crucial in this respect.  The development of a sustainability index is a way to combine multiple criteria measured using different units. Using the sustainability index will greatly assist the construction industry to realise sustainable development goals, and thereby make a positive contribution to identifying optimum design solutions.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">environmental aspects</field><field name="subject">sustainable development</field><field name="subject">Construction industry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/281</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Sport Development Processes in Australia</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with Australian sport policy, specifically sport development in Australia. Therefore, its theoretical origins lie within the discourse of public policy.  While public policy studies are abundant, sport policy research and in particular sport development studies are limited. Hence there is a shortage in the literature on sport development research. Sport nevertheless established itself as a legitimate policy area in Australia in the mid-1970s. Since then, the Federal Government's involvement with sport policy has expanded and nowadays sport in Australia is very much impacted by Federal Government support. However, increased interest and importance placed on sport have not induced corresponding attention from sport policy studies. This study is a first effort to portray the sport development processes as it occurs in the Australian context. In particular, this thesis examines the impact of the Federal Government involvement with sport policy on the sport development processes at a national level. In doing so, this study explores the roles of the key sport development players and the ways sport policies shape sport development processes. Additionally, the study explores the available sport development pathways and the relationships between sport policy players, policies and sport development processes. There have been previous efforts to depict the processes involved with sport development by means of a pyramid that incorporates mass participants at its base and the elite athletes at its peak. This framework provides a very simplistic representation of sport development and does not explicate the embedded processes (Eady, 1993, Shilbury &amp; Deane, 2001). The aforementioned inadequacy of the existing framework to explain sport development led to grounded theory research. Grounded theory is a qualitative research approach formulated by Glaser and Strauss (1967) as a means of generating theory, when existing theoretical frameworks are inadequate to explain a phenomenon, which is embedded in systematically gathered and analysed data (Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967; Bryman, 1988). Strauss and Corbin (1994) argued that if the research question concerns a process, the method of choice for addressing the question is grounded theory. This method led to the constant comparison and coding of data from the Annual Reports of 35 National Sporting Organisations in Australia. These documents covered the years from 1999-2002 (inclusive) and are linked to a Federal Government funding cycle.  Grounded theory research is viewed as 'the foundation for subsequent deductive studies that test out the resulting theory or interventions based on it' (Oshansky, 1996, p. 394). Hence, the model this thesis offers is subject to further empirical testing and future research. The results of the study provide a theoretical framework to understand the Sport Development Processes in Australia. The Sport Development Processes framework illustrates that at the hub of successful sport development there are three major and interrelated requirements: a) Stakeholders, b) Practices and c) Pathways. Sport Development Stakeholders (i.e. governments, sporting organisations and significant others) provide the unity and teamwork necessary for the Sport Development Practices that in turn provide the required Sport Development Pathways. These pathways as the result of sport stakeholder involvement and policy implementation allow Sport Development Processes to occur. According to the Sport Development Processes framework there are three interrelated processes (i.e. Attraction, Retention/Transition, and Nurturing) which involve attracting, retaining and developing the most skilled athletes, building participation and using sport performance to positively influence community involvement with sport. For each process to be successful, a different combination of stakeholder involvement and practices (hence resulting pathways) is necessary. This model provides a unique contribution to the field of sport policy, as it is the first theoretical attempt to fill the void regarding sport development processes. In the process, sport development officers, policy makers and sporting organisations at all levels around Australia are provided with a comprehensive model that assists and advances understanding of sport development processes.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sport</field><field name="subject">development</field><field name="subject">processes</field><field name="subject">federal</field><field name="subject">government</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/282</field></doc><doc><field name="title">What are the characteristics and driving forces behind the creativity and vision of successful Lebanese immigrants?</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">Creative visualization is an essential attribute to be possessed by an artist to achieve success in any art endeavour. To reach its purpose in all its fields, art is made manifest and is expressed through real genuine passion. This research study acknowledges Gibran Kahlil Gibran, as a distinguished immigrant artist, with a vision. A comparison is then made of six other artists, including the researcher, who have all had similar ordeals in the successful attainment of their vision.  This biographical, neo-narrative research design methodology was recorded through extensive readings and lengthy interviews, which consisted of proposing specific questions to each of the participants in order to extract valid and comparable findings. As a consequence, the art researcher was able to observe, reflect and draw some relevant conclusions towards the creative vision of Lebanese immigrants, which led to their success despite hardships, expatriation, ambition and hope.  This study has provided the researcher with real insight into the characteristics of these artists and what constitutes a successful immigrant. It has confirmed her pre-conceived perceptions that success takes time and personal effort.  It highlights the importance for the existence of tolerance between people, which in turn will enable the realisation of empathy.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Creativity</field><field name="subject">creative ability</field><field name="subject">vision</field><field name="subject">interviews</field><field name="subject">immigrants</field><field name="subject">Lebanese</field><field name="subject">Kahlil Gibran</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/283</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Construction of the Meaning and Significance of an 'Author' among Information Behaviour Researchers. A Social Constructivist approach.</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This study identifies and explores the social processes that influence the construction by academic researchers of the meaning/s and significance/s of an author and her work prominent in the literature of their field. It examines the construction by 15 information behaviour researchers of Brenda Dervin and her work, using semi-structured interviewing and inductive analysis techniques.  In focussing theoretical attention on social processes, the study seeks to address critiques of prevailing approaches to information behaviour research, such as: a focus on individual cognition at the expense of social and affective factors; a construction of information users defined by their areas of ignorance and uncertainty, rather than their expertise; and a focus on purposive rather than non-purposive information behaviour.  Conceptually, the study has been influenced by a range of theoretical approaches from both information behaviour research and a variety of other disciplines, including Dervin's Sense-Making and Foucauldian discourse analysis.  The study found that participants' initial contact with the author and her work, and the subsequent important events in their relationship, occurred not because of purposeful searching, but rather 'socially' - as a part of non-purposive events and relationships related to the participants' role as academic researchers. The source most frequently discussed by participants was informal discussions with colleagues, and participants' interactions with 'author texts' were commonly mediated by their interpersonal communication. The study found that the significant influences on participants' constructive processes were people and texts with whom they had a long-term relationship.  Participants' constructions of the author and her work were an essentially social process. Their sense-making was inextricably linked to their social context/s: their interactions with their colleagues and mentors; their engagement with the literature and theories of information science and other fields; their research interests and specialisations; and their educational and cultural backgrounds. Participants' constructive processes largely involved elaborating existing constructions - radical changes in construction were both rare and traumatic. Participants' constructions were neither objective nor wholly subjective, but intersubjective - based on shared understandings, conventions and social practices.  Participants' constructive processes had two interdependent aspects: the construction of meaning and the construction of authority (knowledge/power). Participants' informal behaviour, as well as their engagement with formal information sources, involved constructions of authority. Their constructions of the authority of their informant/s determined whether they accepted or rejected the constructions of the author conveyed to them. Participants were able to strategically use shared constructions to add to the credibility and authority of their own work</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Social sciences</field><field name="subject">Research</field><field name="subject">Methodology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/284</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Video Chaos: Multilinear narrative structuration in New Media video practice</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">The presentation of the thesis comprises the Dissertation component (66%) along with the Practice Component and the Practice Report (33%).

The presentation of the thesis comprises the Dissertation component (66%) along with the Practice Component and the Practice Report (33%). The Practice Report documents the nature and development of the research undertaken during the course of the study. The culmination of the Practice Component takes the form of an exhibition and archiving of video works from June 2003 to the date of submission, January 2005.  The Practice Component has been based in the following locations and used resources from Central Queensland University (Bundaberg campus), and The Australian National University, Centre for New Media Arts in Canberra. The practice has examined the topic through the production of the audio-video installation Sugartown and three video works The Hazzards, Nodal Dialectics 1 and boomsplatbangwhack. While these video works exist as discrete media artworks, they also operate as a type of practice process diary for working through the ideas explored in the written dissertation. Even though the video works are not meant to literally 'illustrate' those ideas, they nevertheless explore ways of integrating the theoretical concepts into my own research practice.

Accordingly a promise received in exchange is not enforceable. This is so whether the promise would have the effect of creating a new contract or modifying the terms of an existing contract. The rule has from time to time been the subject of judicial criticism but nevertheless operated with full vigor until 1991. Hitherto, (except in unilateral contract situations) consideration subsisted in the promises made by the parties at the instant of exchange rendering the promises thenceforth mutually enforceable. The contract or the modified contract effectively existed from that time, unconcerned with what the parties hoped to gain from the exchange or what each in fact gained. The English Court of Appeal decision in Williams v. Roffey Bros &amp; Nicholls Ltd has the potential to change the law as settled. This dissertation is concerned with the consequences of the decision in the context of promises intended to modify the terms of existing contracts. In Williams v. Roffey the successful promisee gave the promisor no more than an understanding that he would continue to attempt to perform his undertaking under a prior contract. The Court held that the 'practical benefit' that accrued to the promisor from the repetition of the previous promise was sufficient consideration to make the promise of increased payment enforceable. The second promise was made outside the bargaining process and the potential for 'practical benefit' was neither solicited nor offered. The fact that there would be a 'practical benefit' was a deduction made by the Court as a result of questioning counsel for the defendant during the argument of the appeal. The dissertation examines the history of the doctrine of consideration, its incidents, which are said to enable consideration to moderate bargains, and how each is potentially rendered redundant by the decision. As a result of the decision, the role of the court has changed with greater emphasis on the substance of the transaction instead of external characteristics. The superior record keeping methods available to commerce in the 20th century facilitates this change. The following matters seem implicit in the decision. First, the bargaining process has lost its significance in contract modification situations. Second, the courts in determining what is practical and what is not, will find it difficult to avoid investigating the adequacy of consideration. This is an investigation that the courts have steadfastly refused to undertake in the past. The series of Australian authorities commencing with Je Maintendrai v. Quaglia and culminating in The Commonwealth of Australia v. Verwayen are examined. Whilst it is correct to say that those decisions, especially Waltons Stores v. Maher, introduce reliance based liability into the Australian law, the conclusion is reached that extensions to the law of estoppel do not solve the problems arising out of promises that modify existing contracts. This is because detriment to the promisee is necessary to trigger the operation of the law of estoppel and the remedy, being equitable, is discretionary. In contract modification situations the detriment suffered by the promisee is often ethereal and a discretionary remedy (as opposed to enforcing the promise) deprives the transaction of the certainty that is desirable in commercial transactions. The work concludes that, in regard to contract modifications, the doctrine of consideration ceases to perform a useful role and the equitable remedies do not meet the needs of commerce. Accordingly, the suggestion is made that all promises having the effect of modifying an existing contract should be enforceable provided that there is satisfactory evidence that the promise was made and the absence of duress.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">consideration (Law)</field><field name="subject">contracts</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/286</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Inquiry Into PBNM System Performance Required For Massive Scale Telecommunication Applications</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">PBNM systems have been proposed as a feasible techology for managing massive scale applications including telecommunication service management. What is not known is how this class of system performs under carrier-scale traffic loads. This research investigates this open question and concludes, subject to the considerations herein, this technology can provide services to large scale applications. An in depth examination of several inferencing algorithms is made using experimental methods. The inferencing operation has been implicated as the major source of performance problems in rule based systems and we examine this. Moreover, these algorithms are of central importance to current and future context-aware, pervasive, mobile services. A novel algorithm, JukeBox, is proposed that is a correct, general and pure bindspace conjunctive match algorithm. It is compared to the current state of the art algorithm - Rete. We find that Rete is the superior algorithm when implemented using the hashed-equality variant. We also conclude that IO is an important cause of PBNM system performace limitations and is perhaps of more significance than the implicated inferencing operations. However, inferencing can be a bottleneck to performance and we document the factors associated with this. We describe a generally useful policy system benchmarking procedure that provides a visible, repeatable and measurable process for establishing a policy server's service rate characteristics. The service rate statistics, namely (mu) and (sigma), establish the limitations to policy system throughput. Combined with the offered traffic load to the server, using the statistic (lambda), we can provide a complete characterisation of system performance using the Pollaczek-Khinchine function. This characterisation allows us to make simple design and dimensioning heuristics that can be used to rate the policy system as a whole.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Telecommunication</field><field name="subject">Management</field><field name="subject">Based</field><field name="subject">Network</field><field name="subject">Performance</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/287</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of Joint Intensity Algorithms to the Registration of Emission Tomography and Anatomical Images</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">In current practice, it is common in medical diagnosis or treatment monitoring for a patient to require multiple examinations using different imaging techniques. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and computed tomography (CT) are good at providing anatomical information. Three-dimensional functional information about tissues and organs is often obtained with radionuclide imaging modalities: positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission tomography (SPET). In nuclear medicine, such techniques must contend with poor spatial resolution, poor counting statistics of functional images and the lack of correspondence between the distribution of the radioactive tracer and anatomical boundaries. Information gained from anatomical and functional images is usually of a complementary nature. Since the patient cannot be relied on to assume exactly the same pose at different times and possibly in different scanners, spatial alignment of images is needed. In this thesis, a general framework for image registration is presented, in which the optimum alignment corresponds to a maximum of a similarity measure. Particular attention is drawn to entropy-based measures, and variance-based measures. These similarity measures include mutual information, normalized mutual information and correlation ratio which are the ones being considered in this study. In multimodality image registration between functional and anatomical images, these measures manifest superior performance compared to feature-based measures. A common characteristic of these measures is the use of the joint-intensity histogram, which is needed to estimate the joint probability and the marginal probability of the images. A novel similarity measure is proposed, the symmetric correlation ratio (SCR), which is a simple extension of the correlation ratio measure. Experiments were performed to study questions pertaining to the optimization of the registration process. For example, do these measures produce similar registration accuracy in the non-brain region as in the brain? Does the performance of SPET-CT registration depend on the choice of the reconstruction method (FBP or OSEM)? The joint-intensity based similarity measures were examined and compared using clinical data with real distortions and digital phantoms with synthetic distortions. In automatic SPET-MR rigid-body registration applied to clinical brain data, a global mean accuracy of 3.9 mm was measured using external fiducial markers. SCR performed better than mutual information when sparse sampling was used to speed up the registration process.  Using the Zubal phantom of the thoracic-abdominal region, SPET projections for Methylenediphosponate (MDP) and Gallium-67 (67Ga) studies were simulated for 360 degree data, accounting for noise, attenuation and depth-dependent resolution. Projection data were reconstructed using conventional filtered back projection (FBP) and accelerated maximum likelihood reconstruction based on the use of ordered subsets (OSEM). The results of SPET-CT rigid-body registration of the thoracic-abdominal region revealed that registration accuracy was insensitive to image noise, irrespective of which reconstruction method was used. The registration accuracy, to some extent, depended on which algorithm (OSEM or FBP) was used for SPET reconstruction. It was found that, for roughly noise-equivalent images, OSEM-reconstructed SPET produced better registration than FBP-reconstructed SPET when attenuation compensation (AC) was included but this was less obvious for SPET without AC. The results suggest that OSEM is the preferable SPET reconstruction algorithm, producing more accurate rigidbody image registration when AC is used to remove artifacts due to non-uniform attenuation in the thoracic region. Registration performance deteriorated with decreasing planar projection count. The presence of the body boundary in the SPET image and matching fields of view were shown not to affect the registration performance substantially but pre-processing steps such as CT intensity windowing did improve registration accuracy. Non-rigid registration based on SCR was also investigated. The proposed algorithm for non-rigid registration is based on overlapping image blocks defined on a 3D grid pattern and a multi-level strategy. The transformation vector field, representing image deformation is found by translating each block so as to maximize the local similarity measure. The resulting sparsely sampled vector field is interpolated using a Gaussian function to ensure a locally smooth transformation. Comparisons were performed to test the effectiveness of SCR, MI and NMI in 3D intra- and inter-modality registration. The accuracy of the technique was evaluated on digital phantoms and on patient data. SCR demonstrated a better non-rigid registration than MI when sparse sampling was used for image block matching. For the high-resolution MR-MR image of brain region, the proposed algorithm was successful, placing 92% of image voxels within less than or equal to 2 voxels of the true position. Where one of the images had low resolution (e.g. in CT-SPET, MR-SPET registration), the accuracy and robustness deteriorated profoundly. In the current implementation, a 3D registration process takes about 10 minutes to complete on a stand alone Pentium IV PC with 1.7 GHz CPU and 256 Mbytes random access memory on board.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nuclear medicine</field><field name="subject">Image registration</field><field name="subject">Magnetic resonance</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/288</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The use of project management mechanisms in software development and their relationship to organisational distance; An emperical investigation</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This thesis describes empirical research into project management of software development.  Specifically, the aim of the research is to investigate how project managers monitor, control and coordinate software development tasks and how this is affected by changing environments, in this case increased organizational distance between the project manager and elements of the project team. Differing project environments allow investigation into which project management mechanisms are essential, which are required in specific circumstances and which may be useful but not necessarily essential.  To explore how software development projects are monitored, controlled and coordinated, a broad range of literature from software development and other fields such as organization theory, supply chain management and automobile manufacture is examined to establish a consensus of the mechanisms of project monitoring, control and coordination and their classification into groups. To better understand how the different mechanisms may be selected in different circumstances, a range of contingencies is examined to deduce which of these contingencies may significantly affect the project management of software development projects. Outsourced and distributed software development projects are becoming more frequent than in the past with consequent effects on project management practices. Although there has been some research into the ways in which project managers monitor, control and coordinate software development projects, little of it has investigated how the mechanisms employed to do so may be affected by such factors as increasing organizational distance. If more were known about the ways in which changed project environments affected the selection and use of project management mechanisms, better responses to those environmental changes could be devised.  This could also identify where tools could be developed to assist project management of outsourced and distributed projects. In this research, the term 'organizational distance' is used to describe the cultural, structural and administrative distance between the project manager and elements of the project team. Since there is limited information available on the concept of organizational distance, a new model is developed that encompasses the dimensions of distance that may be found in outsourced or globally distributed projects. A second model is then developed that relates changes in the factors of organizational distance with preferred choices of project management mechanism via project contingencies. Empirical data were collected by structured interviews with project managers who were currently engaged in software development within Sydney, Australia. The method of collecting the data provided both quantitative and qualitative data that enabled three separate ways to investigate the research questions.  The empirical research found that project managers do not rely on a single mechanism to monitor, control or coordinate a software development project but employ multiple mechanisms.  While the portfolio of mechanisms for both monitoring and control comprised a relatively narrow selection, the portfolio of coordination mechanisms was more diverse. Project monitoring mechanisms were employed to first detect any project problems then to respond to those problems. This contrasts with monitoring systems designed to provide all the information about both the existence and probable causes of project problems.  Project control mechanisms reflected the origin of the control. The constraints imposed on the project by the organization and used by the project manager to direct the project tended to be outcome related, for example budget and schedule. The behaviour of the project team, even across significant organizational distances, was controlled through the use of project plans that determined when different tasks would be performed.  Project coordination mechanisms reflected the different types of dependencies between software development activities. The most common was using a project work breakdown structure, expressed in the project schedule, to resolve sequential and pooled resource dependencies.  Mutual dependencies tended to be resolved using interactive mechanisms such as co-location, conversations and meetings. The empirical evidence did not find any difference between co-located projects and distributed projects so far as the choice of project management mechanisms were concerned. Distributed and globally outsourced software development projects may encounter many difficulties that a fully co-located project does not, but the response to those difficulties appears to lie with the implementation of project management mechanisms and not their selection.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Project</field><field name="subject">Management</field><field name="subject">Computer</field><field name="subject">Software</field><field name="subject">Development</field><field name="subject">Monitor</field><field name="subject">Control</field><field name="subject">Coordinate</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/289</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Influence of Organisational Culture, Subculture, Leadership Style and Job Satisfaction on Organisational Commitment</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">Despite the large number of studies that have examined the antecedents of organisational commitment, the investigation of the influence of organisational culture and subculture on commitment is noticeably absent. The aim of this thesis is to examine the effects of both organisational culture and subculture on organisational commitment. Other measures which have been shown to be related to either organisational commitment or organisational culture are also included in the study. These are leadership style, job satisfaction and demographic variables such as age, education, years in position and years of experience. Recently, multivariate studies have examined the causal relationships between a variety of different variables and organisational commitment, and a number of these have concluded that the effects of these variables on organisational commitment were mainly mediated by job satisfaction. The data gathered in the present study is examined to determine if it is consistent with job satisfaction fulfilling such a mediating role between commitment and the other variables in the study. Also, a multi-dimensional measure of job satisfaction is employed in the present study and the effects of the different job satisfaction components on commitment are investigated. The subjects used in this study were nurses working in different hospital settings. A questionnaire survey was used which was complemented by semistructured interviews. A total of 398 questionnaires were distributed to nurses in seven hospitals, from which 251 completed questionnaires were returned (63.5% response rate). The sample was obtained from three general public hospitals, two private hospitals and two psychiatric hospitals. Correlational and regression analyses were used to investigate the relationships between nurses' commitment to their wards and the other variables measured in the study. A causal model of commitment was developed using a multiple regression analysis in which the role of job satisfaction in mediating the causal link between commitment and the other variables was explored. It was found that organisational subculture had a greater impact on commitment than organisational culture. Innovative and supportive subcultures had a positive effect on commitment and a bureaucratic subculture had a negative effect on commitment. The leadership style variable, consideration, also exerted a relatively strong influence on commitment when compared with other variables included in the study. The results of this study also revealed that the job satisfaction dimensions with the strongest associations with commitment were the control, professionalism and interaction dimensions, which represent intrinsic factors of job satisfaction or those related to higherorder needs in Maslow's (1943) hierarchy. Age showed a direct positive influence on commitment. However, the level of education, years in position and years of clinical experience failed to showed any impact on commitment. Thus, the results of this study are not in agreement with causal models (such as that proposed by Williams and Hazer 1986), in which the influence of various antecedents on commitment are totally mediated via their influence on job satisfaction. The effect of the culture and leadership style variables on commitment was found to be significantly reduced, but not totally eliminated, after statistically controlling for the job satisfaction variables. Finally, in relation to the different hospital groups, the results showed that private hospitals had the strongest bureaucratic ward culture when compared to general public and psychiatric hospitals. The most innovative ward culture was found in general public hospitals and the most supportive ward culture was found in psychiatric hospitals. These findings were contrary to expected outcomes.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Organizational behavior</field><field name="subject">Job satisfaction</field><field name="subject">Corporate culture</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/290</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Impacts of Selective Outsourcing Of Information Technology And Information Services</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This study identifies the impacts to the internal Information Technology (IT) department's policies and procedures caused by outsourcing selective IT functions and assesses the threats and opportunities to an internal IT group, presented by outsourcing selective IT functions.  The trend to selectively outsource IT functions implies that this can be done with minimal disruption and risk to the IT departments policies and processes. This research investigates whether this assertion is valid and develops a model for internal IT departments to respond to the challenges presented by selective outsourcing.  Existing models of outsourcing currently in use and available to organizations are reviewed to assess their suitability or adaptability for `selective outsourcing' and from this identifies which areas of internal IT policy and procedures are most impacted. An analysis of the threats and opportunities presented to the internal IT department is also provided.  Research was conducted into one organization's experience with selective outsourcing to investigate how internal IT departments could approach selective outsourcing of internal IT functions and how internal IT departments could develop strategies for responding to the challenges posed by selective outsourcing.  A case study was conducted of a recent selective outsourcing arrangement within the IT group of the target organization. The personal interview method was adopted to survey a cross section of management and staff from the work groups involved in the selective outsourcing arrangement.  The results obtained revolved around the major themes of: 1. Planning (identified as time constraints, resource constraints and work load).  2. Management control (which encompasses the structuring of the outsourcing relationship, human resource concerns, level of ownership, communication, structure of the internal IT group and inter-departmental concerns).  3. Process (which applies to the quality of the procedures, inherent internal knowledge required, the informality of the procedures and concerns over adherence to procedures).  For an IT group to develop strategies to respond to the challenges of selective outsourcing it was identified that the IT group needs to remove internal barriers to process and strive to achieve single ownership of processes within functional work groups; nurture a shift in internal groups thinking to more planning rather than doing; improve the quality of internal IT procedures and implement appropriate project team structures for task specific selective outsourcing engagements and for ongoing vendor relationship management.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electronic data processing departments</field><field name="subject">Contracting out</field><field name="subject">Information technology</field><field name="subject">Case studies.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/291</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Counting Maternity: The Measure of Midwifery in Australia, 2002.</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">The aim of this Professional Doctorate in Midwifery is to challenge the status quo in maternity services through scholarly reflection and research. Through the studies reported here I aim to provide women with information on which to make informed choices about the services available to them, and to ensure politicians become more responsive to the lack of options currently available in Australia. My aim is also to provide measures that would allow maternity service managers to deploy resources more efficiently to achieve the best care.  The majority of the papers in the portfolio are derived from population data that is routinely collected in Australia. One of the cornerstones of healthcare improvement is creating meaningful information and measurement from these collections. True comparisons from accurate data can be used to better understand the nature of the system, and to gauge whether changes have been effective. Thus, the information derived from various collections of routinely collected data is used to measure and evaluate the maternity services. This measures only part of the experience of childbirth, however.  The Doctorate is a collection of nine major works undertaken in the years 1999 to 2002, during my appointment as a research midwife with the Australian Midwifery Action Project (AMAP). The first paper is an essay that tells of the juxtaposition of two different worldviews and the paradigmatic issues that shape the professional differences between obstetrics and midwifery. The second consists of a brief overview of the Australian maternity system described within the terms of reference for a Senate Inquiry into Childbirth Procedures. The third and fourth papers explore the levels of obstetric intervention for low risk women and the cost of these interventions using a new costing model derived from population data. The fifth paper reviews the contemporary issues in the workforce and education of midwives. The sixth paper outlines a proposal for funding reform and a new model of midwifery care. The seventh paper compares midwifery in Australia and New Zealand, in terms of a public health strategy. The eighth paper explores the concept of a new research method called Graffiti; and the final paper continues the theme of measurement in an essay titled 'Evidence based Everything.  The portfolio explores a number of issues around public funding and the call for reform of the maternity services in Australia. In particular it argues for reforms to fund a more responsive service, based on values outlined by women who experience maternity care in Australia, as opposed to those guided by obstetrics and technology who currently set the agenda and determine the way maternity services will be offered and funded.  Although I have articulated and measured some of the characteristics of midwifery and obstetric care in Australia, this disentangling or quantification merely underlies and emphasises the many more continuations and complexities that coexist beyond that, which is 'measured'.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Midwifery</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/292</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Discourse Contexts for Second Language Development in the Mainstream Classroom.</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">In Australian schools in the late nineties approximately one quarter of all students are from a language background other than English. Although many of these students are fluent in English in informal conversational contexts, there is evidence that such students are not always able to control the more academic registers of English associated with school learning and literacy. A major challenge for teachers is therefore to integrate subject learning with English language learning, and to find ways to support the language development of students concurrent with the construction of curriculum knowledge. This study addresses that challenge. Drawing on data from two classrooms of nine and ten year olds in the curriculum area of science, the study explores how the discourse of the classroom can be enabling of language development. It does not attempt to make claims about what might be common to all classrooms, but rather points to those practices which are shown to be supportive of second language learning. The aim therefore is not to suggest what is common to all classroom discourse but what its potential can be for second language development. The study takes as a basic principle the notion that language development interacts dynamically with the socio-cultural context in which it occurs, and cannot be fully understood without taking account of this context. Although the analysis draws on systemic functional linguistics it does not purport to be a study 'in' linguistics, but rather, through a theorisation of practice, seeks to contribute to a theorisation of second language pedagogy in the mainstream classroom. To this end, the analysis is also informed by a neo-Vygotskian approach to learning and teaching, by second language acquisition (SLA) research, and by critically conceived notions of minority education. A number of conclusions are drawn from the study. First, it shows how, through a process of recontextualisation of student talk, the teachers jointly construct with the students aspects of the science register. It concludes that when teachers encourage the dialogic function of discourse to develop, (that is, when knowledge is seen as co-constructed between teacher and learners, rather than transmitted from teacher to learners), this also leads to the kind of teacher-student talk which is most enabling of second language development. The study demonstrates that even apparently minor changes in interactional patterns can have quite major effects on the progress of the discourse as a whole, and can make the difference between discourse which is likely to constrain or facilitate language development and learning. The thesis also shows how the discourse incorporates a range of interactional patterns, each of which tend to be used for distinct pedagogical purposes, and thus how the role of the teachers correspondingly changes at different phases of the teaching and learning cycle. The study concludes that a reconceptualisation of pedagogy is required which foregrounds the relationship between teaching and learning and the nature of teacher mediation in the teaching and learning process. The study identifies other significant factors for language development in the classrooms examined: the language knowledge of the teachers, the explicitness of the discourse, (including explicitness about language and about the social aspects of participating in the class), the sequence of teaching and learning activities, and the importance of the intertextual links, the 'dynamic' context, which were the result of this sequence. Finally, the study points to the value of approaching SLA research and pedagogy with a model of language which goes beyond a description of its phonology, morphology and syntax, one which allows for the study of discourse and for the study of language development in terms of socio-linguistic competence, and for the value of a socio-cultural and classroom-based approach to research into second language learning and pedagogy.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English language study and teaching.</field><field name="subject">Primary teaching.</field><field name="subject">Foreign speakers.</field><field name="subject">Children of immigrants.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/293</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Project Pluralism: combining the hard and soft paradigms in IS/IT strategy development in the NSW public sector</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This research examines pluralist practice, the combination of methodologies based in different paradigms. Two paradigms are discussed throughout this research, referred to as the hard and soft paradigms. The hard paradigm is commonly associated with positivism and quantitative data, while the soft paradigm is commonly associated with interpretivism and qualitative data. These two paradigms present considerably different perspectives on the world, and methodologies based on these paradigms tend to place different emphases on research and practice. The combination of methodologies from different paradigms presents a number of problems for practice. These include the problem of paradigmatic incommensurability and issues related to practitioner skill diversity, and difficulties in reconciling the different perspectives that are brought to a situation by different methodologies. This research explores pluralist practice through the combination of Project Management and Soft Systems Methodology, methodologies which are based on the hard and soft paradigms respectively. The combination of these methodologies is informed by aspects of the Critical Systems Thinking literature, and based on the Embedding model for pluralism. The combination of these methodologies is explored in the context of an IS / IT strategy development project, in the NSW public sector. This project was set within an environment typified by changing stakeholder relationships, abstractly defined and changing goals, and a variety of external influences which altered throughout the course of the project. A combination of Project Management and Soft Systems Methodology, based on the Embedding model for pluralism, was used in the management of this project, and resulted in a project which is demonstrated to have provided lasting benefit to the organisation. This is participative, practice based research, and Action Research has been used as the research methodology for this thesis. Action Research has been chosen as a way of linking theory and practice, allowing for the simultaneous development of theory and practice, through cycles of active reflection. The interpretation of research findings has been informed by hermeneutic philosophies. Learning outcomes resulting from this research predominantly relate to the combination of Project Management and Soft Systems Methodology, based on the Embedding model. Findings relate to how the problem of paradigmatic incommensurability affects pluralist practice, issues related to the use of tools and techniques governed by paradigms other than that for which they were designed, and specific adaptations that were made in suiting Project Management and Soft Systems Methodology to the needs of the project environment.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Systems.</field><field name="subject">Technology.</field><field name="subject">Paradigms.</field><field name="subject">Project management.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/294</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Relinquishment and abjection: a semanalysis of the meaning of losing a baby to adoption</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">Between 1960 and 1975 more than 38,000 mothers lost babies to adoption in New South Wales, Australia, a pattern which was replicated in other Western societies.  Various theories were proposed for women's exnuptial pregnancies which resulted in their babies being taken for adoption, culminating in the discursive construction of the unmarried mother as 'mad, bad, or stupid'. Until the 1990s, the voices of women whose babies had been taken for adoption had been silenced by the social order which adoption practices served. It is through their voices, and through the voices of other women who remember the era of the adoption bounty, that another meaning for the loss of a baby to adoption, through the process of semanalysis, has been sought.  This thesis is informed primarily by the writings of the French postmodern feminist, Julia Kristeva. In addition the works of the post-structuralist philosopher, Michel Foucault, the German socialist feminist, Frigga Haug, and the American feminist psychologist, Michelle Fine are used as an heuristic lens through which to examine the phenomenon of losing a baby to adoption. A qualitative research methodology, incorporating feminist praxis and feminist multiple methods, has been employed.  The framework for this thesis is that of a double helix which depicts two orders, the symbolic and the semiotic, which intertwine and intersect. The symbolic order is analogous to the public social order which through its hegemonic discourses constructed the unmarried mother and adoption. The semiotic order refers to the personal space where the voices of women are heard through counterdiscourses. At the scission of the two helical strands sits the thetic phase, a point of rupture by the semiotic into the symbolic where the voices of mothers are expressed through their poetry and art.  Through the process of semanalysis, the tensions which simultaneously resist and challenge the semiotic and symbolic orders are exposed: tensions between discourse, discipline and docility; power and knowledge; sexuality and silence; power of / as sexuality; power and resistance; and resistance and / as silence. Furthermore, I examine the manifestations of mothers' resistance to silence, and their resistance as activism.  My concluding analysis involves the notion of abjection as it binds together the threads of the loss of a baby to adoption: abjection as entrapment; abjection as infertility; and abjection as / in reunion. For mothers who lost babies to adoption, their loss finds meaning in the ultimate horror: it is abjection.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Unmarried mothers</field><field name="subject">Adoption</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/295</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structured graphs: a visual formalism for scalable graph based tools and its application to software structured analysis</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">Very large graphs are difficult for a person to browse and edit on a computer screen. This thesis introduces a visual formalism, structured graphs, which supports the scalable browsing and editing of very large graphs. This approach is relevant to a given application when it incorporates a large graph which is composed of named nodes and links, and abstraction hierarchies which can be defined on these nodes and links. A typical browsing operation is the selection of an arbitrary group of nodes and the display of the network of nodes and links for these nodes. Typical editing operations is: adding a new link between two nodes, adding a new node in the hierarchy, and moving sub-graphs to a new position in the node hierarchy. These operations are scalable when the number of user steps involved remains constant regardless of how large the graph is. This thesis shows that with structured graphs, these operations typically take one user step. We demonstrate the utility of structured graph formalism in an application setting. Computer aided software engineering tools, and in particular, structured analysis tools, are the chosen application area for this thesis, as they are graph based, and existing tools, though adequate for medium sized systems, lack scalability. In this thesis examples of an improved design for a structured analysis tool, based on structured graphs, is given. These improvements include scalable browsing and editing operations to support an individual software analyst, and component composition operations to support the construction of large models by a group of software analysts. Finally, we include proofs of key properties and descriptions of two text based implementations.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">computer software development</field><field name="subject">graphic methods</field><field name="subject">computer programs</field><field name="subject">computer simulation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/296</field></doc><doc><field name="title">To what extent is the deep enjoyment of flow experienced in primary classroom learning, and under what teaching and learning conditions might the deep enjoyment of flow be facilitated ?</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">The primary purposes of this research were to identify if and how a selected teacher and her class experience deep enjoyment as flow in the classroom, and if they do have that experience, to investigate the teaching and learning factors that facilitate that deep enjoyment.  In particular this research had the following three aims:  1.	to explore the conditions and activities that are identifiable in learner's perceptions of their deep enjoyment or flow in learning. 2.	to identify the component characteristics of flow articulated in the learners' stories about their enjoyable learning experiences. 3.	to identify and examine perceptions of deep enjoyment or flow in learning in teacher practice and student learning through a teacher's stories of her teaching experience and through classroom observations.  The research involved a case study of a teacher in a state school Year 5/6 classroom, and seventeen of her students.  Qualitative data were collected from interviews with the teacher, interviews with the students, and field observations recorded in the researcher's journal over a period of several months.  These data, analysed by using the NUD*IST software, provide valuable insight into how the teacher and her students perceive their teaching and learning experiences.  The children and their teacher do experience enjoyment, often the deep enjoyment of flow in their classroom.  A classroom culture was identified that includes teaching characteristics, environmental, and instructional variables, which help facilitate deeply enjoyable flow in meaningful learning. This research concludes that the intellectual knowledge is available which will make flow facilitating classroom cultures achievable.  Achieving such a classroom culture is possible when educators identify and value the enjoyment of flow, with its subsequent sense of learner control, confidence, success, well-being, energy and motivation to learn.  To do this, educators need to identify and implement the teaching and learning strategies available that facilitate the experience, with the intention of ensuring recurrent learner success from the early years of school attendance.  Such a change in the educational ethos would lead to successful, enjoyable and vibrant learning experiences for teacher and learner in the classroom.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Educational psychology</field><field name="subject">Classroom management</field><field name="subject">Psychological aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/297</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Perception of Change in Education, Training and Development in the NSW Police Service, Post the Wood Royal Commission</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This study examined the perception held by members of the NSW Police Service as to the effectiveness of changes made to education, training and development, post the recommendations made by the Wood Royal Commission in 1997.  The Commission report highlighted a number of important education, training and development issues.  The literature on policing indicated that police jurisdictions have a need to both anticipate and respond to changes and events occurring in the communities they serve.  This study thus examined both the general and police literature covering change, culture, management and leadership, professionalisation and the main education, training and development topics that were included in the Commission report.  An historical scan of developments within the NSW Police Service was also made.  The study basically adopted an empirical, quantitative research methodology, supplemented by qualitative statements made by participants during discussion sessions.  Two separate questionnaires were developed: one for respondents in the broader NSW Police Service (one city and one rural region), and the other for sworn officers and academic staff at the NSW Police Academy.  The Service questionnaire addressed participant perception of the effectiveness or otherwise, of changes made in relevant aspects of individual, team and organisational learning.  Opportunity was also taken to analyse responses to the Service questionnaire, based on a range of selected demographic characteristics.  The Academy questionnaire addressed the perceptions held about the effectiveness or otherwise, of changes made in general learning issues, curriculum development, course delivery and the evaluation of training.  An analysis of combined responses to like questions in both the Service and Academy questionnaires was also made.  Both Pre and Post Royal Commission perceptions, as recorded on a five point Likert scale were collected.  From the resulting mean difference scores potential change in the respondent's perception of the effectiveness of the changes made were determined.  The findings indicated that respondents perceived some improvement in the effectiveness of education, training and development Post the Wood Royal Commission.  There were some important findings related to: (a) perceived differences between the formal Academy recruit training and probationer practicum or field training; (b) the need for 'Professionalisation' Vs 'Craft' training; (c) leadership role models of learning and the creation of a learning culture and climate; (d) the role of knowledge management in intelligence-led and evidence-based policing; (e) the use of information technology and distance learning strategies; (f) the development of reflective practice and the gaining of lessons learnt from experience; (g) the provision of leadership development; (h) support for continuing professional development, as a part of fostering self-managed lifelong learning and, (i) the consistent Quality Assurance review of both the course curriculum and evaluation of training effectiveness at the Academy.

Although the limited ecological research to date indicates that the nearshore volumes of sandy beach systems may be as biologically productive as estuaries and wetlands, the management of sandy beaches has not been based on ecological or sustainability principles.  In this study, the principles and goals of ecologically sustainable development (ESD) are applied in investigations designed to develop improved ecological and recreational management of metropolitan sandy beach ecosystems, whereby ecological functions are maintained simultaneously with recreational and related uses.  The conventional view that sandy beaches are resilient to recreational use, and are more likely to be seriously impacted by other forms of human activity, seems to have precluded serious research investigation of questions such as: what are the responses of both beach biota and human users to environmental variables influencing the system; what are the simultaneous levels, distributions and diversity of beach biota in relation to levels, distributions and categories of beach users; and what ecological impacts are likely from human beach use on biota at points of interaction, temporally and spatially? From the first section of the project, it has been shown that our present understanding of the functions, processes and responses to human disturbances of sandy beach ecosystems is extremely poor, compared with that of rock platforms. New methodologies have been developed in the current study for experimental investigations into aspects of sandy beach ecology and recreational use which have never previously been considered. Relationships between environmental variables and categories of beach use have been quantified, and show promise for use in predictive modelling to guide management.  Current approaches to the management of sandy beaches and beach recreation, as aspects of environmental and coastal resource management, were then critically examined. The structures, functions and decision-making procedures of the major spheres of government, and their management agencies, were evaluated and found to provide inherent obstacles to effective ecological and recreational management of ecosystems. Coastal resource and beach management by public agencies were assessed for Durban and Sydney. Comparative analysis has provided information that can be used to develop guidelines for integrated ecologial and recreational management of sandy beach systems. In a synthesis of all of the above findings, a new procedural model has been constructed, for sustainable ecological and recreational management of sandy beach systems. This model is proposed as a framework for future integrated coastal resource research and management.

Modifying rivers has brought great benefit to communities, fulfilling important community goals - supporting profitable commercial activities and providing a basis for vibrant communities. However modifying rivers has also had negative consequences - in particular, a decline in the quality and quantity of water. These impacts have undermined valued aspects of rivers (such as fish habitat) and have also caused decline in commercial activities (such as fishing and floodplain grazing).  This thesis explores the ways that these contending perceptions of modification work out on the ground in rural communities. How are the benefits of modification recognised? How are the negative consequences of modification noticed and measured? Under what conditions are the benefits of modification reassessed? These are important questions in the current moment as our society reassesses the past modification of rivers and attempts to move towards more sustainable use of natural resources. This thesis explores this topic by undertaking in depth case-studies of two distinctive riverine environments: one coastal, the Clarence River in luscious coastal northern New South Wales; and one inland, the Balonne River, at the top of the Murray-Darling Basin, in semi-arid south-west Queensland. The case studies explore responses to modification of the rivers in two periods: the post-war decades - a time of widespread support for modification, and recent decades - a time of widespread recognition of the negative consequences of development. The thesis investigates perceptions of modification at three different scales: (i) groups within localities - the ways that modification is perceived by local groups with contrasting physical and conceptual interactions with the rivers (such as graziers, fishers, irrigators, Aboriginal people, ecologists and engineers); (ii) regional communities - which are constituted by groups with differing interests, and (iii) governments - which have the role of managing the long-term health of the economy and the environment, despite the long-term goals often being contested.  This thesis provides insights into the ways that our complex society grapples with the possibility, and effects, of modifying the natural environment. This thesis suggests that local conditions - the actual local physical environment and local social conditions - shape the ways that modification of rivers is supported, challenged and reassessed. However, both local social conditions and the environment are constantly changing, often in surprising ways. Therefore outcomes are always an interaction between different levels of interest groups and the environment itself.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rivers</field><field name="subject">Control</field><field name="subject">Change</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/300</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sustainable livelihoods approach and community development in practice in engineering organisations</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This thesis explored the limitations and challenges to a grassroots engineering non&#172;government organisation for the use of the sustainable livelihoods approach in a community development scenario. The sustainable livelihoods approach is a relatively new approach developed to address the failure of previous approaches to community development. Its key focuses are holistic, people-centred, dynamic and sustainable development, working with people's strengths and establishing macro-micro links. The role of engineering activities in community development is vital in the provision of technology and is visible across water, sanitation, energy, transport and telecommunications sectors. Again, however, community development activities in technology have not proven successful, thus the move towards the increasingly promoted approach of sustainable livelihoods. The major proponents of the sustainable livelihoods approach have developed many case studies and guidelines to address the contrasts in practice between sustainable livelihoods and current practice, common across many sectors including health, education and agriculture, to name a few. Such research into the contrasts and likeness of engineering practice in particular in community development through the sustainable livelihoods approach has not been explored. This research aims to address this gap. A case study of a Nepali engineering non-government organisation was used to explore these limitations and challenges to practice. Participatory methodologies were used to ensure that results and opportunities were identified from within the organisation itself. Data was collected through workshops, focus groups, interviews, surveys and overt observation. Cycles of systemic analyses were used to explore the problem situations for sustainable livelihoods practice as identified by the case study, and to develop systemically feasible and culturally desirable changes. Two approaches to these analyses, one based on logic, and the other based on culture, addressed the complexities characteristic of the community development and engineering sectors. Data was also collected from external stakeholders directly associated with the engineering activities of the case-study organisation to define the context for the research and verify that collected from the primary case-study organisation. The key findings of the data collection phase were seven problem areas for the organisation in the case study: providing community infrastructure and improving  livelihoods; adopting a sustainable livelihoods approach; meeting the need for community participation; monitoring and evaluation; developing partnerships; learning about sustainable livelihoods; and addressing the role of community technology.  Conceptual models were developed for analysis of the key problem situations. Systemic analyses of the key stakeholders, limitations, and the political and social contexts and the conceptual models identified the disparities between the ideal practice and the reality of practice for each problem situation. Whilst the research aimed to explore practice specifically for engineering, the majority of the results from the case study focused on changes for the early establishment of an organisation in the field of sustainable livelihoods. Key challenges for the grassroots organisation in the case study included limitations to the learning capacity of the organisation, imbalances of power with higher level partners, and, importantly, issues of risk and survival. Real and practical changes to the practice of community development organisations based on the case study included using more participatory methodologies, addressing scheduling issues, developing bottom-up activities and more effective partnerships with donors.  These were limitations general to non-sector-specific organisations. The research subsequently explored the challenges specific to engineering organisations in adopting the sustainable livelihoods approach. These focused on ensuring that engineering in community development incorporates not only the natural and non&#172;natural elements of intended community users but also the human elements. Five areas of practice were identified as being affected by the sustainable livelihoods approach, including the nature of technology, the processes for its development, the supporting role of national and international policies and standards, and the culture of engineering, specifically the role of engineering expertise and education. The opportunities in these areas of practice for sustainable livelihoods focused on ensuring a people-centred approach to engineering for community development. The research had implications for the practices of a variety of engineering organisations in the community development sector, including NGOs, standards organisations, legislative and regulatory bodies and educators. Again, these implications focused on ensuring that engineering in community development directly reflected the priorities, skills and dynamics of the intended community users.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">development</field><field name="subject">sustainable</field><field name="subject">community</field><field name="subject">Nepal</field><field name="subject">engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/301</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structural Evolution During the Preparation and Heating of Nanophase Zirconia Gels</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">The chemical preparation of ceramic materials has been widely studied over the past few decades, and provides the potential for excellent control over the microstructure and properties of the final product. This control is dependent on a comprehensive understanding of the microstructure and physical/chemical processes that occur at each stage. Aqueous routes have much potential for adoption by industry, but in many cases a comprehensive understanding of the microstructure and chemistry is lacking, partly due to the complicated aqueous chemistry of many transition-metals. This investigation has focussed on a specific inorganic, aqueous, sol-gel route for the preparation of pure zirconia (Zr02). Zirconia is a ceramic with a wide range of current and potential applications, such as catalysis, fuel-cells, coatings and biomaterials. The emphasis has been placed on the characterisation of the structure at each stage of the route, leading to an understanding of the various mechanisms that are at work. This project has also provided an opportunity to investigate broader issues concerning the solution-based processing of zirconia, particularly those involving the 'metastable' tetragonal phase. This phase is frequently observed to be formed by non-equilibrium methods, but the mechanisms of formation and de-stabilisation are not properly understood. The studied route consists of a number of stages: the preparation of an aqueous sol of 'zirconium hydroxide' particles by forced hydrolysis of a zirconyl nitrate solution; the conversion of the sol to a gel by removal of the aqueous phase; the conversion of the gel to a crystalline tetragonal zirconia powder by heating; and transformation of the tetragonal phase to the stable monoclinic phase with further treatment. At each stage of processing a number of aspects of the material structure have been investigated, including the short-range order, crystalline lattice parameters, particle packing, porosity, and speciation of the nitrate anion. This has required a wide range of complementary characterisation techniques, including Raman spectroscopy, XRD, TEM, DTA/TGA, SAXS, dynamic light scattering, EXAFS, NMR, and nitrogen sorption. The importance of techniques that allow changes in structure to be characterised in-situ during heating has been emphasised. The particles in the sol and gel are plate-shaped, approximately 0.5 nm thick and 3 - 4 nm across. They are composed of up to several stacked `sheets' of zirconium hydroxide, each of which is composed of zirconium atoms arranged in a regular square lattice, joined by double hydroxy-bridges. Detailed evidence for this structure has not been previously reported. The stages of decomposition of the precursor have been elucidated, including the stages at which oxolation and loss of nitrate occur. The complex crystallisation process at 450&#176;C has been investigated, and a structural mechanism for crystallisation of the 'metastable' tetragonal phase proposed, based on similarities between the tetragonal crystal structure and the disordered sheet structure in the amorphous material just prior to crystallisation. The crystalline material consists of nano-sized crystals, containing unusual intracrystalline mesopores. The lattice parameters of the tetragonal phase change with increasing heat treatment, with the unit-cell tetragonality (c/a) increasing from 1.017 to 1.020. This is a previously-unreported phenomenon which may be associated with the stability of the phase. The tetragonal phase transforms to the monoclinic phase after heating to a 'critical temperature' between 900 and 950&#176;C; this temperature is associated with the loss of residual surface nitrate species and/or a substantial increase in the mass diffusion rate. The crystal size and surface area has little influence on the tetragonal-to-monoclinic transformation, a result which is contrary to much previously-published work and that has significant implications for certain theories explaining the stability of the tetragonal phase. The transformation itself occurs during cooling, over a range between 400 and 100&#176;C, and has been studied in-situ by time-resolved Raman spectroscopy. The conclusions of this investigation contribute not only to the understanding of this particular route for processing zirconia, but also to a broader understanding of aqueous zirconium systems, the chemical processing of zirconia, and the tetragonal-to-monoclinic zirconia transformation mechanisms.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Zirconium oxide</field><field name="subject">Ceramics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/302</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re-conceptualising Competency-based Education and Training : with particular reference to education for occupations in Australia.</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">The thesis that emerges from the publications nominated for examination, is that a holistic or integrated competency based approach to vocational education and training (VET) and professional education (both initial and continuing) has many advantages over traditional approaches: * It provides a curriculum framework which links practice to theory in more coherent ways than currently exist; * It potentially provides a way of breaking the old dichotomy between 'knowing that' and 'knowing how' which has characterised Anglo-Saxon education and which has resulted in the belief that education which is practical is both different from and inferior to that which is abstract; * It provides the basis for teaching and learning approaches which could enhance students' adaptability and flexibility over their lives; * It has the potential for developing in occupational education more valid assessment strategies than those traditionally used and also for reducing the deleterious effects on learning of measurement-based assessment approaches. In summary, it is argued that the integrated approach to competency-based education provides a conceptual base for the competency movement and a promising direction for educational reform for all levels of occupational education. It is further argued that competency standards developed through an integrated approach can facilitate the implementation of a number of other areas of social and economic policy, such as the recognition of qualifications of overseas professionals in Australia, and the internationalisation of professional services.  Overview of the publications  The publications span a six-year period from 1990 to 1996. The first of them was written at a time when there was very little literature in the area (and virtually none in Australia) and when there was a great deal of confusion about the nature of competency, how to develop competency standards and the implications of the competency approach for education and training. What literature did exist, was mostly twenty years old and was largely a reaction against educational curricula which, it was felt, had failed to adequately prepare students for occupations or for life more generally. In place of a curriculum based on the acquisition of knowledge most of the critics suggested that curriculum should be based on an analysis of what people needed to do. Conceptually, as Wolf (1995) and others have pointed out, it was based on a niave reductionism arising out of behaviourist approaches to education. This approach was quite powerful for a brief period in the 1970s in teacher education programs in the United States. However the challenge to behaviourism from cognitive and humanist approaches to learning seemed to undermine the conceptual basis of the competency movement and very little was written about competency approaches until the late 1980s.  As Raven (1996) has recently pointed out, the literature on competency-based education which has appeared recently is also a reaction against 'something that is sensed to be wrong' (p.74). But what this is, what needs to be achieved and how this could be done is not clear. He suggests that the contemporary competency literature lacks a conceptual and analytical base and that there is little recognition of the need for a research program which develops a better understanding of the nature of competence, how it might be developed in individuals, how it might be assessed and what impact this would have on individuals, organisations and society generally. It is these issues that the publications submitted for examination have addressed. They have attempted to provide a conceptual base for competency-based education and a framework for how competency might be developed and assessed. Much of the recent literature in Australia has built on the approach which the publications originated.  The publications can be divided into those dealing with the nature of competency, particularly the integrated model, (a, b, d, e) those dealing with curriculum and teaching issues (b, j) and those dealing with assessment of competence (c, f, h, i, k). The theme which unites them, is the integrated approach to competency and its capacity to provide a coherent framework for improved educational practices in all occupational education. Another possible way of categorising the publications would be by educational level. For reasons associated with the traditional division of labour in our workforces we tend to think about the differences between educational levels rather than the similarities. It is usual to think about higher education for example, even when it prepares people for occupations, as substantially different from other occupational education. This is underlined by the fact that there is no term, in common usage, to encompass both what is currently referred to as middle level or vocational education, and education for the professions. Despite its specific nature, professional education is often identified with academic and general education, while vocational education is identified with practical education and is assumed to be devoid of substantial theoretical content. In fact much of higher education for the professions is practical and much vocational education is grounded in theory, even if it is not always made explicit. A conclusion which I believe can be drawn from these publications as a whole is that the difference between higher education for the professions and vocational education for middle level occupations is one of degree rather than one of kind. Obviously most professional work is more complex than work at, say, trades level. But it is better to conceptualise these levels on a continuum rather than to see them as essentially different. There will be many instances when professionals need to do things which are routine where simple competencies are used. Conversely many tradespeople will need to use complex combinations of competencies to solve challenging problems. Hence, it is not useful to divide the publications into those dealing specifically with the professions (of which there are six- a, b, c, d, g, i) and those dealing with issues relevant to all sectors of education (of which there are five- e, f, h, j, k). What the publications have to say about the nature of competency, how to develop competency through curricula and teaching and how to assess it, is broadly applicable to all occupational education irrespective of the context in which it is discussed.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Competency based education</field><field name="subject">Vocational education</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/303</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The lived experience of laterlife computer learners</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">Older adults of the 21st century have not grown up with information and communication technology and may not have used computers in their working lives. However, they have experienced the many technological changes of the 20th century. Some changes have fundamentally altered communication, entertainment, and the kinds of knowledge and skills that are sought and valued. These changes are difficult to ignore because of their pervasiveness. In order to actively participate in their lifeworlds older adults face an imperative to adapt and meet new challenges.  The purpose of this research was to investigate and interpret the lived experience of laterlife computer learners in non-formal learning environments. The research focused on the interpretation and understanding of the learning experience from the perspective of participants. Hence there is an ontological thread that is grounded in the lifeworld of older adults in Sydney, Australia. A hermeneutic phenomenological methodology was considered suitable because of its emphasis on understanding the lived experience of humans. A qualitative method was used in this study because it enabled existential insights into the learning experience from the perspective of learners and privileged their voices.  Fourteen older adults volunteered to participate and were interviewed. Participants identified themselves as laterlife beginning computer learners. Interviews were audio-taped and analysed using an interpretative case study approach. Other analytic tools used were grounded theory, thematic analysis and narrative inquiry. Existential themes were identified and interpreted within a framework of wellbeing.  The research found that participants engaged in learning optimistically and that they believed in their abilities and also in the worth of the learning they were undertaking. The learners believed the outcomes from learning would lead to greater opportunity for participation in their lifeworld. Without computer skills and knowledge they believed they would be ignored and relegated to a peripheral position as observers in their lifeworld. By undertaking learning they believed they were taking control of their current and future lives, acting in defiance of developmental theories that suggested ageing was a stage of life and not a process. However, the sense of agency and purpose was not without its pressures and hurdles and learning was perceived to be difficult, dynamic, frustrating and immensely satisfying. Their purposes and expectations were situated in the changing nature of the world and a desire to continue to live their lives authentically, as participants and not spectators. Laterlife computer learners in this study were seen to be learning and growing their lives into a future of their making.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">aging</field><field name="subject">older people</field><field name="subject">computers</field><field name="subject">continuing education</field><field name="subject">interviews</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/304</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Variability in the Precision of Acupoint Location Methods</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">The ability to precisely locate appropriate acupoints is, according to both traditional and contemporary theories, essential to deliver acupuncture treatments. More than half of the acupoints defined in acupuncture literature are sufficiently distant to anatomical landmarks, to require the use of specialised techniques in order to locate them. However no research has been conducted to investigate the precision of any manual method (electrical detection is discussed at detail with reference to numerous conflicting research papers).  This thesis details the design, conduct and results of experimentation carried out to measure the precision of four methods (named the directional, proportional, elastic and ruler methods) used to locate acupoints. The methods include two based upon the traditional Chinese anatomical unit of measurement, the cun, and two based upon the traditionally reported lengths of areas of the human body. The reasons for selecting these methods, and for excluding others, are explained.  Seventy two subjects were involved in testing the precision of the four methods by applying them when locating a fictitious acupoint. The subjects marked the attempts to locate the fictitious acupoint with invisible ink. The marks were transferred to plastic films and measurements made from reference points.  A significant difference was found between the methods (F3,120 = 11.74, p less than 0.0001). No significant difference was found between the two traditional methods of point location (directional mean = 11.35, and proportional mean = 11.17) (p less than 0.998), nor between the two variant methods of point location (elastic mean = 7.63, and ruler mean = 6.34) (p less than 0.68). Significant differences were found between the two traditional methods and the two variant methods. The directional method was less precise than both the elastic method (F3,120 = 11.74, p less than 0.007) and the ruler method (p less than 0.00009). The proportional method was also less precise than both the elastic method (F3,120 = 11.74, p less than 0.011) and the ruler method (p less than 0.0002).  Each subject also completed a short questionnaire regarding ease and comfort of use of the four methods. The two more precise methods were generally not well received by subjects in this study. Their two primary concerns were not with precision, but rather of application of the method, and its perceived appearance to patients.  An analysis was also carried out to describe any variation in acupoint location descriptions reported by prominent authors. 151 clinical research papers reporting acupuncture studies were selected according to a number of criteria. The five most frequently prescribed acupoints in these papers comprised the sample used in the examination of seven acupuncture texts. Variability was found between the texts, and is discussed in consideration of the presently poor understanding of the anatomical make-up of an acupoint.  Also examined was the usefulness of measures of sensitivity to palpation used when locating acupoints. No statistically significant difference was found between any of the acupoints tested and the related control points.  The thesis discusses the implications for acupuncture practice, research and education in light of the lack of precision measured, the subjects' preference for the more imprecise methods, the inability to locate or even verify the location of an acupoint using pressure, variability in reported acupoint locations between reference texts, and the related short-comings in published acupuncture research.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Acupuncture points.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/305</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Class and Object Modularity Description and Measurement</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">Software measurement has been of interest to software engineers for almost as long as software has been developed. While the evolution of systematic processes of software development has seen a trend away from reliance on the expertise of individual software developers alone to ensure software quality, systematic processes of software measure development have not evolved to a similar extent. The problem with defining software measures according to an informal process is that the quality of measures can be highly dependent on the expertise of the individual measure developers. If a systematic process of software measure development were defined, that promoted transparency and objectivity in measure development, then this systematic process could support the development of high quality measures by less expert users. In this thesis, a systematic process of software descriptive measure development is described and demonstrated. The approach taken to defining this systematic process is to investigate the various processes by which currently available software descriptive measures have been developed. These processes are then amalgamated with an established systematic method of measure development used in the field of social science. Applying the stages of measure development thus identified to the task of developing measures to describe C++ class and object modularity tests the feasibility of this measure development process. Insights gained through this testing provide feedback to further refine the process. In this way, a systematic process of descriptive software measure development is defined alongside the definition of a set of measures that provide a detailed description of the complex software characteristic of modularity. The products of each stage of this measure development process assist a user to validate the measures with respect to an intended application, and to analyse and interpret the measurement data obtained by applying the measures to a software system. This is demonstrated in a case study that also provides an indirect indication of the quality of the process by which the measures were developed. The major contribution of this work is the systematic process of descriptive software measure development, as it has a wide application and can be used to develop measures to describe many software characteristics of interest. A second important contribution is made by the set of measures of C++ class and object modularity developed to demonstrate this systematic descriptive measure development process.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Software</field><field name="subject">Measurement</field><field name="subject">Quality</field><field name="subject">Object Oriented Methods</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/306</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In Vitro Regulation of Growth, Differentiation and Survival of Leukemic CD5+ B Cells</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) is a hematologic neoplasm characterised by the proliferation and accumulation of sIgM+/D+ B cells that fail to progress to the final stages of B cell development. The malignant cells in B-CLL also express the pan-T cell antigen CD5, suggesting that CLL is a malignancy of the CD5+ subset of B cells. Additional characteristics of the malignant clone include a low proliferative index, enhanced in vivo survival and constitutive expression of the anti-apoptosis oncoprotein bcl-2. The behaviour of leukemic CD5 B cells in vitro contrasts their arrested in vivo state. That is, despite the majority of cells being arrested in the G0 phase of the cell cycle, the leukemic B cells are not irreversibly frozen as they can be induced to differentiate to Ig-secreting cells under appropriate in vitro conditions. Furthermore, leukemic CD5 B cells rapidly undergo death by apoptosis following in vitro culture. This thesis describes the requirements for in vitro activation of leukemic CD5+ B cells, the characterisation of the events involved in apoptosis of these cells as well as the identification of various growth factors capable of modulating these events. Stimulation of unfractionated peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) from three patients with B-CLL with the phorbol ester PMA and the mitogens PHA and PWM resulted in significant increases in cell proliferation, RNA synthesis and 1gM secretion when compared to unstimulated cell populations. PMA was the most potent inducer of 1gM secretion and this occurred irrespective of the presence of residual T cells. PMA-induced proliferation and RNA synthesis were also independent of T cells. However, in the presence of T cells, these parameters of cellular activation were enhanced during in vitro culture. Thus, the inductive ability of PMA on leukemic CD5 B cells was independent of T cells. In contrast, activation and differentiation of the leukemic CD5 B cells into 1gM-secreting cells following culture with mitogens did not occur in the absence of T cells. Interestingly, co-stimulation of leukemic CD5+ B cells with PMA and anti-Ig induced cellular responses that exceeded those induced by either activator alone. Thus, leukemic CD5+ B cells from patients with B-CLL can be activated in vitro and differentiate in response to stimulation via both T cell-dependent and T cell-independent mechanisms. Apoptotic cell death was characterised in purified leukemic CD5 B cells obtained from six B-CLL patients. All leukemic CD5 B cell populations entered an apoptotic pathway in vitro as evidenced by a reduction in cell size, loss of cell viability and fragmentation of DNA into multimers of  -180 base pairs. Following 24 hours of in vitro culture 24.0&#177;16% of DNA was fragmented. After 8 days, the majority of DNA was fragmented, and fewer than 10% of cultured cells were viable. Examination of bcl-2 expression in the malignant B cells by flow cytometry revealed a unimodal pattern of expression in greater than 85% of cells from each B-CLL patient prior to culture. During in vitro culture, bcl-2 expression became bimodal such that the B cells displayed a bcl-2hjgh and bcl-2iow phenotype. The level of expression by the bCl2hjgh cells was similar to that observed prior to in vitro culture, indicating that bcl-2 is down-regulated in apoptosing cells. Interestingly, despite this downregulation, the overall number of cells positive for bcl-2 remained constant. This suggests that the enhanced survival of leukemic CD5+ B cells in vivo is mediated by the sustained expression of bcl-2 and that additional mechanisms exist capable of overriding the protective effect of bcl-2 when bcl-2 is present at reduced levels. Leukemic B cell apoptosis has previously been reported to be delayed or prevented by IL-4, IFN-y and IFN-a. These results were confirmed in this study where it was found that culture of leukemic CD5 B cells with IL-4 or IFN-y enhanced cell viability and delayed apoptosis in 6/6 and 5/6 populations of leukemic B cells, respectively. This function was also found to be shared by IL-2, IL-6, IL-13 and TNF-a as these cytokines enhanced cell viability and delayed apoptosis in some of the cell populations examined at a level similar to that observed for IL-4 and IFN-y. These cytokines may mediate their effect via the expression of bcl2 as culture in the presence of IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-13, IFN-y or TNF-a resulted in a higher percentage of cells displaying the bcl-2high phenotype, compared to unstimulated cells. Taken together, these results suggest that autocrine and/or paracrine growth loops may play a role in the pathogenesis of B-CLL and that cytokines that prevent apoptosis in vitro may be targets for treatment of this B cell malignancy.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Differentiation</field><field name="subject">B Cells</field><field name="subject">Chronic lymphocytic leukemia</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/307</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Practitioner Researcher perspective on facilitating an open, infinite, chaordic simulation. Learning to Engage with Theory while Putting Myself Into Practice</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This thesis investigates two intertwined themes. The first concerns the development of a framework for understanding, and making appropriate use of, simulations and games as tools for learning. The second concerns the utilisation of the term PractitionerResearcher to reflect the unity of practice and research activity in creating 'working knowledge' (Symes 2000). These themes are intertwined in the sense that the route I take to understanding simulations and games is through the stance of a PractitionerResearcher. Conversely the thesis aims to draw out what it means to be a PractitionerResearcher through my engagement as a facilitator of simulations and games. I argue that the knowledge I generate as a PractitionerResearcher is utilitarian and pragmatic.  Grounded in my practice as an adult educator it utilises theoretical perspectives chosen for immediate relevance rather than because of any claims to 'truth' or permanence. Understanding how this shapes and influences my practice was a complex, difficult process. Using an auto-ethnographic approach, Chapter 1 outlines the development of my 'working knowledge' as a PractitionerResearcher. It draws on selected personal experiences in my work as an adult educator using simulations and games for teaching and learning. While curiosity about historical facts initiated the research reported in Chapter 2, the chapter focuses on uses of historical precedent for generating greater understanding, and acceptance by participants, of simulations and games as teaching/learning strategies. It identifies a range of contributions - from war games, religious games, and children's play - to the structuring of modern educational simulations and games. Chapter 3 explores approaches to classifying simulations and games. Its development brought a gradual realisation of the futility of trying to establish a single definitive categorisation system for all simulations and games. Understanding how they can be arranged in a variety of different relationships provides a better insight into their general features and helps in making decisions about when and how to use specific activities. One outcome of the work for this chapter was the realisation of some simulations as 'open and infinite' in nature, and that XB - simulation of importance in my practice - is such a simulation. Chapter 4 uses concepts developed in the field of chaos theory to illustrate how certain simulations create messy but 'chaordic' (Hock 2002) rather than dis-orderly learning contexts. 'Chaos/chaotic' once meant only dis-order, 'messiness' and unpredictability. Twentieth century scientific discoveries illustrate that order is concealed within 'chaos' producing richly complex patterns when viewed from the right perspective. I argue that 'chaos' concepts can be usefully applied to open and infinite simulations to demonstrate how they are similarly 'chaordic'. XB (for eXperience Based learning) is an open, infinite chaordic simulation, and has been a driving force in my practice for six years. The case study in Chapter 5 introduces the 'world according to XB' and takes the reader 'inside' participants' experiences as the unfolding nature of their learning is revealed in the way they apply theories of organisational behaviour to immediate behaviours. Chapter 6 reflects on my experiences of facilitating XB, via a review of interactions with some past XB participants. The influence of such a learning process on my practice is analysed. The emotional impact of these interactions has brought a better understanding of my own practice, and the chapter considers the concept of 'dispassionate reflexivity' as an aid for the facilitator in such contexts. Chapter 7 examines the evolution and distinctive features of the PractitionerResearcher in more detail. As an educator, a consistent focus of my work has been simultaneously 'to know more' and 'to be able to do better' - and it is the interdependence of these that lies at the heart of what it means to be a PractitionerResearcher. It is my hope that this thesis offers a solution for practitioners wanting to combine 'research' and 'practice' into a practical and scientifically rigorous 'whole'. For such professionals the PractitionerResearcher model offers an integrated approach, combining and validating 'learning in action' and 'learning for action'.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Practitioner</field><field name="subject">Researcher</field><field name="subject">Experiential learning</field><field name="subject">Educational games</field><field name="subject">Simulation games</field><field name="subject">Working knowledge</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/308</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Theorising information use: managers and their work</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">The focus of this thesis is information use. Although a key concept in information behaviour, information use has received little attention from information science researchers. Studies of other key concepts such as information need and informationseeking are dominant in information behaviour research. Information use is an area of interest to information professionals who rely on research outcomes to shape their practice. There are few empirical studies of how people actually use information that might guide and refine the development of information systems, products and services.  The thesis begins to address this imbalance in information behaviour research by exploring the concept of information use through an empirical study. Fifteen senior managers from two organisations in the cultural industries sector participated in the study. Analysis of interviews revealed that the managers understood and experienced information use in five different ways: as information packaging; as information flow; as developing new knowledge and insights; as shaping judgements and decisions; and as influencing others.  These five different ways of experiencing information use are related in a hierarchy that reflects three different views of information: as an object; as a construct; and as a transformative force. Embedded in the hierarchy are different relations between people and information in their work environments, different processes of information use and different criteria for determining the quality of information that is used.  The thesis demonstrates that the concept of information use can be explored empirically using phenomenography as the research approach. This approach, which originated in the field of education, has been used infrequently in information behaviour research. It offers potential for the further exploration of not only information use but also other concepts germane to information behaviour. The thesis highlights the richness of peoples' experiences of information use and points to some directions that might be taken by practitioners in developing information systems, products and services to support people as they 'go about their business'.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Information resources management</field><field name="subject">Corporations</field><field name="subject">Information services</field><field name="subject">Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/309</field></doc><doc><field name="title">History in Australian popular culture : 1972-1995</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">As cultural studies has consolidated its claim to constitute a distinct field of study in recent years, debate has intensified about its characteristic objects, concepts and methods, if any, and, therefore, its relationship to traditional disciplines in the Humanities and Social Sciences. In History in Australian Popular Culture 1972-1995, I focus on an intersection of cultural studies with history. However, I do not debate the competing claims of 'history' and 'cultural studies' as academic projects. Rather, I examine the role played by historical discourse in popular cultural practices, and how those practices contest and modify public debate about history; I take 'historical discourse' to include argument about as well as representation of the past, and so to involve a rhetorical dimension of desire and suasive force that varies according to social contexts of usage. Therefore, in this thesis I do cultural studies empirically by asking what people say and do in the name of history in everyday contexts of work and leisure, and what is at stake in public as well as academic 'theoretical' discussion of the meaning and value of history for Australians today. Taking tourism and television ('public culture') as my major research fields, I argue that far from abolishing historical consciousness -- as the 'mass' dimension of popular culture is so often said to do -- these distinct but globally interlocking cultural industries have emerged in Australian conditions as major sites of historical contestation and pedagogy. Tourism and television are, of course, trans-national industries which impact on the living-space (and time) of local communities and blur the national boundaries so often taken to define the coherence of both 'history' and 'culture' in the modern period. I argue, however, that the historical import of these industries includes the use of the social and cultural spaces they make available by people seeking to publicise their own arguments with the past, their criticisms of the present, and their projects for the future; this usage is what I call 'popular culture', and it can include properly historical criticism of the power of tourism and television to disrupt or destroy a particular community's sense of its past. From this it follows that in this thesis I defend cultural studies as a practice which, far from participating in a 'death' or 'killing' of history, is capable of accounting in specific ways for the liveliness of historical debate in Australia today.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Popular culture</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">History</field><field name="subject">Civilization</field><field name="subject">20th century</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/310</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of a program implemented to reduce surgical wound infection in an acute care hospital in India: A clinical practice improvement project</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This research project investigated the impact of an action research intervention implemented to reducing surgical wound infection in one of the acute care hospitals in India. The study aimed to develop and implement a clinical practice improvement program in reducing surgical wound infection by improving the hand washing and wound dressing practices of nurses. The study also aimed to identify the important contributing factors to a model that predicts surgical wound infection. Pre-post evaluation measures were taken to compare the results of surgical wound infection rate before and after the implementation of the intervention. Surgical wounds of two thousand patients (one thousand before the intervention and another one thousand after) were assessed to determine the wound infection rate and severity of wound infection. The hand washing and wound dressing practices of forty nurses were observed. These same nurses were involved in the intervention using a participatory action research process. The results of the study suggest that there was a marked, significant reduction in the rate and severity of wound infection following the implementation of the intervention. By increasing the hand washing facilities in the ward, educating nurses on the importance of better hygiene, pre-operative shaving and post-operative wound care, the hand washing and wound dressing practices of nurses improved considerably. These improvements resulted in a reduction in the number and severity of patients' surgical wound infections. The study also examined the contribution of different factors to surgical wound infection in a Indian hospital. Significant predictive factors were the patients' age, longer pre-operative hospital stay, extended pre-operative shaving time before surgery, wound class, and co-morbidity of the patient. The identification of risk factors that contributed to increased surgical wound infection for example pre-operative skin preparation, pre-operative hospital stay of the patient would help in taking appropriate measures at the ward level and organisation as a whole. Nosocomial infections extends to an unnecessary lengthy hospital stay, additional treatment increased mortality and morbidity, and increased cost to the patients and the nation as a whole. This project proved that educational mentoring, data surveillance processes and involving the nurses in an action research process were effective in enabling participants to improve their clinical practice and thereby reduce the incidence of patients' surgical wound infections. Establishing infection control teams, ongoing surveillance and feedback to staff of nosocomial infection rates is an urgent need in all Indian hospitals. Organisational management, as a priority, need to provide funding and staff dedicated to undertaking this essential work. Health care professionals can no longer plead ignorance of a situation for which all have a moral and professional responsibility.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hospitals.</field><field name="subject">India.</field><field name="subject">Clinical practice.</field><field name="subject">Surgical wound infections.</field><field name="subject">Nosocomial infections.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/311</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Language diversity and linguistic identity in Brittany: a critical analysis of the changing practice of Breton</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This thesis explores the ways in which linguistic diversity is represented, articulated and theorised in the context of the promotion of Breton, a minority or lesser-used language spoken in the region of Brittany in western France. In doing so it seeks to provide a critical analysis of the changing practice of Breton and the different ways in which the language is mobilised as a vehicle for personal and collective identity. It provides a historical reading of the development of a sense of Breton identity through the language, locating the changing practice of Breton, particularly following the revival movement that began in the 1960s, in a socio-political and socio-cultural context.  In tracking these functional and symbolic transformations of Breton, the thesis takes a theoretical approach that can broadly be described as belonging to the discipline of critical language studies. Working from this critical perspective, it explores the way different language ideologies frame issues of linguistic diversity and examines the way notions of language, linguistic diversity and identity are epistemologically constructed. In doing so it argues the need for greater critical awareness of the effects these ideologies may have on diversity, with a view to developing more effective ways of promoting diverse language practices and linguistic identities in Brittany.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">diversity</field><field name="subject">Brittany</field><field name="subject">language</field><field name="subject">Breton</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="subject">identity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/312</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship of pedagogy and students' understanding of environment in environmental education</field><field name="creator">Loughland, Anthony Francis.</field><field name="description">Environmental education is a relatively young area that can trace its roots back to the global environmental crises of the late 1960s and 1970s. Research in environmental education since this time has established the justification for its existence in the formal curriculum of schools. Less research has been conducted on the actual pedagogy of environmental education. This forms one part of the justification for this research study. The other justification for this research study is school students' objectification of the environment evidenced from the findings of a large survey of NSW school students. The objectification of the environment finding referred to students' responses that suggested that the environment was separate from them in contrast to a minority of students' responses that referred to a relational view (Loughland, Reid, Walker &amp; Petocz, 2003). The two foci of pedagogy and students' understandings of the environment come together in the research question of this thesis, what is the relation between pedagogy and representations of the environment in environmental education?  A Bernsteinian model of pedagogy, the pedagogical device, underpins the theoretical analysis of the pedagogy of environmental education in this study (Bernstein, 1990). A particular aspect of this device, the pedagogic recontextualising field, is used as a framework of analysis for the exposition of the major influences on the development of pedagogy of environmental education in NSW. Another theory of pedagogy, the NSW Quality Teaching Framework, is used to offer a performative angle on pedagogy to provide theoretical triangulation for the study.  The pedagogy of environmental education was examined through a classroom ethnography with the researcher acting as a participant observer. The data were in the form of field notes, curriculum materials including children's literature, transcripts of classroom learning and products of students' learning. The analysis of the data was conducted using a variety of methods of analysis. The data were initially coded for themes that were the different representations of the environment in the pedagogy of this classroom. Further, the NSW Quality Teaching Framework (NSW DET 2003) was used as a theoretical framework of analysis in order to examine the data from the perspective of student performance in relation to current understandings of what constitutes good pedagogical practice. Next, Bernstein's model of the pedagogic device (1990) was used to analyse the data in the larger context of the social construction of knowledge in the school curriculum. This analysis incorporated  Bernstein's original notions of pedagogical classification and framing (1971). This study has two main findings. First, the pedagogy of environmental education has strong classification and framing (after Bernstein 1971) that supports the objectification of the environment. Second, there is also some weak framing of the pedagogy of environmental education that generally does not support the objectification of the environment. The implications for these findings for practice are that environmental educators should be aware of deterministic curriculum that seeks to impose one view of the environment onto students. This curriculum positions the environment as an object that needs to be saved through human intervention. Further research into the pedagogy of environmental education that explores the relation of students' understandings of the environment and their relation to the epistemological and theoretical bases of pedagogy is warranted as a result of this study.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">environmental</field><field name="subject">pedagogy</field><field name="subject">Bernsteinian</field><field name="subject">model</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/313</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Strangers in a Strange Land: The 1868 Aborigines and other Indigenous Performers in Mid-Victorian Britain</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">Enshrined by cricket history, the 1868 Aboriginal cricket tour of England has become popularly established as a uniquely benign public transaction in the history of contact between Aborigines, pastoralist settlers and British colonialism. Embraced by two Australian Prime Ministers and celebrated by a commemorative Aboriginal tour, film documentaries, museum displays, poetry, creative fiction, sporting histories, special edition prints and a national advertising campaign for the centenary of Australian federation, the zeal for commemoration has overwhelmed critical enquiry. Incorporating some critical interpretations of the tour which are current in Aboriginal discourse, this re-examination subjects the tour to approaches commonly applied to other aspects of Aboriginal history and relations between colonialism and indigenous peoples. Although it is misleadingly understood simply as a cricket tour, the primitivist displays of Aboriginal weaponry during the 1868 Aboriginal tour of Britain were more appealing to spectators than their cricketing displays. Viewed solely within the prism of sport or against policies leading to extermination, dispersal and segregation of Aborigines, there is little basis for comparative analysis of the tour. But when it is considered in the context of displays of race and commodified exhibitions of primitive peoples and cultures, particularly those taken from peripheries to the centre of empire, it is no longer unique or inexplicable either as a form of cultural display, a set of inter-racial relations, or a complex of indigenous problems and opportunities. This study re-examines the tour as a part of European racial ideology and established practices of bringing exotic races to Britain for sporting, scientific and popular forms of display. It considers the options and actions of the Aboriginal performers in the light of power relations between colonial settlers and dispossessed indigenous peoples. Their lives are examined as a specific form of indentured labour subjected to time discipline, racial expectations of white audiences and managerial control by enterpreneuurs seeking to profit from the novelty of Aborigines in Britain. Comparative studies of Maori and Native American performers taken to Britain in the mid&#172;Victorian era flesh out sparse documentation of the Aboriginal experience in an alien environment. Elements of James Scott's methodology of hidden and public transcripts are utilised to identify the sources of concealed tensions and discontents. A detailed study of the two best known 1868 tourists, Dick-a-Dick and Johnny Mullagh, considers two strategies by which Aborigines confronted by a situation of acute disadvantage used their developed performance skills and knowledge of European racial preconceptions in partially successful attempts to satisfy their emotional and material needs and further Aboriginal goals. Finally, the disjunctions between commemoration and critical history are resolved by suggesting that the 1868 tour and its performers deserve to be commemorated as pioneers in the practice of recontextualisng and popularising Aboriginal culture in the western metropolis.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Great Britain</field><field name="subject">19th Century</field><field name="subject">History</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/314</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Space Efficient Visualisation of Large Hierarchies</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">Relational information visualisation concerns viewing relational data, where the underlying data model is a graph. Hierarchical visualisation is one of hot topics in graph visualisation in which the data is organised in a hierarchical structure. As the amount of information, that we want to visualise, becomes larger and the relations become more complex, classical visualisation techniques and hierarchical drawing methods tend to be inadequate.Traditional hierarchical visualisation algorithms are more concerned with the readability of the layouts. They usually do not consider the efficient utilisation of the geometrical plane for the drawings. Therefore, for most hierarchical layouts, a large portion of display space is wasted as background. The aim of this research is to investigate a space-efficient approach to handle the visualisation of large hierarchies in two-dimensional spaces. This thesis introduces a new graph visualisation approach called enclosure+ connection for visualizing large hierarchies. This approach maximises the space utilisation by taking advantages of the traditional enclosure partitioning approach, while it retains the display of a traditional node-link diagram to hopefully provide users a direct perception of relational structures. The main contribution of this thesis is layout and navigation algorithms for visualising large hierarchies. Two layout algorithms, the space-optimised tree and the EncCon tree, have been developed to achieve the space-efficient visualisation. Both algorithms use the enclosure concept to define layout of hierarchies, which ensure the efficient utilisation of display space. Two focus+context navigation and interaction methods have been proposed to cooperate with the visualization of large hierarchies. Several advanced computer graphics approaches, such as graphic distortion and transparency, are used for the development of these navigation methods.  Two case studies have been implemented to evaluate the layout algorithms and the associated navigation methods. The first case study is an application of a shared collaborative workspace which aims to provide users with a better assistance for visual manipulation and navigation of knowledge-based information. The second case study is a visual browser for navigating large-scale online product catalogues.  Although the case studies have provided some useful evaluation, formal usability studies would be required to justify fully the effectiveness of these layout and navigation methods. Although this task has not carried out in this research, the author has presented his usability study's plan as a future work.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Visualisation</field><field name="subject">Trees (graph theory)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/315</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Not Quite/ Just the Same/ Different: the Construction of Identity in Vietnamese War Orphans Adopted by White Parents</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">Global diasporas caused by wars carry many streams of people - in the 1970s one of these streams contained orphans from Vietnam delivered to white parents in the West.  On arrival, the social expectation was that these children would blend seamlessly into the culture of their adoptive parents.  Now some adoptees, as adults, reflect on their lives as 'Asian' or racially 'Other' children in white societies, charting the critical points in their maturation.  This thesis interrogates their life histories to explore the role of birth-culture in the self-definition of people removed from that culture at birth or in childhood.  Thirteen adult adopted Vietnamese participants were interviewed.  These interviews provided qualitative data on issues of racial and cultural identity.  These data were developed and analysed, using a framework drawn from symbolic interactionism and cultural studies, in order to reveal the interpersonal dynamics in which people were involved, and the broader cultural relations that sustained them.  The findings reveal that in early childhood the adopted Vietnamese identity process was shaped by a series of identifications with, and affirmations of, sharing their adoptive parents racial and cultural identity.  Such identifications were then challenged once the adoptees entered society and were seen by others as different.  The participants' attempts to locate a secure sense of self and identity within the world they are placed in are disturbed by numerous uncertainties surrounding racial and cultural difference.  One of the most crucial uncertainties is the adopted Vietnamese knowledge about their cultural background.  While most felt they lacked positive knowledge about Vietnam and racial diversity, their sense of identity was unsettled by experiences with racism and negative cultural stereotypes throughout their late childhood to adolescence.  As their recognition and acceptance of their difference develops in adulthood, they experience a degree of empowerment due to their being able to access more knowledge about their cultural background and a greater appreciation of racial diversity.  Many participants have formed closer ties with other people born in Vietnam, most notably other adoptees; most returned to visit Vietnam.  The thesis concludes that those adoptees who were able to develop an understanding of the Vietnamese and other backgrounds to their complex identities, tended to be more integrated as adults than those who either rejected or were unable to come to terms with their Vietnamese ancestry.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Multiculturalism</field><field name="subject">Social inquiry</field><field name="subject">Vietnam</field><field name="subject">Adoption</field><field name="subject">Cultural identity</field><field name="subject">Asia</field><field name="subject">Cultural adaptation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/316</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Learning and Teaching Mathematics: Interpreting Student Teachers' Voices</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This research study has investigated the beliefs that prospective primary school teachers hold about the epistemology of mathematics, and the teaching and learning of mathematics. In particular, it considered the following questions: *       What beliefs and attitudes about mathematics and mathematics education do first year primary school student teachers bring into their tertiary education? *       Are any of the students' beliefs about mathematics and mathematics education similar to the beliefs of the teacher educators in mathematics education and how do students interact with first year mathematics education subjects in the teacher education course? *       How do students' attitudes and beliefs influence their success in learning new mathematics at this stage of their lives? *       How do students' beliefs and attitudes affect their ideas on good practice in the teaching of mathematics in the primary school? The research design was qualitative, using a case study investigation of 50 students in their first year of a teacher education course. The students' passage through the first year mathematics education subjects provided valuable insights into their beliefs, principally by means of interviews and open-ended questionnaires. The study was designed to have pedagogical outcomes for the students, by embedding the collection and interpretation of data in the teaching and learning of their course. My personal perspective throughout this research has been that mathematics is a socio&#172;cultural phenomenon, and that the learning of mathematics is achieved through the mediation of language, social interaction and culture. This perspective of mathematics and the learning of mathematics has influenced the choice of methodology and the research questions asked. Results indicated that students often held two or more philosophies of mathematics and moved between these philosophies, depending on context. Further, students generally considered that the characteristics of a good teacher included being supportive and enthusiastic. Good pedagogy was believed to incorporate practical activities demonstrating relevance, and providing 'fun' for pupils. However, an alarming result was that having higher order knowledge about mathematics was often seen by the students as being a disadvantage for a teacher, principally because students believed such teachers would be less empathetic to struggling pupils. These beliefs affected students' interactions with the first year university mathematics education subjects, as their beliefs about the importance of subject matter knowledge were at variance with the beliefs of the teacher educators. This dissonance led to devaluing of the mathematics education subjects by some of the students. The study has led to the conclusion that a number of the students' beliefs about mathematics, and the teaching and learning of mathematics, should not be left unchallenged. Those beliefs dealing with ideas on good pedagogy should be strengthened, while beliefs about the nature of mathematics and the value of subject matter knowledge should be made more transparent and addressed. On the other side of the coin, teacher educators need to acknowledge the differences in the beliefs that student teachers and teacher educators might hold, and to consider ways of making mathematics education courses more relevant and meaningful for students.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mathematics</field><field name="subject">Study and Teaching (Primary)</field><field name="subject">Mathematics Teachers Training</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/317</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Fantasy of Exile : Some reflections on the margins of the 'Unhomely Consciousness'</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This thesis is about exile, but exile of a particular nature. I take the term exile discursively and textually, with no particular regard to historical specificities it may offer. In this sense I intend to use the concrete to render the abstract, working backwards from the historically and generally recognised condition of exile - the relegated, the diasporic - to its discursive relocation in various forms of narrative, reflection and representation. In this the measure of the exile will be the continuities re d discontinuities of the discourses of its location.  The thesis will argue that the exilic subject - that is, the subject of modern consciousness - is the product of a certain fantasy formation of a subjective homeland projected onto the various margins of discourse, history and geography. This fantasy leads to a fascination and identification of things perceived at the margins or the bounds of a psychopathological homeland, rendering the homeland itself the site of alienation. The thesis argues against the positioning of the subject as alienated 'lack' in favour of a subjective and representative plenitude. The thesis will look to various discourses alienation and ideology, with a particular focus on the philosophy of reflection, phenomenology and psychoanalytic theory (the philosophy of the 'unreflected') to trace a sort of exilic affectability that inheres in the representation of the modern subject.  The introductory chapter 'Parenthesis' picks at the relation between the discourses of post-structuralist and post-colonial theory, looking to their fascination with the margins and positing a certain intellectual and political tendency to fantasy. Chapters One and Two explore the problem of representation in these discourses with particular emphasis on the disposition of the subject and its relation to its own reading or metaphysical positioning, taking as its metaphor the representation: relation between the map and the territory. Chapters Three and Four look to the ontogenesis of the subject of exile and its reflective and metaphysical positioning in representation. Chapter Five closes the thesis with an exposition on the fantasy of subjective and representative closure. The fantasy of exile as the fantasy of closure proper.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Exile (punishment) in Literature</field><field name="subject">Philosophy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/318</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Language and Power in Nonprofit/For-Profit Relationships: A Grounded Theory of Inter-sectoral Collaboration</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">Concerns over the future of the nonprofit sector due to increasing resource pressures and an economic rationalist political climate in Australia have led to increasing public and private interest in partnerships between nonprofit organisations and the private sector.  The purpose of this research is to describe, understand, map and analyse the experiences of nonprofit staff in organisations that are linked to businesses in a variety of funding relationships. The major questions that drove the research were: 1. Does the language used by nonprofit staff and in organisational documentation relating to relationships with for-profits reflect the status of and contribute to the reproduction of the power relationship between the organisations? 2. Do nonprofit/for-profit relationships affect the organisational capacity of nonprofit organisations and the social agency of individuals? If so, to what extent can balanced power-sharing arrangements contribute to increased organisational capacity? 3. Does the media aspect of the institutional context of relationships in which nonprofits operate affect the social agency of individuals and the capacity of nonprofits? The thesis presents a grounded theory (Glaser &amp; Strauss 1967; Strauss &amp; Corbin 1998) of language and power in inter-sectoral relationships, using five case studies, a media analysis and a quantitative component as the data from which to draw theoretical implications. The work develops an innovative methodological tool called 'linguistic threads' and uses Clegg's circuits of power model (1987) to culminate in static state and process theories of language and power in relationships between nonprofits and for-profits in the Australian context.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nonprofit organizations.</field><field name="subject">Australia.</field><field name="subject">Finance.</field><field name="subject">Business networks.</field><field name="subject">Strategic alliances.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/319</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Birthing business in the Bush: It's time to listen.</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">The challenge of ameliorating or preventing the health problems of Indigenous Australians living in remote areas is compounded by the profound professional, cultural, social and personal isolation of the health professionals who work there. This isolation has direct effects on the recruitment and retention of health professionals to remote communities, and their ability to work effectively in this unfamiliar environment. The overarching goal of this research was to strengthen the capacity of these professionals to improve the quality of remote area maternity services in Australia and the experiences and outcomes for birthing women and their families. This was achieved by investigating a process of engagement with a wide range of stakeholders and utilising contemporary communication technology through the Internet. A case study approach was undertaken using participatory action research (PAR) with the elements off rapid assessment, response and evaluation methods (RARE). The research explored, described and analysed the development of resources aimed at decreasing isolation and increasing communication in the remote setting. Identifying the barriers, facilitators and utility of an information technology intervention was an integral part of the investigation process. The first case study saw the development and evaluation of the Maternity Care in the Bush Web Based Resource Library, designed to decrease the isolation of practitioners from the educational resources and professional expertise available in current literature, guidelines and reports. The second case study targeted isolation from peers, with the development and evaluation of the Remote Links Online Community. This was designed to build partnerships between isolated practitioners, for the purpose of interactive peer support, information exchange and mentoring. The third and fourth case studies were guided by Aboriginal researchers and resulted in the development of the Birthing Business in the Bush Website, designed to decrease practitioners' isolation from cultural knowledge. An integrated component of this Website is the Primary Health Care Guide to Planning Local Maternity Services, designed to decrease the isolation of the health care practitioner from the community in which they are working. Issues related to conducting research in the Australian Indigenous setting have been explored, analysed and detailed. Each case study contributed new knowledge and learning about the challenges and contemporary contexts of remote area maternity service provision in Australia. The use of PAR, and, most particularly, how this can be used in Indigenous research to produce goals that extended beyond the individual researcher's goals, has been described. The current difficulties associated with computer mediated communication, as experienced by remote practitioners, have been highlighted. The research has identified areas of need within the workforce that, if addressed, could contribute to improved health services.  Importantly, the research has documented, acknowledged, honoured and disseminated the voices of Aboriginal women, through the far reaching communication technology that is the Internet. Furthermore, the voices, concerns and conditions of remote maternity services providers were also documented and acknowledged. This workforce, often invisible and poorly valued, was assisted and supported to provide evidenced based, culturally appropriate maternity care, through the resources that were developed. To further progress the lessons taken from the research, recommendations have been developed and are listed in the Conclusion.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">midwifery</field><field name="subject">midwives</field><field name="subject">indigenous health</field><field name="subject">rural</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/320</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Perspectives on Learning and Information in Flexible Learning Environments</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This study explores the perspectives of teachers and learners in flexible learning environments in relation to information and learning, and the implications of these perspectives for the design of effective library and information services. It adopted a case study methodology to investigate three flexible learning academic subjects offered at the University of Wollongong in Autumn Semester (March to June) 2000. Using a contextual and document review, teacher and student questionnaires, and in-depth interviews, data were gathered on participant perspectives on the following key areas of research interest: concepts of flexible learning; the flexible learning environment; the role of the teacher; the role of the learner; methods of communication; concepts of information; methods of presenting information; using information resources and services; the role of the librarian; concepts of learning; the learning process; and the relationships between information, learning and knowledge.  Interview data were analysed using the constant comparative method to identify conceptual categories and higher-level themes within individual cases as well as collectively across all three cases. The main conclusions of the study were that: (1) the ways in which information and learning are conceived are central to understanding information use as part of the learning process; (2) there are a number of identifiable processes or phases involved in using information to learn; (3) the integration of information resources and communication mechanisms is a major benefit of the online learning environment; and (4) the design of the flexible learning environment influences student approaches to learning and the use of information and learning resources. The implications of the study conclusions for library and information services include the need for librarians to develop an understanding of the relationship between information and learning; the need to encourage active engagement with information, qualitative/deep approaches to learning, and critical and interpretative thinking; the need to integrate library resources, services and communication systems into online learning environments; and the need for librarians to develop their roles as collaborative partners with teachers, as guides and facilitators of student learning, as designers of information environments, and as advocates for the incorporation of information resources and services into flexible learning environments. Suggestions for further research include ongoing studies on information conceptualisation and use within flexible learning environments, and a larger scale phenomenographic study of conceptions of information.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Flexible Learning</field><field name="subject">Open Learning</field><field name="subject">Libraries</field><field name="subject">Case studies</field><field name="subject">University of Wollongong</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/321</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Navigating the change process: The experience of, and ways forward for, facility managers in the residential aged care industry</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">The residential aged care industry in Australia has been undergoing change on multiple fronts since the introduction of the Aged Care Act 1997. Some of the sources of this change have been new regulatory systems such as accreditation and certification, concerns about financial viability, problems with recruitment and retention of staff, new models of care and increasing acuity of care provided.  Facility Managers of aged care homes are at the forefront of managing these changes. In spite of their central position within the industry, there has been almost no research on the general role and functions of Facility Managers and even less that focuses on their role in the management of change. Using a constructivist methodology, this study set out to address this lack of research and to develop a range of practical proposals concerning the management of change in the sector. The research questions the study sought to answer were: 1.	How is the role of managing change perceived and understood within the overall role of Facility Managers? 2.	How is the role of managing change approached by Facility Managers? 3.	How do Facility Managers learn to manage change? 4.	Do Facility Managers need to be supported in their efforts to manage change and, if so, how should that support be provided, and by whom?  Data for the project came from one-to-one interviews with two groups: a randomly chosen cross-section of Facility Managers and a purposive sample of senior stakeholders within the sector. Thematic analysis was used to draw out patterns and themes in the interview transcripts, and to develop interpretations and connections to the literature.  The study found that there is not a clear understanding of how the management of change fits into the role of Facility Managers, and that the management of change is an issue that is in the background of management thinking and practice in the sector. The change management aspects of the Facility Manager's role have been largely ignored or taken for granted. This can lead to stress on the individual manager as well as reducing the effectiveness of the change process.  There are many ways that Facility Managers can be better supported in the management of change, and the study presents a number of proposals to help achieve this. These focus on general principles and competencies underlying the management of change, an analytical model of change management, and management development practices supporting the management of change.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">aged</field><field name="subject">residential</field><field name="subject">housing</field><field name="subject">care</field><field name="subject">facility</field><field name="subject">change</field><field name="subject">management</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/322</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Recruitment and age dynamics of Anguilla australis and A. reinhardtii glass eels in the estuaries of New South Wales</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">Shortfin eels (Anguilla australis) and longfin eels (A. reinhardtii) are true freshwater eels of the genus Anguilla.  There are many mysteries still unsolved for the freshwater eel lifecycle, such as location of the spawning grounds, conditions that promote metamorphosis from the leptocephalid to glass eel phase, and the mechanisms that affect glass eel recruitment.  In Australia, little is also known about the estuarine habitats of glass eels as they migrate towards freshwater, and the age at which these eels enter estuaries.  Both species are of commercial importance in the estuary fishery where they are caught in eel traps for export.  There is also a small, but potentially lucrative, aquaculture industry for ongrowing glass eels to market demand size.  This thesis investigates the spatial and temporal recruitment of both species of glass eels to estuaries within NSW, the habitats that may be of importance to them as they continue their upstream migration, and the age at which these eels entered the estuaries.  Firstly, a new sampling device needed to be developed since conventional methods to catch glass eels often required constant observation of gear, multiple operators, specific physical site characteristics, and/or were expensive.  The artificial habitat collectors that were developed were then used to sample six estuaries in NSW monthly within one week of the new moon.  Shortfins showed a more consistent and defined recruitment across all sites than longfins, where the peak shortfin recruitment season was from April - August.  Longfins recruited primarily from January - May but often recruited outside of this period.  Five year collections at one of these sites provided important recruitment information.  It appeared that longfins failed to recruit to this site during 2000/01, which could affect commercial catches of this species when they enter the fishery.  The East Australian Current (EAC) probably transports glass eels from spawning sites in the Coral Sea southward to the east coast of Australia but there was no predicted lag time in the recruitment of eels from northern to southern estuaries.  Therefore, it was not possible to predict the timing of recruitment of glass eels in one estuary based on the timing of recruitment in another more northern estuary.  When glass eels enter estuaries their upstream migration is assisted by the night flood tide.  During the ebb tide, glass eels burrow into the substrate and resurface at the next night flood tide.  The eels do not select particular habitats at this time, rather, their location is dictated by the tide.  However, once glass eels reach the estuarine/freshwater interface, they may prefer more complex habitats such as seagrass/macrophytes or rocks/cobbles in which to hide during the day.  At this interface, glass eels undergo a physiological change to adapt to a freshwater existence and this change may take up to a few weeks.  During this time, glass eels commonly enter the water column during the night flood tide and may be able to locate more suitable habitats in which to hide during the day.  The ages of shortfin and longfin glass eels caught in estuaries were examined both spatially and temporally.  As the EAC travels north to south, glass eels recruiting to the southern sites were expected to be older.  However, shortfins that recruited to the northern-most site in this thesis were older than at all other sites while there was no difference in the ages of longfins.  Also, when the ages of longfins that recruited during the main recruitment period were compared to the ages of longfins that recruited outside of this period, there was no difference in ages.  Therefore, the hypothesis that these later recruiting eels may have been caught in an eddy prior to their estuarine arrival has been disproved.  The ages of shortfins that recruited in two separate years were significantly different from each other and may be due to shortfins' ability to detrain more easily from the weaker currents that exist at these recruitment periods.  Conversely, there was no difference in the ages of longfins that recruited in the same month during three separate years.  The estimated hatch dates for shortfins was estimated at October to January, while for longfins, estimated hatch time was July to September for eels that recruited during the peak recruitment period.  For longfins that recruited outside of the main recruitment period, estimated hatch times were from December to February.  It is unknown, however, whether longfins have an extended spawning period, or whether silver eels arrived at the spawning grounds later and thus produced later arriving longfins.  Continuous monitoring of glass eel recruitment to estuaries is necessary to determine whether there are long term declines in the recruitment of Australian eels similar to the declines recently observed for eels in Europe and Asia.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Eels</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">anguilla</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/323</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors affecting the Australian Position in International Fashion Design</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">Success in fashion design is important both in its own right and because it has positive influences on the culture of a country and because of the favourable ramifications it can have across many unrelated industries. This dissertation investigates the Australian fashion design industry and asks whether there is a place for a semi-autonomous industry regulator of the kind found in other countries. France is a natural choice as a model because on the one hand it has the most success and enjoys the highest prestige in international fashion design, and on the other it has a well-developed support and accreditation structure, the Federation Francaise de la Couture, du Fret-a-Porter des Couturiers et des Createurs de Mode. The Federation oversees the whole process, promoting and protecting innovation in the industry and laying down the criteria used in fashion accreditation. These observations led to the question, if a parallel fashion designers' organization were introduced in Australia, what are the chances it would be suitable and effective? To answer this question, interviews were conducted in Australia and in three European countries. The major systematic enquiry was based on a sample of 48 local industry people in key positions in media, commerce and education, who were encouraged to describe and evaluate the industry and to supply answers to a systematic survey document. Candour was promoted by the anonymity of the survey process. The major outcome in terms of evaluation of the industry was that for historical and structural reasons Australian fashion design is not characterized by a high volume of original work. Consequently it is not having much impact internationally and the upper echelons are not providing the basis for downward diffusion of ideas. If the standard (French) classification were applied to Australia, the bulk of the labels would be categorized at the lower end of the scale. The informants provided a strong consensus regarding the nature of the shortfalls including the undue emphasis given to derivative design, the lack of special support for young talent and the low priority given to the synergy between art and high quality craftsmanship. There was agreement that Australian fashion designers should not focus on product just for local consumers, because fashion in clothing is not central to the minds of the average Australian as it is for example in European countries. Fashion designers might be wise to exploit the position of Australia on the edge of the Asian subcontinent and the pool of potential design talent from other countries within the Australian population. By drawing from the new aesthetics emerging in Australia's pluralistic society, designers could easily be at the cutting edge internationally. They might showcase their work at overseas venues, although not necessarily, in the first instance, in countries like France. Although a full-scale federation-type organization might fail for want of a solid innovative industry upon which it might be based, a limited version of such a controlling body could well succeed. Its task would he to steer new directions in education which develops a pool of creative talent through master classes which focus on understanding original design, the importance of the manual aspect in design and the mechanisms of, and rewards stemming from diffusion. Sponsorship should be granted to endeavours by a collective of such talent to showcase designs abroad. Government funds should be redirected away from the promotion of a generic product to a fashion-designing paradigm emphasizing 'designer handwriting' as the value-added aspect. In addition to exploring these issues, this dissertation provides reflections on the nature of the design process and suggests ways in which fashion design and fashion design education might move to revitalize the industry.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fashion Designers</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Costume</field><field name="subject">Clothing and Dress</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/324</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Young, Competent Internet-Users: A theory based profile</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This thesis presents a qualitative case study of the skills and characteristics of five competent Internet users aged between 10 and 13 years as they engage in Internet activities reflective of their day -to-day use of this culturally valued cognitive tool. The thesis focuses on their learning during these activities and describes the educational profiles of these young learners.  To uncover and more fully understand the learning experiences of young, competent Internet users an integrated theoretical framework was established. Specifically, relevant components of Situated Cognition, Distributed Cognition and Activity Theory, combined with understandings from several cognitive theories developed my understanding of the Internet -mediated learning environment. This integrated theoretical framework resulted in an Internet -Mediated Learning Model which has enabled a holistic understanding of this complex learning sys tem. This model identifies the three major components making up the Internet -mediated learning system: individual, mediating tool (the Internet) and society, and acknowledges the intertwined relationship between these three elements.  The Internet -Mediated Learning Model considers the cognitive processing capabilities and active participation of the individual; the design features and distributive properties of the Internet; and the transmission of social knowledge and participation in local and global communities afforded by Internet -mediated activity.  The integrated theoretical framework was also instrumental in the research design of this study. Most importantly, as a result of the theoretical stance underpinning the study it was deemed appropriate to allow the participants to engage in Internet mediated activity which was reflective of their day -to-day use of this tool, that is, authentic activity.  The data were collected in two distinct phases using four research methods: questionnaire, observations, think -aloud protocols and follow -up interviews. In the first phase a questionnaire, which included a practical component, was developed to ensure the selection of participants who were competent Internet users. Each participant then chose their own Internet -mediated activity in which to participate. Whilst the participants independently completed this activity they were observed and asked to think -aloud. In the second phase, after analysis of the initial data, a follow -up interview was   conducted to further explore some of the issues which emerged from the first phase of data collection. This interview also included a practical component using the Internet.  Analysis of the data resulted in a profile of the young, competent Internet -user. This profile revealed learning characteristics and skills of the user captured in three broad areas which, for this study, have been titled: Participant Citizen, Tool -Mediated Citizen and Adaptive Citizen.  The Participant Citizen captures the skills and knowledge being developed during Internet -mediated activity which relate to transmission of social knowledge and practices and which enable Internet -users to participate in local and global communities. The Tool -Mediated Citizen uncovers learning related to the design features of the Internet and considers the distributive properties of the tool. The Adapative Citizen reveals learner characteristics which enable Internet -users to manage and negotiate the Internet -mediated environment.  Taken together, the Internet -Mediated Learning Model and profile of the young, competent Internet -user provide an in -depth understanding of learning in this unique and complex environment. This study highlights the value in reconsidering the learner skills and characteristics relevant to current and future generations and questioning our application of preconceived notions of learning to the new and relatively unexplored Internet -mediated learning environment.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Internet</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/325</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A hermeneutic phenomenological study of the lived experience of parenting a child with autism.</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">It was identified that there was little published research into the lived experience of parenting a child with autism that utilised a qualitative approach. There was a paucity of material in the literature, beyond single parent accounts, for a nurse to turn to develop a beginning understanding of the experience. There was also little for a parent to compare their own experience with. This study of the lived experience of parenting a child with autism provides an exploration of the experience within the framework of a hermeneutic phenomenological approach. Initially nine parents were interviewed and the resulting transcripts analysed. This analysis was taken to four focus groups to allow the parent's voice to remain active in the refinement of the analysis. The parents reported a strong resonance with the analysis and the discussion fell silent. The experience identified was not that of a series of activities but profound changes to the self of the parent. This is considered in the discussion in the light of the existential challenge to the parent's being posed by the demands of parenting a child with autism. Chaos theory and its mathematical applications are considered as a potentially fruitful way to pick up the conversational relation with the question of, "what is the lived experience of parenting a child with autism"?</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Parents of autistic children</field><field name="subject">Autism in children</field><field name="subject">Autistic children</field><field name="subject">Phenomenology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/326</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Diffraction Investigations of Cement Clinker and Tricalcium Silicate using Rietveld Analysis</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">Cement is the world's most popular building material, yet surprisingly its composition is not fully understood. Due to the complex nature of cement constituents, there is currently no reliable method to quantitatively determine the composition of cement. Partly this arises from the fact that the crystal structure of the main component of cement, tricalcium silicate, has not been fully determined. There has been an increase in the use of Rietveld refinement of powder diffraction data for the analysis of cement in recent years. The method has emerged as a valuable tool for the quantitative determination of the composition of cement. A further advantage of the method is its ability to refine complex crystal structures, such as tricalcium silicate. Despite the increased application of this method, few publications exist concerning the evaluation or improvement of the method for the purpose of cement analysis. In this work, the Rietveld method has been critically investigated as a tool for the identification and quantification of the different phases in cement clinker. Laboratory X-ray, synchrotron, neutron, and combined diffraction data are all used in the investigations. For the first time, comparisons of analysis results using various sources are made, rather than comparing the results from various methods. Inconsistencies in the results were found, and their causes were investigated and identified. The reliability of this method was shown to be dependent on the quality of the diffraction data, both in terms of the counting statistics and the resolution, and on the ability of the structures used in the Rietveld model to describe the phases in the sample. The only previously existing structural model for triclinic tricalcium silicate is shown, in this work, inadequate as a description of the form found in cement. Consequently, the triclinic crystal structures of tricalcium silicate were re-investigated. Using synchrotron powder diffraction data, the lattice dynamics during the T1-T2 transition were observed in detail for the first time. Superstructure reflections were observed for the two structures. The first model for the average sub-structure of the T2 form is presented. Structural modulation in the T1 form was re-investigated. The parent sub-structure, suitable for Rietveld refinement, corresponding modulation wave-vector, and superspace group of the superstructure, were identified.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cement composites</field><field name="subject">Cement clinkers</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/328</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of the Maximum Entropy Method to X-Ray Profile Analysis</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">The analysis of broadened x-ray diffraction profiles provides a useful insight into the structural properties of materials, including crystallite size and inhomogenous strain. In this work a general method for analysing broadened x-ray diffraction profiles is developed. The proposed method consists of a two-fold maximum entropy (MaxEnt) approach. Conventional deconvolution/inversion methods presently in common use are analysed and shown not to preserve the positivity of the specimen profile; these methods usually result in ill-conditioning of the solution profile. It is shown that the MaxEnt method preserves the positivity of the specimen profile and the underlying size and strain distributions, while determining the maximally noncommital solution. Moreover, the MaxEnt method incorporates any available a priori information and quantifies the uncertainties of the specimen profile and the size and strain distributions. Numerical simulations are used to demonstrate that the MaxEnt method can be applied at two levels: firstly, to determine the specimen profile, and secondly to calculate the size or strain distribution, as well as their average values. The simulations include both sizeand strain-broadened specimen profiles. The experimental conditions under which the data is recorded are also simulated by introducing instrumental broadening, a background level and statistical noise to produce the observed profile. The integrity of the MaxEnt results is checked by comparing them with the traditional results and examining problems such as deconvolving in the presence of noisy data, using non-ideal instrument profiles, and the effects of truncation and background estimation in the observed profile. The MaxEnt analysis is also applied to alumina x-ray diffraction data. It is found that the problems of determining the specimen profile, column-length and strain distributions can be solved using the MaxEnt method, with superior results compared with traditional methods. Finally, the issues of defining the a priori information in each problem and correctly characterising the instrument profile are shown to be critically important in profile analysis.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Entropy.</field><field name="subject">X-rays.</field><field name="subject">Diffraction.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/329</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Skillmax Program : An Evaluation</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">The Skillmax Program was launched by the New South Wales State Government at the end of 1988 as a result of concern about the underutilisation of the skills of overseas qualified and experienced immigrants in the labour force. The program is administered by the NSW Adult Migrant English Service. The aim of this study is to evaluate how well the Skillmax Program is achieving its aim of assisting non-English speaking background immigrants to maximise the use of their overseas experience and skills within the NSW labour market. The main source of data for the evaluation was a questionnaire distributed to all students who had studied in the program from July, 1993 to June, 1994. Those in the final program intake surveyed had just completed courses, those in the first intake surveyed had completed courses nine months previously. The questionnaire was sent to 458 ex-students in August, 1994 and 217 questionnaires were returned. Additional data was obtained from a literature search, a survey distributed to Skillmax program staff and a focus group meeting of the Skillmax Program's teachers, educational and vocational counsellor and program manager. Key research findings are: 71.9% of all respondents had found employment since enrolling in the Skillmax Program and 67.7% were still employed when the study was conducted; 84.9% of those respondents who had completed or partially completed courses ending from six to nine months before the study was conducted had found employment and 78.5% were still employed when the study was conducted; 66.7% of those respondents in employment had found employment at the same occupational level as in their countries of birth; 52% of all respondents were either unemployed (28.1%) or underemployed (23.9%); 85.9% of those respondents in employment considered that the Skillmax Program had contributed significantly to their success in finding employment. The study compares the findings of the current study to those from a previous Skillmax Program evaluation concluded in 1992 (Mograby &amp; Eddie, The Skillmax Program Evaluation Report, 1992). Employment outcomes of participants in the current study are significantly better than those in the previous study. The study argues that improvements in employment outcomes can primarily be attributed to program improvements made since the 1992 evaluation. The study concludes that the Skillmax Program is achieving its aims. Recommendations for program improvement and future directions for the program are made.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English language study and teaching.</field><field name="subject">Skillmax (Program : N.S.W.)</field><field name="subject">Skilled labour.</field><field name="subject">Migrant labour.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/330</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Induction of Drug Resistance and Differentiation in Human Leukaemia Cell Lines</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">The ability of low, clinically relevant levels of the chemotherapeutic drugs epirubicin and vinblastine to induce drug resistance was examined in the K562. U937, KG-la and HEL human leukaemia cell lines. Treatment with epirubicin and vinblastine induced the MDR phenotype and P-glycoprotein expression in K562 and U937 cells. However this treatment had no effect on drug resistance in the P-glycoprotein expressing KG-la and HEL cells. In the U937 cells, drug resistant cells were not only MDR but were also resistant to other drugs including cisplatinum and chlorambucil which are not normally associated with MDR. The drug resistant U937 sublines were also sensitised to doxorubicin, cisplatinum and chlorambucil by buthionine sulphoximine (BSO), suggesting that glutathione-related mechanisms also contributed to resistance in these sublines. The U937 sublines also had an increased DNA content and an increased ability to recover from DNA damage, as determined by cell cycle analysis, indicating that the broad cross-resistance exhibited by these cells was due to the co-existence of multiple resistance mechanisms. Drug treatment induced changes in expression of differentiation associated antigens in all four cell lines. Treatment with inducers of differentiation (TPA, sodium butyrate, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor; GM-CSF). Treatment of K562 and K562/E15B cells with TPA induced megakaryocytic differentiation, with increases in drug resistance, and increased P-glycoprotein expression in the K562/E15B subline. TPA induced monocytic differentiation in the U937 cells but not the U937/EIS subline, with increased P-glycoprotein expression and function in the U937/E15 cells but not the U937 cells. Staurosporine, an inhibitor of PKC, inhibited differentiation in these cell lines, but did not inhibit increases in P-glycoprotein expression, suggesting drug resistance was not mediated by PKC. Sodium butyrate induced erythroid differentiation, and increased P-glycoprotein expression in the K562/E15B cells. However at a higher concentration (15 mM) this was not accompanied by increased drug resistance. Granulocyte monocyte colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) did not induce differentiation in the K562 cells or K562/E15B subline, although the K562/E15B cells became more drug resistant after treatment with GM-CSF. Treatment with GM-CSF induced differentiation in the U937/E15 subline but did not change drug resistance in either the U937 cells or the U937/EI5 subline. Therefore the P-glycoprotein expressing K562/E15B and U937/E15 sublines were more responsive to inducers of differentiation than the parental cell lines. Induction of differentiation therefore induced increases in P-glycoprotein expression and drug resistance, suggesting that expression of P-glycoprotein or a multidrug resistance phenotype was associated with differentiation.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Drug resistance</field><field name="subject">cancer cells</field><field name="subject">leukemia</field><field name="subject">chemotherapy.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/331</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Telecommuting: current status, future direction</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">Telecommuting is a method of work which substitutes telecommunications and technology for the daily journey to, and home from work. Instead of travelling to a central workplace telecommuters work from home or a specially established centre close to their home. The incidence of telecommuting is increasing throughout the world. An extensive search for information on the telecommuting phenomenon reveals that most developed countries in the world have some level of participation in telecommuting. The United States of America certainly leads the way in terms of the numbers of participation and especially the information available. Information on the Australian situation has been difficult to find. It would appear that not many organizations have formal plans or policies regarding telecommuting. Much of the information available for the Australian situation is concerned with the Rural Telecentres programme that whilst not strictly developed for the purposes of telecommuting does provide facilities which can be used by organizations and telecommuters. Based on the reports available telecommuting is a popular choice for many workers. Telecommuters report benefits associated with lifestyle choices and increased work productivity due to lowered stress levels and choices about working hours. Telecommuting has also associated problems for telecommuters varying from being able to set aside a suitably equipped environment at home to concerns about isolation and missed career opportunities. For organizations the benefits also are many including increased productivity, cost savings and worker satisfaction. The problems facing organizations need careful planning to overcome. Organizations have to deal with managerial issues, potential problems associated with insurance and legal exposure, and security concerns. Organizations need to establish formal policy regarding telecommuting in order to address these concerns. Telecommuting has the potential to impact on travel and transport habits and infrastructures. It has the potential to impact positively on the environment by reducing vehicle emissions. Telecommuting, by making work location independent has the potential to affect suburban and rural communities. Issues associated with telecommuting need to be further researched in order to have the information to plan and manage this phenomenon effectively. There is difficulty obtaining information on the Australian experience, even though Australia would be ideally suited due to its geographical isolation to take advantage of the possible benefits.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Telecommuting</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/332</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Community Structure of Cliff-Top Coastal Heathlands in Botany Bay National Park, Sydney</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This thesis examines community structure of cliff-top coastal heathlands in Botany Bay National Park, Sydney. Community properties of floristic composition, structure and species richness are investigated. This investigation is made in order to assess the justification for contemporary pre-emphasis in local studies on individual community properties. It is also made in order to assess the relative and independent contributions of individual properties to variance in overall community structure. It is also made in order to assess the relative utility of multi-property classifications in summarising community structure of cliff-top coastal heathlands.  First, the presence of determinable structure in each property is assessed through multivariate classification of respective data sets. Secondly, a new model of community structure is developed in which the hypothesis that community structure is a function of common (shared) and independent (unique) variance in each of the three properties is assessed. This is achieved through application of variance partitioning using correspondence analysis techniques. Thirdly, a matrix combining variance in all three properties is classified. This classification is compared with those of individual properties in order to assess the hypothesis that more ecologically cohesive classifications than those of single properties are obtainable. The ecological significance (environmental relativity) of all classifications and variance components is assessed through examination of relationships with variance in 20 environmental factors which encompass variation in maritime factors, soil physical factors, soil nutrition factors and effects of time since fire. Classifications of individual properties showed the presence of determinable structure in each. Eleven floristic complexes, nine structural complexes and eighteen species richness complexes were recognised. Nineteen community complexes were recognised from the classification of the combined property matrix. All complexes were shown to differ significantly with respect to multiple environmental factors. Variance partitioning showed the presence of both independent and common variance components with respect to properties compared pairwise. These were all shown to differ in magnitude. Examination of environmental correlates showed ecological differentiation of all properties and most variance components. Maritime and fire factors provide a major axis of environmental differentiation for most properties and variance components. A second major axis was resolved with respect to physical soil factors. With the exception of variance in species richness, major soil nutrients were generally of secondary importance to community structure. Low soil nutrients may demarcate heathlands from other vegetation types. However, this study shows elevated importance of other major areas of environment for community structure within cliff-top coastal heathlands. Comparisons of environmental homogeneity characteristics between all classification systems showed the classification of the combined property matrix to be more ecologically robust than those of structure or species richness. Homogeneity characteristics of the combined classification remained statistically inseparable from that of floristic composition. However, studies provided some evidence suggesting greater robustness of the combined classification with regard to fine-scale variance in community structure. This thesis shows that variance in all major community properties of the studied vegetation to be of ecological significance. It also shows that this significance is differential with respect to properties and their variance components. Pre-emphasis on individual properties in syntheses of local systems thus involves the loss of ecological information. I thus conclude that if adequate ecological syntheses of cliff-top coastal heathlands are to be obtained which are appropriate to their scale of distribution and functioning in the Sydney area then inclusion of attributes of multiple properties is required. Equally, multiple sources of environmental variation need to be examined.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Heathlands -- New South Wales -- Sydney</field><field name="subject">Botany Bay Region (N.S.W.)</field><field name="subject">-National parks and reserves -- New South Wales -- Botany Bay Region</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/333</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Continuity of maternal care in a community setting: a randomised controlled trial using the Zelen design</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This research investigated a new community-based model of continuity of care provided collaboratively by a small team of midwives and obstetricians (St George Outreach Maternity Project or STOMP). The study considered whether STOMP improved maternal and neonatal clinical outcomes, resulted in a better experience for women and could be implemented within the current resources of a public teaching hospital in Sydney, Australia. A randomised controlled trial using a Zelen design was used to compare the STOMP model with standard care. One thousand and eighty-nine women were randomly allocated to either the STOMP model or standard hospital-based care. The Zelen design was used to increase the participation of women from non-English speaking backgrounds and to reduce disappointment bias in women allocated to the control group.  The results suggest that the model of community-based continuity of care is associated with a lower caesarean section rate, more positive experiences for women and costs less than standard care. There were no differences in the number of medical complications experienced in either group, but more women in the control group were admitted to hospital during the antenatal period. There were four perinatal deaths in each group. Women in the STOMP group reported a higher quality of antenatal care compared with the control group. Women in the STOMP group also reported that the community-based service was accessible and convenient with reduced waiting times for appointments. Women in the STOMP group were more likely to have received adequate information about labour, birth and the postnatal period and felt more 'in control' during labour compared with the control group. Women from both groups reported problems with postnatal care, particularly when provided in the hospital. The study also examined the impact of the STOMP model on women from Chinese and Arabic-speaking backgrounds. The STOMP model appeared to reduce the rate of elective and emergency caesarean section in Chinese-speaking women compared with English-speaking women. Small numbers precluded statistical analysis on these data so the results must be interpreted with caution. Women from Chinese-speaking  backgrounds reported receiving insufficient information. The STOMP model improved the provision of information, however Chinese-speaking women still reported inferior experiences. There were also differences in the method of infant feeding. The results indicate that the model provides effective, cost efficient and satisfying maternity care. New models of maternity care can be implemented within current resources when organisations have a strong commitment to change.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">NSW</field><field name="subject">Maternity services.</field><field name="subject">Hospitals.</field><field name="subject">Sydney.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/334</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Australian Digital Theses Program and the Theory of Disruptive Technologies : A case study</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">The Theory of Disruptive Technologies put forward by Clayton Christensen in 1997 has attracted significant attention.

Doing so, however, presents a number of challenges to those involved. One of these is that because of a lack of experience in collaborating through computer-based collaboration systems, there is little knowledge on how to carry out collaboration virtually. Another is that it is not easy for those not directly involved in the collaboration to know what is, and has been, 'going on' during virtual collaboration. This thesis suggests that both of these challenges can be addressed with the same approach, namely by referring to observations of virtual collaboration. The problem then is how such observations of virtual collaboration can be obtained without requiring those involved in it to document their own actions. To address this problem is the objective of this thesis. The approach proposed here involves three elements: firstly, the collection of data about virtual collaboration; secondly, the modeling of this data; and thirdly, the derivation of increasingly abstract, larger-scale representations of virtual collaboration from this data. These representations are termed patterns of virtual collaboration, which are abstract descriptions of activities of virtual collaboration. A multi-layered conceptual model of information, the Information Pyramid of Virtual Collaboration, is proposed, providing different views of information related to virtual collaboration, at different levels of abstraction. The thesis then suggests how from a given body of data, patterns of virtual collaboration at a corresponding level of the Information Pyramid can be extracted, and how from collections of such patterns more abstract patterns of larger-scale activity can be derived, providing the observations of virtual collaboration sought. In considering how the extraction of patterns of virtual collaboration fits into the larger context of the conception, design, and use of collaboration systems, a Framework for Pattern Extraction and Feedback is proposed. This framework introduces the notion of collaboration memory, a type of organizational memory that contains records of collaborative activity. Moreover, the framework suggests how extracted patterns of virtual collaboration feed back into both ongoing development and use of collaboration systems. Finally, the modeling and extraction of patterns of virtual collaboration is illustrated in a case study involving the LIVENET collaboration system.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Virtual work teams.</field><field name="subject">Communication in organizations.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/336</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adult Education as Professional Practice</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">The thesis will establish, through philosophical argument, particularly in philosophical psychology, that professional practitioners in adult education are those who see themselves (and indeed are also seen) as agents of the integration of (a) adults' learning from their experiences (the authenticity aspect), with (b) the values of 'education' (the integrity aspect). That is, such practitioners employ 'know how' to bring such integration about, and they may ideally exemplify a kind of wisdom in 'knowing why' they act as they do. We will call this the 'integrationist' model of adult education practice. This integrationist thesis, drawing mainly upon Wittgenstein, Kant and Aristotle: * takes the very phenomenon of the practices of adult educators as its starting point, rather than analyse concepts or language per se, and treats ethical and epistemological dimensions of this practice as interwined and equally central in such phenomena; * requires extensive treatment of the formation of the 'appropriateness' or efficacy of the ethical and epistemological ingredients of professional practice, and subsumes this 'know how' in the significance of sociocultural location; * assumes such people are still 'students' in the broad sense that they are integratively learning from their practical experience and that socio-culturally located workplaces provide the most significant context for their practice (intentionality and competence are especially addressed); * re-examines the emphasis in adult education on the role of experience and the self, and accordingly revitalises a constructivist approach more firmly based in ontological considerations; * accordingly, moves beyond an atomistic conception of professional competence and the sovereignty of the agency of the individual practitioner, * develops an emphasis on teleological considerations - adding 'knowing why' to a more holistic 'know how' and, in that sense, signals a retrieval of the notion of 'vocation', with an orientation towards the attainment of the 'rightness' of practical wisdom (phronesis) as the purpose of adult education as professional practice. Integrationism is thus also constructivist: professionals in any field are expected to make a positive difference. There are general features of the analysis pertinent to any practice where adults' circumstances are up for amelioration.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Adult education.</field><field name="subject">Educators.</field><field name="subject">Philosophy.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/337</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Model Reduction of Large Structural Systems for Active Vibration Control</field><field name="creator">Boffa, John</field><field name="description">This thesis studies the applicability of the Dynamic model reduction method that is used for direct plant order reduction in the active vibration control of large and flexible structures. A comparison of the performances between the reduced models produced by the Dynamic model reduction method and those obtained by other common model reduction methods such as the Guyan method, and the Mode-displacement method have been carried out. By using a full analytical model of a twenty storey building as the reference, each three degrees of freedom model was compared by computer simulation.  The open-loop frequency response simulation, open-loop earthquake simulation, and the closed-loop earthquake simulation were all used to initially evaluate the reduced models. The accuracy of the frequency responses was assessed with sinusoidal applied forces, and for the closed-loop dynamic analysis, an active mass damper at the top storey and a recorded earthquake excitation was used. When compared with the simulation results of the Guyan method, the Dynamic method has many advantages, especially in terms of its accuracy at the high frequency range. The Mode-displacement method produces reduced models that are good for dynamic analysis of open-loop systems, but it was found to be inconvenient for use in active control. Finally, the Dynamic model reduction method and Guyan method were compared using experimental test results. A 2.5m tall building model with 20 floors was used as the plant, with a linear motor installed at the top storey for the purposes of active-damping.  Although the results of simulations would suggest that both models perform sufficiently, experimental testing proved that only the Dynamic model performs adequately for this specific application of active control. The problem associated with most model reduction methods, such as the Guyan, is that they are based on full-order models that were derived from the linear elastic theory. The versatility of the Dynamic model reduction method is such that it provides the option of obtaining system parameters directly from experiment, not just from theory. The experimental procedure ensures that the Dynamic model reduction method forms an accurate description of the real system dynamics. The applicability of this method for obtaining low-order plant models was demonstrated through real-time active control testing of the model structure, while it was subject to a sinusoidal excitation. The tests have shown that the Dynamic model reduction method can be used as an alternative approach for the model reduction of structural systems for the purpose of active vibration control.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Vibration control.</field><field name="subject">Buildings vibration.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/338</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Invisibility of Midwifery - Will developing professional capital make a difference?</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">Serious questions need to be asked about the current status of midwifery in Australia. This doctorate examines the lack of recognition of midwifery as an autonomous profession and its consequential invisibility in Australian maternity care.Despite the significant amount of evidence that continues to accumulate to support the expansion of midwifery models of care, such changes have not been widespread in Australia. An examination of international, national and local health policy and strategic direction in maternity services, together with a critique of contemporary Australian midwifery and the role of the midwife within the public health system, provide the rationale and context for the study. The 'case' for introducing improved systems and models of maternity care is developed with regard to the evidence for increasing the utilisation of midwifery. The doctorate argues for greater visibility and recognition of midwifery in Australia with a focus on the role of midwifery leadership and its potential to improve collaboration. A number of case studies report experiences and insights of leadership and collaboration across different contexts: clinical practice, organisation of health services and health policy leadership in maternity services. The result is a comprehensive understanding of the reasons for the lack of visibility of midwifery and the potential costs of such a situation continuing. The exploration of this situation highlights the barriers to recognising and acknowledging midwifery itself.  Attention is drawn to the continuing lack of voice and visible leadership in Australian midwifery, with midwives being absent from decision-making in situations whereothers, predominantly nurses and doctors, speak 'for' them. This work examines the barriers to midwives forming alliances and working to influence government agendas at the social, organisational and political level. Exploration of the power structures and hierarchical constraints that exist reveals particular barriers and highlights what is needed to address the impending decline of the profession in Australia. The enhanced capacity that midwives would experience if their work were to be understood, recognised and valued in the provision of maternity services in Australia, is postulated through the development of a construct called 'professional capital'. Drawing on several theoretical perspectives, it is argued that the notion of 'professional capital' is dependent on a strategy of focused and deliberate leadership and collaboration within maternity services and the creation of positive social networks and affiliations amongst midwives. Professional capital would enable greater visibility and recognition of midwifery and a more effective midwifery contribution to maternity services. It is suggested that improved professional and societal recognition will ultimately enhance the professional performance and self image of midwives. Such developments will enable new and effective ways of supporting and strengthening inter-professional relationships and systems of care that will, in the long term, improve the outcomes and experiences of women who access maternity services.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Midwifery</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Practice</field><field name="subject">Professional Relationships</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/339</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of Continuously Variable Unit on Powertrain Dynamics</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This thesis studies the dynamic model and simulation of a Half-Toroidal (HT) type Continuously Variable Unit (CVU) integrated into a conventional powertrain.  A simplified parametric model of a HT-CVU is constructed using Finite Element Method (FEM) in which the continuous variable speed unit is discretized into lumped masses, spring and damper elements. Linearized Finite Elements (FE) have been used to model the contacts between the toroids and rollers. The phenomenon of slip and spin associated with the rolling-slipping contacts of the traction drives are modelled kinematically. All Finite Elements including the CVU model are integrated into the complete powertrain system.  Free Vibration Analysis (FVA) of the multi degree of freedom system is carried out for torsional vibration for High Gear (HGR) and Low Gear Ratio (LGR) conditions. Further, FVA is carried out with a lock-up clutch engaged at high speed range. The results of the FVA indicates significant changes in natural frequencies and corresponding mode shapes for both HGR and LGR condition with a change in HT-CVU gear ratios. Change in natural frequencies and mode shapes for both HGR and LGR conditions are also observed for varying contact torsional stiffness. The change is significant till a certain value of contact torsional stiffness. Further increase in contact torsional stiffness within the HT-CVU does not affect the natural frequencies and corresponding mode shapes significantly. The results of the modal analysis carried out for a HT-CVU integrated powertrain with a lock-up clutch engaged at high speed range illustrates the ability of the lock-up clutch to simultaneously suspend engine and roller element excitation. However, for certain natural frequencies the modal analysis of the integrated powertrain system indicates suspension of engine and input toroid but increased excitation for the roller element of the HT-CVU.  The transient dynamic analysis is carried out to understand the behaviour of the CVU integrated into the complete powertrain and to identify and possibly correct potential problems associated with the system. The simulation is carried out for constant and variable throttle conditions for the powertrain with and without a lock up clutch engaged at high speed ranges. A piecewise curved gear ratio map is assumed for all conditions. All analyses are carried out for throttle 'tip-in' condition. The results of the transient dynamic analysis indicate that the transient responses of input and output rollers of the HT-CVU exist when clutch change occurs during vehicle acceleration period from stand still condition. The clutch change also leads to disturbances in the HT-CVU output torque to driveline and in vehicle speed. This leads to imperfect drive feel for the driver. The simulated vehicle velocity indicates powerful acceleration characteristics of the HT-CVU integrated powertrain. Engine harmonics is modelled as a rich collection of various forcing frequencies. These frequencies impress on the response of both the roller and output toroid and are observed in the simulation.  Stability analysis is carried out on the powertrain to understand the effect of damping in the tyres and damping within the HT-CVU on the stability of the powertrain. Severe or even unstable response of the HT-CVU takes place if the damping in the HT-CVU and/or the tyres is insufficient during the initial acceleration period and later after the clutch change occurs and when the vehicle is at high speeds. The results of the stability analysis lead us to reason with confidence that the tyre and HT-CVU damping have an effect on the dynamic characteristics and the stability of the system. The response of the powertrain becomes stable when a lock-up clutch is applied over the high speed ranges even if the damping in the tyres remains insufficient. The modal damping ratios for stable and unstable conditions are also discussed. Future investigations need to be carried out in order to understand in depth the fluid-metal interaction in the HT-CVU. This can be achieved by modelling in non-linear drag torque which would act on the HT-CVU elements.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Automobiles</field><field name="subject">Transmission Devices</field><field name="subject">Automatic</field><field name="subject">Power Trains</field><field name="subject">Design and Construction</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/340</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The right to leave and return and Chinese Migration Law</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">The Right to leave and return (RLR) has been affirmed as a fundamental human right in several international instruments. While being a fundamental human right, each State has the sovereign right to regulate RLR in accordance with its own laws. The regulation of RLR, however, is not only an attribute of sovereignty but an issue with important political, economic and security implications for the State. Given its significance, it is understandable and desirable that States regulate RLR. The regulation must however take account of both the interests of the State and the human rights dimension of the right. This is an issue of balance. In the case of China, the country's communist political system has significantly affected the development of RLR and the country's approach to it. As a rule China's approach is restrictive. As part of its reform and 'opening up' policies, China has embarked on a range of reforms to liberalise RLR, but the reforms lack cohesion and focus, and remain restrictive. Given its peculiar past and complex social and economic conditions, China may have some justifications for its approach, but on balance, has more to gain from adopting a more liberal approach. The issue of RLR in China is crucial both for the future of China, and for development of RLR in the world.  China's current policy's on RLR still reflects a closed culture. A more open policy is not only consistent with international human rights norms, but also a useful infrastructure for the country's place in the global economy. Great achievements over the last 25 years and encouraging developmental trends demand acceleration of reforms to protect RLR in China. A careful and well-coordinated migration strategy with a well-defined RLR focus could enhance China's economic progress as well as its international human rights image. When designing the reform strategy, the balance of the Western experience and Chinese realities needs to be finely kept.  This thesis will explore the Chinese regulatory regime governing RLR to determine its consistency with international standards. The thesis is divided into 15 chapters. It investigates RLR in international migration law and practice; analyses RLR in the context of China, and identifies its driving factors; investigates the conditions and practical concerns relevant to the protection of RLR; and concludes with recommendations on how the Chinese regulatory regime governing RLR can be improved.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">migration</field><field name="subject">law</field><field name="subject">immigration</field><field name="subject">freedom</field><field name="subject">movement</field><field name="subject">civil rights</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/341</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Study of Labour</field><field name="creator">Duff, Margaret</field><field name="description">The partograph, developed over 50 years ago and based on research conducted by Friedman (1954, 1955 &amp; 1956), has been promoted by the World Health Organisation as the &#8220;gold&#8221; standard for assessing progress in labour. The basic premise of the partograph is that regular vaginal examinations throughout labour that calculate the extent and rate of cervical dilation will be the most reliable indicator of labour progress.  A review of the medical and midwifery literature suggested that the progress of labour can also be assessed by observing women&#8217;s behavioural responses to labour. This study set out to describe and test the reliability and consistency of these behavioural cues. These cues were derived from published literature and used to construct a &#8220;Labour Assessment Tool&#8221; (LAT). The LAT was tested and modified using an expert reference group and results of a pilot test. Inter-rater reliability was established during the pilot study and verified with other experienced midwives as data collectors. The LAT recorded partograph observations as well as labour behaviours.  The study was undertaken in two Australian hospitals between 1999 and 2002. Women were given information on the study during regular antenatal visits to the hospitals from 30 weeks gestation and invited to participate during one of their antenatal visits between 37 weeks and 42 weeks of pregnancy. There were 21 women of the 225 women approached who declined to participate. The LAT observations were recorded on 203 participants however only 179 participants (94 nulliparous and 85 multiparous women) who generated 47,768 individual observations were suitable for analysis. There were 59 participants (31 nulliparous and 28 multiparous women) who were induced into labour or had their labours augmented. Women excluded from the study included those with complications of pregnancy and labour. Women were also withdrawn from the study at the time an epidural was commenced but their data to that point were retained for analysis.  The data were examined from three perspectives. The first was from a &#8216;phases of labour&#8217; perspective based on the work of Friedman (1954; 1955). Data obtained at the time the women had an internal cervical assessment were allocated to early labour, active labour, transition or full dilation, based on the results of the cervical measurements. The second perspective examined all the descriptors over the course of labour from admission to hospital or the beginning of an induction of labour, to second stage of labour. Frequencies were again generated for each behaviour from admission to hospital until full dilation. They were compared to the mean dilation generated for both parity groups based on the 279 cervical examinations that were performed on the participants. The third perspective examined behavioural patterns observed within each woman&#8217;s labour unrelated to the time to full dilation or Friedman&#8217;s phases of labour model.  Results indicate that specific behavioural descriptors associated with progress were observed before cervical dilation increased. Descriptors indicating cervical dilation was occurring, or had occurred, and descriptors indicating impending second stage as well as second stage itself, were identified. Differences were observed between the labours of multiparous and nulliparous women and induced labours and non induced labours.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Labor (Obstetrics)</field><field name="subject">Pregnancy</field><field name="subject">Childbirth</field><field name="subject">Midwifery</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/348</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mothers and school choice: effects on the home front</field><field name="creator">Aitchison, Claire</field><field name="description">There have been substantial changes in the way that families interact with schooling at the point of school choice. These shifts have been brought about by market orientated educational policy changes, and by altered forms and experiences of &#8216;family&#8217;. This study explores this changed dynamic by researching how a group of mothers in one urban setting engaged in school choice over a period of fourteen months. The research set out to investigate the processes, behaviours and influences that mothers took to the task of choosing secondary schooling for their children. In particular it aimed to explore the personal, familial, cultural and social dimensions of this engagement. These objectives were pursued using feminist and phenomenological frames because these theoretical approaches allowed for a gendered and contextualised analysis of experience. Data was gathered longitudinally through return interviews with 20 women from one socially and culturally diverse local government area in Sydney, Australia. The analysis of data is informed by perspectives on markets and consumerism from the field of cultural studies. Bourdieu&#8217;s concepts of &#8216;capital&#8217;, &#8216;habitus&#8217; and &#8216;field&#8217; were also used along with the feminist concepts of &#8216;emotional labour&#8217; and &#8216;emotional capital&#8217; to analyse the way that neoliberal market orientated educational policies impacted on this group of middle Australians. This research shows that the Australian experience of school choice is an emotionally rich, highly context-specific, complex, gendered and cooperative process that contests the prevailing public rhetoric about the operations of markets and of choice. School choice, while not always welcomed by this group of middle Australians, is an overtly gendered activity mostly overseen and undertaken by mothers in gender-specific ways. For these women school choice was an activity that demanded considerable physical and emotional labouring adding significantly to mothers&#8217; work in support of their children&#8217;s education. Further, the research showed how within this new marketised context, the family became the site for the contestation of taste via the negotiation of differing economic, social, cultural and emotional capitals vis a vis the structural imperatives imposed by the market. It showed that for these women and their families in this location, at this time, the promise of &#8216;choice&#8217; was a hollow promise indeed.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">School choice.</field><field name="subject">Feminism.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/351</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Discourse and desire in a second language classroom</field><field name="creator">Ellwood, Constance</field><field name="description">This thesis draws on the theories of Foucault, and Deleuze and Guattari to describe some ways in which teacher and student identities are produced and performed in a second language classroom. Three major aspects of identity are considered: cultural identity, teacher professional role identity, and the changing identity of the language learner.  The thesis uses poststructuralist perspectives to critique notions of identity current in second language theory and practice. It extends the conception of identity as 'subjectivity&#8217; proposed by Bonny Norton Peirce - that is, as multiple, impermanent, fragmented &#8211; to include the notion of subjectivity produced in interaction and desire. Through an examination of texts produced in an ethnographic study, the thesis addresses issues of cultural categorisation and stereotyping in second language teaching and learning. It discusses the discursive production of subjectivity in discourses of cultural identity and the extent to which culture is a determining factor in subjectivity in the classroom site of the research. It shows how a homogenising effect of discourse leads to the positioning, both self-imposed and other-imposed, of individuals as members of particular cultural groups with particular characteristics. The thesis also discusses the discursive production of subjectivity through discourses of good teacher and good student, and demonstrates the extent to which these discourses are processes of molarisation. The thesis is thus concerned here with an examination of relatively static, fixed identifications and to demonstrate the power of discourse to determine subjectivities. It is also concerned to look at an excess to discourse, a flow which is beyond signification and identification: desire. Identity change at the discursive level is discussed through discourses of becoming, and is differentiated from movements away from subjectification. These movements of desire are proposed as a new way of conceiving agency.  The thesis attempts to show some ways in which these subjectivities, produced in discourse and desire, play out in the classroom, in terms of their production and reception by participants, and the impacts on the teaching/learning context.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">language</field><field name="subject">second language</field><field name="subject">classroom</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/353</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Celebrations for personal and collective health and wellbeing.</field><field name="creator">Hilbers, Julieanne.</field><field name="description">Celebrations are pervasive.  At a personal level they include birthdays, funerals, weddings, get-togethers, award ceremonies, and parties organised for any number of reasons.  At a community level they include faith-based services, public holidays, commemorations and community festivals.  These are just a selection.  I argue that there is a need to better understand what role celebrations can play to improve health and wellbeing and not just for individuals but for communities. In this thesis I examine the experiences, context, processes and politics of celebrations and how they contribute to both personal and collective health and wellbeing.  Of course, some celebrations make a more meaningful contribution than others.  And it is the nature of that difference I seek to understand.  The two leading research questions I address are:  &#8226;	How do celebrations contribute to personal and collective health and wellbeing? &#8226;	What is &#8216;healthy&#8217; celebration practice?  There are three sections in this thesis.  In the first I describe and discuss the Australian context of celebration activities.  I also explore definitions of celebrations.  I consider celebrations to be an active process made up of both play and ritual.  Celebrations seek to focus people&#8217;s attention, and intention, in a positive way.  The resulting celebratory act(s) are a cultural expression of what a particular individual or community values.  There are a diversity of celebration forms and practices - open, spontaneous, planned and formal.  Each celebration is influenced by, and influences, the context in which it occurs.  I will be focusing on celebrations occurring within a community context.  A community may be a family, an organization, local community, shared interest group or a whole of society grouping.  In the second section of the thesis I analyse the relationship of celebrations to various dimensions of health and wellbeing.  These dimensions include: social connectedness, identity, transitions and lifespan development, and community capacity.  A major part of my fieldwork was undertaken in Victoria where I studied 20 community celebrations.  The community celebrations I examined in varying degrees, did positively contribute to personal and collective wellbeing.  They did so because they included positive and personally meaningful activities.  They explored identity.  Celebrations played a role in supporting transitions leading to ongoing healthy development.  They provided opportunities for learning; not just knowledge but allowed values to be explored and skills and resources to be gained.  They brought people together to interact and fostered a sense of belonging.  Celebrations that were health enhancing valued diversity but also explored what unites people.  My research confirmed that celebrations can foster our connections; to ourselves, others, the earth, time and the spiritual.  They can build relationships between individuals, groups and organizations.  They can be spaces that allow for personal and collective healing. But the degree to which these positive dimensions can be achieved depends on the nature or quality of the celebration practice.  And it is the practice of planning and facilitating celebrations that is the focus of the third section of the thesis.  Some celebration practices are health enhancing while others are not.  Celebrations can be an opportunity to explore not just ourselves but our communities and how they oppress particular individuals and groups.  Many contemporary celebrations do not feel authentic or resonate with people.  They often remain at the surface and focus on passive forms of entertainment and the consumption of goods.  Deeper engagement can be facilitated through more participatory and creative activities such as dance, playing music, story -making and -telling and ritual; particularly when engaged in with conscious intention.  Celebrations at the individual level can be a positive, affirming experience that is personally meaningful and enables people to move towards their potential.  At a collective level they build relationships between the individual, groups and places.  They highlight the interconnectedness between all things.  And as such they are an integral part of community life.  I conclude by presenting an analytical framework to help understand the nature of celebration practice that is less or more likely to facilitate health and wellbeing.  I try to adopt the viewpoint of a practitioner interested in the health and wellbeing of individuals and communities.  I anticipate this knowledge will stimulate discussion particularly within the health and community sector about how celebration practice can be integrated into the work of health professionals and community workers.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">wellbeing</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">anniversaries</field><field name="subject">celebrations</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/354</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Phosphorus removal mechanisms in soil and slag media.</field><field name="creator">Lee, Seung Hwan</field><field name="description">Excessive phosphorus (P) is one of the major pollutants in natural water that are responsible for algal blooms and eutrophication. P removal by soil and slag is an attractive solution if the P sorption capacity of soil or slag is significant. To design an efficient land treatment facility, basic information on the behaviour of P in the media-water environment is required. In this study, detailed experiments were conducted to study P removal under static and dynamic conditions, and mathematical models were developed to describe these processes. The kinetic studies on P sorption onto a sandy loam soil from North Sydney, Australia, and dust and cake waste products from the BHP steel industry revealed that P sorption is a slow process. More than 90% of the P was adsorbed within 70, 12 and 60 hours in a mixing system for soil, dust and cake respectively while it was within 240, 24 and 120 hours respectively in a static (no stirring) system. Dust adsorbed P the most, compared to the other adsorbents (220-225 times and 4-5 times of the sorptivity of soil and cake respectively). P sorption in the batch experiments was described better by an equation using the Langmuir isotherm than one using the Freundlich isotherm. The kinetics of P sorption were satisfactorily explained by a static, physical, non-equilibrium sorption model (SPNSM). The pH of the P solution played a critical role in the extent of removal and the removal mechanisms of P. Removal was at a minimum at pH 2. The effect of pH on P removal varied depending on the type of adsorbents and the initial P concentration. The dominant removal mechanism of P at pH&lt;8 was physical sorption, while it was chemical precipitation at pH&gt;10. Batch flocculation experiments revealed that the P removal efficiency increased with an increase of adsorbent dose, flocculation (contact) time and mixing rate. P sorption is affected by the presence of NH4 which competes for available sites on the adsorbents. The amount of P adsorbed by dust and cake in the presence of NH4 was less than that in a single solute system. The reduction percentage of P for dust ranged from 33 to 57%. Detailed column experiments conducted with soil, dust and cake as media indicated that dust and cake have much higher sorption capacities than soil. The solid phase P concentrations on dust and cake calculated from batch experimental isotherm constants are substantially higher than those estimated.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Phosphorus.</field><field name="subject">Soils.</field><field name="subject">Slag.</field><field name="subject">Algal blooms.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/356</field></doc><doc><field name="title">BlackBOX : painting a digital picture of documented memory.</field><field name="creator">Pentes, Tatiana</field><field name="description">This study investigates and records the production of a digital media artwork blackBOX: Painting A Digital Picture of Documented Memory, generated through the media technologies of interactive multimedia, exploiting the creative potentials of digitally produced music, sound, image and text relationships in a disc based and online (Internet) environment. The artwork evolves from an imaginary electronic landscape that can be uniquely explored/ played in a non-sequential manner. The artwork/ &#8216;game&#8217; is a search for the protagonist Nina&#8217;s hybrid cultural identity. This is mirrored in the exploration of random, fragmentary and non-linear experiences designed for the player engaged with the artwork. The subjective intervention of the player/ participant in the electronic artwork is metaphoric of the improvisational tendencies that have evolved in the Greek Blues (Rembetika), Jazz, and Hindustani musical and performative dance forms. The protagonist Nina&#8217;s discovery of these musical forms reveal her cultural/ spiritual origins. As a musical composer arranges notes, melodies and harmonies, and sections of instruments, so too, the multimedia producer designs a ensemble of audio-visual fragments to be navigated. Dance also becomes a driving metaphor, analogous to the players movement in and through these passages of image/ sound/ text and as a movement between theories and ideas explored in the content of the program. The central concern is to playfully reverse, obscure, distort the look of the dominating/colonialist gaze, in the production of an interactive &#8216;game&#8217; and allow the girl to picture herself. One of my objectives is to explore the ways in which social research can be undertaken by the creation of an interactive program in the computer environment utilising interactive digital media technologies.

The first was a survey of 86 waterways, sampled under low conditions. Samples were generally low in salinity, soft, of poor buffering capacity and dominated by sodium and chloride. C0-dominance by calcium, magnesium and (bi)carbonate occured in a number of particular cases. Multivariate analyses indicated three groups, separated primarily by levels of dissolved nutrients, trace metals, turbidity and colour. Groupings were associated strongly with the type of catchment. Streams in areas relatively unaffected by human influence had notable uniformity in chemistry, while those from developed catchments were varied. Heavy metal contamination was relatavely low, although a few of the samples displayed inordinately large levels of one or more metals. In such cases the more extreme measurements of phosphorus and nitrogen were also seen. The findings were consistant with occasional or localised elevation of contaminant levels. The second study invloved monitoring of three Hawkesbury Sandstone streams. Sampling of surface waters, interstial waters and sediments was performing at irregular intervals over a two year period at three stations within each site. The streams predominantly existed under low conditions and showed similar major ion chemistries to the majority of the survey samples. Levels of calcium and total carbonate, plus heavy metals and nutrients were generally higher in the urbanised creeks, comapred to the reference strema. During a heavy storm, high levels of nutrients, suspended solids and colour were detected in all surface waters at peak-flow, as well as alkaline pH, oxidising redox, and reduced conductivity, alkalinity and hardness. The sandy sediments were characterised by very low levels of organic matter and cation exchange capacity. Sequential extractions identified that the sums of secondary phase lead, zinc and copper were over nine, four and two times that of the corresponding residual, respectively. Greatest proportions of zinc and lead were associated with coatings of iron and maganese oxides, or coarse waste particles. Copper was preferentially associated with organic matter. Concentration gradients between interstitial and surface waters were rare and release of sedimentary constituents should occur from the upper-most particulates. Poor water and sediment qualities were often observed in the urban sites. Poor water quality was also seen on occassion in the reference stream. However, since poor sediment quality was not detected at those times and interstitial waters for all sites displayed high within-site variability, surface waters were considered the most reliable short-term indicator of condition for Hawkesbury Sandstone streams. Multidimensional scaling showed that all streams had distinct water and sediment chemistries. High levels of temporal and spatial variability were apparant within the urbanised sites - particularly in interstitial waters - mostly due to concentrations of heavy metals, phosphorus and suspended solids. Seasonal differences were detected, but only in terms of the level of variability between summer and winter samples.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Trace elements.</field><field name="subject">Water.</field><field name="subject">Urban runoff.</field><field name="subject">Pollution.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/361</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New urban space in China: towns, rural labour and social inclusion.</field><field name="creator">Carrillo-Garcia, Beatriz.</field><field name="description">Since the late 1970s internal migration has become a fundamental feature of economic and social change in the People&#8217;s Republic of China. So has rapid urbanization as the rural population moves to the cities and towns in search for work. In the process, new urban spaces have been created that not only provide the springboard for economic development but also present challenges for social coherence and stability. Considerable attention has been focussed on the impact of this migration on the larger cities and on the migrants to those cities; processes that inevitably highlight the difficulties of China&#8217;s socio-economic transformation. Nonetheless, the experiences of those cities represent but one of the country&#8217;s urban realities. In fact, the majority of China&#8217;s urban population live in a highly dispersed system formed by thousands of small cities and towns.  Through the examination of a county in North China (Hongtong County, Shanxi Province) and its county town (Dahuishu Town) this study suggests that outside the larger cities there may be alternative accounts of urban social change and the integration of rural migrant workers. Empirical findings point to greater openness and flexibility in the incorporation of rural workers. Though shortcomings are still observed, there is also considerable governmental and social awareness of the problems brought by rural  -urban migration and urbanization processes; a willingness to act and a capacity to promote and deliver greater social inclusion. Dahuaishu Town&#8217;s distinct development experience has allowed for the construction of a more inclusive social environment, one which provides all inhabitants, including rural workers with a platform towards advancing their economic and social well-being. Impossible as it is to be representative of town development throughout China, this study provides an example of and a guide to alternative development processes to those documented in large urban centres. Small town urban development in Hongtong County is not a resolved issue, but it suggests that China&#8217;s transformation may not necessarily result in dysfunctional and socially polarized urban environments.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">labor</field><field name="subject">urbanization</field><field name="subject">migration</field><field name="subject">Shanxi Province</field><field name="subject">Hongtong County</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/367</field></doc><doc><field name="title">It's like having to trade on the personal : changing work, changing identities of public health learning and development practitioners.</field><field name="creator">Wilkins, Rob</field><field name="description">As a practitioner involved in the planning and development of educational activities in the field of public health, I have worked within many pedagogical traditions and program parameters. Through this work, I have experienced both subtle and radical shifts in the range of skills, knowledge and relationships required to collaboratively plan and evaluate educational work. In this professional and community-based landscape, competing and often overlapping models of education and evaluation have led to much conceptual confusion and ambiguity around narrowly defined notions of best practice, evidence and knowledge legitimacy. Drawing from Dorothy Smith&#8217;s (1999) standpoint theory from which my inquiry was developed as a result of my participation with colleagues in the field, I explore how three professional practice networks of learning and development practitioners speak of the skills, knowledge, relationships and worker identities in a changing field. This research seeks to explicate the kinds of informal and largely unarticulated knowledge that is produced through the changing contexts of work. This research maps the changing conditions of educational work through my own case stories of educational practice and uses these as a springboard for discussion among three diverse professional practice networks. The Story/Dialogue Method (S/D-M) developed by Labonte and Feather (1996), is a constructivist methodological approach that, in this application, structures group dialogue into reflective insights and theories about how educational work occurs in varied settings among different professional and community-based groups. A strong reliance on interpersonal skills was articulated by all three networks to build trust, assess individual and organisational learning needs, to build partnerships and to motivate learners. Skills were often described vaguely and summarised as a series of situational specific attributes. A valuing of reflexive, working knowledge as opposed to professional or discipline-based expertise was raised as an important aspect of partnership building and in negotiating program parameters. The need to build individual and organisational relationships through formal and informal encounters was cited as a series of legitimate yet often &#8216;behind the scenes&#8217; professional practices. Aligning with the notion of worker identity described by Chappell, Rhodes, Solomon, Tennant and Yates (2003) as process, practitioners spoke of their identities as constructed and temporary, negotiated through newly emerging roles and changing relationships with peers and learners. This study suggests that evidence-based practice is a contested term drawing its meanings from multiple theoretical and pedagogical traditions including that of intuition. Perhaps unsurprisingly then, evidence guiding educational approaches is viewed as a pragmatic and eclectic mix of tools stored to be adapted for use in new ways. Additionally, this study concludes that all participants (including myself) regard educational practice as a collaborative and continually negotiated endeavour.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">health practitioners</field><field name="subject">health promotion</field><field name="subject">public health</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/368</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Plagiarism or intertexuality? : a study of the politics of knowledge, identity and textual ownership in undergraduate student writing.</field><field name="creator">Thompson, Celia Helen.</field><field name="description">Interest in plagiarism continues to generate debate both in the media and in the context of the academy. Opinions continue to differ not only about how plagiarism can be defined, but also about the nature of its causes and its possible solutions. Most universities have now developed websites to address the difficulties experienced by both students and staff in ascertaining exactly what kind of writing practices might constitute plagiarism. However more often than not, such websites tend to give undue emphasis to the mechanics of referencing and universal notions of &#8216;academic honesty&#8217; in order to make their point. Little or no attention is given to providing well-developed guidelines on what constitutes &#8216;common&#8217; knowledge, which is especially relevant currently given the growing cultural diversity of contemporary university classrooms. In addition, discussions about writer identity and authorship seem to be totally absent. This silence on such matters needs to be tackled as a matter of urgency.  I have adopted a &#8216;critical ethnographic&#8217; case study approach to this doctoral study in order to investigate how undergraduate university students from diverse language and disciplinary backgrounds have used the words and ideas of others in their written research-based assignments. The responses of academic staff to these students&#8217; writing practices have also been explored. Three different sources of data from ten students and ten academic staff have been collected in order to allow for data analysis from multiple perspectives through a process of triangulation. Bakhtin&#8217;s concept of dialogism (1981, 1984, 1986), Kristeva&#8217;s writings on intertextuality and the subject-in-process-and-on-trial (1986a, 1986b, 1986c, 1996) and Howard&#8217;s work on patchwriting, textual ownership and writer development (1992, 1995, 1999) have been central to the construction of the analytical framework used in this study. I argue that, the notion of &#8216;plagiarism&#8217; should be re-conceptualised in terms of transgressive and non-transgressive forms of intertextuality (see also Chandrasoma et al., 2004). My study also reveals how students react differently to the homogenising forces of the academy (Holton, 2000). Some feel alienated and have challenged or resisted these forces, while others have adopted an accommodationist position. Furthermore, this research shows that students are confused by unified and autonomous notions of textual ownership and originality that fail to conceptualise subjectivity and authorship as sociohistorically constructed and multi-voiced.  I conclude that educators need to recognise the political nature of the processes involved in the construction of text/knowledge and writer identity and recommend a dialogic approach to pedagogy, which allows for textual ownership and authority to be circulated and negotiated between students and their lecturers.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">students</field><field name="subject">universities</field><field name="subject">undergraduate</field><field name="subject">intertextuality</field><field name="subject">plagiarism</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/369</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecology of plant communities in Ku-Ring-Gai Chase National Park, New South Wales: an examination of vegetation and environmental patterns.</field><field name="creator">Le Brocque, Andrew Francis.</field><field name="description">Patterns in the floristic composition, stand structure, species richness and environmental characteristics of plant communities at a number of spatial scales were examined in Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park, New South Wales. Vegetation patterns in eastern Australia have often been related primarily to a single environmental variable, soil phosphorus concentration. This study examines the 'single nutrient' hypothesis regarding the distribution of plant species. If soil phosphorus concentration is the majot factor affecting the distribution of plant species, then this should be highly correlated with spatial patterns in the floristic composition of plant communities within the study area. Floristic composition was determined as the frequencies of all vascular species occuring within duplicate 500 m2 quadrants from fifty sites within the Park. Environmental data consisted of 21 variables, including soil physical and chemical characteristics, from each quadrant. The patterns in floristic composition and environmental factors are described and the relationships between composition and environment were examined. through indirect and direct gradient analyses. The measured environmental factors showed strong correlations with floristic patterns; however, two scales of species distributions were apparent: between and within soil type. Direct gradient analyses of composition and environmental data showed soil phosphorus concentration was inadequate in explaining the observed patterns in floristic composition of plant communities are a response to complex multivariable environmental gradients. The structural characteristics of vegetation stands were examined through the development of a multivariate approach to the classification of stand structure. This multivariate approach is essentially a modification of an existing scheme utilising foliage projective cover of various recognisable strata within the strands. Multivariate classification and ordinations of plant communities based on structural characteristics showed strong correspondence to that obtained by compositional analyses. The complex multivariable gradient hypothesis is supported from results examining stand structure-environment relationships. The relationship between species richness and richness of three growth-form types (tree, shrubs, and herbs) and environmental variables were examined through generalised linear models. The measured environmental variables showed strong relationships with species richness, consistent with the results found multivariately with floristic composition and stand structure. No single measured environmental variable adequately predicted the observed patterns in species richness, rather species richness showed strong relationships with complex multivariable environmental gradients. This study clearly demonstrates the the 'single-nutrient' or 'phosphorus' hypothesis is inadequate in explaining all the patterns in the various components of vegetation within Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park. The complex multivariable environmental gradient hypothesis suggested by the relationships between floristic composition and environmental variables is supported by the relationships exhibited by two other attributes of vegetation communities: stand structure and species richness. Further studies testing the significance of the complex multivariable environmental gradient hypothesis are required.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">national parks</field><field name="subject">Ku-Ring-Gai Chase</field><field name="subject">plants</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/370</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fighting falls with action research: a practice development project.</field><field name="creator">Dempsey, Jennifer</field><field name="description">Nurses espouse a caring ethic and demonstrate effectiveness in prevention of patient falls but are often observed taking risks with patients&#8217; safety. These actions reflect poor congruence between espoused values and behaviours. Attitudes, values and involvement in decision- making are factors that influence work behaviours. Nurses&#8217; attitudes are held to be a definitive factor in prevention work; however, few studies have focused on adherence with best practice principles of fall prevention. Yet nurses claim no authority to change their work. It was assumed that increased adherence would be achieved by improving nurses&#8217; attitudes through participation in decision- making surrounding fall prevention practice. This study aimed to tes t this assumption by empowering nurses working in two medical wards with high numbers of patient falls to improve their ownership of practice by utilising critical social theory and action research. Nurses&#8217; attitudes, including self-esteem, professional values and work satisfaction were established before and after a practice development project using action research. Mixed methods were employed by praxis groups meeting fortnightly for a year reflecting on, and re-engineering practice. Action research occurred in cycles focusing on assessment, communication, everyday work, and performance. Nurses&#8217; work was re-organised to gain time to spend in prevention work. Patients&#8217; environments were made safer and more patient-centred. New and effective ways of assessing risk to fall, communication of risk and monitoring nurses&#8217; performance of prevention work were created and evaluated. Analysis demonstrated that nurses had good self-esteem and professional values but were not satisfied with their work. Self-esteem and professional values were unaffected by participation in work-related decisions however, nurses expressed increased sense of ownership, more satisfaction and were observed to engage in more prevention work. In conclusion, manipulation of attitudes and values is not warranted if attitudes and values are good. However, participation in work-related decision- making engages practitioners and leads to greater congruence between values and behaviour. The &#8220;unspoken rules&#8221; constraining practice that were exposed in the action research oblige nurses to assume authority, confronting and dispelling these constraints to enable more therapeutic care to emerge. Recommendations include promoting practice development as the preferred means for cultural change and improving person-centred care whilst recognising its fragile nature and dependence on clinical leadership.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nurses</field><field name="subject">accidents</field><field name="subject">falls</field><field name="subject">prevention</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/371</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Variable region gene expression and structural motifs of human polyreactive immunoglobulins.</field><field name="creator">Ramsland, Paul Allen</field><field name="description">Polyreactive immunoglobulins (Ig) exhibit a capacity to recognise multiple, structurally dissimilar antigens through a single combining site. This characteristic differentiates these Igs from monoreactive Igs which bind to a single antigen, usually with high specificity and affinity. Chronic B lymphocytic leukaemia (B CLL) is a malignancy identified by the incessant accumulation, in the peripheral circulation, of B lymphocytes of a mature and resting morphology. B CLL malignant cells generally express both surface IgM and the pan T cell antigen CD5. Moreover, the IgM on the surface of these CD5 positive B CLL cells is frequently polyreactive. This thesis examines the structural diversity found in the combining sites of B CLL derived Igs in an attempt to elucidate the structural basis of polyreactive antigen binding displayed by a significant proportion of human Igs. The genes encoding the variable (V) domains of five B CLL derived IgM antibodies (Bel, Tre, Yar, Hod and Jak) were cloned and sequenced (Chapter Two). When the light chain V domain genes were aligned with the closest germline VL and JL coding DNA sequences it was determined that there was either a complete absence of somatic mutation (Tre, Yar and Jak) or a minimal number of mutations (Bel and Hod) present in the rearranged VL domain genes. A remarkable fidelity in the splicing of VL to JL genes was noted suggesting that the diversity, normally introduced through variability of splicing VL to JL, is reduced in Igs expressed by B CLL cells. Furthermore, the markedly reduced primary structural diversity was highlighted when two of the VL domain genes (Yar and Hod) were found to be different in sequence by only four nucleotides and two amino acids. The heavy chain V domain genes of the same five Igs were sequenced in another study (Brock, 1995), however, it was interesting to analyse the sequences of the VH domain genes and compare them with the VL domain genes. The naive or gerrnline nature of the B CLL antibodies was reflected in the VH genes by either an absence or a low frequency of mutations within these sequences compared with germline immunoglobulin gene sequences. No obvious conserved motif, which could be related to polyreactivity, was observed when the primary protein sequence was analysed for distribution of identical or similar amino acids. Thus, homology modelling was used to construct three-dimensional models of the Fv (VL-VH) portions of the five B CLL IgM molecules to examine the structures of the combining sites of these Igs (Chapter Three). Framework regions were constructed using X-ray coordinates taken from highly hon~ologous human variable domain structures. Complementarity determining regions (CDR) were predicted by grafting loops, taken from known Ig structures, onto the Fv framework models. The CDR templates were selected, where possible, to be of the same length and of high residue identity or similarity. If a single template CDR was not appropriate to model a particular CDR the loop was built from loop sterns of known conformation, followed by chain closure with a p-turn. Template models were refined using standard molecular mechanics simulations. The binding sites were either relatively flat or contained a deep cavity at the VL-VH domain interface. Further differences in topology were the result of some CDR loops protruding into the solvent. Examination of the electrostatic molecular surface did not reveal a common structural feature within the binding sites of the five polyreactive Fv. While two of the binding cavities were positively charged the other three structures displayed either negatively charged or predominantly hydrophobic combining sites. These findings suggested that a diversity of structural mechanisms are involved in polyreactive antigen binding. Rcsidues within CDRs which have aromatic side-chains and are partially exposed to solvent were distributed across large regions of the combining sites. It is possible that these aromatic residues are responsible for the conserved binding to mouse Igs observed (Chapter Two) for the B CLL derived polyreactive IgM molecules. Two Fv molecules (Be1 and Tre) were cloned as dicistronic constructs, into the bacterial expression vector pFLAG. The expression of the Fvs was fully characterised and unfortunately the VL and VH of Be1 and Tre Igs did not associate in an appropriate manner to yield large quantities of purified Fv (Chapter Four). Expression of correctly folded and stabilised fragments of human polyreactive immunoglobulins would enable the structural basis for the polyreactive binding phenomenon to be fully explored using protein crystallography.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">immunoglobulins</field><field name="subject">gene expression</field><field name="subject">polyreactive</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/372</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of the Internet on English language teaching: a case study at a Thai Rajabhat University.</field><field name="creator">Noytim, Usa</field><field name="description">This research was conducted in the English Department of a provincial Thai university. It seeks to address the tension between the priority accorded to English by the Thai government and the relatively low levels of English of most Thai people. The study investigates the potential of the Internet to support students&#8217; English language development, in particular the capacity of the Internet to support students&#8217; English reading development. The research was located in Central Thailand at Nakhon Pathom Rajabhat University (NPRU), my own work place. Here I investigated students&#8217; Internet practices and the potential offered by one English language program that incorporated use of the Internet. My focus on this one program enabled me to address questions about my own teaching practices, and about the implications of incorporating the Internet for program design and teaching. The research itself was conducted in two stages. Stage One was an ethnographic investigation of students&#8217; current Internet practices, both in and out of University. Outcomes from Stage One then informed the development of an English language program that incorporated extensive use of the Internet. This program was implemented and evaluated in Stage Two of the research. Outcomes from Stage One of the research revealed that the University students had low overall levels of Internet use, low levels of computer and Internet skills, but generally high levels of interest and enthusiasm, and a belief that the Internet could play a positive role in supporting English language learning. Outcomes from Stage Two confirmed that the Internet was potentially a powerful resource for teaching English. However, they also showed that if the Internet was incorporated fully into a program, rather than simply tacked onto a traditional program, then a major rethinking of program design and pedagogical practices was necessary. The implications of such changes in program design and teaching are addressed in the thesis.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English language.</field><field name="subject">Teaching.</field><field name="subject">Internet.</field><field name="subject">Thailand.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/384</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Incorporating prior domain knowledge into inductive machine learning: its implementation in contemporary capital markets.</field><field name="creator">Yu, Ting</field><field name="description">An ideal inductive machine learning algorithm produces a model best approximating an underlying target function by using reasonable computational cost. This requires the resultant model to be consistent with the training data, and generalize well over the unseen data. Regular inductive machine learning algorithms rely heavily on numerical data as well as general-purpose inductive bias. However certain environments contain rich domain knowledge prior to the learning task, but it is not easy for regular inductive learning algorithms to utilize prior domain knowledge. This thesis discusses and analyzes various methods of incorporating prior domain knowledge into inductive machine learning through three key issues: consistency, generalization and convergence. Additionally three new methods are proposed and tested over data sets collected from capital markets. These methods utilize financial knowledge collected from various sources, such as experts and research papers, to facilitate the learning process of kernel methods (emerging inductive learning algorithms). The test results are encouraging and demonstrate that prior domain knowledge is valuable to inductive learning machines.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">machine learning</field><field name="subject">capital markets</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/385</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aesthetics and hyper/aesthetics: rethinking the senses in contemporary media contexts.</field><field name="creator">Swalwell, Melanie</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses the escalation of interest in the senses, across a range of media technological contexts, dating from the mid 1990s. Much of this discourse has focussed on the experiential, particularly intense, multisensory experience of the present. As there are numerous discourses on the senses, technology and affect individually, my concern is to examine some of the intersections between these, in order to reconsider the contemporary significance of aesthetics in media contexts. I develop a &#8216;hyper/aesthetic&#8217; approach to try to think about aesthetic relations with technology in a nuanced way, opening up a space from which to investigate a variety of relations with technology. Walter Benjamin&#8217;s work on the senses and modern technology is useful in this, as is that of two of his commentators, Susan BuckMorss and Miriam Hansen. In providing the outlines of a hyper/aesthetic approach in this thesis, I am, in particular, seeking to complexify understandings of audience reception and meaningmaking, to return some ambivalence to conceptions of the sensory encounter with technology. Hyper/aesthetics is a term that draws together ambivalence, doubling, virtuality, unfamiliarity, innervation, and moving beyond, all concepts that are relevant to the senses and subjectivity. In close readings of case studies drawn from the areas of advertising, computer gaming practices, and new media art, I argue that as well as critiquing their claims to newness, it is also important to attend to the ways in which particular relations with technology exceed or refuse the logic of instrumentality. In particular, these cases consider the emerging aesthetic experiences that technologies of computer gaming and new media art facilitate, and the new subjective possibilities that follow from each. Approaching these studies hyper/aesthetically enables me to go beyond other accounts in appreciating the more experimental character of some of these relations with technology. I particularly focus on the effects and affects generated by encounters with the unfamiliar, including that which is considered strange, &#8216;unnatural&#8217; or &#8216;inhuman&#8217;, and critically appraise the significance of encounters such as these for the manner in which subjectivity is conceived.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aesthetics.</field><field name="subject">Senses.</field><field name="subject">Technology.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/386</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Practising place: stories around inner city Sydney neighbourhood centres.</field><field name="creator">Rule, John.</field><field name="description">The Neighbourhood Centres (NCs) in Sydney, Australia, were established to encourage forms of local control and resident participation and to provide a range of activities to build, strengthen and support local communities and marginalised groups. This thesis is concerned with exploring the personal conceptions, passions and frameworks, as well as the political and professional identities, of activists and community workers in these NCs. It also explores stories of practice and of how these subjective experiences have been shaped through the discourses around the NCs, some of which include feminism, environmentalism, multiculturalism and social justice. The following key research questions encouraged stories of community practice: What do the terms empowerment, participation, community service and citizenship mean for community organisation? What did community workers and organisers wish for when they became involved in these community organisations? What happened to the oppositional knowledges and dissent that are part of the organisational histories? Foucault&#8217;s concept of governmentality is used to explore the possibility that these NCs are also sites of &#8216;government through community&#8217;. This theoretical proposition questions taken-for-granted assumptions about community development and empowerment approaches. It draws on a willingness of the research participants to take up postmodern and poststructuralist theories. &#8216;Practising place&#8217; emerges in the research as a description of a particular form of activism and community work associated with these inner city Sydney NCs. The central dimensions of &#8216;practising place&#8217; include: a commitment to identity work; an openness to exploring diverse and fluid citizenship and identity formations; and the use of local knowledges to develop a critique of social processes. Another feature of &#8216;practising place&#8217; is that it involves an analysis of the operation of power that extends beyond structuralist explanations of how to bring about social change and transform social relations. The research has deconstructed assumptions about empowerment, community participation, community organisations and community development, consequently another way of talking about the work of small locally based community organisations emerges. This new way of talking builds upon research participants&#8217; understandings of power and demonstrates the utility of applying a poststructural analysis to activist and community work practices. Overall the research suggests that if activists and community workers are to work with new understandings of the operation of power, then the languages and social practices associated with activist and community work traditions need to be constantly and reflexively analysed and questioned.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">centres</field><field name="subject">communities</field><field name="subject">inner city</field><field name="subject">neighbourhood</field><field name="subject">Sydney</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/387</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Technologies transforming academics : academic identity and online teaching.</field><field name="creator">McShane, Kim</field><field name="description">As the discourses of the &#8220;technological imperative&#8221; and student-centred learning have gained momentum in university teaching and learning, one way for the lecturer to signal excellence has been to adopt the flexible, student-centred practices of online teaching. This thesis investigates academics&#8217; insights and experiences about their changing teacher identities in the context of being, or becoming, a facilitator of online student learning. This was an empirical research project, a collective case study that explored the teaching experiences of twelve university lecturers in two Australian universities who taught online, or were making the move online. Primary research data were drawn from semi-structured conversations with the lecturers, online teaching artefacts and email communications. The interpretative analysis was organised according to three overlapping lecturer identities: the teaching metaphors of performance, care and creative direction. From the perspective of each metaphor position, the move to becoming a facilitator of blended learning was uneasy. The performer/carer/director lecturer struggled to entertain, care and intervene in familiar ways in asynchronous, computer-mediated communication. Online, the performing/caring/directing lecturer was ignored by students, and became instead a helpless and highly reflexive bystander to students&#8217; learning. The findings suggest that the teaching values and practices of the performing/caring/directing lecturer, in particular lecturer-student responsiveness and reciprocity, do not adapt to online pedagogies. Indeed, blended learning establishes the conditions for a new moral order in university education, with the move to online facilitation best understood as a move to management-centred regulation of teaching and student learning. And so, overlooked in higher education policy and research, and ignored by her students online, the performing/caring/directing lecturer is under erasure, at the same time as the work of the facilitator is being archived.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lecturer.</field><field name="subject">Technology.</field><field name="subject">Teaching.</field><field name="subject">Academics.</field><field name="subject">Internet.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/391</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Scalable and cost-effective framework for continuous media-on-demand.</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Dang Nam Chi</field><field name="description">This dissertation was motivated by the exponential growth in bandwidth capacity of the Internet, coupled with the immense growth of broadband adoption by the public. This has led to the development of a wide variety of new online services. Chief amongst the emerging applications is the delivery of multimedia contents to the end users via the network on-demand. It is the &#8220;on-demand&#8221; aspect that has led to problems which, despite the advances in hardware technology and network capacity, have hampered wide scale adoption of multimedia delivery. The focus of this dissertation was to address these problems, namely: scalability, cost-effectiveness, and network quality of service for timely presentation of multimedia contents. We proposed an architecture, which we referred to as &#8220;Delayed-Multicast&#8221;, to address the scalability problem. The new architecture introduced buffers within the network to reduce demands on core network bandwidth and server load. A feasibility study of the architecture was conducted through the use of a prototype. It was found that such a system is within reach by demonstrating the prototype using cheap, common-of-the-shelf (COTS) components, and with help of freely available system software such Linux with real-time support. The introduction of buffers within the network led to the requirement of how to minimize buffer space. We developed an optimal algorithm for allocating buffer space in a single level caching layout (i.e. only one buffer in the transmission path from the server to the end user). For the case of multi-levels network caching, we thoroughly examined different optimization problems from an algorithmic perspective. These problems included how to minimize total system memory, and minimize the maximum memory used per node. We proved that determining the optimal buffer allocation in many of these iv v cases is an NP-complete problem. Consequently, we developed heuristics to handle multi-level caching and showed through simulations that the heuristics greatly help in minimizing buffer space and network bandwidth requirement. An important aspect of the heuristics was how to handle the case when the arrival times of client requests were not known a priori. For these &#8220;online&#8221; problems we also proposed heuristics that can significantly reduce overall system resource requirements. If the cost of buffer space was also taken into account along with the cost of network bandwidth, a different optimization problem was how to minimize the total system cost. Here, we also proposed heuristics, which in simulations show that the total system cost can be significantly reduced. Besides the problems associated with resource allocation, in terms of buffer space and bandwidth, we also examined the problem of how to provision the necessary network quality of service on-demand. Most current networks rely on best-effort delivery which is ill suited for the delivery of multimedia traffic. We proposed a solution which relied on the use of a programmable network plane, that is present in many current routers, to dynamically alter the priority of flows within the network in real-time. We also demonstrated the effectiveness of the flow prioritization on an actual Nortel router. Finally, we examined the problem of how to admit and achieve fair bandwidth allocation for the end-users within a Differentiated Service (DiffServ) network. Diff- Serv is an IETF standard that aims to provide a &#8220;better than best-effort&#8221; network in a scalable manner, and is used widely, especially within the same autonomous domain for prioritization different classes of traffic. However, there are open problems on how to provide fair bandwidth allocation amongst competing flows. We proposed an edge-aware resource discovery loop, which as the name suggests, sent packets to gather information about the internal states of the core network. With this information, we proposed a price-based admission control algorithm for use within the DiffServ network that would allow fair admission, effective congestion control, and fair bandwidth allocation amongst different traffic flows.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Streaming.</field><field name="subject">Technology.</field><field name="subject">Telecommunication.</field><field name="subject">Data transmission.</field><field name="subject">Interactive.</field><field name="subject">Multimedia.</field><field name="subject">Bandwidth.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/392</field></doc><doc><field name="title">OJS in an Hour</field><field name="creator">OJS, Team</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/393</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Birth dirt: relations of power in childbirth.</field><field name="creator">Callaghan, Helen M.</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the findings of a doctoral study which analysed video tapes of labouring Australian women at the end of the 20th century, historical data from midwifery and medical textbooks, consumer material, and personal experience as a midwifery student in 1970- 1971. The data analysis was achieved using discourse analysis, but was influenced by Michel Foucault together with anthropological and sociological approaches, particularly as these can be applied to visual material. &#8216;Dirt&#8217; is a commonly accepted term, but it becomes difficult to define as it is so dependant on the context. Since the discovery of the germ theory in the 19th century, however, it is difficult for western health professionals to conceive of dirt as being anything but unaesthetic, unhygienic and pathogenic. When analysing the data from this study, it became evident that birth and dirt have a close association. The changes that have occurred in childbirth have revolved around who and what is perceived as clean, and who and what is perceived as dirty. This thesis argues that &#8216;birth dirt&#8217; exists, but, its form will vary depending on the time, the place, and the culture, although it is always centred around the physical reality of birth. Video tapes of the birthing process indicate that midwives, in their ritualised behaviours of containing, controlling and cleaning up the &#8216;dirt&#8217; associated with birth, create a barrier between themselves and the women. &#8216;Dirt&#8217; in this instance is the &#8216;contaminating&#8217; body fluids and substances derived from the woman and her baby. The dirt relationship is a power relationship and the midwife is an essential part of its structure. The midwife is the dirty worker who maintains the cleanliness of the environment and controls the &#8216;dirt&#8217; during birth. There is considerable rhetoric about midwives as being &#8216;with woman&#8217;, but the reality is that the midwives are more often &#8216;with dirt&#8217;.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">childbirth</field><field name="subject">labouring</field><field name="subject">birthing</field><field name="subject">midwives</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/400</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Blood ties: and 'Kings. what a good idea' : monarchy in epic fantasy fiction.</field><field name="creator">Freeman, Pamela</field><field name="description">The thesis Blood Ties is a novel in the epic fantasy tradition.

It considers evidence from folktale research, primate behavioural studies, literary traditions, both ancient and modern, and the effect of religious doctrine and history on the symbolic role of the monarch.  Folktales are found to have had very little effect on the role of kings in epic fantasy, which has been influenced by a combination of literary traditions, including the Arthurian saga and the historical romances of Sir Walter Scott.  More profoundly, the meaning of the king&#8217;s role has been influenced by the Christian mythos in two ways:  the king is a Christ surrogate who sacrifices his own safety for the good of the body politic and, in being successful against evil, restores a version of Paradise/Eden for his people.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fantasy</field><field name="subject">fiction</field><field name="subject">monarchy</field><field name="subject">folktales</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/403</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Beyond the Scientology case: towards a better definition of what constitutes a religion for legal purposes in Australia having regard to salient judicial authorities from the United States of America as well as important non-judicial authorities.</field><field name="creator">Ellis-Jones, Ian.</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is to formulate a better definition of religion for legal purposes than the formulation arrived at by the High Court of Australia in the 1983 decision of Church of the New Faith v Commissioner of Pay-roll Tax (Vic). In that case, known in Australia as the Scientology (or Church of the New Faith) case, two of five justices of the High Court of Australia considered belief in a supernatural Being, Thing or Principle to be an essential prerequisite for a belief system being a religion. Two other justices stated that if such belief were absent it was unlikely that one had a religion. There are major problems with the High Court&#8217;s formulation in the Scientology case. First, it does not accommodate a number of important belief systems that are generally regarded as being religious belief systems, even though they do not involve any notion of the supernatural in the sense in which that word is ordinarily understood. Secondly, the Court provided little or no guidance as to how one determines whether a particular belief system involves a supernatural view of reality. The guidance that was given is ill-conceived in any event. Thirdly, it is philosophically impossible to postulate a meaningful distinction between the &#8220;natural&#8221; and the supposedly &#8220;supernatural&#8221; in a way that would enable the courts and other decision makers to meaningfully apply the &#8220;test&#8221; enunciated by the Court. The thesis combines a phenomenological approach and the philosophical realism of the late Professor John Anderson with a view to eliciting those things that permit appreciation or recognition of a thing being &#8220;religious&#8221;. Ultimately, religion is seen to comprise an amalgam of faith-based ideas, beliefs, practices and activities (which include doctrine, dogma, teachings or principles to be accepted on faith and on authority, a set of sanctioned ideals and values in terms of expected ethical standards and behavior and moral obligations, and various experientially based forms, ceremonies, usages and techniques perceived to be of spiritual or transformative power) based upon faith in a Power, Presence, Being or Principle and which are directed towards a celebration of that which is perceived to be not only ultimate but also divine, holy or sacred, manifest in and supported by a body of persons (consisting of one or more faithxvii based communities) established to give practical expression to those ideas, beliefs, practices and activities. The new definition is tested against 3 very different belief systems, Taoism (Daoism), Marxism and Freemasonry.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">faith</field><field name="subject">religion</field><field name="subject">religious</field><field name="subject">legal definition</field><field name="subject">law</field><field name="subject">belief</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/404</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploration of critical thinking in environmental subjects.</field><field name="creator">Carmichael, Christine (Erst)</field><field name="description">This qualitative research study investigated the expression of critical thinking in environmental subjects at university level in Australia. It also explored the strategies used by lecturers to encourage student critical thinking. Initially an open-ended questionnaire was sent to lecturers and tutors in universities across Australia and the responses from thirty participants were analysed thematically. From these participants semi-structured interviews were arranged with six lecturers and eight students from three different universities. The third phase of the research process involved analysing subject outlines and student assignments. Findings were triangulated to create a picture of the teaching and learning practices of critical thinking in this field. The three cases of Environmental Science, Environmental Engineering and Environmental Law were identified as having some common yet distinctively different themes in relation to critical thinking. In each discipline area three broad approaches to the expression of critical thinking were identified: scientific/technical, paradigmatic and reflective. The scientific/technical approach in science was most concerned with critique of experiments and studies, in engineering with problem solving and in law with the technical aspects of language and application of the law. The paradigmatic approach included critical analysis of the different theories, frameworks and paradigms of each subject. The reflective approach to critical thinking included students&#8217; self evaluation of their learning within a specific subject. Notable differences between the three cases were the types of strategies used by lecturers to encourage student critical thinking. The Environmental Science lecturers were more inclined to use a wide variety of strategies, including provision of written material about critical thinking with critical thinking identified in marking criteria, discussion in class and guided exercises. The Environmental Engineering lecturers placed more emphasis on discussion in class than on providing written materials. The Environmental Law lecturers predominantly focused on the strategy of debating in class for the development of student critical thinking. The findings of this study are significant in providing support for the argument that development of critical thinking is subject specific rather than generic. This calls into question the use of generic skills testing for university graduates as a reliable measure of their ability to think critically in their field. The findings indicate that it is necessary for subject lecturers to be explicit with students about their expectations regarding critical thinking, particularly in relation to assessment. Findings suggest guidelines for lecturers including strategies and attitudes that encourage or hinder student critical thinking. Findings also suggest that the nature of the field of environmental and sustainability subjects lends itself to developing critical thinking, which is considered to be important.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Critical thinking.</field><field name="subject">Environmental science.</field><field name="subject">Environmental engineering.</field><field name="subject">Environmental law.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/420</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Kolokol : spectres of the Russian bell.</field><field name="creator">Kaminski, Jason.</field><field name="description">Kolokol: Spectres of the Russian Bell, submitted by Jason Kaminski in fulfilment of the requirements of PhD (Humanities and Social Sciences) candidature at the University of Technology, Sydney, is an interpretative history of Russian bells (kolokola) and bell music (zvon). As a cultural object and sign, the Russian bell is associated with ideas of transcendence, and ideological and creative &#8216;vision.&#8217; This interpretation of the signification of the kolokol as a sign arises directly from the perception that the bell is essentially a physical (anthropomorphic) body that is capable of &#8216;projecting&#8217; or &#8216;transcending&#8217; itself in the form of a spectrum. This essential &#8216;spectrality&#8217; defines a history of the Russian bell as an instrument of magical, spiritual and religious ritual, as a cultural artefact associated with changing ideological movements (paganism, Christianity and communism) and as a sign represented synaesthetically in image, sound and text. Ethnographic and campanological studies observe that the kolokol &#8216;reflects Russian social history like a mirror&#8217;, representing the &#8216;voice of God&#8217; or Logos as an aural or &#8216;singing&#8217; icon, pointing to the primordial origins of language. This dissertation further investigates the idea that the kolokol acts as an &#8216;acoustical mirror&#8217; and &#8216;ideological apparatus&#8217;: a medium or spectre through which Russian history and culture is interpellated and reflected. The various logical streams (storytelling, legend, script, text, song, cultural theory, philosophy and ethnography) that contribute to this dissertation form a textual &#8216;polyphony&#8217; through which the essential meanings and &#8216;personae&#8217; of the kolokol as a cultural object are interpreted. The bell is regarded as presenting an enigma of signification that must be resolved through investigation and definition. The thesis concludes that the kolokol acts as an iconic sign of the creative &#8216;Word&#8217; (Logos) and as a symbolic sign that implies a &#8216;bridge&#8217;, copula or psychic &#8216;hook&#8217;, articulating the relationship between the cosmos and consciousness, the material and spiritual, the real and imaginary.

There has been considerable examination of cultural value in relation to museums. However, little is known about how value is created, captured and exchanged for stakeholders in new museums. It is posited that value creation, capture and exchange constitute a value cycle. Through this value cycle management in new museums detects and limits the liability of newness. The ability to detect and limit the liability of newness enables the continuation of the museum. If the liability of newness is not limited, it may mean that a new museum exits the sector or is transformed. The concept of a value cycle is derived from an examination of the nonprofit management literature, aspects of the for-profit management literature and the arts and museum management literature. Value creation is a key concept in the three literature areas. Value creation in this context, is specifically defined as the worth of the physical manifestation of the museum. It resides in the building and the collection, services and programs within the building. It is suggested that this value needs to be transformed and consumed by a range of stakeholders. The transformation of value creation is denoted as value capture. Value capture is the appeal of programs, projects and activities. Value capture includes how well the products and services align with particular stakeholders, how accountable the managers are to stakeholders and how products and services are consumed by stakeholders. The measure of how managers have been able to capture value is in the realm of value exchange. Value exchange is the merit of programs, projects and activities. Value exchange is in the form of revenue raised through sponsorship; continuation of revenue investment by the principal stakeholder, the state; time and money transacted by visitors; and intangible exchange such as leadership and reputation enhancement through collaborations. A Value Cycle Framework of New Entrant Museums is then developed as a working analytical tool to assess how the value cycle operates and how the liability of newness is detected and limited by museum management. x The Value Cycle Framework is used to assess four cases. These case studies include the National Museum of Australia as a purpose built new entrant; the Australian National Maritime Museum as a purpose built new entrant; the Mint as a recycled new entrant; and the Earth Exchange as a refurbished new entrant. Each case is assessed discretely using secondary and primary source material and analysing qualitative data generated from interviews with key stakeholders. The cases are then compared in order to track similarities and differences in relation to value creation, capture and exchange. The research findings suggest that a value cycle is operating in relation to new entrant museums. This value cycle is dynamic and non-sequential. Until value creation is floated for a range of stakeholders it is difficult for managers to know the worth of their content, location or their building. Value creation is a nominal starting point, signifying the arrival of a new entrant in the museum marketplace. However, value capture is the zone that is the most vulnerable and volatile for managers of new museums. Typically in these case studies value capture includes a disruptive episode, such as a review process that indicates the liability of newness. Managers within the museum who can respond and resolve contradictions between museological beliefs and the demands of stakeholders (and in so doing limit the liability of newness) are likely to continue museum operations. Senior executives who find such reconciliation more difficult, jeopardize the future operations of the museum to such an extent that the museums close or are transformed within the museum sector. Through these four case studies a revised Value Cycle Framework is developed as an analytical device. This analytical framework can assist in understanding the processes involved in new entry for museums.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">museums</field><field name="subject">value capture</field><field name="subject">value exchange</field><field name="subject">value cycle</field><field name="subject">museum management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/422</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Support services for adolescents and young adults with cancer or a blood disorder : measurement properties and validation of quality of life instruments for adolescents and young adults with cancer or a blood disorder.</field><field name="creator">Ewing, Jane Elizabeth.</field><field name="description">Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) is an important outcomes measure in cancer and there are specific issues depending on the site, stage, treatment and patient age. Although numerous instruments are available for cancer HRQOL, most are designed for adults, some for children, but none for adolescents and young adults (AYA) who have special age-specific concerns and poor improvement in survival compared with other age groups. An existing HRQOL instrument was modified to ensure its suitability for AYA, its validity, reliability and sensitivity were tested in Australians aged 16 to 25 years old diagnosed with cancer or a blood disorder. Varni&#8217;s PedsQLTM Measurement Model (13-18 year olds) was selected, modified then administered to families recruited from haematology/oncology clinics and wards at three Sydney Metropolitan Hospitals in person or by telephone. The Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale was used to categorise participants into groups reflecting sensitivity of symptom severity (slight, moderate and severe).  The instruments demonstrated excellent internal consistency reliability, making them suitable for both group and individual comparisons. Clinical validity, construct validity, and discriminant validity were demonstrated by &#8220;known-groups&#8221; analysis, exploratory factor analysis and correlations, respectively. These new versions of the PedsQL Generic Core and Cancer Module are reliable, valid and sensitive measures of HRQOL in patients aged 16-25 years diagnosed with cancer or a blood disorder. The measures will soon be available for use as outcome measures in clinical trials and clinical practice with this age cohort in Australasia and internationally.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cancer</field><field name="subject">blood disorder</field><field name="subject">adolescents</field><field name="subject">young adults</field><field name="subject">quality of life</field><field name="subject">clinical practice</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/423</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Queer cinema as a fifth cinema in South Africa and Australia.</field><field name="creator">Peach, Ricardo.</field><field name="description">Australia had the world&#8217;s first gay film festival at the Sydney Filmmakers Co-op in June 1976, part of a larger commemoration of the Stonewall Riots in New York City of 1969. In 1994, South Africa became the first country in the world to prohibit discrimination in its constitution on the basis of sexual orientation, whilst allowing for positive discrimination to benefit persons disadvantaged by unfair discrimination. South Africa and Australia, both ex-British colonies, are used in this analysis to explore the way local Queer Cinematic Cultures have negotiated and continue to negotiate dominant social forces in post-colonial settings. It is rare to have analyses of Queer Cinematic Cultures and even rarer to have texts dealing with cultures outside those of Euro-America. This study offers a unique window into the formations of Queer Cinematic Cultures of two nations of the &#8216;South&#8217;. It reveals important new information on how sexual minorities from nations outside the Euro-American sphere have dealt with and continue to deal with longstanding Queer cinematic oppressions. A pro-active relationship between Queer representation in film and social-political action is considered by academics such as Dennis Altman to be essential for significant social and judicial change. The existence of Queer and other independent films in Sydney from the 1960s onward, impacted directly on sexuality, race and gender activism. In South Africa, the first major Queer film festival, The Out In Africa Gay and Lesbian Film Festival in 1994, was instrumental in developing and maintaining a post-Apartheid Queer public sphere which fostered further legal change. Given the significant histories of activism through Queer Cinematic Cultures in both Australia and South Africa, I propose in this thesis the existence of a new genus of cinema, which I term Fifth Cinema. Fifth Cinema includes Feminist Cinema, Queer Cinema and Immigrant/Multicultural Cinema and deals with the oppressions which cultures engage with within their own cultural boundaries. It can be informed by First Cinema (classical, Hollywood), Second Cinema (Art House or dual national cinemas), Third and Fourth Cinema (cinemas dealing with the decolonisation of Third World and Fourth World people), but it develops its unique characteristics by countering internal cultural colonisation. Fifth Cinema functions as a heterognosis, where multi-dimensional representations around sexuality, race and gender are used to assist in broader cultural liberation.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">homosexuality</field><field name="subject">gays</field><field name="subject">queer culture</field><field name="subject">sexuality</field><field name="subject">motion pictures</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/425</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contemporary tiger girls : women and enterprise in the People's Republic of China, 2003-2005.</field><field name="creator">Chen, Minglu.</field><field name="description">The existing scholarship on women in China suggests that gender inequality still exists against the background of the country&#8217;s reform and opening in recent years. However, the situation of women in enterprise ownership and leadership seems to indicate that under the surface of women being disadvantaged, some of them are playing a more active and significant role in China&#8217;s economic development. Based on a series of interviews with women enterprise owners, wives of enterprise owners and women managers conducted in three localities in three difference provinces of China, this research aims to discover the deeper socio-political realities of leading women in enterprises. By analyzing information on these women&#8217;s personal experiences, career and families, this thesis investigates their status at work and at home, as well as their connections with local politics. The research results suggest that although traces of gender inequality can still be found in these women&#8217;s lives, they appear to be actively engaged in the business establishment and operation and gradually casting off the leash of domestic responsibilities. At the same time, these women have developed strong connections with the Party-state, not necessarily in their own right, but largely through their family ties. The research has also highlighted that the varied socio-economic development of each locality has its effects on these women&#8217;s development.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">businesswomen</field><field name="subject">entrepreneurs</field><field name="subject">enterprise</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">inequality</field><field name="subject">interviews</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/426</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The information technology adoption process within Indonesian small and medium enterprises.</field><field name="creator">Sarosa, Samiaji.</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the adoption process of Information Technology (IT)-based solutions within small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Indonesia, in the furniture and handicraft industries. As the Indonesian SMEs grew in size, they faced new problems in managing their businesses. They have tried to use IT to support their business and resolve some of these problems. Yet in their efforts to adopt IT, they often faced new problems by introducing new technology into the organisation. The thesis examines the experiences of 35 Indonesian SMEs when they adopted IT. We investigated what factors were influencing IT adoption; the process of IT adoption which covers decision making, implementation or deployment and evaluation; and how SMEs cope with and recover from failure. The participants&#8217; experiences were compared to what has been reported in the existing literature. Analysis of the relevant research literature revealed some unexplored issues concerning IT adoption within SMEs. Most of the published research has been conducted in developed countries, with little in developing or less developed countries. From those few, only one was conducted in Indonesia and it was about IT diffusion. The focus of previous studies was mainly to explore factors influencing IT adoption and they mostly utilised survey techniques to elicit the factors. The scant literature suggests that exploring IT adoption can be approached from three different perspectives: individualist, structuralist, and interactive process. This thesis uses the interactive process approach to explore how well those factors that have been well documented in the literature actually work in Indonesian SMEs&#8217; IT adoption. As a result of our exploration, we formulated a model of an interactive process view of IT adoption within Indonesian SMEs. A qualitative approach was used to answer research questions and explore the participants&#8217; experiences in depth. In this thesis, we used in-depth interviews to explore participants&#8217; experiences. These interviews enabled us to draw out not only IT adoption processes but also successes and failures in IT adoption. Semi-structured interviews were used as the data collection tool. They provided guidance so the interviews stayed well within the focus of the thesis, yet provided room to explore new and relevant issues that emerged during the interview process. Content analysis of the interview transcripts was used to extract answers given during the semi-structured interviews and to identify new themes that emerged from the data. The analysis resulted in important findings. First, it confirms some factors found in the literature as actually influencing IT adoption in Indonesian SMEs. Despite some similarities, we found some differences such as government role and competitors&#8217; influence on IT adoption. The other findings are concerned with the failures faced by some of the participants. We then explore the differences between failed and successful participants, and how Indonesian SMEs cope with and recover from failed IT deployment. Finally, we revised the initial model of the interactive process of IT adoption. The extended model captures new insights into success and failure of IT adoption, and could provide a better understanding of IT adoption within Indonesian SMEs. The interaction between different factors in the IT adoption shows how those factors influence each other and how different stakeholders could manage their own interests related to IT adoption. The improved model could be used to guide Indonesian SME managers to manage their adoption of IT more effectively.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">small business</field><field name="subject">medium enterprises</field><field name="subject">information technology</field><field name="subject">Indonesia</field><field name="subject">IT adoption</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/427</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electrical conductivity imaging of aquifers connected to watercourses : a thesis focused on the Murray Darling Basin, Australia.</field><field name="creator">Allen, David Andrew.</field><field name="description">Electrical imaging of groundwater that interacts with surface watercourses provides detail on the extent of intervention needed to accurately manage both resources. It is particularly important where one resource is saline or otherwise polluted, where spatial quantification of the interacting resources is critical to water use planning and where losses from surface waterways need to be minimized in order to transport water long distances. Geo-electric arrays or transient electromagnetic devices can be towed along watercourses to image electrical conductivity (EC) at multiple depths within and beneath those watercourses. It has been found that in such environments, EC is typically related primarily to groundwater salinity and secondarily to clay content. Submerged geo-electric arrays can detect detailed canal-bottom variations if correctly designed. Floating arrays pass obstacles easily and are good for surveying constricted rivers and canals. Transient electromagnetic devices detect saline features clearly but have inferior ability to detect fine changes just below beds of watercourses. All require that water depth be measured by sonar or pressure sensors for successful elimination of effects of the water layer on the data. The meandering paths of rivers and canals, combined with the sheer volume of data typically acquired in waterborne surveys, results in a geo-referencing dilemma that cannot be accommodated using either 2D imaging or 3D voxel imaging. Because of this, software was developed by the author which allows users to view vertical section images wrapped along meandering paths in 3D space so that they resemble ribbons. Geo-electric arrays suitable for simultaneous imaging of both shallow and deep strata need exponentially spread receiver electrodes and elongated transmitter electrodes. In order to design and facilitate such arrays, signed monopole notation for arrays with iv segmented elongated electrodes was developed. The new notation greatly simplified generalized geo-electric array equations and led to processing efficiency. It was used in the development of new array design software and automated inversion software including a new technique for stable inversion of datasets including data with values below noise level. The Allen Exponential Bipole (AXB) array configuration was defined as a collinear arrangement of 2 elongated transmitter electrodes followed by receiver electrodes spaced exponentially from the end of the second transmitter electrode. A method for constructing such geo-electric arrays for use in rivers and canals was developed and the resulting equipment was refined during the creation of an extensive set of EC imaging case studies distributed across canals and rivers of the Australian Murray- Darling Basin. Man made and natural variations in aquifers connected to those canals and rivers have been clearly and precisely identified in more than 1000 kilometres of EC imagery.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electric conductivity.</field><field name="subject">Electromagnetic.</field><field name="subject">Conductivity.</field><field name="subject">Aquifers.</field><field name="subject">Watercourses.</field><field name="subject">Murray Darling Basin.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/428</field></doc><doc><field name="title">States of exclusion : narratives from Australia's immigration detention centres, 1999-2003.</field><field name="creator">Browning, Julie.</field><field name="description">This thesis interrogates immigration detention as a space of intricate ambivalence - one which seeks to exclude, but which is also entreated to protect. The focus is so-called &#8216;unauthorised&#8217; asylum seekers detained both within Australia and offshore on the Pacific island of Nauru between 1999 and 2003 - when the numbers of detained asylum seekers reached its maximum and the government introduced offshore processing centres.  Australia&#8217;s immigration detention regime sits awkwardly with the discourse of universal human rights and brings into sharp conflict two robust political values: the right of endangered people to seek refuge and the right of the nation to determine who will enter.  Focusing on the experiences of detainees reveals immigration detention as a complex regime through which the state&#8217;s dominating power targets the stateless, non-white, male body. This targeting is intentional, serving to secure sovereign borders and to rearticulate the naturalised ties between the national population and the modern state.  Immigration detention holds the seeker in a limbo that sets parameters for the seeker&#8217;s experience of ongoing and intensifying insecurity. It specifically and intentionally fractures the identity of detainees: masochistic actions and collective protests, from hunger strikes to breakouts, reflect the common currency of anxiety and violence.  The creation of offshore camps was, in part, a response to ongoing protests within onshore detention and the failure of onshore detention to stop boat arrivals. My chief focus here is the largest Pacific camp, &#8216;Topside&#8217;, on the island of Nauru. Unlike the onshore detention centres where publicised protests and breakouts screamed of continuing detention of asylum seekers, those on Nauru were effectively silenced. The thesis explores purpose as inscribed within the body of the exile. To give up hope for asylum is to face the possibility of endless wandering and death. Mechanisms of resistance, whether explicit protest or more passive waiting, are parts of the continuing struggle by the detained against mechanisms of exclusion and exception. The detained carve out small openings to contest their exclusion and to reassert an identity as survivors.  There is a complex and fluid interplay between such resistance and government policies aiming to silence protest and limit identity &#8211; and ultimately to deter all unauthorised boat arrivals.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">detention centres</field><field name="subject">asylum seekers</field><field name="subject">human rights</field><field name="subject">immigration</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/441</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship between team characteristics with team performance in Malaysian teams.</field><field name="creator">Heng, Siok Sim Agatha</field><field name="description">University of Technology, Sydney.Faculty of Business.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Teams.</field><field name="subject">Workplace.</field><field name="subject">Performance.</field><field name="subject">Malaysian.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/522</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Corpus modificatus: transmutational belonging and posthuman becoming.</field><field name="creator">Massie, Raya</field><field name="description">University of Technology, Sydney.

A criticism of some past research into IS/business alignment is that it has ignored organisational complexity and context. This is partly due to the dominant paradigm in use within IS research. One result of this paradigm is that there are numerous prescriptions provided in the literature for improving alignment but little in the way of theory development that explains the behaviour of practitioners when confronted with the task of attaining alignment. To address these criticisms a grounded theory approach was adopted using a coding family that encouraged the discovery of systems of interaction between variables rather than assuming linear causality. Data was collected via three unstructured focus groups that limited the effect of prior reading of the literature, an important consideration when conducting a grounded theory study. These were followed by semi-structured individual interviews. The instruments for the latter were developed after the focus group interviews were analysed, so reducing the impact of a prior reading. Analysis of the focus group interviews found that the major concern of practitioners was aligning IS strategies to either business strategies documented in business plans or the business strategies in use. This is a similar result to earlier alignment research. As a result of analysis of the focus group interviews the research question stabilised. This research investigated how factors within an organisational setting impact the ability of senior IT managers to identify, then act upon, the business strategies in use. It confirmed many of the enablers and inhibitors to alignment identified in earlier research. However, it also identified two variables that are rarely given prominence in the literature: the mental models held by managers; and the motivation and measurement schemes applied to managers. It is believed that both these variables have a significant impact on the alignment of IS and business strategies. The theory developed here demonstrates that a system of variables will tend to encourage IT managers to either collaborate with their business peers, or retreat from the business and concentrate on providing a low cost reliable technical IT solution. In the former situation alignment of IT managers&#8217; actions to those of their business peers is encouraged. In the latter situation there will be little alignment between business and IS strategies nor between the actions of business and IT managers. A feedback loop of actions by actors within the system tends to reinforce the situation making a change in response extremely problematic. This, then, helps explain the intractable nature of alignment that has been observed for many years.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Information technology.</field><field name="subject">Information systems.</field><field name="subject">Grounded theory.</field><field name="subject">Management information systems.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/650</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of suicide grief: meaning making and the griever's relational world.</field><field name="creator">Sands, Diana Catherine Cook.</field><field name="description">University of Technology, Sydney.

However, while various theorists show that deliberation is applied to democratic effect in an assortment of arrangements (such as interpersonal relationships, new social movements and international negotiations), there appears to be a hesitation in theorising the means to improve the deliberative functioning of currently existing representative institutions. This thesis argues that despite the many limitations of representative democracy, and of the mass media which act as its key deliberative forum, currently existing models of representative democracy still offer formal and practical opportunities for collective deliberation in rhetorical exchanges among citizens, particularly, but by no means exclusively, in the course of the election campaign. Consideration of recent democratic theory suggests that the quantity and quality of democratic deliberation in a range of particular situations may be assessed against a set of criteria: access, transparency, feedback and coordination. For citizens to make use of the deliberative opportunities raised by the election campaign requires, it is argued, the creation of a contemporary rhetoric. This thesis addresses that process by reviewing the roots of rhetorical practice and theory in tribal and bardic methods used to produce social cohesion, in the activities of the Sophists in Greek, and particularly Athenian, direct democracy and in the practical reason of Aristotle's seminal text. This thesis then proceeds to consider the rhetorical techniques, employed in two recent election campaigns, which overcame the preconceptions of academic and media commentators to produce "upset" results by successfully engaging, it is argued, the citizen-audience in a meta-narrative of rhetorical exchange. From consideration of these three case studies, an account of a rhetoric emerges as a technical and instrumental discipline. While a contemporary version of political rhetoric may be derived from campaign practices in the electoral context, that rhetoric is also capable of utilising the mass media for much broader deliberative purposes and the potential for marginal and critical political forces to apply these activities more widely is explored. Central to the development of new, deliberative accounts of rhetoric is a return to Aristotle to appreciate the ethical import of rhetoric. A contemporary approach to rhetoric, arising from an emerging account of citizenship as participatory, deliberative, global and "media-active" is considered.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Political campaigns.</field><field name="subject">Voting.</field><field name="subject">Democracy.</field><field name="subject">Representative government and representation.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/836</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Moving and making strange: a design methodology for movement-based interactive technologies.</field><field name="creator">Loke, Lian</field><field name="description">This thesis develops and presents a design methodology that enables designers to work with the moving body in the design and evaluation of interactive, immersive environments built on motion-sensing technologies. The notion of making strange, that underpins the methodology, calls for designers to re-examine and revitalise their assumptions and conceptions of the moving body through bodily-based movement inquiries. This thesis addresses research questions about ways of understanding human movement, of describing and representing human movement and of accessing the felt experience of the moving body in the emerging field of movement-based interaction design. The research questions were explored through a series of three distinct, yet related, projects, each one focusing on different aspects of designing for moving bodies in interactive, immersive environments. The first project analysed an existing interactive product, Sony Playstation2c  EyetoyTM, as a prototype of future movement-based interactive, immersive environments. The second project involved the design and development of a specific interactive, immersive artwork, Bystander. The third project worked with trained dancers and physical performers in a constructed design situation. The contributions of this research are first and foremost the design methodology of Moving and Making Strange: a design approach to movement-based interaction that prioritises the lived experience of movement by both designers and users and values the creative potential of the experiential, moving body. It consists of methods and tools for exploring, experiencing, describing, representing and generating movement that enable designers to shift between the multiple perspectives of the mover, the observer and the machine. It makes particular contributions as follows: &#8226; Laban movement analysis and Labanotation as a design tool. &#8226; Moving-Sensing schema: Suchman&#8217;s analytic framework adapted as a design tool. &#8226; Extension of existing human-centred design tools to explicitly represent moving bodies, in the form of movement-oriented personas and movementoriented scenarios. &#8226; Patterns of watching: a catalogue of audience behaviour in terms of movements and stillness in relation to engagement with a specific interactive, immersive artwork. &#8226; New methods for generating, enacting and experiencing movement, sourced from dance and movement improvisation practices.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Human-computer interaction.</field><field name="subject">Interactive computer systems.</field><field name="subject">Motion-sensing technologies.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/837</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bayesian methods for modelling and management of trust in wireless sensor networks.</field><field name="creator">Momani, Mohammad.</field><field name="description">Security and trust are two interdependent concepts and are often used interchangeably when defining a secure wireless sensor network (WSN) system. However, security is different from trust in that, it assumes no node is trustworthy and requires ongoing authentication using sophisticated protocols leading to high communication and computation overheads. This makes the traditional cryptographic security tools hard, if not impossible, to be used in wireless sensor networks that are severely resource constrained. Trust on the other hand is the exact opposite of security in that any node can interact with any other and requires no authentication and unwrapping of hidden keys to carry on with their business and hence carries zero overhead. However, this leads to the miss-use and abuse of networks causing loss and damage to the owners of the networks. This thesis focuses on developing novel methods for modelling and managing trust that enable WSN to be secure while significantly reducing computing and communication overheads. Although researchers have been studying the problem of trust modelling and management in wireless sensor networks for over a decade, their focus was on the trust associated with routing messages between nodes (communication trust). However, wireless sensor networks are mainly deployed to sense the world and report data, both continuous and discrete. However, there are no methods in the literature that focus on the trust associated with misreporting data (data trust). In this thesis, we model the trust associated with the integrity of the data, and propose methods to combine the data trust with the communication trust to infer the total trust. Bayesian probabilistic approach is used to model and manage trust. A new risk assessment algorithm for establishing trust in wireless sensor networks based on the quality of services characteristics of sensor nodes, using the traditional weighting approach is introduced. Then a Beta distribution is used to model communication trust (due to its binary nature) and determine the weights in terms of the Beta distribution parameters to probabilistically combine direct and indirect trust. The thesis extends the Bayesian probabilistic approach to model data trust for cases when the sensed data is continuous. It introduces the Gaussian trust and reputation system to that accounts for uncertain characteristics of sensor data. Finally we introduce a Bayesian fusion algorithm to combine the data trust and communication trust to infer the overall trust between nodes. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate how the models accurately classify different nodes as being trustworthy or not based on their reliability in sensor reporting and routing functions.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wireless sensor networks.</field><field name="subject">Wireless communication systems.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/838</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reading in the margins : EAP reading pedagogies and their critical, postcritical potential.</field><field name="creator">Wilson, Kate</field><field name="description">International students for whom English is an additional language (EAL) commonly undertake preparatory classes in English for Academic Purposes (EAP), delivered in language institutes which exist as independent commercial colleges on the margins of the university. EAP has been criticized for taking a purely pragmatic approach of &#8216;skilling up&#8217; students rather than taking a critical, &#8216;literacies&#8217; approach appropriate to the rapidly globalising, &#8216;liquid&#8217; contexts of the twenty-first century (Doherty &amp; Singh, 2005; Lea &amp; Street, 2006; Luke, 2002b). In this thesis, I explore the ways in which EAP reading pedagogies in Australian universities are responding to this call for a more critical approach, asking the question: Do learning environments in EAP support the development of critical reading practices, and if so, how? In seeking answers to this question, I used an ethnographic-ecological methodology (van Lier, 2004b) to gain an understanding of reading pedagogy in three EAP learning environments. The study inevitably generated vast amounts of &#8216;messy&#8217; data, including transcriptions of classes, observation notes, interviews and examples of students&#8217; written work. Using Christie&#8217;s tools of Classroom Discourse Analysis (Christie, 2002) in combination with Engestr&#246;m&#8217;s third generation Activity Theory (Engestr&#246;m, 1999; Lantolf &amp; Thorne, 2006) it was possible to generate a holistic analysis of the interaction between the multiple, intersecting elements of each environment. I argue that more attention needs to be paid to &#8216;critical engagement&#8217; in EAP pedagogy. The data suggest that conditions for such a pedagogy entail a negotiation of goals; texts and tasks which present high challenge as well as high support (Hammond &amp; Gibbons, 2005); and a positive and productive classroom community (D&#246;rnyei &amp; Murphey, 2003). The study challenges teachers to see their role not as &#8216;arbiters of meaning&#8217;, mediating texts FOR students, but as setting up learning environments which scaffold students&#8217; direct engagement and dialogue WITH texts, so that they themselves can experience legitimate participation in constructing meaning, and develop an emerging identity as critical readers. Finally, I argue that the constraints of EAP in its marginalised position on the periphery of increasingly commercialised universities militate against the possibility of a richly critical, postcritical pedagogy. EAP can, however, begin to sow the seeds of critical reading practices, orienting students towards an active, dialogic engagement with the texts they will meet in the coming years at university.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English for academic purposes.</field><field name="subject">Academic writing.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/839</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hegemony, anti-hegemony and counter-hegemony : control, resistance and coups in Fiji.</field><field name="creator">Ramesh, Sanjay</field><field name="description">The thesis argues that the colonial state in Fiji was founded upon ethno-cultural divisions, which continued in the post-colonial period with the establishment of indigenous chiefly political hegemony. By using a neo-Gramscian analytical framework based on the centrality of the role of ethnicity and culture in the study of colonial and post-colonial societies, the thesis develops three inter-related themes for the analysis of Fiji&#8217;s political history: the role of colonial culture, the importance of ethno-cultural divisions, and the changing role of the military in hegemony, antihegemony and counter-hegemony. The thesis proposes a dynamic model of decolonisation that conceptualises Fiji&#8217;s post-colonial political history in terms of hegemonic cycles that sees indigenous chiefly hegemony subside into factionalisation of the indigenous polity, inter-ethnic alliances and coercive indigenous assertion. These cycles operate as a product of conflict between hegemonic, anti-hegemonic and counter-hegemonic forces. The study finds that the hegemonic cycles were interrupted by a failed indigenous coercive phase in 2000 which led to military counter-hegemony and the ouster of the indigenous political order in 2006. The thesis notes that the re-alignment of indigenous political forces, following the latest military intervention, had the potential to re-instate the hegemonic cycles. The neo-Gramscian model developed in the thesis has a projective element and can be used to analyse the role of ethnicity and culture in colonial and postcolonial hegemonies such as in the South Pacific region.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fiji.</field><field name="subject">Coups d'&#233;tat.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/840</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Economy of nature: a genealogy of the concepts 'growth' and 'equilibrium' as artefacts of metaphorical exchange between the natural and the social sciences.</field><field name="creator">Walker, Jeremy R.</field><field name="description">Presently, the more or less global political consensus is that the primary task of government is to perpetually maximise a quantity called 'economic growth'. Given the decline of 'socialist' models of industrialisation, the economic consensus is that economic growth is best achieved through the deregulation of markets, industry and trade, as free markets are self-regulating institutions that automatically and efficiently optimise growth through their tendency to reach 'equilibrium.' Another word for this consensus might be 'neoliberalism'. This cosy situation, however, is increasingly under challenge from the recent transformation of global warming from a deniable proposition to a clear and present danger. As ecologists and earth scientists have long argued, global warming (an unforeseen side effect of what was called the 'energy crisis' in the 1970s) is just one of many aspects of a generalised global ecological crisis. The biosphere, environmentalists tell us, is radically 'out of balance'. Given this impasse, it appears that the science of social systems (economics) and the science of living systems (ecology) are incommensurable. This incommensurability is the starting point of the thesis, which seeks to provide a genealogy of the concepts of equilibrium and growth as they appear in the claims of both disciplines to represent 'hard' science. Drawing from debates in the philosophy of science, studies in the history of ideas, the anthropology of technology, and political economy, the thesis charts the mutual exchange of metaphors and analogies between the natural and the social sciences, and traces a surprisingly parallel trajectory in the separate histories of economics and ecology. Beginning with early historicist and organicist conceptual frameworks, both sciences embraced 'mechanism' in their bid to attain the mantle of Science. For both sciences, the attainment of this status was associated with the incorporation of the language of energetics and an insistent identification of 'equilibrium' with the central scientific object of inquiry, 'the market' and 'the ecosystem' respectively. What is ironic in these claims is that the acceptance of the machine metaphor effecti vely screened out the study of actual machinery from the pure states of nature called 'the market' or 'the economy.' This history is taken up to the climactic moment of the early 1970s, when, it is argued, the ontological foundations of ecology and economics collided. This is the moment from which the political discourses of neoliberal globalisation and global environmental crisis both date, and since then we see the rise of hybrid discourses that attempt to address and overcome the deep contradictions of disciplinary specialisation. The thesis concludes with a brief discussion of the implications of this conceptual legacy, and in analysing the interactions of the 'new ecology' and the 'new economy', offers suggestions as to why what appeared in 1971 as a fundamental and obvious contradiction between 'growth' and 'equilibrium', no longer attracts debate.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Equilibrium (Economics)</field><field name="subject">Economic development.</field><field name="subject">Sustainable development.</field><field name="subject">Environmentalism.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/841</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Business orientated resource diversification in smaller social service nonprofits: why some are adopting and others are not.</field><field name="creator">Feeney, Melisah Carol</field><field name="description">One of the current key challenges for nonprofit social service organisations is how to diversify resource mobilisation practices in order to build sustainable organisations that can innovatively achieve social mission. Two approaches to resource mobilisation that are promoted within Australia are social enterprise and partnering with business. Both of these approaches involve a re-orientation toward business, either in management practices or through an enduring relationship. Despite an increased interest in business-focused resource mobilisation strategies there are few successful examples of social enterprise and partnering with business emerging across the nonprofit sector.

The thesis analyses data from fourteen organisational case studies of nonprofit social service organisations located across Australia. Seven of these organisations were selected because they had adopted an enterprising form of resource mobilisation and had been recognised for their achievements in this area.

Considerable competition for these students from the UK and USA indicates the necessity of meeting their needs if the Australian higher education market is to be preserved. Recent research has challenged the effectiveness of the currently operating Australian marketisation model that focuses upon attracting students and maximizing profits. International students, and specifically Japanese students who were the focus of this research, are attracted to Australian university studies for a number of reasons which are analyzed. The numbers of Japanese students studying at Australian universities have fallen since 2006, despite Japan being potentially one of the largest international markets. The learning needs and expectations of 51 Japanese undergraduate and postgraduate students at two Sydney universities were analyzed using a questionnaire and semi-structured interview during their first semester of enrollment. The expectations and needs of these students had been shaped by growing up and being educated in Japan, a culture that values university education in different ways to Australia, and has different views on learning and study. Analyses of Australian academic culture, that emphasizes individuality and critical thinking, together with analyses of Japanese values and cultural mores, provided the foundations to guide the study and help formulate the questions used to gather data. Results revealed a considerable proportion of respondents were postgraduates contrary to the expectation that the market is chiefly an undergraduate one. It was found that only approximately thirty per cent of students had come to Australia for primarily educational reasons. The other seventy per cent had been attracted to Australia the country and its culture, and had been motivated for personal development reasons and to satisfy challenges pertaining, in some cases, to English language acquisition. These findings reflect earlier research based on ESL classes. The majority appear to have been motivated by liberal education reasons, with explanation of the process engaged in, with so little serious preparation, perhaps best accounted for in terms of Hart&#8217;s (1999) work on the hero&#8217;s personal journey with its substantial challenges. Results indicated that a considerable number of students at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels experienced difficulties with a number of basic academic skills expected at Australian universities. These included listening to and understanding lectures, note taking in lectures, reading for assignments, writing assignments, discussing studies with Australian students, and group work activities generally that required public presentation and argument. The majority had done little reading or other preparation for their educational adventure in a foreign Australian culture, although many were aware of the fact that their undertaking would be hard, having spoken to other Japanese students. Relatively few appeared to have been influenced by family members who had undertaken international study. All had been admitted on the basis of IELTS or TOEFL standards set by the universities, but had studied English in preparation for their international studies for relatively short periods of time, with this apparently contributing to their problems with Australian academic skills. Findings indicate that most of these students continued to frame their intercultural experience in terms of the Japanese cultural scenario, leading in many cases to academic and socio-cultural expectations at odds with Australian university expectations of the roles these students should play. Specific recommendations are made regarding the need for university policies to ensure that Japanese students are made aware of academic and socio-cultural differences and challenges before enrollment, and are offered programs that will develop specific academic skills. The analyses of the culturally-based academic learning difficulties encountered by students in this research should provide a substantial guide for specific skill development programs. Some of the expectations, that would be appropriate in the Japanese cultural setting, cannot be accommodated in the Australian one, and need to be managed prior to enrollment. On the wider policy level, there is also a serious need to reconsider the standards of English required for admission. Recommendations are made for a larger scale, longitudinal study to be undertaken to address issues that could not be considered in what was essentially an exploratory study. The analyses of Japanese cultural values and social expectations, presented as part of this research, would appear to offer a substantial basis to assist institutions and staff to better understand Japanese students and their learning needs in the Australian academic cultural context, and to guide both research and teaching. In policy terms, results indicate that there is a clear need to reconsider the marketisation model and spend more on support services for the students who have paid full fees. Results also indicate that the policies advanced by government policy makers linking tourism and university study are relatively na&#239;ve, and cannot succeed without better understanding of the needs and expectations of international students from different cultural backgrounds, and better support services carefully tailored to their needs.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Japanese students.</field><field name="subject">Fee paying students.</field><field name="subject">International students.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/846</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Business orientated resource diversification in smaller social service nonprofits: why some are adopting and others are not.</field><field name="creator">Feeney, Melisah Carol</field><field name="description">One of the current key challenges for nonprofit social service organisations is how to diversify resource mobilisation practices in order to build sustainable organisations that can innovatively achieve social mission.

As there is limited research on fans of new sport teams, this study sought to redress this situation by seeking to explain and measure new team identification. Through investigating new team identification, this study extends current applications of social identity theory and understanding of fans of a new sport team. Additionally, by measuring new team identification, this thesis contributes a valid and reliable measure of the construct, and discovery of key themes driving the formation and development of new team identification. A mixed-method research design was used to investigate the central thesis topic. A case study of members of a new sport team, Sydney FC, provided the sample population. The research design included two surveys, administered at the end of the new team&#8217;s first and second seasons, respectively, in addition to twenty-one interviews undertaken to deepen understanding of new team identification. The Sports Spectator Identity Scale (SSIS) was used to measure new team identification and test for differences in identity strength based on participant characteristics. Results indicated that three defining behaviours provided the basis for the formation of new team identification. These were termed: Football first, Origin and Occasion. Measurement of new team identification using the SSIS validated the model in a new team context; however, the value of victory and the identification of rival groupings did not relate strongly to the construct. Member identity strength was significantly influenced by age, salary, membership category and games attended. Five behaviours underpinned the development of new team identification; these were termed: Searching, Expression, Eagerness, Names and Faces, and Spruiking. Social identity theory provided a useful framework to explore the formation and extent of new team identification. The formation of new team identification was strongly influenced by support of football, in this case. The implementation of the SSIS to measure new team identification extended its previous applications. Participant characteristics exerted a clear influence on the strength of new team identification. Members engaged in additional teamrelated behaviours as their new team identification increased and they developed multi-faceted and socially important bonds. Stemming from the key thesis findings, the conceptual outcomes provided a significant contribution to current literature exploring members of new sport teams. Furthermore, the nuanced differences between identification with new and established teams provide a distinct agenda for future research into new sport teams.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Group identity.</field><field name="subject">Soccer.</field><field name="subject">Football fans.</field><field name="subject">Sydney Football Club (N.S.W.)</field><field name="subject">Sports teams.</field><field name="subject">Sports fans.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/848</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sustainable tourism development and rural community values in Australia's forest regions.</field><field name="creator">Schweinsberg, Stephen Conrad.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Willingness to pay.</field><field name="subject">Personal construct theory.</field><field name="subject">Eden (N.S.W.)</field><field name="subject">Rural development.</field><field name="subject">Nature tourism.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/849</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Planning for sustainable urban water: systems-approaches and distributed strategies.</field><field name="creator">Fane, Simon.</field><field name="description">This thesis develops and applies a number of methods for systems analysis and assessment within the field of sustainable urban water. These focus on the evaluation of distributed strategies. In line with arguments made within the thesis, the methods developed assess urban water on a whole-system basis, with the system defined in terms of the services provided. Further, the thesis argues for sustainable urban water planning to take a pluralist stance; both in the conception of sustainable urban water and the strategies considered. The challenges of sustainability and sustainable development are fundamentally problems of complex systems. Planning and assessment of sustainable urban water therefore require a systems-approach. Systems-thinking is not, however, a unified body of knowledge and this thesis develops a unique perspective on systems-thinking which is used to critically review the fields of sustainable urban water and its assessment. Within these reviews, the thesis develops a framework for understanding sustainable urban water in terms of a number of varied approaches, and describes a feasible theoretical basis for assessing sustainable urban water. Many, so called, sustainable strategies are small-scale and distributed in nature. Distributed strategies include decentralised systems, embedded technologies, and local measures for conservation. Traditional systems analysis methods have failed to account for distributed strategies. To adequately include distributed strategies, this thesis argues that assessment methods will need to be based on whole-system modelling, utilise end-use models of service provision, and include - in the form of a demand forecast - a time dimension in relation to service provision. This thesis proposes new methods for microbial risk assessment on a whole-system basis and Least cost planning for (urban water) Sustainable Scenarios (LeSS). A novel evaluation framework for least cost planning for water supply, which provides an equivalent comparison of demand- and supply-side options, is also developed. These methods are illustrated through case studies. These case studies illustrate the potential of distributed strategies. When assessed on an equivalent basis, in various examples, distributed strategies are shown to be particularly cost effective. Decentralised wastewater reuse systems are also shown to impose a theoretically lower level of pathogen risk on the community than equivalent centralised reuse schemes. Despite the advances in assessment methodologies made within the thesis, further development of practical tools for assessing and planning sustainable urban water remains an urgent goal.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sustainable urban water.</field><field name="subject">Urban water.</field><field name="subject">Water reuse.</field><field name="subject">Sustainable development.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/850</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Consuming nirvana: an exploration of surfing tourist space.</field><field name="creator">Ponting, Jess.</field><field name="description">The purpose of this inquiry is to explore the social construction of surfing tourist space in the Mentawai Islands, Indonesia and to expand existing theory to explain the process by which tourist space comes to be overlaid upon the geographical and social domain of destination communities. A review of surfing tourism literature revealed a modest body of knowledge that was largely descriptive, and devoid of any clear theoretical and philosophical perspectives. In order to gain an understanding of the historicity in the production of surfing tourist space, a review of academic and popular surfing literature was undertaken. This review indicated the importance of commercial surf industry discourse, disseminated through a specialist surf media, in defining and maintaining an idealised surfing tourist space (labelled &#8216;Nirvana&#8217;), which is based on the search for, and consumption of, the &#8216;perfect wave&#8217;. A social constructionist interpretation of grounded theory was employed in order to collect and analyse observations and indepth interviews of surfing tourists, surf tour operators, surf industry and media representatives, and locals, from which a number of interpretations were drawn. Firstly, surfing tourist space &#8211; Nirvana - is a fragile and contested space based upon four symbolic elements: perfect waves; uncrowded conditions; cushioned adventure; and, a pristine tropical environment. A four-phase process (referred to as Nirvanification) was developed in order to interpret the way in which tourist space is overlaid upon the social and geographical domain of destinations. It is argued that this space is remotely constructed, highly symbolic, and &#8216;disembedded&#8217; from local realities in the Mentawai Islands. Nirvanification revolves around the construction of symbolic elements of tourist space where it is threatened by alternative discourses, which the industry counters by deploying various myths. The ramification of Nirvanification for local communities in the Mentawais is marginalisation from the economic benefits from tourism. In conclusion this study identified channels for resistance and change which provide an alternative theoretical and philosophical position from which to question the assumptions that underlie socially constructed tourist space.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Surfing.</field><field name="subject">Tourism.</field><field name="subject">Mentawai Islands (Indonesia)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/851</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecotrekking: a viable development alternative for the Kokoda track?</field><field name="creator">Grabowski, Simone</field><field name="description">Tourism as an industry in the 20th and 21st Century has primarily been an international money-making industry which has attracted many governments of less developed countries as a fast mechanism for development. This has often involved a trade-off between the pursuit of economic wealth and support for the social, cultural and natural environments. The negative impacts of mass tourism in these economies are countless and well documented, especially as many of these countries are still trying to deal with impacts caused during colonial occupancy. Consequently, alternative tourism has been presented as a way to manage tourism development which is economically, social and ecologically sustainable. One manifestation of this trend is community-based tourism, which aims to be inclusive of the host communities as they plan for tourism and considers the socio cultural and natural resources and desires of tourists in a more equitable manner. The aim of this thesis is to determine how ecotrekking as a form of community-based tourism can provide a foundation for development for remote rural communities in developing countries. It was conceptually determined that if the needs of the community matched those of the tourists, then a sustainable ecotrekking industry can evolve. To explore this issue contextually, a case study of the Kokoda Track (KT) in Papua New Guinea is presented based around three research questions: 1. What role can market segmentation play in sustainable tourism development in remote rural communities? 2. What outcomes do the Kokoda Track communities envisage for the future of tourism on the Kokoda Track? 3. Do Kokoda tourists meet the outcomes envisaged by the community? A review of the literature found that market segmentation is a tool used in destination planning to assess visitor characteristics and match these to resource capabilities. It was employed in this study to determine the characteristics and needs of Kokoda tourists through a questionnaire survey distributed to trekkers via the tour operators. It was found that the Kokoda tourist is a university educated, middle-aged man who visits the KT for adventure and historical reasons. They have higher-order needs of personal development and knowledge and value the authenticity of the experience.  The second research question was approached using secondary data analysis. Notes from Participatory Rural Appraisal workshops with community leaders in 2004 and 2005 were reinterpreted. The key themes to emerge were that the communities have a great need for basic facilities (education, transportation, telecommunications, medical infrastructure and water supplies) and they see tourism as an economic means to develop those facilities. They would like to build more guesthouses and provide food for tourists to increase revenue however, they are unsure of the extent to which this will be supported by trekkers. A comparative analysis of the findings from research questions 1 and 2 was employed to address the third research question. The quantitative needs of the tourist market segment were matched to the qualitative expectations of the communities. It was found that the current Kokoda tourist is in favour of many of the outcomes that the Kokoda communities envisage. These include the provision of locally made food and guesthouses. Further to this, the empirical results from the questionnaire found that ecotourists and cultural tourists are the tourist types that need to be targeted by operators. They indicated a strong match with the desires and needs of the Kokoda communities. For example, they indicated that the KT can cater for a much smaller number of trekkers than the other three pre-determined tourist types (adventure, organised and historic tourists). Additionally, the natural and cultural environments are more important to these tourist types inferring that the protection of these resources is of primary importance. Consequently, it was established that ecotrekking can play an important role in development in less developed countries, if the right market segment is targeted to meet the needs of the community. Generally this can then ensure a slower rate of development, which allows the communities to adjust to the changes that occur at both a socio-cultural level and also in the infrastructure within their communities. In the longer term it also allows them to see how tourism can provide long term benefits not offered in extractive industries such as forestry and mining.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ecotrekking.</field><field name="subject">Eco-tourism.</field><field name="subject">Market segmentation.</field><field name="subject">Community-based tourism.</field><field name="subject">Kokoda Track (Papua New Guinea)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/852</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evolution of new media technologies - developing design parameters for a digital media centre for the Beijing Olympic Games 2008.</field><field name="creator">Chau, Mimi</field><field name="description">The advent of digital media has affected the nature of global communications, amplifying the interaction between populations and massively expanding the information load that an audience may be forced to consider.

For the police community in the English-speaking world, police chaplains have emerged as a group of professionals in police organisations providing specialised pastoral care and associated education to their constituents. As a relatively new community of practitioners, little is known about the emergence of this group in terms of its needs for learning, education and support and processes of acquisition of knowledge and skills. Major purposes of this study were to explicate the learning engaged in by police chaplains to become a professional practitioner and to project the role for future sustainability for all stakeholders. This is the first doctoral thesis to examine the development and practice of police chaplaincy in New South Wales (Australia), New Zealand and the United Kingdom. It was argued that neither police chaplains themselves nor the police communities they serve understand the potential of the role and implications for future learning and performance of that role. Prior to this study, there were no strategies in place to assess consequences of change, to address work-related problems or to determine future training. Consequently, this study explored how police chaplains perform their role so they could better justify the value of their roles for multiple stakeholders and make suitable professional development plans and strategies to improve services, address work-related problems adequately and respond appropriately to social changes. In order to understand and articulate the experiences of police chaplains, a reflective analysis was provided of the work of practising police chaplains in New South Wales, Australia, and a comparative study of police chaplains in New Zealand and the United Kingdom. The qualitative research design was interpretive and used ethnography and autoethnography as methodologies. The researcher is a police chaplain herself and is a current member of this professional group in New South Wales and was for a period of time in New Zealand. Four key objectives guided the inquiry and were addressed in determining an explanatory framework in the literature review and in the findings and discussion chapters. The first objective was to investigate the nature of the professional police chaplain. The findings suggested that police chaplains were male or female, ordained or lay, highly educated and pastoral and have a passion for policing. They are professional in nature from their qualifications as a minister, practising professionalism in their role as minister and chaplain and behaving appropriately as a professional. It was discovered in this study that because police chaplains largely act alone they have developed four distinct &#8216;walking styles&#8217; of having a presence and performing their role in a police station or other venues. The second objective to explicate the nature of police chaplaincy culture focused on kinship among police chaplains and incorporated notions of community of practice, culture and identity. The findings showed that kinship was a useful explanatory concept for analysing the culture of police chaplaincy. It became evident in the study that learning, belonging, connecting, participating and knowing were essential in the police chaplain&#8217;s role in complex and diverse communities of practice and various community and organisational cultures that influenced their identities as a minister, chaplain and pastoral carer. The third objective was to identify the major challenges faced by police chaplains. The findings indicated that police chaplains consistently faced challenges in representing the spiritual to police, managing their time, finding best practices, being credible and understanding others relationally as well as attending critical incidents in their ongoing honorary position. Senior Chaplains played an important role providing the support and training that police chaplains require for their ongoing practice while mentors and/or spouses also provided necessary time to listen to the police chaplain&#8217;s challenging day. The fourth objective was to examine the professional development and training of police chaplains. The findings revealed that training offered to the honorary police chaplain was minimal and did not meet the police chaplains&#8217; needs. Strategies including a program of continuing professional education have been suggested to enhance training and development for the future of police chaplaincy. Police chaplains interviewed for this research have given a broad range of perspectives making this exploratory study a significant contribution towards capturing the culture of police chaplaincy for the first time. This exposition of the work of police chaplains contributes to setting future directions for police chaplaincy practice and research enabling a better service for police officers and staff of police services worldwide.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Police chaplain.</field><field name="subject">Pastoral care.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/854</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electrode performance and signal processing strategies for the discrimination of EEG alpha waves: implications for environmental control by unconstrained subjects without training.</field><field name="creator">Searle, Andrew.</field><field name="description">The phenomenon of the increase in alpha EEG activity associated with eye closure has been shown to be successful for implementing environmental control for disabled persons. Studies in this thesis investigate strategies which improve the reliability, robustness, and ease of use of alpha EEG control systems. Primarily, research covers the effectiveness of alpha EEG detection algorithms (with regard to detection time and susceptibility to artifact) and the construction and use of EEG sensing electrodes. Many new techniques for the detection of the increase of alpha EEG associated with eye closure are researched, developed, implemented and evaluated. All detection techniques are compared to a conventional method using a novel performance parameterisation criterion. In conjunction with the application of the same EEG data sets to all techniques, the use of the performance criteria enables a fair and quantitative comparison to be made between alpha detection methodologies. Detection techniques employed include enhanced versions of conventional methods, localisation of apparent alpha sources in the brain, and preprocessing methods (such as spatial filtering, adaptive filtering and independent component analysis). The best performance of alpha EEG detection was given by the source power alpha localisation technique, which showed statistically significant and practically important improvements in performance over conventional techniques. Additionally, this localisation technique is convenient and fast to implement. In situations in which electrodes are intended for unsupervised use with environmental control systems, the evaluation of alternative electrode types to the conventional wet electrodes is required, as the use of wet electrodes has several drawbacks. The performance of wet, dry and insulating electrodes is compared in this research. One aspect of the quantitative comparison of electrodes types is the measurement of contact impedance. To enable the fast and accurate measurement of impedance spectra, a new impedance spectroscopy system was developed as part of this thesis. In addition to comparison of impedance criteria, electrodes were evaluated in the presence movement-based, and electric field induced, artifacts. The electrode comparisons were carried out in a direct and quantitative manner in a controlled test environment for the first time. Results indicate that, in contrast to earlier reports, both dry and insulating electrode perform well with respect to artifact and offer a viable alternative to wet electrodes for long-term monitoring of biosignals from the surface of the skin. More improvements are required before such electrodes are suitable for EEG usage.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electroencephalography.</field><field name="subject">EEG alpha waves.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/855</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An examination into the effects of incorporating collaborative learning methods in a core first-year mathematics subject.</field><field name="creator">D'Souza, Sabita Maria.</field><field name="description">This project aims to examine the effects of incorporating collaborative learning methods extensively in a core first-year mathematics subject and to investigate students' individual learning style preferences, their attitudes towards group-work in mathematics and the objectives for setting group work, their attitudes towards using computers, in particular, Mathematica and their concerns regarding the assessment of group-based work. Following the rapid increase in the use of technology in education over the last decade, one would perhaps expect to find an overabundance of literature regarding the effects of its use. However, the number of technology related research studies has been surprisingly low, especially those pertaining to the curriculum area of Mathematics at the tertiary level. The availability of quality software, the need for curriculum redesign, and limited research on the effectiveness of computers as a teaching tool, are factors to have hindered the rate of implementation and of subsequent research. Also, despite the rapid growth in the use of collaborative methods of learning, and widespread belief in the importance of such methods, there have been calls for increased research especially at the tertiary level, and particularly in engineering education looking at students who have to study mathematics because it is a requirement and not because they are majoring in mathematics, therefore needing to determine how best to make their learning a meaningful and enjoyable experience. This project aims to investigative the effects of incorporating a rich collaborative learning based curriculum in either face-to-face or computer-supported environments in the subject Mathematical Modelling 1. The carrying out of this project is a response to the lack of research in a curriculum area of tertiary mathematics. Within the context of mathematics, issues of attitude, gender differences, motivation and achievement are considered. The chief purpose of this investigation is to explore the effectiveness of collaborative learning in mathematics at university, and to provide some insight as to what degree, if any, the use of such methods enhance mathematics learning. The research uses an experimental methodology, an attitudinal questionnaire and indepth interviews to elicit students' feelings and/or opinions toward the incorporation of collaborative learning. The questionnaire sought demographic information from the students, namely, name, age, gender, length of stay in Australia and language spoken at home, and investigates the role of these factors in the effectiveness of, and interest during the tutorial and laboratory sessions a time when students were working on collaborative-based activities. This project maintains interest in the use of collaborative problem solving, and the belief that the findings could be of international significance if the effectiveness of this style of learning can be finnly established. It is also hoped that grounding the collaborative activities in the literature, and providing statistical and theoretical support for their use might promote them more widely in mathematics in particular and more generally, across universities in Australia. The broad issue of whether the use of collaborative learning enhances mathematics learning can be broken down into a number of specific inquiries. The key research questions may thus be expressed as follows: I. What are tertiary students' preferred learning styles? 2. What are students' opinions about group work in mathematics? 3. Does collaborative group work foster a deep, meaningful understanding of mathematics? 4. What are students' attitudes about using CAS such as Mathematica? 5. What are students' attitudes about the assessment of group-based work? 6. Are there any differences in students' learning style preferences across the various demographics? 7. Are there any differences in students' attitudes towards collaborative learning methods across the various demographics? 8. Are there any differences in students' attitudes towards the use of Mathematica across the various demographics? 9. Are there any variations in students' attitudes towards the assessment of group work in mathematics across the various demographics? This study does not claim to fill the void into the effectiveness of computers or collaborative learning methods, but should provide greater insight and support to future research.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Collaborative learning.</field><field name="subject">Group-work.</field><field name="subject">Mathematica (Computer file)</field><field name="subject">Mathematics.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/856</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Australian Citizenship: a genealogy tracing the descent of discourse 1946 - 2007.</field><field name="creator">Briggs, Justin</field><field name="description">This thesis is a genealogy which traces changes to the discourse of Australian citizenship. These changes were traced in the Australia Day (i.e., January 26) and January 27 editions of The Sydney Morning Herald (SMH) and The Sun Herald (SH) from 1946 &#8211; 2007. The dissertation used Foucault&#8217;s (1980; 1991a; 1991d; 1991e; 1998; 2002a; 2006b) genealogy supplemented with his archaeological method to provide an analysis of the discourse of Australian citizenship. The analysis was conducted by creating an archive of newspaper texts that related to Australian citizenship discourse. This archive represents the body of knowledge about citizenship as published in the specified print media and reflects the systems of thought that circulated the discourse at particular points in time. The archived newspaper texts related to Australian citizenship discourse contain traces of the social, political, cultural and economic beliefs and values of Australian citizens. The analysed texts were found in headlines, reports, editorials, opinion pieces, annotated photographs and letters to the editor that made-up the day-to-day history of the Australia Day editions. The texts that were produced in this narration in the SMH have provided data in the form of specific language use that defines the discourse of citizenship over the 62 year period. The language of these texts as reported in the print media represents the understandings of citizenship at particular times and also the discursive responses to contingent factors conditioning citizenship discourse including globalisation, localisation and neo-liberalism. The research links with Foucault&#8217;s (1980; 1991a; 1991d; 1991e; 1998; 2002a; 2006b) findings that the analysis of discourse is fundamental for understanding the nature of reality. This reality reported in this dissertation indicates a discourse that has changed and transformed over the analysed period of time. The discourse of citizenship has developed through the flow of rules and regulations that prohibit and permit what can and cannot be said, thought or spoken about citizenship at particular points in time. This form of normative thought, action and speech is culturally constructed and has been traced in the discourse through a mapping of specific language use related to understandings of citizenship. These types of knowledge constructions are artefacts of culture and reinforce existing power relations. This study has attempted to unmask these relations of power to question the rationality of the practices and experiences of Australian citizenship. The genealogical method allows for the distillation of citizenship discourse as a history of social and political truths as seen in the print media from 1946 &#8211; 2007. The genealogy of Australian citizenship presented in this dissertation lays bare the characteristic forms of power/knowledge manifested in the discourse over the post-World War Two period of Australian history to show systems of thought pertaining to citizenship. By doing so it shows that current citizenship practices are not the result of historical inevitabilities but rather the result of the interplay of contingencies. By emphasising citizenship in this way the thesis offers insights into how it can be refashioned to offer greater individual freedom through an understanding of the games of truth that are played throughout all levels of society. The manifestation of power/knowledge in the discourse is further evidence that citizens exist in relations of power. These manifestations produced five distinct thematic discursivities. I labelled them as, &#8216;The silencing of Aboriginal concerns 1946 &#8211; 1969, Authorised voices question the acceptance of poverty and racism 1969 &#8211; 1980, Relations of power between Aboriginal Australians and whites 1981 &#8211; 1988, Relations of power between Asian immigrants and whites 1989 &#8211; 1996, The struggle of cultural dominations 1997 &#8211; 2007&#8217;. In particular, a discontinuity was identified during the period Relations of power between Aboriginal Australians and whites 1981 &#8211; 1988. From this time in the discourse Indigenous Australians were permitted to criticise their treatment by whites. Subsequently this permission has become embedded in systems of thought. This thesis gives details of the products of the genealogical method related to the discourse of citizenship. It pinpoints the moments when individuals and social, cultural, economic and political groups played roles in the production, reproduction and transmission of truth from 1946 - 2007. Based on the products of the research it creates recommendations for minimising the potential dominations of social and political truths. It also suggests ways to re-think Australian citizenship to afford greater freedoms for individual thought, speech and action.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia Day.</field><field name="subject">Australia.</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians.</field><field name="subject">Social values.</field><field name="subject">Citizenship.</field><field name="subject">National characteristics, Australian.</field><field name="subject">Genealogy.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/882</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The multi-attribute elimination by aspects (MEBA) model.</field><field name="creator">Pihlens, David A.</field><field name="description">Our research proposes a new, multi-attribute, parameterisation of Tversky&#8217;s Elimination- By-Aspects (EBA) model. The EBA model conceptualises choice as a covert sequential elimination process with choice probabilities formulated over all consideration sets of the choice set. This specification attempts to capture the effect of context on choice behaviour. However, the EBA model has seen limited usage due to the large number of required parameters given the set of items under study. For a set of items T, it has 2|T| - 3 free parameters, which is infeasible for all but the simplest of contexts. To provide a practical operationalisation, we impose a set of a priori constraints on the parameter space. We define a generic multi-attribute structure to the set of aspects. This restricts the cardinality of the set of unknown scale values while retaining the functional (recursive) form of the model. The EBA hypothesis of a population of lexicographic decision-makers can therefore be tested in more market-realistic contexts, and inferences made over a large universal set of items described by the complete factorial. We call this model the Multi-attribute Elimination-By-Aspects (MEBA) model. The MEBA model reduces the set of unknown free parameters to a maximum of |T|-1. We develop a general algebraic expression for the MEBA choice probabilities as a function of the attributes of the options in the choice set. This enables the derivation of a likelihood function, and consequently maximum likelihood estimation. We also consider the form of optimal MEBA paired comparison designs. Using Monte Carlo simulation and a discrete choice experiment with consumers, we conduct an initial empirical test of the model against the special case of the MNL model (that assumes no context effects) and find the MEBA model to be a better approximation of observed choice behaviour. This is achieved on a common set of parameters, and so it is due solely to the difference in functional form of the two models. We conclude with a discussion on future research directions, in particular the introduction of heterogeneity into the model, and the description of optimal choice experiments for larger choice set sizes.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Choice modelling.</field><field name="subject">Decision making.</field><field name="subject">Multiattribute decisions.</field><field name="subject">Consumers' preferences.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/884</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"You'll never walk alone" The use of brand equity frameworks to explore the team identification of the 'satellite supporter'.</field><field name="creator">Kerr, Anthony Keith</field><field name="description">Globalisation and advances in communications technology have greatly expanded the potential marketplace for professional teams, especially for internationally popular sports. Lewis (2001) claimed that fans are now more likely to support a team based less on a shared geographic connection than on personal reasons. As Ben-Porat (2000) claimed, for these fans a foreign-based team is like &#8220;an 'overseas sweetheart,' far away but close to the heart&#8221; (p. 344). These 'satellite supporters,' (Kerr 2008, in press), or 'satellite fans' (Kerr &amp; Gladden 2008) represent significant revenue, especially for those team brands that seek international expansion. In addition, an individual's decision to purchase the sports product is largely dependent upon their level of identification with a chosen team. Team identification, or &#8220;the extent to which a fan feels psychologically connected&#8221; (Wann, Melnick, Russell &amp; Pease 2001, p. 3) to a particular team, is critical to the financial viability of a sports organisation. However, despite the increased attention paid to team identification, the reasons why satellite supporters identify with a foreign-based team have been largely unexplored. To address this need this study asks: What are the most important antecedents in the identification of satellite supporters with their chosen sports team? Recent research also suggests that a relationship exists between team identification and brand equity (Carlson, Quazi &amp; Muthaly 2002; Kerr 2008; Underwood, Bond &amp; Baer 2001). Therefore, the study also asks: Can a conceptual brand equity framework predict the determinants of team identification of satellite supporters? The thesis adopts a case study approach using mixed methods; a strategy that can provide &#8220;a fuller understanding of the sports fan&#8221; (Jones 1997b). Online questionnaires and semi-structured interviews were administered to members of fan organisations dedicated to the English Premier League's Liverpool F.C. Liverpool F.C. was an appropriate subject for the case study as it has a global fan base, a rich history, and is arguably one of the world's premier team brands. This thesis proposes a number of important antecedents in the satellite supporter's identification with a foreign-based team. These are: media coverage; style of play; the presence of particular player(s); team success; history of success; participation in the highest division; stadium; history of ethical behaviour; and the broadcast quality of games. Furthermore, a conceptual brand equity framework is shown to shed light on the possible determinants of their team identification. This study also confirms that social identity theory is an appropriate perspective to examine foreign fandom; satellite supporters might derive positive psychological benefits from their fandom; and the existence of a brand community dedicated to a professional sports organisation.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Team identification.</field><field name="subject">Sports teams.</field><field name="subject">Liverpool Football Club.</field><field name="subject">Brand equity.</field><field name="subject">Sports fans.</field><field name="subject">Satellite fans.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/887</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Habitat requirements and habitat use of the red-crowned toadlet Pseudophryne Australis and the giant burrowing frog Heleioporus Australiacus in the Sydney basin.</field><field name="creator">Stauber, Andrew G.</field><field name="description">Habitat requirements and habitat use for Pseudophryne australis and Heleioporus australiacus were investigated to aid management of these threatened frogs around Sydney, Australia. Much of the work focussed on roads, commonly encountered features in the habitat of both species. The habitat requirements based on locality records of both frogs in the Sydney Basin were investigated at four spatial scales. Both species are habitat specialists. They showed a strong geological association with Hawkesbury Sandstone and occupy upper topographic areas with ephemeral watercourses of gentle gradients. Both frogs occur predominantly in areas of higher precipitation and milder temperature regimes compared to averages representative of the region. Leaf litter is an important feature of P. australis breeding sites, whereas H australiacus generally associate with crayfish burrows. Both species are dependent on natural vegetation with a complex structure. H australiacus have a relatively long larval period (3 - 12 months) and breed in ephemeral pools, exposing their tadpoles to the risk of dying due to early pond drying. In the laboratory, tadpoles responded to decreasing water levels by shortening their larval periods and metamorphosing earlier than siblings held at constant water level. Despite this plastic response, a number of pools in the field failed to produce metamorphs due to early drying, an observation also made on P. australis. Regular monitoring of breeding sites revealed increased reproductive success away from roads for both species probably because of relatively longer hydroperiods. Spatial distributions and associations with habitat features, and movement patterns of both frogs were further investigated using mark-recapture methods. Both species showed strong site fidelity. P. australis formed small aggregations and predominantly selected leaf litter piles despite their relatively low availability. Leaf litter piles in creeks moved over time and the animals moved with these piles. In contrast, H australiacus individuals formed no aggregations and showed no preference for any available structural vegetation type. Locations of individuals were independent of relative distances to creeks and artificial drains, but males appeared to be more common near culverts. However, individuals were randomly distributed in space and nearest-neighbour distances were high relative to individual movement distances, suggesting minimal overlap between relatively large home ranges. Radio-telemetry demonstrated that some H australiacus individuals burrow in the road environment. There they would be at risk of being dug up and possibly injured during road works. The results are discussed in relation to the spatial requirements of both species and the protection of utilised habitat features. Management options are suggested to mitigate the impacts of road works. Differences in spatial dynamics of both frogs with overlapping habitats highlighted in this study require species-specific management approaches.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Toads.</field><field name="subject">Heleioporus Australiacus.</field><field name="subject">Pseudophryne Australis.</field><field name="subject">Endangered species.</field><field name="subject">Frogs.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/890</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Unpredictable predictables: complexity theory and the construction of order in intensive care.</field><field name="creator">Carroll, Katherine Emily</field><field name="description">The Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is a unit that manages the most critically ill, complex and unstable patients in the hospital. As a result, the ICU is characterised by a high degree of clinical and organisational unpredictability and uncertainty. In Western discourse, uncertainty is often portrayed as problematic, and as something to be controlled and reduced. This research challenges this discourse by examining the productive relationship between certainty and uncertainty in the work practices of ICU clinicians, and subsequently, how intensive care clinicians utilise uncertainty to construct order in a highly unpredictable work environment. To understand how order can coexist with ICU&#8217;s unremitting unpredictability, complexity theory is used to frame this investigation. This research engaged an emergent, interventionist methodology, deploying multiple methods. Using ethnography, video-ethnography, and video-reflexivity, this research relied on clinicians&#8217; participation in the construction and analysis of video data of the ICU clinicians&#8217; work practices. This resulted in clinician-led practice change in the ICU. This research suggests that methods need to be deployed adaptively in order to deal with the complexity of ICU, in addition to the moment-to-moment emergence of events that require the researcher&#8217;s own work plans to be revisited. Moreover, in order to gain traction with, and understand highly complex and changeable environments, the researcher needs to also enter and experience uncertainty herself. Using complexity theory as its analytical tool, this research shows an inseparability of uncertainty and certainty in the ICU which is labeled &#8216;un/certainty&#8217;. Three main conclusions emerge from this research. First, un/certainty predominates in intensive care, and due to this, ordering is a process rather than a final state. Un/certainty is at the heart of the adaptive practices that clinicians enact. These adaptive practices are highly interconnected to the changes that the ICU environment may require, and thus produce a dynamic order in the unit. Second, the researcher herself, in order to come to terms with the complexity and un/certainty of the ICU environment must also enter un/certainty in order to gain traction with the ICU environment: unpredictability and complexity cannot be studied from a neat and disengaged distance. Third, the presence of un/certainty in the ICU can be significant and enabling rather than disabling for clinicians in their ongoing pursuit of dynamically ordering practice. The contribution of un/certainty to frontline practice is as a central driver to managing change and complexity. Therefore it should be positively revalued by health services researchers, policy makers and clinicians alike.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Complexity theory.</field><field name="subject">Intensive care units.</field><field name="subject">Uncertainty.</field><field name="subject">Video ethnography.</field><field name="subject">Video reflexivity.</field><field name="subject">ICU clinicians.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/899</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Diabetic retinopathy : economic evaluation and cellular functions.</field><field name="creator">Ting, Julia Ho Yee.</field><field name="description">This thesis reports an investigation from the &#8220;bedside&#8221; back to the &#8220;bench&#8221;. That is, from the economic evaluation of a medical intervention to basic research and development of a contractility assay. The underlying theme of this thesis is cellular contractility, which was stimulated from our laboratory&#8217;s work in the microvascular complications of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR). The health economic perspective of this thesis evaluates the cost effectiveness and cost utility of DR prognosis using the prog-DR test. This novel prognostic test developed in our laboratory relies on the contractile response of blood vessels to detect subjects with high risk of developing DR. Markov modeling based on information in the literature was used to estimate the outcomes of a hypothetical population. The costs, health and utility outcomes of DR were compared to the potential outcomes if the prog-DR test was used. The model show that the prog-DR test can improve the health of the hypothetical population as measured in the number of life years (LY), sight years (SY) and quality-adjusted life years (QALY). The prog-DR test was more cost effective than the benchmark of annual or bi-annual screening and the incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) appears to be at an acceptable level. Scenario and sensitivity analysis also show that the cost effectiveness of the prog-DR test can be improved by (i) better blood glucose management post prog-DR test, (ii) targeted screening (as opposed to population-wide screening) and (iii) reduced costs of both screening and management of DM and DR. The physiological perspective of the thesis aimed to develop a contractility assay for DR that was based on a 3D scaffold, which was affordable, easy to make and mimicked the three dimensional physiological environment of blood vessels. The contractility assay was developed using a 3D, hollow scaffold (PE-PAH capsule) and involved (i) the selection of the optimal core material, (ii) optimisation of the manufacturing process, (iii) characterisation of the scaffold and (iv) ensuring that cells can be grown on it. The cyto-biocompatibility of the candidate polyelectrolyte Poly(Sodium 4-Styrene Sulfonate) (PSS) and Poly(Allylamine Hydrochloride) (PAH) in the thin films format were investigated using three different cell lines and the effects of these thin films were also compared to titanium and titanium nitride thin films. In essence, PSS and PAH are not cytotoxic and was used to develop the contractile scaffold, PE-PAH capsule. This scaffold is relative elastic and the contractile force exerted by the 3T3-L1 cells was calculated based on the deformation of the PE-PAH capsule.

The key issues were whether interest-job congruence correlated with job satisfaction, and whether the congruence-satisfaction relationship was a function of the congruence measure used. While previous studies showed positive correlations between person-job congruence and satisfaction, most of these used professionallyemployed subjects, and some used students; few researchers investigated the experiences of unskilled workers. A meta-analysis of previous research, carried out in this study revealed an overall mean correlation between congruence and satisfaction of .16, which was very low. Structured interviews in workplaces were used to gather data from the unskilled subjects, and a questionnaire was devised for use with the skilled subject group. The interviews and questionnaires used a card-sort procedure to ascertain subjects' vocational interests, asked questions about subjects' L jobs, collected details on education levels and job tenure, and concluded with a job satisfaction measure. The data gathered were analysed in various ways. Two different interest coding systems, and four congruence measures were applied, to see whether different measures gave differing results. Congruence levels were significantly higher in the skilled subjects than the unskilled subjects when one set of interest codings were used, but were low for both groups when the other codings were applied. Average job satisfaction levels were similar in each group of subjects. When congruence and job satisfaction were correlated, no significant correlations were found, using either subject group, either interest coding method,'or any congruence measure. Similarly, when certain factors (tenure, education levels and gender) were statistically controlled, there were still no significant correlations between congruence and total job satisfaction scores. Certain individual items on the job satisfaction questionnaires showed significant correlation with congruence levels, however, indicating that congruent people were happier than incongruent people with certain aspects of their jobs. On the whole, the results did not support Holland's (1985) theory of vocational choice. The current study suggests that interest may not be a strong predictor of satisfaction, at least in the group of Australian workers sampled. There are implications for career guidance with less academically-inclined people; careers advisers must address other needs as well as interests, in assisting clients to make work and study decisions.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Career development.</field><field name="subject">Unskilled labour.</field><field name="subject">Job satisfaction.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/916</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Collaborative and cross-company project management within the automotive industry using the Balanced Scorecard.</field><field name="creator">Niebecker, Klaus Dieter</field><field name="description">Cross-company product development projects are often managed without clearly defined project goals and without an alignment of these goals to an organisations strategy and objectives. With a shift towards more decentralised and distributed development teams, and an increasing level of collaboration, project transparency is reduced and status measurement more difficult due to a lack of transparency. To overcome these difficulties, the quality of collaboration in the automotive manufacturing industry needs to be improved. The understanding of unifying goals and of the mutual purpose to produce new products is essential for efficient and effective collaboration. A methodological study in the automotive industry as part of this research lead to the conclusion that a strategic scorecard method based on the Balanced Scorecard concept by Kaplan and Norton is capable to improve cross-company project management and reduce existing difficulties in typical product development collaboration, such as communication or collaborative risk management. A common definition of project goals, leading and lagging indicators to measure the status, and defining corrective action are core elements of the Collaborative Project Scorecard concept. This thesis identifies the current problems and difficulties in automotive project management and explores solutions to improve its efficiency and effectiveness based on the Collaborative Project Scorecard. It is shown how the concept is derived from business strategies for an improved alignment of project goals with business objectives. A project impact analysis facilitates the development of project strategy maps to increase transparency of goal impact interdependencies. Furthermore, based on the results of workshops, surveys, and interviews the Collaborative Project Scorecard concept is applied to typical automotive product development projects and the identified advantages and limitations are evaluated by an application to a crosscompany project of an automotive supplier and a manufacturer. The development of the Collaborative Project Scorecard is followed by a software implementation of the results. The integration of a collaborative project management model that has a focus on time, task and communication management enables the project manager to create operational indicators that can be controlled on a strategic level by the Collaborative Project Scorecard. Additionally, it is shown how risk management and performance assessment are supported by the concept. Advantages, benefits, and limitations of the methodology are identified and further application scenarios suggested.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Project management.</field><field name="subject">Automotive industry.</field><field name="subject">Collaborative project scorecard.</field><field name="subject">Cross-company project management.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/917</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Plainsong or polyphony? Australian award-winning novels of the 1990s for adolescent readers.</field><field name="creator">Voskuyl, Heather Margaret</field><field name="description">Plainsong or Polyphony? Australian Award Winning Novels of the 1990s for Adolescent Readers.  Using a musical metaphor of plainsong (to allude to monophonic sameness) and polyphony (to allude to multiphonic difference) this thesis seeks evidence of similarity (plainsong) or difference (polyphony). The texts considered are judged to have both literary merit and to meet the particular needs of Australian adolescent readers. Adult concerns about the suitability of particular Young Adult (YA) novels imply that there is an agreed archetype for this genre; an implication that this thesis explores using variety of critical perspectives, chiefly Narrative Theory, Reader Theory, Althusser&#8217;s concept of the hail and the work of Pecheux.  Bakhtin(1981) applied the musical metaphor of polyphony to describe the novel as a genre in which an author orchestrates its themes through &#8216;the social diversity of speech types&#8217; and &#8216;the differing individual voices that flourish under such conditions&#8217; (p. 263). This study considers both polyphony and its opposite, plainsong, in its inquiry into two aspects of individual authorial voices. The first relates to the authors&#8217; representations of adolescence as portrayed through their protagonist[s]; the second to the authors&#8217; beliefs about their adolescent readers as reflected in the various ways each author tries to attract and engage their audience.  This study finds that whilst patterns of similarity exist in the texts, these patterns shift when the novels are viewed from different critical perspectives. This thesis demonstrates that whilst the authors appear to share similar ideas about adolescence, they have different perceptions about what they can and cannot do in novels addressed to adolescent readers.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Young adult fiction.</field><field name="subject">Adolescent readers.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/923</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New workers &#8211; depressed workers a discursive investigation of the experience of depression in the workplace.</field><field name="creator">West, Lorraine Heather.</field><field name="description">This thesis arose out of my professional engagement as a therapist, with people suffering depression, and from my recognition of the significance of such people&#8217;s workplace experience in times of significant workplace change. Worker depression is now widely identified as a significant and growing problem by employers, by governments and by international authorities such as the World Health Organisation. By the end of the 20th century, it had become a significant site for policy, leading to the collection of data and the development of management &#8216;tools&#8217; at all these levels. Actions formed by such new policy range from workplace interventions to the establishment of government-funded bodies, such as beyondblue and the Black Dog Institute in Australia, charged with both research and information dissemination. An understanding of the context in which depression is increasing requires an exploration of two 20th century phenomena: on the one hand, the changing workplace of the advanced capitalist societies; and on the other, the ways in which depression itself has come to be diagnosed and treated, and consequently understood, as a medical phenomenon. There is a substantial literature on the contemporary workplace, and on the diagnosis, treatment and management of depression. Very little is available, however, dealing with the experience of individual workers who have been diagnosed with depression. This is the area the thesis is concerned to explore. In order to undertake this task, two significant methodological moves have been made, away from the &#8216;realist&#8217; orientation of much of the available literature. The &#8216;genealogical&#8217; move, drawing on Foucault, is the move concerned to understand how things are as they are and not otherwise, to ask questions such as: How has depression come to be a more and more common diagnosis in the late 20th - early 21st centuries? What is it about workers&#8217; experience of the workplace that is making such diagnoses more likely? Might it be the case that more workers are increasingly unhappy and that unhappiness, particularly manifested somatically, through bodily &#8216;symptoms&#8217;, is increasingly likely to be diagnosed and treated medically, as depression? The &#8216;discursive&#8217; move, drawing on Foucault, together with Nikolas Rose and Judith Butler, is the move that works with the understanding that selves are not simply given, existing autonomously. Rather, persons are constituted as selves &#8211; as subjects &#8211; in and through their active participation in the social worlds they come to inhabit. The mechanisms of this participation are the characteristic ways of acting and speaking &#8211; the discourses &#8211; of social institutions. Learning such discourses involves not only learning how to act appropriately but also to become a certain kind of self. For workers in the neoliberal workplace, this means learning to be the autonomous, flexible worker of overt requirements while simultaneously learning to live with increased demands for hours of work and levels of work output, together with escalating levels of surveillance. It is not surprising that many workers experience this workplace as increasingly stressful. Such stress, when medically diagnosed and treated as &#8216;depression&#8217;, offers a new kind of subject position to those affected. The heart of the thesis is an interview study which explores the narrative stages a set of workers diagnosed as depressed detail as they account for their progressive &#8216;resubjectification&#8217; as depressed workers. Five stages, involving the narrative positioning of different selves or subject positions, are identified from detailed readings of the interview data: these are the narrating of psychologising, internalising, somatising, medicalising and pharmacologising positionings. The identification and naming of these stages draws substantially on the work of Nikolas Rose and his identification of key 20th century selves. The identification of these as narrative or discursive stages in the retrospective reconstruction of resubjectified selves is the original contribution of this thesis.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Depression, Mental.</field><field name="subject">Workplace depression.</field><field name="subject">Job stress.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/927</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Antenatal education : meeting consumer needs. A study in health services development.</field><field name="creator">Svensson, Jane L.</field><field name="description">This research situated antenatal education within a health promotion framework to determine a consumer-based approach to improving antenatal and postnatal education purported to prepare for parenthood. Research, both published and unpublished, criticises current structured educational programs and first time parents are reported to experience high levels of stress and unhappiness. Stage One of this study was a multiple source, multiple methods needs assessment conducted at two large, metropolitan hospitals in Sydney. The aim of the needs assessment was to explore the needs, interests and concerns of first time expectant and new parents, their changing nature during the childbearing year, ascertain learning processes that best suited their needs, and plan effective antenatal education around the results. Repeated in-depth interviews, focus groups, participant observation and surveys were used to collect data from expectant and new parents. Focus groups, surveys and participant observation were used to collect complementary data from educators, midwives and Child and Family Health Nurses who work with expectant and new parents. The third source of data analysed was documentary, that is program outlines and session plans of three comparable hospitals. The needs assessment demonstrated that to effectively prepare women and men for their childbearing experience, a range of strategies, programs and learning activities were required. This resulted in the design of a &#8216;menu&#8217;1 approach to antenatal and postnatal education with an emphasis placed on &#8216;life as a mum and a dad&#8217;, and the &#8216;world&#8217; of their baby. The results also demonstrated a significant difference existed between the actual learning needs and priorities of expectant and new parents and those perceived to be their needs by the professionals. Expectant and new parents questioned the group facilitation skills of educators and identified methods to improve practice. Three strategies identified by these expectant and new parents as priorities were designed, implemented and an evaluation of each was undertaken in Stage Two of this study. The strategies were: 1. Seven session Having a Baby program for first time parents. 2. Group skills training program for antenatal and postnatal educators. 3. Breastfeeding resource package for antenatal educators. Stage Three of this research was an empirical study. A repeated measures randomised control trial was undertaken to test the effectiveness of the new Having a Baby program. In particular whether women and men who attended this program had improved perceived parenting self-efficacy, knowledge, and decreased worry about the baby eight weeks after birth compared with those who attended the conventional antenatal education program. The new program placed the labour and birth experience as a microcosm of the childbearing experience, and incorporated learning activities designed to enhance the confidence of pregnant women and their partners during their adjustment to parenthood. Perceived parenting self-efficacy2 was the measure by which parenting confidence, and therefore adjustment to parenthood, was measured The randomised control trial demonstrated that the perceived parenting self-efficacy of women and men in the experimental group was higher than those of control group participants at approximately eight weeks after the birth, with the difference being statically significant. The labour and birth outcomes of both groups, and their demographic details, were similar. Evaluation of the group skills training program for antenatal and postnatal educators and the breastfeeding resource package for antenatal educators were undertaken. Data collected from focus groups, interviews and surveys demonstrated the effectiveness of these strategies. The findings of this research question the validity of conventional antenatal classes and confirm the need for training and mentoring of antenatal educators. Effective, high quality antenatal education operating within budget allocation, facilitated by group skills trained educators, can produce superior postnatal outcomes.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Prenatal care.</field><field name="subject">Childbirth.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/948</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"Making something for myself" : women, quilts, culture and feminism.</field><field name="creator">Grahame, Emma</field><field name="description">This thesis juxtaposes a historical and ethnographic account of a highly organised women's activity -- quiltmaking -- with an examination of feminist discussions on art, craft, leisure, culture and folklore. In describing and analysing the quiltmaking revival in Australia, I attempt to show how quiltmakers have collectively constructed a space in which they avoid, and indeed, deconstruct, some of the ideas and practices which constrain women. As a case study, quiltmaking reveals the practical 'workarounds' that these women have found, which enable them to take time and space for themselves in the face of family responsibilities, to be creative and proud of their artistic efforts in the face of conventions of womanly modesty, and to arrange their own public events in the face of training in silence and backroom support. In so doing, they break down the divisions between professional and amateur, commercial and voluntary, and even public and private. For the most part, feminist analysis has ignored or misunderstood such women. Although feminist philosophers, academics and artists have often used the products of traditionally feminine crafts as metaphors, examples and parables, they have not always done so with knowledge or familiarity. My study of feminist art and craft writing suggests that this is because of a complex interaction between the political and strategic needs of academic feminists at different times and a lack of detailed attention to the actual creative choices of such women, who often refuse the label 'artist', though they are indubitably cultural producers. Similarly, feminist theorists and researchers of leisure have been concerned with why women do not choose the same leisure activities as men, but have discounted the specific pleasures of traditional women's skills, and the homosocial organisations they inspire, as positive reasons for the choice of such activities. Cultural studies analysis, with its emphasis on the products of the commercial media has underestimated the popularity and importance of voluntarily organised cultural production, such as quiltmaking, especially when such production has not been seen as politically interesting. Feminist folklore studies provides the only model for research which takes such activities seriously, and pays attention to the complex ways in which they both subvert and support women's traditional roles.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Feminism and the arts.</field><field name="subject">Quilting.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/949</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Anthropology, philosophy and a little Aboriginal community on the edge of the desert.</field><field name="creator">Morgan, Hamish.</field><field name="description">This thesis explores a rethinking of community, one without identity. This thinking became possible and necessary because I lived in a little Aboriginal community in south central Western Australia, called Ululla. The Jackman family have made Ululla a home (a home among others, this changes over time), not as a kind of ideal place that would stabilise and centre an identity, but as a place one leaves and returns to, where family gathers and stays for awhile &#8211; a number of years or a few months &#8211; depending on other forces going on in the region and with kin. What I gained a sense of, was that the claim of another &#8211; their work &#8211; forces one&#8217;s sense of responsibility outward, towards other gatherings across time and space; an extension that does not rest, stay put, but that moves. Extensive relatedness puts a community in motion, forces a thought of community without notions of bounded identity. A community at &#8216;loose ends&#8217; perhaps, where differences, discontinuities and multiplicity do not become One (Miami Theory Collective 1991). Anthropologists have noted that what Aboriginal people emphasise is regional relatedness and extensive social ties rather than exclusive or restricted groupings (Myers 1986). There is no centring as such, rather relations are pivotal, turning one towards another without rest. As a result, and drawing broadly from Jean-Luc Nancy&#8217;s work on community, I think of community as movement and imperative &#8211; an outward extension &#8211; rather than a retreat or consolidation &#8211; an inward concentration. Here, community is not to be controlled or managed or unified (centred, bound-as-one ) but something to go with, to feel happening as an imperative or inclination; a kind of event where one gets ready to respond to the call of others from elsewhere. Following Nancy, I think of community as something that is happening &#8211; an event, a call, an inclination &#8211; rather than an object of description (Nancy 1990). My thesis draws upon a critique of anthropology and a use of Nancy&#8217;s philosophy (Levinas and Lyotard are also important at times) to say something about Ululla. The problem with anthropology, as I argue here, is that it works to secure the identity of a people through uncovering an underlying unity that is supposed to order and sustain the group (Norris 2000); the anthropologist works to centre an identity in order to speak of the group itself. I imagine a different possibility here, one that would reflect Aboriginal social practices of community. The thesis is structured in a non-linear way and is organised around &#8216;gatherings&#8217; &#8216;breakaways&#8217; &#8216;articulations&#8217; and &#8216;spacings/rhythms&#8217;. This organisation means that the form and shape of the community, it&#8217;s rhythm if you like, is reflected in the structure of writing itself. Events happen, one is taken away, breakaways and gatherings take place across space.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/952</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigative study of computer guidance systems for project cost control.</field><field name="creator">Langston, Craig Ashley</field><field name="description">The problem under investigation is the failure of current project cost control processes in Australia to adequately examine alternative design solutions due primarily to the imposition of time and cost constraints. Hence project optimisation does not occur-- the cost of a design is controlled but rarely is a design formulated to comply with a pre - determined budget allocation . This thesis attempts to improve current practice through the introduction of a computer guidance system called "COSTPLANNER!" devised to enable implementation of complex optimisation and control procedures between the stages of conception and tender while simultaneously improving speed and accuracy. In order to arrive at a workable solution the investigative study is subdivided into three main sections. First, traditional methods of project cost control are discussed in order to ascertain the basic philosophies which will need to be preserved. Second, current levels of computer involvement are analysed to arrive at the essential elements which any computer - based system must possess. Third, a framework for a complete computer- guided cost planning package, incorporating the necessary mechanisms to enable more thorough investigation and overcome restrictions curre.ntly imposed by insufficient time, is designed in detail. The investigation has highlighted that design optimisation must be initiated at an early stage before valuable time and money is spent documenting a Bcheme that is inherently cost expensive . Also, to enable proper exploration of alternative solutions either the number of areas to be investigated must be r educed or the speed with which such area s are examined increased . The use of computers to undertake cost control activities means that the latter is an achievable goal that does not resist acknowledged attempts by the National Public Works Conference (N .P.W.C. ) in Australia to encourage industry standardisation. The major conclusion reached is that current practice can be significantly improved through the utilisation of computer guidance systems at all stages in the design of a project . Preparation time of feasibility reports can be reduced by ninety-three percent, sketch design cost plans by forty-five percent and tender document cost plans by thirty-four percent an overall reduction in time and cost of fifty percent. In addition to the obvious benefits of making instantaneous changes to cost information, full reports including life cycle costing, value analysis and cost- benefit analysis studies as applicable are automatically prepared . Implementation of computer guidance systems to improve efficiency is not only desirable but absolutely essential, although it is an area which t o date has been suprisingly ignored.</field><field name="date">1985</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cost control.</field><field name="subject">Value analysis (Cost control)</field><field name="subject">Costplanner.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/953</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessment of the structural integrity of timber bridges using dynamic approach.</field><field name="creator">Choi, Fook Choon</field><field name="description">In this study, a systematic approach was adopted to investigate, numerically and experimentally, localised defects and/or damage in timber bridges, such as rot, using modal based damage detection techniques. An existing damage detection method namely damage index (DI) method that utilises modal strain energy before and after damaged state was adopted. One contribution of this study was to modify the Dl method by an additional step of normalising the modal curvature, which would minimise the dominance of higher modes. In the numerical models, a comparative study of the effects of numerical integration techniques used in a damage detection process was carried out. The results show that when mode shape curvature integrations use the rectangular rule for the numerical integration, it yields better results than the trapezoidal rule. In the numerical examples using a finite element model of timber beam, the modified DI (MDI) methods were found to perform better than its original form for locating'" single and multiple damage scenarios. For the DI methods, two types of formulations were adopted and modified, and they are denoted as modified damage index I (MDI-I) and modified damage index II (MDI-II). Another modal based damage detection method, namely changes in flexibility (CIF), was adopted for locating damage. It was found that the ClF method performed reasonably well for single damage but not multiple damage scenarios. As part of the study, the modified damage index methods were utilised for evaluating severity of damage. For the :MDI-I method, the formulation was not derived to evaluate damage severity directly. Instead, a hybrid of the MDI-I and CIF methods (HMC), was proposed for evaluating severity of damage in terms of loss of '1' (moment of inertia). Using three levels of damage, i.e. light (L), medium (M) and severe (S), the HMC method is able to predict the medium and severe damage quite well, but it is less efficient for light damage scenarios. For the MDI-II method, further manipulation of the algorithm can predict the severity of damage in terms of loss of'I'. This method is able to predict the medium and severe damage quite well but is not as good for the light damage. Both methods, HMC and MDI-II, for predicting severity of damage, required some adjustment using a weighting factor in order to obtain reasonable results. An experimental modal analysis (EMA) test program of timber beams was undertaken. This was done to verify the robustness of the modified damage index methods for detecting location and estimating severity of damage. The laboratory investigation was conducted on the corresponding changes of modal parameters due to loss of section. The MDI methods were used to detect location of damage and to evaluate the severity of damage in the test beams. A mode shape reconstruction technique was utilised to enhance the capability of the damage detection algorithms with limited number of sensors. The test results and analysis show that location of damage is quite accurately estimated with the available sensors. The methods demonstrate that they are less mode dependant and can detect damage with a higher degree of confidence. The MDI methods also show that they are able to predict the severe damage well, but it is less accurate for the medium damage and not as good for light damage. The damage index II (DI-II) method extended to plate-like structures (DI-II-P) was adopted and evaluated for detecting damage. Based on finite element analysis (FEA) results of a laboratory timber bridge, the DI-II-P method which utilises two dimensional (2-D) mode shape curvature was employed to detect location of damage. The results show that the tnethod based on 2-D mode shape curvature is able to locate damage quite well, numerically. A supplementary work using the DI-II-P method in a timber plate model was carried out. The results also show that the method was able to predict the damage location well. A process of updating a laboratory timber bridge, analytically, is presented. A finite element model was developed and updated with experimental modal data. Material properties of timber beam (girders) and plywood (deck) as well as the screw connection between deck and girder were experimentally investigated. These test results were then used for the finite element modelling. The model has been developed sequentially starting with a preliminary model having very simple features. It followed by the advanced model calibrated with the experimental modal data employing a global objective function, consisting of errors of natural frequencies and modal assurance criterion. The calibrated finite element model shows a good correlation to the experimental model with minor adjustments to the real material properties and boundary conditions. The calibrated model can reasonably be used to study the damaged behaviour of the laboratory timber bridge. The bridge model was then used to verify the numerical results for detecting damage. The bridge was inflicted with various damage scenarios with loss of section similar to the timber beam models. The limited number of data was expanded using the 2-D cubic spline. Using the reconstructed data for detecting damage yields better results than just using 'as is' data. Using the undanlaged and dmnaged modal data, the D I-II -P method was employed to detect the location of damage. The results of using the first nine modes showed that generally the severe damage is able to be located by the method. It performs reasonably well for the medium damage but does not perform as good in the light damage scenarios. However, in some cases the method can present some problems in identifying severe damage, which may be due to lack of normalisation of mode shape curvature. Complementary work was undertaken using the method 'On a timber plate, experimentally. The results showed that the damage detection process in the timber plate is less efficient compared to the laboratory timber bridge. A comprehensive comparative study was carried out based on the results of the numerical and experimental investigation of damage detection on timber beam, laboratory timber bridge and timber plate. For the timber beam, both damage detection methods, MDI-I and MDI-II, were capable of detecting medium and severe damage in the numerical and experimental studies. However, the light damage was not identified well using the experimental data in the presence of noise. To estimate damage severity in the timber beam, the HMC method performed well for the medium and severe damage. The method did not work well in estimating severity of light damage. Similar conclusions can be drawn in using the MDI-II method to estimate the damage severity. The results of applying the DI-II-P method (using 9 modes) to locate damage in the laboratory timber bridge showed that numerical and experimental data are capable of detecting all severe damage for damage cases with less than three damage locations. While for light and medium damage, the experimental data did not work well as compared to the numerical one. For the timber plate (a complementary work), the numerical and experimental results also showed that they are able to detect the severe damage well. However, there were serious false positives appearing in the light damage cases in the experimental results.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Timber bridges.</field><field name="subject">Wooden beams.</field><field name="subject">Modal analysis.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/954</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies in the biology and reproductive characteristics of Pseudomugil signifer.</field><field name="creator">Howe, Effie Helena Irene</field><field name="description">The aims of this study were firstly to observe the breeding behaviour and embryo ology. and then to identify factors affecting the reproductive biology of the Australian native pseudomtlgilid Pseudomugil signifer (pacific blue-eye) and the impact upon it of the presence of the exotic species Gambusia holbrooki (eastern gambusia). Six species of the genus Pseudomugil, and the related Scaturiginichthys venneilipinnis, are found on the Australian continent. The normal breeding behaviour, egg surface morphology and embryology of four species of Pseudomugil (P. signijer, P. genrudae, P. tenellus and P. mellis) were first investigated, using aquarium and microscopic (light and S.E.M.) studies. The four species were divided into two groups: P. signifer and P. mellis; and P. tenellus and P. gertrudae. The study provided further evidence for the view that the embryology of the genus Pseudomugil differs markedly from that of members of the family Melanotaeniidae, with which the pseudomugilids have previously been grouped. The seasonal pattern of gonadal function in P. signifer, both in the field and in aquariums, was then investigated for populations of P. signifer from the Sydney region. It was found that P. signifer bred over the spring and summer months, commencing breeding as the temperature and daylength increased, and declining in breeding activity as daylength and temperature declined. There was no substantial difference in the pattern of reproductive activity between wild and captive stocks of P. signifer in the populations used. The impact of the presence of the introduced G. holbrooki on P. signifer was then examined, first in open-air tank experiments , and then in the field. In the tank experiments the exotic species profoundly affected the breeding of the native species. When G. holbrooki were in the tanks P. signifer did not gain weight or grow in total length (except for females given supplementary feed); ovarian weight and fecundity was greatly reduced and the ovaries were morphologically undeveloped. No eggs from P. signifer were observed in tanks which also housed G. holbrooki. G. holbrooki were observed to actively hunt and eat young P. signifer and to nip the caudal fins of adult P. signifer. The results indicate clearly, that at least in a captive situation, the presence of the exotic species has a very deleterious effect on breeding and hence possible survival, of a native population. A pilot study conducted at the same time as the harvest of the second tank study did not reveal such drastic consequences. However, even in the less confined field situation, some evidence of an interrelation between water quality, numbers of P. signifer and numbers of G. holbrooki were seen in one disturbed site (Home bush Bay). These findings suggest that a newly designed field experiment based on data collected from the power analysis of the pilot study could clarify whether G. holbrooki adversely affects P. signifer in the wild. The information gained from these studies can be used in the management of P. signifer in the wild, and serve as a model of the possible effects upon other native species.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pacific blue-eye.</field><field name="subject">Eastern gambusia.</field><field name="subject">Freshwater fishes.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/955</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The determination of equivanlent value in life-cost studies: An intergrated approach.</field><field name="creator">Langston, Craig Ashley</field><field name="description">University of Technology, Sydney.

A comprehensive study of the groundwaters in the unsaturated and saturated zones of nine Australian cemeteries has been made, with most sampling between October 1996 and August 1998. Periodic sampling from 83 wells or ponds yielded 305 complete samples which were tested for at least 38 inorganic and 5 bacterial analytes. Other, partially complete samples were used for metals and bacterial analyses. The soils of all sites were tested for a range of analytes that might reflect or affect the presence of human decomposition products. The within-cemetery sampling has allowed inorganic chemical characterisation of cemetery groundwaters to an amount of detail not previously attained. In the past 100 years there have been fewer than 12 sampling-based studies published on any of these matters. The forms of nitrogen feature most prominently, but three groupings of analytes are recognised as major contributors, including Na, Mg, Sr, Cl, SO4 and forms of P; these outcomes are similar in each hydrogeological zone. This study is unique in that it has a broad focus on the environmental impacts in respect of bacterial presence and transmission, heavy metals and nutrients, and has put these into the context of cemetery management and operational practices. Cemetery functions are best understood conceptually as a special kind of landfill but they are strongly influenced by the temporal and spatial variability of cemetery practices. Human decomposition mechanisms and products are considered in detail. This information was used to model the impacts for a large municipal cemetery over a twenty year time-frame. The previously unquantified relationship of cemetery proximity to drinking water wells has been determined and guiding principles for cemetery location and operation have been prepared including separation distances from watertables and specification of buffer zones in different hydrogeological settings. The related issue of the disposition of cremated remains is also considered and guidelines developed for scattering of these within buffer zones. The amounts of decomposition products leaving cemeteries are very small, and well sited and managed cemeteries have a low impact on the environment. Cemeteries should not be regarded as a detrimental landuse and the in-soil interment of human remains and re-use of graves are sustainable activities. However, almost all cemeteries have some potential for pollution. The most serious situation is the escape of pathogenic bacteria or viruses into the environment at large. The answer to the question as to &#8216;whether any one cemetery pollutes?&#8217; depends on the location and operation of the site in adherence to the affecting parameters. The question can only be resolved by a comprehensive geoscientific investigation with a focus on the hydrogeological setting. Such assessment needs to consider the effects if the practices and/or usage patterns within the cemetery change, or if there are unaccounted changes in impacting natural phenomena like floods.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cemeteries.</field><field name="subject">Human decomposition.</field><field name="subject">Groundwater.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/963</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The spatiality of English language teaching, gender and context.</field><field name="creator">Appleby, Roslyn</field><field name="description">University of Technology, Sydney.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/965</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A model for assessing the perceived value of knowledge based systems.</field><field name="creator">Clark, Jeffrey.</field><field name="description">University of Technology, Sydney.

For university-based business schools, housed within institutions with responsibilities for fostering public wellbeing, public accountability represents major challenges. The specific challenge of this dissertation is interpreting that accountability in moral, as opposed to legal or bureaucratic terms. Much of the academic attention to public accountability has focused on the legal aspects of compliance and regulation. The systemic nature of the educative-formative problem of moral accountability argued herein is especially evident inside postgraduate management education. I argue that nascent ideas of moral accountability foreground a systemic and inescapable challenge to the legitimacy of the now ubiquitous Masters of Business Administration (MBA) within university based management education. Illustrating the formative-educative problem via a case study at an Australian university and drawing on a critical review of the management studies literature I argue that current approaches to meeting those public responsibilities are at risk of being marginal at best. This is a view increasingly recognised by those within the management studies field already committed to redressing amoral management theory and practice. Efforts to professionalise management by bringing management studies inside universities have long been abandoned in favour of following market logic - a predominantly financially driven logic that is formatively amoral - thus exposing universities' moral legitimacy to rising public skepticism, if not acute and justifiable concern. Beyond the professionalisation efforts and the compliance mentality of corporate governance and against the commonplace smorgasbord approach to business ethics (foreclosing engagement with larger and relevant political, ethical and philosophical dimensions) I argue for cultivating a specific capability for management graduates - one area that will yield considerable philosophical scope and pedagogical options while meeting the university's public responsibility. I make a case for cultivating reflective judgment on matters of moral accountability {and specifically at the individual level} as a defining capability in management studies - a capability that is worthy of public trust in universities. To that end I argue for a Kantian approach to cultivating reflective moral accountability. The scope of this approach is global, the mode is action-guiding principles under public scrutiny, where reverence for individual human dignity is at its base: a civic or enlightened accountability, oriented to earning and warranting public trust, by individuals and through institutions. Kantian hope in a cosmopolitan ethical commonwealth sustains practical-idealist commitment to cultivating this capability. This Kantian approach is shaped by Kant's grossly under-recognised moral anthropology: a composite of a modest metaphysical framework of justice intersecting with his almost completely ignored philosophy of experience / anthropology. The pedagogical approach developed here is based on Kant's moral anthropology and notion of maturity. It is oriented to deeply experiential organic learning as university-based preparation for reflective moral judgment in pressured, complex situations of uncertainty. The aim here is fostering ideas on approaching what is problematic not to develop a comprehensive theory of moral accountability in the MBA. Taken together this Kantian response sees paideia as central to the public role of university education, and as such represents a radical challenge to seemingly unassailable assumptions of authority in management theory and practice. I follow a phronesis approach in this research, a perspective on knowledge that views the social sciences as categorically different from the natural sciences, calling less for universal laws and more for knowledge drawing on wisdom and moral judgment derived through extensive experience. Flyvbjerg's phronetic approach to the social sciences guides the case study, influences the selection of perspectives in both the literature review and the Kantian considerations. I approach this educative-formative problem out of liberal-humanist, social-contract traditions.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Kant, Immanuel,1724-1804</field><field name="subject">Moral accountability.</field><field name="subject">Moral education.</field><field name="subject">MBA degree.</field><field name="subject">Judgment.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/980</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Punk aesthetics in independent "new folk", 1990-2008.</field><field name="creator">Encarnacao, John</field><field name="description">Various commentators on punk (e.g. Laing 1985, Frith 1986, Goshert 2000, Reynolds 2005, Webb 2007) have remarked upon an essence or attitude which is much more central to it than any aspects of musical style. Through the analysis of specific recordings as texts, this study aims to deliver on this idea by suggesting that there is an entire generation of musicians working in the independent sphere creating music that combines resonances of folk music with demonstrable punk aesthetics. Given that the cultural formations of folk and punk share many rhetorics of authenticity &#8211; inclusivity, community, anti-establishment ideals and, to paraphrase Bannister (2006: xxvi) &#8216;technological dystopianism&#8217; &#8211; it is perhaps not surprising that some successors of punk and hardcore, particularly in the U.S., would turn to folk after the commercialisation of grunge in the early 1990s. But beyond this, a historical survey of the roots of new folk leads us to the conclusion that the desire for spontaneity rather than perfection, for recorded artefacts which affirm music as a participatory process rather than a product to be consumed, is at least as old as recording technology itself. The &#8216;new folk&#8217; of the last two decades often mythologises a pre-industrial past, even as it draws upon comparatively recent oppositional approaches to the recording as artefact that range from those of Bob Dylan to obscure outsider artists and lo-fi indie rockers. This study offers a survey of new folk which is overdue &#8211; to date, new folk has been virtually ignored by the academic literature. It considers the tangled lineages that inform this indie genre, in the process suggesting new aspects of the history of rock music which stretch all the way back to Depression-era recordings in the shape of Harry Smith&#8217;s Anthology of American Folk Music. At the same time, it attempts to steer a middle course between cultural studies approaches to popular music which at times fail to directly address music at all, and musicological approaches which are at times in danger of abstracting minutae until the broader frame is completely lost. By concentrating on three aspects of the recordings in question - vocal approach, a broad consideration of sound (inclusive of production values and timbre), and structure as it pertains to both individual pieces and albums &#8211; this work hopes to offer a fresh way of reading popular music texts which deals specifically with the music without losing sight of its broader function and context.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Punk culture.</field><field name="subject">Oldham, Will.</field><field name="subject">Punk rock music.</field><field name="subject">Indie music.</field><field name="subject">Folk music.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/981</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship between the work environment and therapeutic commitment of nurses working in mental health.</field><field name="creator">Roche, Michael.</field><field name="description">The therapeutic relationship is the central focus of nursing work in mental health (Peplau, 1992, 1997). However, there is currently little research that has examined influences on the nurses&#8217; capacity to effectively engage in this relationship. This study investigated the impact of nurse, patient and work environment factors on the willingness and ability of nurses to engage in therapeutic relationships. This attribute of the nurse, identified as therapeutic commitment, is essential for an effective therapeutic relationship (Lauder, et al., 2000; Rogers, 1957), which has been identified by users of mental health services as the foundation of their care (Forchuk &amp; Reynolds, 2001). The therapeutic relationship is central to nursing in mental health and has been linked to improved patient outcomes (Horvath, 2005). Environmental factors hypothesised to impact the nurse&#8217;s therapeutic commitment included leadership, collegial nurse-doctor relationships, participation in hospital affairs, the foundations of quality nursing, clinical supervision, staffing, skill mix and patient turnover (Aiken, et al., 2008; Duffield, et al., 2009a; Estabrooks, et al., 2002; Kramer &amp; Schmalenberg, 2004; Lake &amp; Friese, 2006; McGillis-Hall &amp; Doran, 2004; Needleman, et al., 2002; Proctor, 1986). These factors, together with measures of the nurse&#8217;s qualifications and experience, were assembled into an hypothesised model, based on an earlier framework that included the nurse&#8217;s perception of support, adequacy and legitimacy in their role along with their therapeutic commitment (Lauder, et al., 2000; Shaw, et al., 1978). Data were collected from 76 nurses across six mental health wards in general acute hospitals in New South Wales. A nurse survey collected the identified factors using the Practice Environment Scale of the Nursing Work Index (Lake, 2002), the Mental Health Problems Perception Questionnaire (Lauder, et al., 2000), and other questions. A ward profile was used to collect staffing, skill mix and patient movement data. Partial least squares path modelling was applied to the model in order to identify the most influential relationships. The most significant factors in the model were the foundations for quality care, nurse experience, participation in hospital affairs and clinical supervision. Services should enhance the support provided to clinical nurses in mental health through improved access to preceptorship, continued education and clinical supervision. In addition, the therapeutic commitment of nurses in mental health can be increased through improved continuity of care, access to career development opportunities such as the involvement of mental health nurses in the governance of the hospital, and improved responsiveness of administration to the needs of nurses in mental health. Engagement in these supportive activities should be enacted through structured mechanisms that both facilitate involvement and encourage evaluation. This study provides a basis on which to modify the operation of mental health services in general hospitals in order to improve the nursing work environment.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mental health nurses.</field><field name="subject">Therapeutic relationships.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/983</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Play and the experience of interactive art.</field><field name="creator">Costello, Brigid</field><field name="description">Encouraging audience engagement is a challenge that confronts all interactive artists. If an audience member does not interact or does so in a cursory manner, then it is unlikely that the artistic aims of an interactive artwork will be met. The research project under discussion here approached this challenge by focusing on play as a way to encourage both audience engagement and exploration. Using practice-based research methods the project aimed to develop design strategies for stimulating a play experience within an interactive art context. The research process began with the creation of two interactive artworks and the development of a framework of thirteen characteristics of a play experience. These characteristics are: creation, exploration, discovery, difficulty, competition, danger, captivation, sensation, sympathy, simulation, fantasy, camaraderie and subversion. This play framework was then used during the creation processes of a third and fourth interactive artwork. Two subsequent evaluative case studies assessed the playful characters of these four artworks within an exhibition context. They also explored the usefulness of the play framework as a tool for both evaluation and design. The findings from these case studies suggested that the play framework was indeed a useful tool for design. They also suggested three additional design strategies for evoking play experiences within an interactive art context. First, to work with patterns and ambiguity to create a rhythm between rule-based play and improvisational play; second, to use the relationship between action and representation to connect with the emotional and sensual memories of an audience; and finally, to use robustness and responsiveness to give an artwork a vital and playful character and make it an equal participant in the play experience. The findings from the case studies also led to a greater understanding of techniques for installing playful interactive art. Exhibition signage was found to be important for creating an environment conducive to play and for shaping and directing a play experience. The studies also revealed audience play preferences for either puzzle solving or sense-making. An awareness of these preferences, it is suggested, could help exhibition designers to create an environment that will maintain the boundary of play. Finally, the findings from the case studies led to a greater understanding of techniques for evaluating playful interactive art. The play framework was found to be useful during evaluation for collecting detailed data about play experiences and for developing a common language between artist and audience. The use of social pairs as participants was found to help reduce anxiety and encourage play. The sobering effect of evaluation anxiety was also reduced by using peers as participants and by giving participants some training in the practice of doing evaluations. Finally, in order to maintain the play spirit it was suggested that the experience of doing an evaluation needs to be designed to be playful itself. These findings will be valuable for any artists and curators of interactive artworks that aim to evoke a play experience. They will also be of use to those within the general interaction design community, particularly designers focused on the creation, evaluation and exhibition of playful interactive systems.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Audiences.</field><field name="subject">Interactive art.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/984</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fashioning an academic self: a study of managing and making do.</field><field name="creator">Devonshire, Elizabeth-Anne</field><field name="description">This study investigates how academics are managing and being managed by the demands of their everyday work. Specifically, it sets out to examine how a small cohort of academics located in a former college of advanced education (CAE), now integrated as a Faculty in a traditional Australian university, negotiate the dominant discourses and power relations in this setting. It considers the role played by government policy directives in shaping this particular workplace and its inhabitants. It also explores the tactics and strategies academics employ to manoeuvre the complexities of their day-today work life, and how these practices of the everyday fashion academics in this setting. To date, few studies have explored the changing nature and intensification of contemporary academic work from the perspective of academics working in a former CAE. In taking up this focus, observing the historical and cultural legacy of the institution, the study provides a situated perspective about academic work: one located in a particular workplace, at a particular point in its history. It illustrates how the academic self is fashioned through and within the disciplinary technologies and power relations operating within the workplace setting: how different types of academic performances are taken up and/or valued in this context, and how these performances are then implicated in the production of academic subjects. The research data comprised historical and institutional documentation, as well as semi-structured conversations with academics. A range of related theoretical ideas and positions are used to analyse three specific perspectives about being an academic: work(ing) policies, work(ing) narratives, work(ing) practices. Personal writing about experiences as an insider/outsider in this research study further informs the discussion, with insights about doing academic work in this (and other) workplace settings, and the role of the doctoral process in the subjectification of the academic self highlighted. The thesis puts forward the argument that managing everyday work is a complex and (self) productive process: one situated in, and shaped by, the institutional spaces &#8211; textual, discursive and operational &#8211; within which work performances are enacted. It depicts how academics take up, negotiate and/or self-regulate their work practices within these institutional spaces. The process of managing academic work is thus represented as an interactive yet bounded practice, subject to and subjectified through the specificities of the workplace setting and its inhabitants, and the power relations and disciplinary forces operating on and within the institution. The thesis also demonstrates the fashioning of the academic self involves a set of practices of managing and making do. These practices of the self, which are shaped by the aspirations and positioning (personally, professionally and institutionally) of academics, and the past and current circumstances of the workplace setting, highlight the mutually constitutive nature of discipline and desire in shaping academic work in an institutional context.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Colleges of Advanced Education.</field><field name="subject">Self.</field><field name="subject">Job satisfaction.</field><field name="subject">Academics.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/985</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The application of immunological assays for the monitoring and diagnosis of selected infectious diseases, with emphasis on neosporosis.</field><field name="creator">Reichel, Michael Philipp.</field><field name="description">The 16 publications presented in this thesis summarise the author&#8217;s contribution to seroepidemiological approaches for the diagnosis and monitoring of animal diseases of importance to New Zealand. The first four publications not only contribute to the above in relation to three important animal pathogens, namely Brucella ovis, Mycobacterium avium spp. paratuberculosis and Bovine Leukaemia Virus but also give an insight into more general consideration associated with the optimisation and validation of serological assays, namely regarding the definition and choice of gold standard reference sera, the determination of the cutoff threshold and discrimination between negative and positive reference populations. Two further publications deal with the establishment and validation of serological assays for the diagnosis of Neospora caninum infection and abortion in New Zealand. Then, baseline data were obtained for the sero-prevalence of the infection in dog and cattle populations in New Zealand. Three case studies provided initially information about the kinetics of serological responses after a N caninum abortion outbreak, and information about the usefulness of herd-based techniques rather than individual cowbased abortion diagnoses. A further study provided some early information about the mode of transmission seemingly predominating in New Zealand, which tends to be mainly via post-natal infection, in contrast to evidence provided by overseas researchers. A final case study, a longitudinal study of serological and other responses over a period of three years also provided data on the production effects of N caninum. The dissertation is completed by a number of reviews on sero-diagnosis of N caninum infection, its presence in Australasia and suggests finally control options, based on the present state of knowledge.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Neospora caninum.</field><field name="subject">Immunology.</field><field name="subject">Epidemiology.</field><field name="subject">Cattle.</field><field name="subject">Diagnosis.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/986</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A relational re-view of collective learning : concerts, condiments and corrections.</field><field name="creator">Johnsson, Mary Chen</field><field name="description">Work in organisations is a shared and joint endeavour often accomplished by groups, teams or other collectives. Yet groups at work do not always learn at work, limiting an organisation&#8217;s capability to thrive in knowledge economies. Research investigating collective learning at work continues to place the analytic focus on entities or abstractions representing the collective. For example, culture, power, group membership, group structure, group communications, motivations and skills are often examined to explain why groups learn or not in organisations. In contrast, this thesis investigates what it means to learn together when people act, talk and judge at work through their relational and responsive interactions. This relational orientation conceptualises learning as emerging from patterns of interactions that are responsive to local contexts and shaped by practical sensemaking that occurs in the everyday practice of work life. Specifically in the case study interpretive tradition, I investigate the relational practices of dyads and small groups in three disparate organisational contexts and professions. The organisational, group and individual characteristics differ widely for musicians in an orchestra, apprentice chefs in a commercial kitchen and rehabilitation staff in a corrections centre. Yet these three groups shared relational similarities in learning how to weave ways of acting, talking and judging together to make their work &#8216;work&#8217;. Such weaving together is enabled by shifting conceptually from notions of context as descriptive setting or situatedness to the notion of groups contextualising together. This thesis contributes to collective learning research by highlighting the significance of patterns of interactions and the dynamics of practice. The findings enhance existing collective learning theory by including spatio-temporal concepts from theories of organisational change and complexity. The findings have implications for guiding the learning of commencing practitioners into professions as well as for generating modes of transdisciplinary learning across professions. Re-viewing collective learning in relational ways recognises that learning is an emergent phenomenon, each time practised anew from interactions between people and the possibilities that lie within. The Latin prefix con means with.

Potential solutions to a problem are encoded by allele sequences (genes) on an artificial genome in a manner analogous to biological DNA. Populations of these artificial genomes are then tested and bred together, combining artificial genetic material by the operation of crossover and mutation of genes, so that encoded solutions which more completely optimise the problem flourish and weaker solutions die out. Genetic algorithms are applied to a very broad range of problems in a variety of industries including financial modeling, manufacturing, data mining, engineering, design and science. Some examples are: &#8226; Traveling Salesman Problems such as vehicle routing, &#8226; Scheduling Problems such as Multiprocessor scheduling, and &#8226; Packing problems such as Shipping Container Operations. However, relative to the total volume of papers on genetic algorithms, few have focused on the theoretical foundations and identification of techniques to build effective genetic algorithms. Recent research has tended to focus on industry applications, rather than design techniques or parameter setting for genetic algorithms. There are of course exceptions to these observations. Nevertheless, the exceptions generally focus on a particular parameter or operator in relative isolation and do not attempt to find a foundation, approach or model which underpins them all. The objective of this Thesis is to establish theoretically sound methods for estimating appropriate parameter settings and structurally appropriate operators for genetic algorithms. The Thesis observes a link between some fundamental ideas in information theory and the relative frequency of alleles in a population. This observation leads to a systematic approach to determining optimum values for genetic algorithm parameters and the use of generational operators such as mutation, selection, crossover and termination criteria. The practical significance of the Thesis is that the outcomes form theoretically justified guidelines for researchers and practitioners. The Thesis establishes a model for the analysis of genetic algorithm be- haviour by applying fundamental concepts from information theory. The use of information theory grounds the model and contributions to a well established mathematical framework making them reliable and reproducible. The model and techniques contribute to the field of genetic algorithms by providing a clear and practical basis for algorithm design and tuning. Two ideas are central to the approach taken. Firstly, that evolutionary processes encode information into a population by altering the relative frequency of alleles. Secondly, that the key difference between a genetic algorithm and other algorithms is the generational operators, selection and crossover. Hence the model maximises a population&#8217;s information as represented by the relative frequency of solution alleles in the population, encourages the accumulation of these alleles and maximises the number of generations able to be processed. Information theory is applied to characterise the information sources used for mutation as well as to define selection thresholds in ranked populations. The importance of crossover in distributing alleles throughout a population and in promoting the accumulation of information in populations is analysed, while the Shannon&#8211;McMillan theorem is applied to identify practical termination criteria. The concept of ideal alleles as being those symbols in the appropriate loci, which form an optimal solution and the associated solution density of the population is central to this analysis. The term solution density is introduced to refer to the relative frequency of ideal alleles in the population at a particular generation. Solution density so defined represents a measure of a population&#8217;s fitness. By analysing the key genetic operators in terms of their effect on solution density, this Thesis identifies ten contributions. &#8226; A model for the analysis of genetic algorithm behaviour inspired by information theory. &#8226; A static selection threshold in ranked populations. &#8226; A dynamic selection threshold in ranked populations. &#8226; A maximum limit on the number of loci participating in epistasis is identified whereby more epistatic loci degrade directed search. &#8226; A practical limit to the amount of useful crossover is identified as sufficient. &#8226; An optimal crossover section length is found. &#8226; A cumulative scoring method for identifying solution density. &#8226; An entropy profile of ranked lists is described. &#8226; A practical termination criteria of most probable individuals based on the Shannon&#8211;McMillan theorem is provided. &#8226; An alternative genome representation which incorporates job&#8211;shop schedule problem knowledge in the genome rather than the algorithm&#8217;s generational operators is developed. Each of these contributions is validated by simulations, benchmark problems and application to a real&#8211;world problem.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Genetic algorithms.</field><field name="subject">Information theory.</field><field name="subject">Information density.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1004</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The experiences of midwives involved with the development and implementation of CenteringPregnancy at two hospitals in Australia.</field><field name="creator">Teate, Alison Judith</field><field name="description">Aims : The aims of the study were to describe the experiences of the midwives who were part of the first Australian CenteringPregnancy Pilot Study and to inform the future development of CenteringPregnancy. Background CenteringPregnancy is a model of group antenatal care that has evolved over the past two decades in North America. A pilot study that explored the feasibility of implementing CenteringPregnancy in Australia was undertaken in 2006-2008. I was the research midwife employed to coordinate this study and I explored the experiences of the midwives who were participants as the focus of my Master of Midwifery (Honours) research. Method : An Action Research approach was undertaken to study the implementation of CenteringPregnancy in Australia. This included a qualitative descriptive study to describe and explore the experiences of the midwives who were participants. The study was set in two hospital antenatal clinics and two outreach community health-care centres in southern Sydney. Eight midwives and three research team members formed the Action Research group. Data collected were primarily from focus groups and surveys and were analysed using simple descriptive statistics and thematic content analysis. Findings : CenteringPregnancy enabled midwives to develop relationships with the women in their groups and with their peers in the Action Research group. The group antenatal care model enhanced the development of relationships between midwives and women that were necessary for professional fulfilment and the appreciation of relationship-based care. The use of supportive organisational change, enabled by Action Research methods, facilitated midwives to develop new skills that were appropriate for the group care setting and in line with a strengths-based approach. Issues of low staffing rates, lack of available facilities for groups, time constraints, recruitment difficulties and resistance to change impacted on widespread implementation of CenteringPregnancy. Conclusions : The experience of the midwives who provided CenteringPregnancy care suggests that it is an appropriate model of care for the Australian midwifery context, particularly if organisational support and recruitment strategies and access to appropriate facilities are addressed. The midwives who undertook CenteringPregnancy engaged in a new way of working that enhanced their appreciation of relationship-based care and was positive to their job satisfaction. Implications for practice Effective ways to implement CenteringPregnancy models of care in Australia were identified in this study. These included a system of support for the midwives engaging in facilitating groups for the first time. It is important that organisations also develop other supportive strategies, including the provision of adequate group spaces, effective recruitment plans and positive support systems for change management. In the light of current evidence the development of continuity of care models which enhance the relationship between an individual women and her midwife, it is important to explore the effects of group care on this unique relationship.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">CenteringPregnancy.</field><field name="subject">Pregnancy.</field><field name="subject">Antenatal care.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ecological modernisation of industry : developing multi-disciplinary research in organization &amp; environment.</field><field name="creator">Orssato, Renato J.</field><field name="description">This thesis develops suitable approaches to conduct environment-related research in organisations, as well as systematic means for understanding the emergent phenomenon of ecological modernisation in industrialised societies. The study is organised in two distinct parts: While Part I deals with environment-related theories and practices in (and around) modern organisations, Part II situates such theories and practices in an analysis of the context of the European automobile industry. The research problem is defined through several stages. The research questions driving Part I are premised on the exploratory nature of the study, developed in an unfolding interplay between the review of the literature, the collection of secondary and (exploratory) primary data, and the analysis and interpretation of the data. As the initial question is answered by reviewing the literature and interpreting the primary and secondary data, another question arises from the process, which then requires further research. Part II of the study departs from a proposition based on ecological modernisation theory, that pro-active environmental practices in corporations are part of a broader emergent sociological phenomenon, typical of modern industrialised societies. It analyses a specific socio-technical context that, hypothetically, is undergoing such process - that of the European automobile industry. Hence, the development of Part II aims at answering the following principal research question: Why is the European automobile industry undergoing ecological modernisation? Analytically, the concept of automobile field is proposed to establish a link between the product (automobile) and the context embedding its systems of production and consumption (field). The exploratory character of the study implied that the most adequate research procedures were of a qualitative nature. A combination of grounded theory and reflexive methodology is used to orientate the overall research process, which introduces a novel approach for the triangulation of qualitative data. Together, the chapters forming Part II of the thesis answer the principal research question. The fundamental technologies of the current technological regime of the automobile, as well as the economic and environmental implications of this regime are analysed. Then, an analysis of selected pilot programs to develop and commercialise electric vehicles, as well as schemes for the management of end-of-life vehicles in the Western European context is developed. Through the interplay between data collection and analysis, the thesis designs an analytical framework, built upon contingent factors, as well as circuits of political ecology, that foster or inhibit ecological modernisation in the automobile field. The study showed that the auto industry has developed incremental technological innovations and practices that resemble the pre-requisites for ecological modernisation. Radical innovations, however, are more likely to be initiated by outsiders. The concepts inherited from the past and reproduced in the present practice of car design explains such a situation as one that imposes a specific set of technologies on car manufacturing that require high levels of investment in systems of production. Such design paradigm not only imposes high break-even points for most car models; they also result in vehicles with extremely low environmental performance and entail serious limitations for increasing recycling rates of non-metallic parts. The characteristics of ecological modernisation in the European automobile industry are used to evaluate whether this phenomenon is conducive to sustainable industrial development. As an implication of this analysis, the concluding chapter presents suggestions for the enhancement of ecological modernisation theory. Fallibility is proposed as both a source of reflection about the appropriation of knowledge and a principle that can be used for the definition of eco-modernising strategies and actions. The acceptance of fallibility as an immanent characteristic of human action is critical for the approximation of the countervailing theories of ecological modernisation and risk society. Finally, if ecological modernisation is expected to facilitate sustainable industrial development, radical technological innovations may be necessary. Such radicalism in technology may need, however, an incremental institutional reform of modern societies. Together, radical technological innovations and incremental institutional reform constitute the concept of radical reformism, which is suggested for enhancement of the ecological modernisation theory, as well as for the development of its normative programmes.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Automotive industry.</field><field name="subject">Sustainability.</field><field name="subject">Industrial ecology.</field><field name="subject">Electric vehicles.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"All the time learning... three months are equal to one year": Second language learning in a target-language community.</field><field name="creator">Sayin, Saffet.</field><field name="description">Australia hosts thousands of English language learners every year and one of the reasons learners give for this is their belief that living in the target language community naturally avails them of more language learning opportunities than are available in their homelands. In fact, learners actually learn faster and more effectively compared to the limited gains in their respective countries. Believing that the target language community has a strong role in language learning, this research focuses on the factors and opportunities which enable students to develop their language skills in informal settings outside the school. Due to the vast scope of the research area, six different types of data collection methods have been used so that a wider spectrum in SLA could be investigated. These include an exploration of learner beliefs about their language learning experiences and a study of authentic social activities and linguistic engagements within those activities. The outcome of this research suggests that language learning is not first initiated &#8220;in the head&#8221;, but starts with the social activities in which learners participate and the qualities of the linguistic challenges and opportunities within these activities. The research draws on sociocultural theory (Vygotsky 1962, 1978), ecological approach to learning (van Lier 1999) and register theory (Halliday and Hasan 1985), and also on a range of research within second language acquisition studies. The study illustrates that language learning occurs in the context of activitybased communication experiences in authentic contexts, and the more the constant challenge and varied linguistic opportunities exist in the learner&#8217;s ecology, the more and better the chances to learn language. An overall approach to understanding independent language learning and a conceptual framework for examining informal language learning opportunities, have been developed. The study concludes with some implications for pedagogical practice in English language classrooms.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Second language acquisition.</field><field name="subject">Target language community.</field><field name="subject">Natural learning.</field><field name="subject">Informal learning.</field><field name="subject">Social learning.</field><field name="subject">English language learners.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1007</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of the intra-organisational processes of institutionalisation : establishing the practices of knowledge management.</field><field name="creator">Hirst, Christine</field><field name="description">This research is a study of how practices emerge and become established within an organisation. Institutional studies present different process models, however few have considered how they emerge and become established, other than by means of legitimacy and diffusion. Tolbert and Zucker (1996) defined institutionalisation as a sequential model of three processes, each had its own focus and was described within the context of certain institutional dimensions and outcomes. They indicated that similar processes could be played out between as well as within organisations. Based on this assumption the research aimed to extend this framework and develop a processual analysis of the institutionalisation of a practice at the intra-organisational level. To gain an understanding of these changes, the research positioned the study within the context of a practice. This was defined as knowledge management, a phenomenon which represented a set of practices which have been adopted by organisations over recent years. The methodology required a structured approach. This led to the development of the reference framework, which defined the inter-relationship between processes, practice, the intraorganisational context and time. It also provided the means to explore certain institutional dimensions and outcomes based on: theorisation, diffusion, formulisation and internalisation. Based on a sample of organisations across different industries, the research design consisted of three phases. The first was exploratory, the second was based on a mixed methods approach; the final explored the processual outcomes in terms of institutional dimensions and the different levels of change. The second and third phases were used to frame the intra-organisational processes of institutionalisation of a practice. The results showed that through studying practice within the intra-organisational context, this had generated important insights into the processes of institutionalisation. The research found that theorisation activity lay very much at the hands of the leader and their knowledge and willingness to champion the practices. Examples were found of the different pressures upon organisations to adopt the practices. Variations in formalisation related not only to the different stages of change but also to the many different approaches of implementation. It was found that internalisation was affected by people understanding the value of the practices not the concept of knowledge management. Finally, the process analysis defined expands the narrow focus on intra-organisational dynamics, as well as providing a bridge between practice and institutionalisation.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Knowledge management.</field><field name="subject">Institutionalisation.</field><field name="subject">Institutional theory.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1008</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of the Arthur Andersen and Ernst &amp; Young merger on the Australian audit services market.</field><field name="creator">Bond, David</field><field name="description">The merger between Arthur Andersen (AA) and Ernst &amp; Young (EY) in Australia was announced on the 16th May 2002. The merger was the culmination of seven months of speculation and drama surrounding the future of AA, following its involvement in the collapse of Enron in the United States of America (US). With the number of Big N firms having been reduced to four, concerns were raised over the impact of the merger on the competitiveness of the Australian audit services market (Boreham, 2002; Robertson, 2002; Hamilton et al., 2008). The objective of the thesis is to evaluate the impact of the merger of AA and EY on the market for audit services in Australia. In this regard, consideration is given to two specific questions. First, whether the Australian audit services market became less competitive subsequent to the merger of AA and EY. Second, whether any benefits, either in relation to audit pricing or efficiency, accrued to the firms involved as a consequence of the merger. In order to address these objectives, the impact of the merger on Australian listed firms is examined. This was done for both the market as a whole, as well as for the clients of EY. The sample was drawn from the 1271 available firms on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) in 2002. The results show that the audit services market in Australia is still competitive subsequent to the merger of AA and EY. This is so, even though the changes in concentration would suggest that anti-competitive effects could be occurring. One possible explanation for these findings is that the measures of market concentration as identified in the industrial organization literature are difficult to apply to audit firms. Additionally, the lack of benefit to EY from the merger, either through increased pricing or efficiency, may simply be due to 2002 being too early for benefits to be realised, possibly due to the stickiness of audit service fees (Ferguson et al., 2005) or merger implementation issues (Lawrence and Glover, 1998).</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Auditing.</field><field name="subject">Competition.</field><field name="subject">Ernst &amp; Young (Australia)</field><field name="subject">Arthur Andersen (Firm)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1009</field></doc><doc><field name="title">&#8220;We ARE America!&#8221; Cultural politics and Chicano movement legacies in the work of Los Tigres del Norte and El Vez.</field><field name="creator">Rodr&#237;guez, Mariana.</field><field name="description">The musical production of Los Tigres del Norte and El Vez illustrates Mexican and Chicano/a traditions of using popular music as an alternative way of narrating Mexican immigrant, Chicano/a and Mexican American community life in the U.S.A. These musicians grapple with the ways in which a dominant U.S. national discourse has historically subordinated Mexican immigrant and Chicano/a communities. Through their lyrics these musicians propose&#8212;albeit in different ways&#8212;a progressive cultural politics that underscores the importance of equality and anti-discrimination based on ethnic, cultural, gender and class positions. This thesis compares the work of Los Tigres and El Vez and argues that, beyond the merely documenting and providing a narrative representation of Mexican immigrant and Chicano/a experiences in the U.S.A., these musicians must also be regarded as political activists, using their lyrics and musical profile to articulate and present alternative politics on behalf of Mexican immigrants and Chicano/as in the U.S., and in ways that work with the legacies of the Chicano Movement in the 1960s and 1970s. In this thesis I attend to the differences between El Vez and Los Tigres del Norte. The musicians come from distinct musical and performance backgrounds, and work with distinct generic musical praxes. While recognizing those differences, I nonetheless identify five comparable axes of progressive politics in their work. First, they counter the notion that Mexican immigrant, Chicano/a and Mexican American communities in the U.S.A. form one homogenized group. Second, they emphasize community building as a form of empowerment for immigrant groups and ethnic minorities. Third, they continue the Chicano Movement fight for human rights and equality; but rather than calling for a separate nation of Aztl&#225;n, Los Tigres del Norte and El Vez claim a place for Mexican immigrants and Chicano/as as viable and productive constituencies in the U.S.A. Four, though these artists are male performers, they also deal with gendere issues and female characters and thus do not uphold the subordinate role of women in Mexican immigrant and Chicano/a patriarchal societies. And five, Los Tigres del Norte and El Vez engage with notions of an &#8220;America&#8221; whose pan-ethnic and trans-national qualities reflect the musicians&#8217; advocacy of alliances between diverse subordinate groups. Such engagements demonstrate that Los Tigres del Norte and El Vez operate as political activists whose lyrics and musical profile confirm the lasting impact of Chicano Movement activist aspirations, while also reworking those aspirations in line with changing sociopolitical conditions.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chicano movement.</field><field name="subject">Mexican Americans.</field><field name="subject">Tigres del Norte (Musical group)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1011</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Benchmarking climate change strategies under constrained resource usage.</field><field name="creator">Nettleton, Stuart John</field><field name="description">This doctoral dissertation presents evidence based research into climate change policy.

Fifty-three isolates of Pisolithus were obtained from various locations in central and eastern Australia and genetic variation within the isolates was assessed using ITS-RFLP and ITS sequencing analyses. RFLP analysis initially grouped the isolates into eight RFLP types. Neighbour-joining analysis of ITS sequences with Pisolithus ITS sequences available in databases clustered the majority of isolates into four groups within two major clades, each comprising isolates of similar basidiospre characteristics. Most Australian isolates correspond with recent provisional descriptions of P. albus or P. marmoratus. One isolate (LJ30) had low sequence identity (61.6-78.0%) to the other isolates and probably represents a separate undescribed Australian species. Significant intraspecific variation was observed in ITS-RFLP profiles for the putative P. albus isolates, suggesting that the sole use of RFLP analysis in diversity assessment may over-estimate Pisolithus species richness. Investigations were also initiated to identify if a relationship exists between genetic and physiological diversity in Australian Pisolithus. It is, however, clear that extensive physiological variation exists in Australian Pisolithus isolates. The size and distribution of genets of Australian Pisolithus species I and II ( putative P. albus and P. marmoratus) was also assessed using microsatellite-primed PCR to gain a better understanding of the likely distribution of underground mycelial networks and possible reproduction strategies in native soils. The data demonstrate that both species have the ability to be long-lived and extend for significant distances in native soils in undisturbed conditions.

This is despite it being widely acknowledged that a monitoring system is a fundamental component of a scheme, due to the risk of altering the hydrogeological processes and resource devaluation. The aim of this research was to address this information gap, by developing guidelines that provide a platform for the continuous improvement in groundwater monitoring systems for recycling schemes. To achieve the stated aim, an action research strategy formed the methodological approach for the implementation of the objectives. Existing guidelines for monitoring systems were reviewed, consolidated and refined, in consultation with industry expertise. The developed guidelines were then verified through the implementation of a case study at the Hawkesbury Water Recycling Scheme (HWRS), with the resulting information providing for a preliminary characterisation of the resources. Designed on current best practice, and to meet statutory requirements, the guidelines addressed the identified information gap. The research recommends the integration of groundwater monitoring systems into the environmental management system for recycling schemes, to provide for continuous refinement through the interpretation of the knowledge base developed in previous cycles. Adoption of this practice will initiate improved decision making and management processes, and provide for future resource protection and enhancement.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">groundwater</field><field name="subject">water reuse</field><field name="subject">aquifers</field><field name="subject">Hawkesbury Water Recycling Scheme</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/15008</field></doc><doc><field name="title">HSC Aboriginal studies : strengths, limitations, and impact upon Aboriginal students' self-concepts and educational outcomes</field><field name="creator">Wray, Debra E.</field><field name="description">Two primary, interdependent goals of the NSW Higher School Certificate Aboriginal Studies course are enhancing Indigenous students&#8217; self-concepts and educational outcome. It was considered that these would lead to increased Indigenous student participation and retention to Year 12. Yet recently there has been a decline in enrolments. Despite the introduction of Aboriginal Studies over a decade ago, no rigorous research has been undertaken to determine the impact of the course or the extent to which the aims of the course have been achieved. Research in Aboriginal Education has identified that Indigenous students are still not achieving at the same level as their non-Indigenous counterparts. However, the majority of studies to date have been theoretical and descriptive in nature. The primary purpose of the present investigation was to address some of the above issues by elucidating the (a) factors that influence Indigenous students&#8217; decisions to participate in the HSC Aboriginal Studies course; (b) impact of the course on Indigenous students&#8217; self-concepts and educational outcomes; and (c) strengths and limitations of the course. The research was undertaken in three NSW Department of Education and Training secondary schools, located in rural, north coast, and south coast areas. Results indicated that Indigenous students choose Aboriginal Studies based on their need to understand more about their own culture. There were also clear educational benefits in that Aboriginal Studies was considered to be a motivational factor that encouraged attendance at school and enhanced their academic self concept. Both staff and students suggested that the academic rigour of the Aboriginal Studies course contributed to declining enrolments. Overall the findings suggest that whilst the current course has some limitations, there are also many strengths; this implies there is a need to continue to refine the course to meet the needs of Indigenous students.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">indigenous students</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">educational leadership</field><field name="subject">self-concepts</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal education</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/15151</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Epistemic learning and rural development : an autoethnography of systemic participation with peasants, self and society</field><field name="creator">Mattner, Harold F.</field><field name="description">This thesis is motivated by my felt connection with the unnecessarily hungry peasants of the Majority World. The odyssey that results is portrayed as one of epistemic learning in which the meaning of participation is central. The first part (Chapters 1-4) introduces the philosophical understandings gained at the end of the research in order to assist the reader&#8217;s orientation at the beginning of the thesis. This explanation depends upon understanding the paradigmatic implications of Classical and Quantum Physics along with an autooethnographic approach. Using these concepts, I portray my experiences in agricultural development with peasants in the Solomon Islands and Mozambique as na&#239;ve systemic practice. This practice arises in response to the continual failure of contemporary development which I refer to as expat-centric development. I systemically reframe the categories of &#8220;expert&#8221; and &#8220;blueprint project&#8221; which become &#8220;expert and project with peasant.&#8221; The development that results I find to be easy and successful, yet it is ignored and undermined. This leads me to a watershed experience, which becomes Part 2 (Chapter 5) of the thesis.Within Part 3 I see the role of society&#8217;s institutions to replicate the mechanistic paradigm. Thus, in order to avoid the institutional entrapment that results from this, I see the need post-thesis, to participate in evolving new social structures that can replicate the paradigm of systemic participation. This will largely depend upon the willingness of society to engage with a cosmology of connectedness.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">peasants</field><field name="subject">rural development</field><field name="subject">peasantry</field><field name="subject">theory of knowledge</field><field name="subject">underprivileged people</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/14277</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploration of achievement motivational patterns during adolescence using a 12- factor model across grades and sex</field><field name="creator">Simpson, Katrina B.</field><field name="description">This thesis argues that a multidimensional profile incorporating mastery goals, performance goals, social goals and extrinsic goals, as well as factors relating to self-perceptions, would provide a better understanding of achievement motivation in adolescents than a univariate or dichotomous framework. Additionally this thesis also explores whether the use of lower-order dimensions provides information that offers a more detailed analysis of achievement goals over and above that found by the higher-order factors alone. A newly developed multidimensional measure, the SMOSA (Self Motivational Orientation Scale for Adolescents) of achievement motivation was used to examine changes of different motivational pursuits and perceptions of self across grades and sex in an adolescent population. The information found provides a more detailed analysis than previous research, which relied on an evaluation of means to explain differences between samples. Therefore, educators will be provided with a comprehensive understanding of the patterns of change in achievement motivation during adolescence and such knowledge may equip them with a way of measuring students&#8217; approaches to facilitative learning and the ability to explore students&#8217; paths for optimal engagement.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">adolescence</field><field name="subject">achievement motivation</field><field name="subject">multidimensional scaling</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/14412</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Redesign of a model of nursing practice : a case study</field><field name="creator">Hayman, Brenda</field><field name="description">Models of nursing practice create a context, boundary, direction and expectations for nurses, patients and other members of the health care team. The literature is scanty in regard the experience of Australian nurses faced with the process of redesign in their workplace. This study presents a case study of the process of designing a new model for a surgical ward in a large hospital in Western Sydney and explored the nurses&#8217; experiences of this redesign process. The participants were the nurses working in the ward and the nurse managers associated with the ward management and included the nurse unit manager and directors of nursing. Data for the case study were accessed from a number of sources for different purposes. The case study of the redesign of the model of nursing practice showed that change is a difficult process, which needs to involve all stakeholders. There are a number of implications for clinicians, managers and educators from this case study. Managers and clinicians must share an effective communication process during redesign and identify common outcomes. Clinicians need to be encouraged to work towards a vision of nursing practice through debate and education. Educators must be used to support the redesign process by preparing nurses to undertake change, provide information on models of nursing practice and change theory. Recommendations for future research include evaluations of the role of education in redesign and the effect of redesign from patient perspective. Other studies could include descriptive studies of nurse managers&#8217; experiences of redesign in a clinical setting and reasons why nurses are resistant to change.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nursing models</field><field name="subject">nursing practice</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/16871</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Living, knowing and writing the value of participatory practice to sustainability</field><field name="creator">Goff, Susan J.</field><field name="description">The thesis inquires into the living value of participatory practices to sustainability. The two problems of lack of recognition of participatory practices and the lack of address of sustainability matters are drawn into one collective inquiry initiative. Twelve Australian participatory practitioners, working in three states, in various aspects of social and environmental sustainability in the public, community and academic sectors voluntarily participated in the initiative for over eighteen months. The author, being the initiating researcher and practising participatory principles from the outset, chose not to facilitate a pre-determined method at any stage so as to let a systemic form of inquiry come into being. Working through three emergent iterations, the Inquiry and its thesis propose that globally, participatory practices are distinguishable in four generic constituents of Governance, Development, Learning and Activism and that incorporating all four of these elements constitutes a participatory practice with transformative qualities at systemic scales. Practically, the co-researchers created participatory practices from an eclectic range of such traditions, modes and disciplines, integrated through dialogic, reflexive, autobiographical and contextual inclusions. The ongoing Inquiry entity resists collapse to a defaulted instrumentalist stance and continues to unfold as a sociological embodiment of the thought it generates. Referring to Polanyi, Bohm, Bourdieu, Foucault, Torbert and Miller the author interprets the Inquiry&#8217;s legacy as establishing an articulate, committed and responsive open community within which we freely develop capabilities that are inhibited by our daily life worlds while also crucial for transformation towards participatory sustainability in these same worlds.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">participatory development</field><field name="subject">community development</field><field name="subject">sustainable design</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/15784</field></doc><doc><field name="title">It's my turn! : critical discourse analysis and the emergence of gendered subjectivity through children's games</field><field name="creator">Simpson, Alyson Melanie</field><field name="description">This thesis is positioned at the intersection of two fields of research: language and gender and language development, to address the lack of linguistically informed investigation into the emergence of gendered subjectivity. Rather than treat the domain of language and gender research as a site of resolve, the research problematises the area to create a site of contestation by drawing attention to the limitations of research based on a single theoretical framework which proposes unified gender identity as gender difference. Gender will be read not as singular identity but multiple, as a Foucauldian 'nexus of subjectivities'. The study is an investigation into the construction of gendered subjectivity through a critical discourse analysis of a family playing games. The initial contention is that gender is a process which may be performed in multiple ways which are linked to the subject positions taken up in competing discourses. Focusing on children playing games, the study examines how gendered relationships are constructed in discursive practices to propose that it is possible to identify the performance of multiple femininities/masculinites through an analysis of patterns of interaction where the negotiation of power relationships is made visible in language and action. The study is a reflexive ethnographic case study based on data collected of two siblings, a boy and a girl, and their parents playing games at home. Conducted from within a framework which strategically combines poststructuralist readings with linguistic analysis, the research is an example of the viability of 'postlinguistic' approach to discourse analysis. The thesis argues that the study of a culture as it is lived in a family reveals the emergence of gendered subjectivity in the constitutive relationship which exits language, subjectivity and discourse. It is suggested that the development of a child's multiple gendered identities towards normative gender patterns may be traced in the discursive practices which s/he mobilises as a result of the subject positions in which s/he is positioned during the research period</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Foucault, Michel, 1926-1984</field><field name="subject">feminism</field><field name="subject">language</field><field name="subject">gender</field><field name="subject">discourse analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/253</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Koalas and the community : a study of low density populations in Southern Sydney</field><field name="creator">Ward, Steven J.</field><field name="description">The aim of this study was to investigate the distribution, density, health, condition, fertility, causes of mortality, home range size and tree preferences, of koalas in low density populations in the south of Sydney.

While some Mediterranean countries have well established, modern olive oil industries, the Australian industry is still in its infancy. In order to compete in the world market, the Australian olive oil industry requires information on the response of olive cultivars in Australian conditions, especially when to harvest and irrigate to produce high quality olive oil. This study investigated the effect of harvest timing and irrigation on the quality of olive oil. It was conducted on a commercial olive grove in southern New South Wales over a three year period. It involved harvesting, extraction and analysis of the oil at 6 harvest times from early February to late July. A number of irrigation regimes were imposed in this study, although management was difficult due to drought conditions and lack of available water. The study provides very useful information and guidelines not only for the Australian olive industry, but also for the international olive oil producing community.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">olive industry and trade</field><field name="subject">olive oil industry</field><field name="subject">olive</field><field name="subject">harvesting</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/23714</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of atmosphere in international inter-firm relationships</field><field name="creator">Sutton-Brady, Catherine</field><field name="description">To date little empirical research has been undertaken into relationship atmosphere, yet the literature leads one to the conclusion that this is a key or central factor in developing the relationship between firms and in shaping the characteristics of that relationship over time.Given that the dimensions of atmosphere are only observable by the individual from a subjective standpoint, and that therefore emotion and subjective perception will inevitably intercede, this omission is startling to say the least.The aim of this study is to respond to this research gap and explore the nature and importance of perceptions of relationship atmosphere in business markets.In order for this exploration to be effective, a research methodology was designed to gather data, and three research questions were identified as having implications for the study of relationship atmosphere.

This is achieved through an exploration of current literature, policy and legal documents, and from the point of view of a sample of ADF women. The purpose of this thesis is to determine whether constructions of gender devalue, exclude and therefore oppress women in the ADF and to determine whether constructions of gender legitimise the subordinate position of female personnel within the ADF. The study locates the &#8216;voices&#8217;, the experiences, and opinions of a group of female ADF personnel in order to hear from the &#8216;central&#8217; players. The thesis contributes to current debates by: providing a platform for female members of the ADF to relate their experiences and opinions, thereby, giving a voluntary voice to women who are often not heard from in the debates; providing a feminist perspective -which in the Australian context is scant, as Australian feminisms have been reluctant to approach this controversial area; providing a critical perspective that is complementary to in-house research, through conducting the research from a position outside the ADF. The aims of the research are to explore the culture of the ADF, with the purpose of illustrating the underlying causes of barriers to full integration. It aims to understand where unequal treatment arises from, how inequity manifests, how this impacts on women, and how ADF resources are ultimately misused by the excluding of women from certain employments. Coming from a pacifist position I originally wanted to know why women would want to join the ADF, this question was easily answered through the beginning phases of the research. Through the research fieldwork I was led in the direction of focusing on the gendered nature of Defence culture. Government and ADF policy on combat exclusions I found to be a barrier to integration that impact upon career progression in the ADF. The research further revealed a disturbing realisation that Australian women continue to be denied full citizenship rights and responsibilities due to the inequities of restrictions on military service. The research led to the finding that women are excluded from roles in the ADF based on the mythology that women&#8217;s service is inferior to that of males. Issues presented in the arguments for cohesion, physical strength, and protectionism are military myths that seek to continue to exclude from positions of leadership, prestige and power in the ADF. Women&#8217;s current and potential roles in combat and peacekeeping are presented in the thesis as ultimate case studies revealing how women are denied equal employment rights in the ADF</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian Defence Force</field><field name="subject">Sex discrimination against women</field><field name="subject">Women and Defence Force</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/471</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Influence of self-concept on non-traditional student persistence in higher education</field><field name="creator">Wylie, John R.</field><field name="description">Despite numerous interventions, Australian Technical and Further Education (TAFE) students continue to display extremely high rates of attrition. Typically these students are mature-aged and work full-time while studying part-time.

Whilst there have been recent advances in self-concept theory and research, studies examining the role of self-concept in relation to attrition remain rare. The primary purpose of this research was to capitalize on recent advances in self-concept theory and research to identify the relation of the self-concept construct to attrition in the TAFE setting and the nature of self-concept for working adults.

The purpose of this thesis was to evaluate the peer review process for awarding research grants used by the Australian Research Council (ARC) Large Grants Program and to propose strategies to address potential shortcomings of the system. This study also evaluated psychometric properties such as the reliabilities of various ratings that are part of the assessment process of the ARC Large grants Program. Data for the all grant applications submitted for the 1996 round of the Large Grants Program were provided by the ARC. In a variation to the typical peer review process, applicants were given an opportunity to nominate assessors to review their proposals. The results indicated that global ratings given by the researcher-nominated assessors were systematically higher and less reliable than those by panel-nominated external reviewers chosen by the ARC. The reliability of peer reviews is not adequate by most standards. A critical direction for future research is considering what strategies need to be put in place to improve the quality of the reviews. To improve the reliability it is recommended that researcher-nominated reviewers should not be used; that there should be more reviews per proposal and a smaller more highly selected core of reviewers should perform most of the reviews within each sub-discipline providing a greater control over error associated with individual reviewers</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">peer review of research grant proposals</field><field name="subject">research grants</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/572</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Peers helping peers : the effectiveness of a peer suport program in enhancing self-concept and other desirable outcomes</field><field name="creator">Ellis, Louise A., 1975-</field><field name="description">Research suggests that the transition to adolescence and secondary school can be challenging and potentially disruptive to adolescent functioning.

Salt marshes in particular have been vulnerable to urban expansion and reclamation because of their close proximity to densely populated areas, while mangrove forests have been less often reclaimed because of frequent tidal inundation. The effect of reclamation of salt marshes on the biotic assemblages and functioning of mangrove forests with an adjacent salt marsh, park or bund wall was examined at nine separate locations on the Parramatta River, Sydney NSW. A mensurative approach was used to describe the patterns of distribution and abundance of macro fauna at several temporal and spatial scales. The implications for management are that salt marshes are an integral part of estuaries, and smaller patches of salt marsh are just as important as larger patches in maintaining the diversity of faunal assemblages and ecosystem functioning in mangrove forests in urban areas</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mangrove swamps</field><field name="subject">estuarine ecology</field><field name="subject">salt marsh, Sydney, NSW</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/652</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of factors associated with the season of a fire on germination of species forming soil seedbanks in the fire-prone Hawkesbury sandstone region of Sydney, Australia</field><field name="creator">Thomas, Paul B.</field><field name="description">Fire is a recurrent disturbance that removes above ground vegetation in many locations throughout the world, including the Sydney region. Many species in fire-prone locations, and most species in the Sydney region, form soil seedbanks and regenerate through post-fire germination. However, a germination response is determined by the fire regime acting as a selective pressure over a sufficient period of time, rather than a single fire. The components of the fire-regime are intensity, season, type and frequency. The natural fire regime is dominated by warm-season fire, but management burning is conducted in cooler seasons. Cool season burning produces lower levels of germination than warm season fires in a number of locations with Mediterranean-type climate, but the effects of cool season burning on species composition in the relatively aseasonal Sydney region is unknown. An experimental approach was adopted to address this lack of knowledge. Fire can be simulated using heat shock and smoke (fire cues), and the seasonal factors of temperature and water availability can be reproduced in the laboratory. I have investigated the effect of various combinations of heat shock and smoke, of various pre-and post-fire cue temperatures, of prefire cue hydration status, of various post-fire cue water availabilities, and of accelerated aging before application of fire cues on germination of a number of species forming soil seedbanks in the Sydney region. A degree of primary dormancy was overcome in most species by the combination of heat shock and smoke in the current investigation. Fire intensity is expected to influence germination, as germination of most species was increased by the combination of heat shock and smoke within a narrow heat shock range.The interaction between ambient temperature and the level of heat shock may affect germination. Soil water content, and thus seed moisture content at the time of a fire may interact with the level of heat shock to affect both germination and survival of a seed. The age of a seed may also affect its germination response to fire. The above factors are predicted to affect the germination of species differently, and thus season of fire is expected to alter species composition. Such predictions can be readily field-tested</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">soil seed banks</field><field name="subject">effect of fires</field><field name="subject">germination</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/697</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Applications of GIS in community based forest management in Australia (and Nepal)</field><field name="creator">Baral,  Himlal</field><field name="description">Community forestry is now a popular approach in forest management globally. Although local communities have previously been involved in forest management in various minor ways, community-based forestry is very new in the Australian context. Because of the multiple interests of forest users and other community interest groups, a wider range of up-to-date information is being requested in community forestry, than has been used in &#8216;conventional&#8217; government-based forest management in the past. The overall aim of this research was to explore the potential and constraints for the application of Geographic Information System (GIS) technology in community forest management in Australia and to relate the results also to Nepal. Specific objectives were to: (i) review the applications of GIS in forestry and community forestry worldwide, (ii) determine stakeholders&#8217; views on their requirements for the use of GIS in community-based forest management, (iii) prepare and demonstrate various practical applications of GIS requested by community groups in the Wombat State Forest, (iv) identify the strengths and limitations of GIS in community forestry, and (v) relate findings on GIS applications in Australia to community forestry in Nepal. This study involved a combination of three approaches: review of global literature on GIS, use of GIS and related technologies, and participatory action research.

Earlier suggestions were that the FDI is generated by a specific class of retinal ganglion cells, which are preferentially lost in the early stages of glaucoma. Based on this linking theory, frequency doubling perimetry (FDP) was developed and several clinical reports confirmed its high efficiency in diagnosing early glaucomatous vision loss. However, this linking theory is not universally accepted and newer suggestions posit that the illusion arises because of temporal frequency related difficulties in temporal phase encoding ability. This thesis psychophysically examines the spatiotemporal characteristics of both the FDI and temporal phase encoding ability with achromatic and equi-luminant (both red-green (RG) and blue-yellow (BY)) gratings at a range of spatiotemporal parameters including those eliciting the FDI.

Antonio</field><field name="description">In this thesis two different problems in distributed sensor networks are considered. Part I involves optimal quantiser design for decentralised estimation of a two-state hidden Markov model with dual sensors. The notion of optimality for quantiser design is based on minimising the probability of error in estimating the hidden Markov state. Equations for the filter error are derived for the continuous (unquantised) sensor outputs (signals), which are used to benchmark the performance of the quantisers. Minimising the probability of filter error to obtain the quantiser breakpoints is a difficult problem therefore an alternative method is employed. The quantiser breakpoints are obtained by maximising the mutual information between the quantised signals and the hidden Markov state. This method is known to work well for the single sensor case. Cases with independent and correlated noise across the signals are considered. The method is then applied to Markov processes with Gaussian signal noise, and further investigated through simulation studies. Simulations involving both independent and correlated noise across the sensors are performed and a number of interesting new theoretical results are obtained, particularly in the case of correlated noise.  In Part II, the focus shifts to the detection of faults in helicopter transmission systems. The aim of the investigation is to determine whether the acoustic signature can be used for fault detection and diagnosis. To investigate this, statistical change detection algorithms are applied to acoustic vibration data obtained from the main rotor gearbox of a Bell 206 helicopter, which is run at high load under test conditions.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hidden Markov model, machine fault detection, machine fault diagnosis, non-linear filtering, mutual information, auto-regressive moving average, ARMA, generalised likelihood ratio, GLR</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00000943/01/ThesisFinal.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/78</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular characterization of insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP)</field><field name="creator">Ye, Siying</field><field name="description">Central infusion of the hexapeptide angiotensin IV (Ang IV) and its analogs have been demonstrated to markedly enhance memory retention and retrieval in rats using a range of learning and memory paradigms. This effect is mediated by the binding of the peptide to the specific binding site previously described as the AT4 receptor. The AT4 receptor has been isolated and identified as insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP), a type II transmembrane protein belonging to the M1 family of zinc-dependent aminopeptidases. Subsequently, AT4 receptor ligands, including Ang IV and its analogues and the unrelated peptide LVV-hemorphin-7, were demonstrated to be peptide inhibitors of IRAP. These findings suggest that AT4 ligands may exert their cognitive effects by inhibiting the catalytic activity of IRAP in the brain. Therefore, IRAP is an important target for the development of a new class of therapeutic agents for the treatment of memory loss.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">IRAP, insulin-regulated aminopeptidase, AT4, Ang IV, memory and learning, virtual screening, structure-based drug design, molecular modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00001651/01/Thesis_Full_Version_Revision_15_April_2006.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/53</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Muslim-Christian relations in the New Order Indonesia: the exclusivist and inclusivist Muslims' perspectives</field><field name="creator">Husein,  Fatimah</field><field name="description">The relationship between Muslims and Christian in Indonesia is and important subject.

This thesis examined these interrelationships in the context of Williams syndrome (WS), a neurodevelopmental genetic disorder that affects aspects of cognition, behaviour, and brain structure.  The principal aims of this thesis were to evaluate the cognitive, behavioural, and neuroanatomical profile of WS individuals and to explore the relationships between aspects of the cognitive and behavioural profile and the neuroanatomical changes that are evident in WS. Three general hypotheses, and 10 specific hypotheses, were postulated as a means of exploring these aims.  The first general hypothesis predicted that WS individuals would demonstrate distinct features within their cognitive and behavioural profile.  Specifically, it was predicted that WS individuals would show relative strengths on verbal tasks and significant deficits on visuospatial and mathematical tasks, in contrast to control participants who were predicted to show a more even profile.

I focus on the way the socioeconomic position of patients is a factor in that experience as my underlying interest is in exploring how health inequalities are understood, approached and handled in general practice. The study is thus a practical and grounded exploration of a widely debated theoretical issue in the study of social life, namely the relationship between the micro day-to-day interactions and events in the lives of individuals and the broad macro structure of society and the position of the individual within that.  There is now wide acceptance and evidence that people&#8217;s social and economic circumstances impact on their health status and their experiences in the health system. However, there is considerable debate about the role played by primary medical care. Nevertheless, better theoretical understanding of the importance of psychosocial processes in generating social inequalities in health suggests medical care may well be important, as such processes are crucial in the care of chronic illnesses such as diabetes which are now such a large part of general practice work.  I approach this study through an exploration of patient centred clinical practice. Patient centredness is a pragmatic, idealised prescriptive framework for clinical practice, particularly general practice. Patient centredness developed in part in response to critiques of biomedicine, and is premised on a notion of a more equal relationship between GP and patient, and one that places importance on the context of patients&#8217; lives.

The main immunological barrier to xenografting from pig-to-primate is the antigen, Galactose-&#945;1,3-Galactose (Gal) which is found in all species except humans and other higher primates.  Even with the major advancement of deleting Gal from the potential pig donor species with the aid of cloning technology, complete elimination may be elusive as alternative genes yet to be fully characterised, may still produce Gal at low levels.  Thus, the human immune response against Gal may continue to be a barrier to successful xenotransplantation. The aim of this project was to develop small animal models of the important components of xenograft rejection that largely relate to the anti-Gal immune response.  These include models of hyperacute, acute vascular and chronic xenograft-like rejection that in turn, provide new insights in the immune mechanisms of the rejection processes.  The role of antibody and both innate and cognate cellular immunity are explored.  Both vascularised heart grafts and non-vascularised skin graft models are examined as rejection of solid organs may differ from cellular transplantation.

Efficient scheduling is a vital tool in successful decision-making. To date, an enormous amount of research has been done on scheduling problems arising from various disciplines. Major attention has so far been dedicated to off-line (usually deterministic) scheduling problems. Off-line deterministic scheduling deals with perfect information. That is, all information with regard to a problem is known prior to any decision. However, this perfect information assumption violates the nature of many realistic issues with uncertainties, for example, a situation where the knowledge of problem instances is revealed over time, or a scenario in which processing tasks are temporarily disrupted or cancelled. To better formulate this sort of problem with high uncertainties, a new concept of on-line scheduling was introduced. On-line approaches have become increasingly important and are frequently encountered when only partial knowledge is available but instant or very fast solution methods are required and should nevertheless result in good outcomes. In on-line scheduling, a decision maker allocates resources between tasks as the information is gradually released. Obviously, given the same scheduling environment and problem instance, the result produced by an on-line scheduler cannot be better than that by the optimal off-line scheduler; but the on-line scheduling technique immunizes schedules from future disruptions and uncertainties.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">on-line scheduling, on-line algorithms, scheduling problems</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/3538</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/3538</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigations into the mechanical properties and curing characteristics of dental glass-ionomer cements</field><field name="creator">Prentice, Leon Hugh</field><field name="description">Conventional glass ionomer cements (GICs), which continue to gain acceptance as superbly biocompatible dental materials, were first released in the early 1970s as a result of research into combining the advantages of silicate cements and polyalkenate cements.

The refractive index profile extracted from AFM data was compared withQuantitative Phase Microscopy (QPM) and nanometer Secondary Ion MassSpectrometry (nanoSIMS) measurement techniques.In addition, AFM was employed to study the diffusion of the dopant produced by thearc fusion splicing technique using a fluorine-doped fibre and a multiple-dopant fibre.Furthermore, the phase and the refractive index profiles of a thermally expanded core(TEC) fibre were performed using quantitative phase microscopy (QPM).The application of the AFM to the resolution problem provides a fundamentalenhancement on the optical resolution from of around 400 nm to 500 nm. This providesconsiderable new structural information about the fibre.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00000942/01/Masters_Thesis-Peter_Pace.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/77</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The political economy of disablement: a sociological analysis</field><field name="creator">Gibilisco,  Peter</field><field name="description">A central political and social debate confronting societies around the world concerns the form and content of social democracy.  The collapse of communism, the advent of globalization, the transformation of the social experiences in life, and other profound social, political and economic changes, have all created a perceived need within social democratic circles to rethink the policies and theoretical thought of the left.  Social democratic politics is thus in a state of critical self-reflection.  More precisely, in Australia, pragmatic social democracy has faced profound challenges with the emergence both of neo-liberal models of society and policy, and with the development of third way social democracy which seeks to combine the social justice concerns of pragmatic social democracy with the market based economics of neo-liberalism. To explore the dynamic contests between these different approaches, this thesis provides a critical exploration of the actual and potential contributions that policies modeled on pragmatic and third way social democracy, and on neo-liberalism, make to the lives of people with disabilities.  People with disabilities continue to be socially excluded in capitalist societies including Australia, the UK, and the US, and as a result a key challenge for social democratic approaches is how to increase the social inclusion of people with disabilities.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">people with disabilities, social democracy, empowerment, social justice</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00001483/01/Peter_Gibilisco.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/68</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Australian Disability Rights Movement: freeing the power of advocacy</field><field name="creator">Cooper,  Margaret</field><field name="description">The Australian Disability Rights Movement (ADRM) developed slowly during the century, with a major spurt of growth in the 1980&#8217;s, resulting in the formation of two national advocacy organisations controlled by people with disabilities.

Numerous mouse models of colitis highlight how varied immunological defects, particularly of T-cells, can give rise to intestinal inflammation. It is increasingly recognized that glycosylation status has a major impact on the development and function of T-cells. In particular maturation in the thymus is regulated by a number of glycosylation-dependent mechanisms. Abnormal glycosylation has been identified in human IBD although this is almost entirely within the context of the mucosal barrier. Mice transgenic for a human glycosyltransferase (&#945;1-2fucosyltransferase, hFUT1) were generated at our institution.

Through the jurisprudence of Justice Kriewaldt in the Northern Territory, it explores the relationship between the policy of assimilation and the application of the criminal law to Aboriginal people. Justice Kriewaldt was the sole judge of the Northern Territory Supreme Court during the 1950s. This was an important period in Australian history when the assimilation policy was at its highpoint. The thesis focuses on three areas of criminal justice&#8212;provocation, sentencing and alcohol consumption regulation. Both for Justice Kriewaldt and, in contemporary times, these areas were and continue to be of particular relevance to Aboriginal people confronting the criminal justice system. The thesis demonstrates that Justice Kriewaldt&#8217;s approach in these areas was informed by his support for the assimilation policy. It is argued that Justice Kriewaldt generally understood Aboriginal people to be uncivilised and that he applied the criminal law to assist in civilising Aboriginal people so that they could become assimilated.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Indigenous people, criminal law, assimilation policy</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00001751/01/Heather_Douglas_PhD.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/55</field></doc><doc><field name="title">DNA methylation at the neocentromere</field><field name="creator">Wong, Nicholas Chau-Lun</field><field name="description">The Centromere is a vital chromosomal structure that ensures faithful segregation of replicated chromosomes to their respective daughter cells.

First and foremost the crisis saw the collapse of the main political parties, the Christian Democracy and the Socialist Party. In a different manner and only one year prior to this crisis, the former Communist Party, also underwent major changes and evolved into a social democratic party, the Democratic Party of the Left.  Though this crisis was sparked by a corruption revelation, it became a catalyst for a change in the deformities of a political system, of the partitocracy, which was itself the product of Cold War conditions faced by Italy in the post-war period. The focus of this study has been to re-evaluate the causes of this crisis with particular attention to the role of the Cold War as the over-arching influence which directly and indirectly influenced many of the internal dynamics of the Italian political process. The hypothesis of this research was that the end of the Cold War in 1991 as a factor which provoked this political crisis, was far more important as a cause than has hitherto been acknowledged. The study examines the other indicated possible causes including the impact of the corruption revelations, the role of the magistrates in uncovering corruption, the economic crisis, the role of the new protest movement of the Lega Nord and finally the especially brutal equilibrium with Italian political forces re-established by the Mafia after 1992.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Italian politics, corruption, Cold War, partitocracy, Italian political parties</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00001490/01/Dissertation_complete.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/69</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transmission technologies for radio-over-fibre</field><field name="creator">Gamage, P.

Keys to future generations of mobile communication are multimedia communications capability, wireless access to broadband fixed and mobile networks, and seamless roaming among different systems. Increasing demand for currently used bands at lower frequency spectrum has reduced the ability to allocate the large spectrum bandwidths required for broadband radio applications. Current trend in cellular networks, both in mobile and fixed, are to reduce cell size to accommodate more users and to operate in the microwave and millimetre wave frequency bands to avoid spectral congestion. Moreover, larger radio frequency (RF) propagation losses at mm-wave bands reduce the cell size covered by a single base station (BS) and allow an increased frequency reuse factor to improve spectrum utilization efficiency. These factors demand cellular networks to have a larger number of simple, compact and low-cost BSs connecting to a central office to cover a service area. Furthermore, analog optical link nonlinearity, line-of sight constraint, spectral inefficiency, inefficient remote node (RN) architectures and inefficiency in RF power conversion have become major obstacles in achieving high performance fibre-radio systems for the provision of wireless services.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/3426</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/3426</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A country welcome: emotional wellbeing and belonging among Iraqi women in rural Australia</field><field name="creator">Vasey, Katherine Elizabeth</field><field name="description">The Iraqi women in this study have made Australia their &#8216;home&#8217; in the years following the Gulf War in 1991, and are the first generation to move to a small rural town in Australia. The experiences documented in this thesis are based on 15 months of ethnographic research, between March 2003 and June 2004, with twenty-six Iraqi women, sixteen service providers and members of the communities of which they are a part. The focus of the study is on Iraqi women&#8217;s experiences of resettlement, their sense of emotional wellbeing and belonging. By and large, studies of refugee mental health attribute &#8216;refugee suffering&#8217; to pre-migration experiences, rooted to the cultures of peoples&#8217; home countries, principally through war, persecution and trauma, and how this legacy impacts upon women&#8217;s emotional wellbeing and ability to belong in resettlement. In many ways, it is convenient for host countries to ascribe refugee mental health problems to pre-migration experiences because the power dynamics of integration, the complex micro politics and the consequences of encounters with the Australian system are made indiscernible.

It has been shown in theory that in the case of uncharged porous materials the effective diffusion coefficient of solutes is a function of the pore morphology of the material and can be described by their tortuosity (tensor). To estimate the apparent diffusion coefficients, the values of tortuosity and porosity should be known first. In contrast with calculation of porosity, which can be easily obtained, estimation of tortuosity is intricate, particularly with increasing micro-geometry complexity in porous media. Moreover, many engineering materials (e.g, clays and shales) are characterized by electrical surface charges on particles of the porous material which can strongly affect the diffusive transport properties of ions. For these materials, estimation of effective diffusion coefficients have been mostly based on phenomenological equations with no link to underlying microscale properties of these charged materials although a few recent studies have used alternative methods to obtain the diffusion parameters.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">effective diffusion coefficient, tortuosity, clays, multi-scale, Poisson&#8211;Nernst&#8211;Planck equation, numerical modeling, adsorption</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/5780</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of recursive partitioning technique for indexing spatial objects and trajectories</field><field name="creator">Antoine, Elizabeth Arockiarani</field><field name="description">The requirement to store and manipulate data that represents the location and extent of objects, like roads, cities, rivers, etc. (spatial data), led to the evolution of spatial database systems.

The fact that there is no total ordering of objects in space makes the conventional indexes, such as the B+ tree, incapable of handling spatial data.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">recursive paritioning method, indexing spatial objects, indexing trajectories</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/6699</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Creative writing piece; Reaction time, and critical essay; Wide open roads, landscape, place and belonging in Australian outback narratives</field><field name="creator">McCarthy, Brigid</field><field name="description">The thesis contains two components, providing both a creative and critical exploration of the relationship between the subject and place.

A reliable and valid measure of nasality is important, because it not only affects clinical decision making but is also essential for the evaluation of treatment outcomes. In order to allow cross-linguistic comparisons of the assessment of resonance, language specific stimuli developed according to a common set of guidelines have been recommended. The aim of this thesis was to contribute to the development of an assessment protocol for use in Malay speaking individuals with clefts of the lip and/or palate, specifically focusing on the detection of nasality. A series of four studies were completed which systematically developed and then validated a set of stimuli in the Malay language using both perceptual and instrumental measures.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nasality, Malay, cleft lip and/or palate, Nasometer, spectral analysis of resonance, perceptual ratings of nasality</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/5658</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"Like-mindedness"? Intra-familial relations in the Iliad and the Odyssey</field><field name="creator">O'Maley, James</field><field name="description">This thesis argues that the defining characteristic of intra-familial relationships in both the Iliad and the Odyssey is inequality. Homeric relationship pairs that are presented positively are strongly marked by an uneven distribution of power and authority, and when family members do not subscribe to this ideology, the result is a dysfunctional relationship that is condemned by the poet and used as a negative paradigm for his characters. Moreover, the inequality favoured by the epics proceeds according to strict role-based rules with little scope for innovation according to personality, meaning that determination of authority is simple in the majority of cases. Wives are expected to submit themselves to their husbands, sons to their fathers, and less powerful brothers to their more dominant siblings. This rigid hierarchy does create the potential for problems in some general categories of relationship, and relations between mothers and sons in particular are strained in both epics, both because of the shifting power dynamic between them caused by the son&#8217;s increasing maturity and independence from his mother and her world, and because of Homeric epic&#8217;s persistent conjunction of motherhood with death. This category of familial relationships is portrayed in the epics as doomed to failure, but others are able to be depicted positively through adhering to the inequality that is portrayed in the epics as both natural and laudable.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Homer, Iliad, Odyssey, epic, homophrosyne</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/6725</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improving the impact of Australian aid: the role of AusAID's Office of Development Effectiveness</field><field name="creator">Schwebel, Amy Elizabeth</field><field name="description">This research is in response to the current debate on aid in Australia.

Drawing on research about the functions of lay conceptions of humanness in social perception, the current research investigated a novel group-protective strategy: believing that an in group&#8217;s negative traits (flaws) are fundamental aspects of &#8216;human nature&#8217; (HN). A similar protective strategy has been documented when acknowledging flaws in the individual self; this was extended to the acknowledgement of in group flaws in the current studies. In Study 1 (N = 77),participants&#8217; in group-descriptiveness ratings of flaws were most strongly predicted by their HN ratings of flaws, suggesting that people may selectively acknowledge HN flaws as in group-descriptive. Study 2 (N = 51) demonstrated that flaws were rated higher on HN when attributed to an in group than to an out group. However, this effect was not found for positive traits, suggesting that it may reflect a motivation to protect a threatened in group-identity. Study 3 (N = 79) replicated this asymmetrical &#8216;humanising of in group flaws&#8217; effect, and found that it was independent of desirability. In addition in group-identification was measured in Study 3 and found not to moderate the humanising of in group flaws.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">humanness, humanising flaws, human nature, self-humanising, social identity threat, group-protection, intergroup bias</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/6753</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A dynamic approximate representation scheme for streaming time series</field><field name="creator">Zhou, Pu</field><field name="description">The huge volume of time series data generated in many applications poses new challenges in the techniques of data storage, transmission, and computation. Further more, when the time series are in the form of streaming data, new problems emerge and new techniques are required because of the streaming characteristics, e.g. high volume, high speed and continuous flowing. Approximate representation is one of the most efficient and effective solutions to address the large-volume-high-speed problem. In this thesis, we propose a dynamic representation scheme for streaming time series. Existing methods use a unitary function form for the entire approximation task. In contrast, our method adopts a set of function candidates such as linear function, polynomial function(degree &#8805; 2), and exponential function. We provide a novel segmenting strategy to generate subsequences and dynamically choose candidate functions to approximate the subsequences.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">data stream, time series, segmentation, approximate representation</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/6766</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Conceptualising and measuring health literacy from the patient perspective</field><field name="creator">Jordan, Joanne Emma</field><field name="description">The current patient-centred healthcare approach encourages individuals to assume greater roles in decisions about their health.

This entails pedagogical changes and challenges for teachers, especially, in terms of their knowledge, dispositions and practices of critical thinking, which are argued to be fundamental in fulfilling the TSLN thrust. Although TSLN is now 10 years into its implementation, to date, there has been little research undertaken to determine the efficacy of the implementation of the critical thinking policy thrust through the perspectives and voices of both teachers and students &#8212; the key stakeholders of education and the ultimate agents in the successful implementation of educational initiatives.

Through stance and stance-taking, speakers position themselves relative to objects, and to other speakers. Stance is conceptualized as a social action whereby both positioning of the self and evaluation of an object are achieved through language in social interaction.  The central contention is that stances are complex and interrelated social relationships established by speakers in conversation; stance(s) are established not only relative to stance, subject and object, but also to other stances, other objects, other subjects, and context.  This relativity of stance acts to the multiplex vectors of other stance(s) is the basis for the proposal of the stance matrix as a framework for conceptualizing stance in conversation.  Through micro-qualitative analysis of conversational data, speakers are shown to orient to the stance matrix in the everyday achievement of complex structures and sequences of stance acts.  In addition, the communicative means by which stance is achieved in conversation is examined, and the heterodox nature of stance-taking expressions is shown to be critically dependent on an expanded and flexible model of indexicality, relating linguistically enabled stancetaking acts to the stance acts that are thereby achieved.  The role of subjects in the stance matrix is considered in terms of achieving stance acts towards people.  Subjects are shown to be deployed as objects through the intervention of membership categorization to foreground the social roles and/or categories in which people can be categorized.  In conclusion, the stance matrix is proposed as a critical framework for conceptualizing and examining how speakers can be seen to orient to, in conversation, the multiple vectors of stance connecting subjects, objects and other stances.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/6671</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Patriotic and nationalistic song in Australia to 1919: a study of the popular sheet music genre</field><field name="creator">Binns, Georgina Mary</field><field name="description">Since European settlement of Australia, patriotic and nationalistic songs have provided entertainment and given an emotional outlet to the people of Australia.

However, in 1976, two groups of scientists, one in New Zealand, the other in India, independently published essentially the same radical alternative to the double helix. The alternative, Side-By-Side (SBS) or &#8216;warped zipper&#8217; conformation for DNA is not helical. Rather than intertwine, as do Watson and Crick&#8217;s helices, its two exoskeletal strands are topologically independent. Thus, unlike the double helix, they may separated during replication without unwinding. This dissertation presents, but does not arbitrate among scientific arguments. Its concerns are meta-scientific; in particular, why and how the individuals who invented the &amp; &#8216;warped zipper&#8217; came to do so. Against Popper and most recent philosophers of science, it is taken to be &#8220;the business of epistemology to produce what has been called a &#8216;rational reconstruction&#8217; of the steps that have led the scientist to a discovery [Popper (1972), p.31, emphasis in the original].&#8221; On the received view, the invention of the &#8216;warped zipper&#8217; must be irrational or, at best, non-rational  thereby excluding from philosophical investigation. I establish that this philosophical dogma is not true a priori, as is usually supposed, and, in the case of the SBS structure of DNA, false a posteriori.

This thesis explores the relationship between cognitive ability relating to social and non-social processing.  Schizophrenia patients demonstrate an impaired ability to recognise, label and discriminate emotional expression within the face.  The underlying mechanisms behind this social cognitive impairment are not yet fully understood.  This thesis explores the notion that a basic perceptual impairment in processing facial information adversely impacts on the perception of more complex information derived from faces, such as emotional expression.  Face perception relies on processing the featural characteristics of a face as well as the relationship between these features.  Information pertaining to the spatial distances between features is referred to as configural information.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">schizophrenia, configural face processing, emotion, social cognition, neurocognition, bipolar disorder</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/7040</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thiyl radical reactions with alkynes in the absence and presence of oxygen</field><field name="creator">Tan, Kristine Joy Wei Mei</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the reactions of sulfur-centred radicals and alkynes.  The first objective of this work was to extend the scope of &#8220;self-terminating radical cyclisations&#8221; to sulfur-centred radicals, such as thiyl radicals.  Preliminary experiments revealed that the reaction of thiyl radicals with alkynes was sensitive to residual oxygen.  In the absence of oxygen, the reactions of photochemically generated phenylthiyl radicals with cyclodecyne (1) resulted in three isomeric sulfides, which were identified through a combination of techniques.  (1S,6S)-2-phenylthiobicyclo[4.4.0]decane (trans-49a, unknown stereochemistry at C2) was identified by synthesis of an authentic sample, while the structure of (1S,2R,6S)-2-phenylthiobicyclo[4.4.0]decane (cis-49a1) was determined by X-ray analysis of the corresponding crystalline sulfone, cis-69.  The third sulfide, (1S,2S,6S)-2-phenylthio-bicyclo[4.4.0]decane (cis-49a2), was assigned based on computational studies.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">physical organic chemistry, thiyl radicals, alkynes, oxidation, reaction mechanisms</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/7036</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A defense of trivialism</field><field name="creator">Kabay, Paul Douglas</field><field name="description">That trivialism ought to be rejected is almost universally held.

With an absence of major storages or weirs, the flow regime of the Upper Ovens River is close to its natural magnitude and frequency. Water extraction from rivers has the potential to negatively impact on environmental flow requirements and management of extraction is required to maintain flows to the river, especially over the low flow summer periods. The Upper Ovens River has been shown to have a high connectivity between groundwater and surface water, and for effective protection of stream flow, it is proposed that groundwater and surface water are managed conjunctively by a government legislated Water Management Plan. Environmental stream flow objectives have been identified, but no method exists to link these to groundwater objectives. Without this link, water resource managers cannot develop management methods or plans for management of groundwater to achieve surface flow objectives.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">groundwater-river interaction, water management, water balance, Ovens River</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/5724</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Planning contested ground: place, voice and governance in local government planning.  A case study on the provision of community housing</field><field name="creator">Press, Amanda</field><field name="description">This research is about planning and governance relating to people in place and the challenges for local government in reconciling differing community interests in contests over land use.  Victorian state government policy imperatives require local government to encourage community participation and cohesion and to promote urban consolidation by supporting medium density and affordable housing.  Paradoxically, resident backlash to the urban consolidation agenda is increasing community division.  The research explores these themes through a case study of the governance processes in a collaborative effort to develop Woodstock community housing in Balaclava, a gentrifying neighbourhood in inner-urban Melbourne, Australia.  The development is typical of projects which ignite community opposition and challenge local government&#8217;s role in dealing with contested land uses.  The analysis of the governance process was undertaken using qualitative research methods which included in depth interviews with project proponents and objectors and the analysis of secondary data including council and local media reports and policy documents.  The collaborative planning theory of Patsy Healey provided an assessment framework for the Woodstock governance process focussing on the stakeholders, planning discourses and planning practices.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">governance, contest, community housing, local government</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/5781</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cochlear implant sound coding with across-frequency delays</field><field name="creator">Taft, Daniel Adam</field><field name="description">The experiments described in this thesis investigate the temporal relationship between frequency bands in a cochlear implant sound processor.

In particular, it draws attention to the ways in which the pedagogical aims of the New Education intersected with the settler goal of &#8216;indigenisation&#8217;: a process whereby native-born settlers in colonised lands seek to become &#8216;indigenous&#8217;, either by denying the presence of the genuine indigenes, or by appropriating aspects of their culture. Each chapter explores a particular set of pedagogical ideas associated with the New Education and relates it back to the broader context and ideology of settler-colonialism. It examines in turn the overarching goals of the New Education of &#8216;educating citizens&#8217;, within which twentieth-century educationalists sought to mobilise biography and local history to cultivate a &#8216;love of country&#8217; in primary school pupils, exploring the centrality of the &#8216;local&#8217; to the experience-based pedagogy of the New Education. Next, it argues that the tendency of textbook histories to depict governments &#8211; past and present &#8211; in an overwhelmingly positive light, served important ongoing colonising functions. Next it examines the influence of the Victorian ideal of &#8216;character&#8217; in textbooks, particularly during the first two decades of the twentieth century, through a pedagogy centred upon the assumption that the lives of past individuals or groups could be instructive for present generations.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">history education, pedagogy, School Journal, history in schools, cultural colonization, settler-colonialism, New Education, indigenisation</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/7057</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mineralogy, geochemistry and origin of the Kalgoorlie gold deposits, Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Golding, Lee Yvonne</field><field name="description">Rich gold-telluride lodes (steeply dipping and flatly dipping) and minor gold-quartz stockwork mineralization characterize the Kalgoorlie gold-field.

However, these equations are insufficient when applied to flow problems where the effects of non-hydrostatic pressure distribution are predominant. This study provides a comprehensive examination of the feasibility of a simple one-dimensional Boussinesq-type model equation for such types of flow problems. This equation, which allows for curvature of the free surface and a non-hydrostatic pressure distribution, is derived using the momentum principle together with the assumption of a constant centrifugal term at a vertical section. Besides, two Boussinesq-type model equations that incorporate different degrees of corrections for the effects of the curvature of the streamline are investigated in this work. One model, the weakly curved flow equation model, is the simplified version of the flow model based on a constant centrifugal term for flow situations that involve weak streamline curvature and slope, and the other, the Boussinesq-type momentum equation linear model is developed based on the assumption of a linear variation of centrifugal term with depth.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">flow simulation, open channel flow, hydrodynamics, Boussinesq equation, rapidly varied flow</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2413</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The geology and geochemistry of the Agnew Intrusion: implications for the petrogenesis of early Huronian mafic igneous rocks in Central Ontario, Canada</field><field name="creator">Vogel, Derek Christian</field><field name="description">The Early Proterozoic Agnew Intrusion is a well-preserved leucogabbronoritic to gabbronoritic layered intrusion that is a member of the East Bull Lake suite of layered intrusions (ca. 2490-2470 Ma) occurring in central Ontario.

It is imperative to restore these ecosystems to mitigate further declines. In this thesis, I focused on a highly degraded region, the Box-Ironbark forests and woodlands of Victoria, Australia. Rather than mature stands with large trees, stands are currently dominated by high densities of small stems. This change has resulted in reduced populations of many flora and fauna species dependent on older-growth forests and woodlands. Managers are interested in restoring mature Box-Ironbark forests and woodlands through three alternative management strategies: allocating land to National Parks and allowing stands to develop naturally without harvesting, modifying timber harvesting regimes to retain more medium and large trees, or a new ecological thinning technique that retains target habitat trees and removes competing trees to encourage growth of retained stems.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">elicitation, forest restoration, multiple experts, state-and-transition models, uncertainty, box-ironbark, decision theory, management</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/5801</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Measurement of wavefunction overlap of phosphorus donors in silicon</field><field name="creator">Stavrias, Nikolas</field><field name="description">There are many formidable challenges along the road to building a silicon quantum computer, and perhaps none is more demanding than engineering and measuring the coupling between qubits.

For a long time, the Aboriginal Tasmanians were thought to have been annihilated. However, this claim is now understood to be fanciful. Aboriginality is no longer defined as a racial category but rather as an identity that has its basis in community. Nevertheless, extinction discourse continues to shape the features of modern literature about Tasmania. The first chapter of this dissertation will examine how extinction discourse was imagined in the nineteenth century and will trace the parallels that contemporary fiction about contact history shares with it. The novels examined include Doctor Wooreddy&#8217;s Prescription for Enduring the Ending of the World by Mudrooroo, The Savage Crows by Robert Drewe, Manganinnie by Beth Roberts, and Wanting by Richard Flanagan. The extinctionist elements in these novels include a tendency to euglogise about the &#8216;lost race&#8217; and a reliance on the trope of the last man or woman. The second chapter of the dissertation will examine novels that attempt to construct a representation of Aboriginality without reference to extinction. These texts subvert and ironise extinction discourse as a way of breaking the discursive continuities with colonialism and establishing a more nuanced view of Aboriginal identity in a post-colonial context. Novels analysed here include Drift by Brian Castro, Elysium by Robert Edric, and English Passengers by Matthew Kneale.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">extinction discourse, Aboriginal Tasmanians, Tasmanian literature, genocide, indigenous identity</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/6811</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Faith and the state: a history of Islamic philanthropy in Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Fauzia, Amelia</field><field name="description">Zakat (almsgiving), sedekah (donation, giving) and waqf (religious endowment) are forms of philanthropy Muslims in Indonesia, as well as in other parts of the world practice.

Like the films themselves, this protagonist has largely been understood as an allegorical embodiment of a bleak post-World War Two mood of anxiety and disillusionment. Theorists have consistently attributed his pessimism, alienation, paranoia and fatalism to the concurrent American cultural climate. With its themes of murder, illicit desire, betrayal, obsession and moral dissolution, the noir canon also proves conducive to psychoanalytic interpretation. By oedipalising the noir hero and the cinematic text in which he is embedded, this approach at best has produced exemplary noir criticism, but at worst a tendency to universalise his trajectory. This thesis proposes a complementary and newly historicised critical paradigm with which to interpret the noir hero. Such an exegesis encompasses a number of social, aesthetic, demographic and political forces reaching back to the nineteenth century. This will reveal the centrality of modernity in shaping the noir heros ontology. The noir hero will also be connected to the flaneur, a figure who embodied the changes of modernity and who emerged in the mid-nineteenth century as both an historical entity and a critical metaphor for the new subject.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">film noir, men in motion pictures, hardboiled hero, film history and criticism, noir hero, modernity, femme fatale</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00000122/01/latestall_Nolan.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/1338</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The maritime strategy of China in the Asia-Pacific region</field><field name="creator">Huang, An-hao</field><field name="description">This thesis aims to examine how and why a continental-oriented China has shifted its maritime strategic orientation and naval force structure from its coast toward the far seas in an era of interdependent international system.

Undoubtedly, the quest for sea power and sea rights has become Beijing&#8217;s main maritime strategic issue. Given China&#8217;s escalating maritime politico-economic-military leverage in the Asia-Pacific region, its desire to become a leading sea power embodying global strategic thinking means that it must expand its maritime strategy by developing its navy and preparing for armed confrontation in terms of international relations realism.

This proposition is explored in both the ideas and methods of the Indian political psychologist Ashis Nandy. For over thirty-five years Nandy has contributed extensively to a number of debates within a global academic culture, and as a public intellectual in India. His critique of Indian secularism has produced intense controversy, and is a dynamic case to explore this relationship between critique and method, and by extension the identity of the critic. This case study also allows for an analysis, of what is widely accepted, as the confronting features of his critique. In radically questioning the ways in which the ideology of secularism operates in Indian political culture, and in defining concepts of Indianness, Nandy contests dominant political ideas and ideals. Further, he confronts the role these ideas and ideals play in foreclosing understandings of national identity, national integration and Indian democracy. I argue that this confrontation demonstrates a critical and psychoanalytic engagement with the constituting features of Indian political culture, and political identities.

This study traces the progress of a science project on spiders in an Australian early childhood centre which purports to have an emergent curriculum. In particular, this study sought to answer the question: What form does a science learning project take in an early childhood class that purports to have an emergent curriculum philosophy? What are the processes involved? What are the roles of the main players? Was this curriculum truly an emergent one? How did it fit with the different perspectives being taken to emergent curriculum in the literature? Did science learning take place? How did this learning fit with current views on science learning in the literature? Using a participant observation approach, this study looks at factors that characterise the processes and the players in this project and considers these in the context of current views on emergent curriculum and early childhood science. Results indicate that while the curriculum in this centre was clearly &#8216;emergent&#8217;, it differed in some minor aspects from both the Reggio Emilia model and the American model of emergent curriculum. The approach used was consistent with the social constructivist approach to science teaching and was clearly conductive to the children's science learning. The study shows that emergent curriculum is a very appropriate approach for science learning.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">child, children, education, early childhood, science, curriculum</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2392</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of shear on dewatering of flocculated suspensions</field><field name="creator">Gladman, Brendan Robert</field><field name="description">The ability to separate a suspension into its respective solid and liquid constituents is an important requirement in the chemical, wastewater and mineral industries. Typically, separation occurs in open, large diameter tanks known variously as thickeners, settlers or clarifiers. The design and operation of these devices have been based, until recently, on kinematic models and macroscopic mass balances. The problem with these approaches is that consolidation in the bed is not described accurately and consequently, the area required for thickening is often grossly overestimated. Recently, Buscall and White [24] proposed a 1&#8722;D phenomenological theory of dewatering that encompasses both sedimentation and consolidation, providing a more solid grounding for understanding, simulating and optimising dewatering in a range of devices, including thickeners. This theory identifies two important rheological parameters; a concentration dependent yield stress, Py (&#966;) and hindered settling function, R(&#966;).</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">flocculation, shear flow, suspensions, chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/6726</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hypoxia and angiogenesis in renal cell carcinoma</field><field name="creator">Lawrentschuk, Nathan Leo</field><field name="description">Hypoxia is one of the hallmarks of cancer.

If hypoxia is severe or prolonged, cell death occurs.3 Malignant cells can undergo genetic and adaptive changes that allow them to escape from dying of oxygen deprivation.

Low velocity events that appeared in field data semblance analyses suggested that an elastic wave modelling study was required to understand the subcoal reflection response.

A study into the effect of each part of an elastic depth model (upon an elastic depth model (upon an elastic synthetic seismogram) resulted in a set of guidelines for obtaining a field data comparison. Excellent ties were obtained at several wells, often using little more than a partial sonic log. The noise contributions to the synthesis were interpreted using additional synthetics computed from variations upon the depth model and by exercising control over the wave types modelled. Subsequent processing of the synthetics revealed three types of persistent noise in progressively deeper parts of the subcoal image: 1) mode converted interbed multiples (generated within the coal sequence); 2) S-wave reflections and long period multiples (generated between the coal sequence and the Miocene carbonates and 3) surface related multiples.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gippsland, seismic, noise suppression, geology, subcoal</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2429</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The settlement of Melbourne 1851-1893: selected aspects of urban growth</field><field name="creator">Campbell, Joan</field><field name="description">Melbourne was the obvious choice as a prototype of a nineteenth century colonial city in the following study in urban history. It succeeded early to a pre-eminent position within Victoria, indeed of the entire Australian continent and its position of supremacy went unchallenged until the twentieth century. It was never seriously threatened by the claims of rival cities such as Ballarat, Sandhurst or Geelong. In this respect, Melbourne was a classic primate city with a whole-state hinterland and was justly described as "the commercial metropolis of the South". Its favourable geographic location, centrally placed between eastern and western halves of the colony, together with its position at the northern end of Port Phillip Bay provided the logical point of convergance for a railway network spanning the reaches of the interior. This gave a nodal quality to the city which made it the sole effective input-output point for all commerce with the mainland interior.(For complete abstract open document)</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Melbourne, Victoria, urban, growth, settlement, housing, suburbs, history</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2433</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teaching imagination</field><field name="creator">Macknight, Vicki Sandra</field><field name="description">This thesis is about the teaching imagination.

The methods that are currently used for quantitative comparison generally fail to consider the spatial arrangement of element values within spatial fields. Instead, there is a dependence on qualitative methods (e.g. visual comparison) to undertake comparison of many aspects (e.g. intermediate scale features), but such methods are non-repeatable, often biased and difficult to report on.

It considers how law-makers have decided upon what to regulate and where to draw the line between permissible and prohibited activities, and the type of regulatory design strategies and enforcement approaches adopted in each jurisdiction (the &#8216;how to regulate&#8217; question).  It is argued that both jurisdictions have effectively decided upon permissible and prohibited activities as a result of thorough public consultation, research, reviews and the parliamentary process, and have appropriately balanced competing rationales for regulation.  However, the type of regulation used in relation to those who are licensed to research in this area is unsuitable due to an over-emphasis on deterrence and the authoritarian approach taken by the regulatory bureaucracies.  The central thesis is that a responsive regulatory system for licence-holders should be adopted.  It is proposed that such a system would maintain the top level &#8216;command and control&#8217; design strategies and deterrence approaches present in the current regulatory systems for breaches of legislation by non-licence holders and serious breaches by licence holders.

The University of Melbourne's new course joined the early stages of a dual transformation, of legal training into university study and of contemporary common law into an academic discipline. Victoria's Supreme Court immediately gave the law school what was known in America as 'diploma privilege': its students could enter legal practice without passing a separate admission exam. Soon university study became mandatory for locally trained lawyers, ensuring the law school's survival but placing it at the centre of disputes over the kind of education the profession should receive. Friction between practitioners and academics hinted at the negotiation of new roles as university study shifted legal training further from its apprenticeship origins. The structure of the university (linked to the judiciary through membership of its governing council) and the profession (whose organisations did not control the admission of new practitioners) aided the law school's efforts to defend both its training role and its curriculum against outside attack.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">history of The University of Melbourne Law School, history of Melbourne Law School, history of Law schools in Victoria, history of study and teaching of Law in Australia, history of legal education</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/5710</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inquiry learning and creative drama.

It is a progressive and often fatal muscular disease with wide variation in clinical presentation. Two broad clinical categories of Pompe disease have been identified; infantile- and late- onset. In the past decade, enzyme replacement therapy has shown promising results in treating the underlying pathology, resulting in improved clinical outcome. Clinical trials indicating that initiation of treatment at an earlier disease stage leads to a higher chance of preventing permanent damage have led to the proposition of introducing newborn screening for Pompe disease. All forms of Pompe disease are caused by the same pathology, and thus newborn screening has the potential to identify those affected with the more severe infantile-onset form as well as those with late-onset disease who may not present with symptoms until late in life.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pompe, newborn screening, NBS</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/7065</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A comparison of homocysteine levels in first episode psychosis patients and age matched controls</field><field name="creator">Stephens, Timothy Charles Bondfield</field><field name="description">Elevated serum homocysteine concentrations are neurotoxic and are strongly implicated as a risk factor for neuropsychiatric disease (Fabender, Mielke, Bertsch, &amp; Hennerici, 1999; Kim &amp; Pae, 1996; Kruman et al., 2000; Reutens &amp; Sachdev, 2002).

These programmes were realised through new cultural policies, with music the prime target of the governments&#8217; campaigns. I contend that in the search for an appropriate voice West African governments focussed on one group of musicians, the Mande griots. It was through their musical compositions that the State communicated ideology and doctrine to the public. I assert that to focus on a specific ethnic group and promote them as cultural ambassadors was a policy that conflicted with the core principles of West Africa&#8217;s governments, who upheld a doctrine that promoted nationalism over ethnocentrism. It was a neo-colonialist strategy designed to consolidate the rule of the governing party, a contention which I support through an analysis of the role of griots in West African society and an appraisal of the careers of musicians, musical recordings, and musical styles. This thesis represents a historical account of Mande griots in West Africa with respect to their influence on local and national politics.

While the historical war crimes tribunals at Nuremberg and Tokyo have been widely criticised for exercising a &#8220;victor&#8217;s justice&#8221;, this thesis illustrates a discernible shift towards a form of &#8220;victim&#8217;s justice&#8221; that extends beyond the parameters of punishment and proportionality for serious violations of international humanitarian law (IHL). Restorative principles of justice have thus been increasingly incorporated within current international criminal jurisdictions, reflected in victim-friendly legislation at the ICTY and the recently established International Criminal Court (ICC).

It is clear that the Electronic Attack (EA), or jamming, of such radar systems is expected to become a more difficult task. The reason for this research was to address the issue of jamming adaptive radar systems. This required consideration of adaptive jamming systems and the development of a methodology for outlining the features of such a system is proposed as the key contribution of this thesis. For the first time, game-based optimization methods have been applied to a maritime counter-surveillance/counter-targeting scenario involving conventional, as well as so-called &#8216;smart&#8217; noise jamming.Conventional noise jamming methods feature prominently in the origins of radar electronic warfare, and are still widely implemented. They have been well studied, and are important for comparisons with coherent jamming techniques.Moreover, noise jamming is more readily applied with limited information support and is therefore germane to the problem of jamming adaptive radars; during theearly stages when the jammer tries to learn about the radar&#8217;s parameters and its own optimal actions.A radar and a jammer were considered as informed opponents &#8216;playing&#8217; in a non-cooperative two-player, zero-sum game. The effects of jamming on the target detection performance of a radar using Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR)processing were analyzed using a game theoretic approach for three cases: (1) Ungated Range Noise (URN), (2) Range-Gated Noise (RGN) and (3) False-Target (FT) jamming.Assuming a Swerling type II target in the presence of Rayleigh-distributed clutter, utility functions were described for Cell-Averaging (CA) and Order Statistic (OS) CFAR processors and the three cases of jamming. The analyses included optimizations of these utility functions, subject to certain constraints, with respectto control variables (strategies) in the jammer, such as jammer power and spatial extent of jamming, and control variables in the radar, such as threshold parameter and reference window size. The utility functions were evaluated over the players&#8217; strategy sets and the resulting matrix-form games were solved for the optimal or &#8216;best response&#8217; strategies of both the jammer and the radar.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">non-cooperative games, zero sum games, Nash equilibrium, saddle points, minimax, target detection, Rayleigh clutter, constant false alarm rate, incoherent noise jamming, CFAR, Cell Averaging CFAR, Order Statistic CFAR, ungated range noise, range gated noise, false target jamming</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00002983/01/Thesis.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/293</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing script-specific recognition ability - the case of  learners of Japanese</field><field name="creator">Toyoda,  Etsuko</field><field name="description">Reading non-alphabetic script can be a serious challenge to second language (L2) learners with alphabetic backgrounds.

By analysing the results of behavioural tests and a verbal protocol administered to both L1 and L2 readers of Japanese, the study described the changes in developing L2 learners&#8217; kanji recognition skills and their awareness of the structure and function of characters at the different stages of L2 exposure.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Japanese, kanji, character, word, recognition, skills, awareness, L2, skilled, less-skilled, readers, development, reading, script, processing, structure, function, transformation, exposure, instruction</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/00002971/01/etoyoda-phd-thesis.pdf</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/292</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A conceptual framework for  situated task analysis  within the context of  Computer-Assisted Language Learning  system design</field><field name="creator">Farmer, Rod</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the role of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) task  analysis within the context of Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL)  system design.

The state had a systematic plan of cultural repression and manipulation of public opinion. Even though there was not an official censorship office, the regime had an organised and sophisticated operating control over publication and public performance. However, the dissident writers and lyricists examined in this study developed strategies of resistance that depended largely on allegory and irony to convey subtle and oblique oppositional messages. By means of a detailed rhetorical analysis of a varied literary and popular corpus this study examines the functioning of allegory and irony under the constraints of censorship. The corpus includes the musical production of one of the most outstanding representatives of the rock nacional movement and four novels. The fictional narratives selected are divided into two symmetrical groups: in each group, one novel is written by a female writer and the other by a male author; one has reached a large readership and popularity while the other had a delayed reception but has won critical acclaim.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">censorship, irony, allegory, Argentina</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/7070</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An ethico-aesthetics of injecting drug use:  body, space, memory, capital</field><field name="creator">Malins, Peta Husper</field><field name="description">Harm minimisation approaches to illicit drug use have proven extremely successful in reducing drug-related harm and improving health outcomes for those using drugs, their families and the broader community.

Following an introduction to their key concepts, this thesis explores the implications of their ontology for understandings of injecting drug use across four inter-related dimensions: the drug using body; urban spaces of injecting; public overdose memorials; and drug referenced, &#8216;heroin chic&#8217; advertising imagery.

Using an immunohistochemical approach, this study demonstrated that PACRG is localised to the human sperm flagella.  To investigate a potential role for PACRG in human male infertility, sequence analysis and an association study were performed.  Sequence analysis did not identify any pathological alterations.

Appropriate use is use of an audit support system in a manner consistent with how the audit firm expects the system to be used.  Investigating appropriate use of audit support systems is important because the extent to which these systems can assist auditors achieve efficient and high quality audits depends on how auditors use them.  Adaptive Structuration Theory (AST) (DeSanctis and Poole, 1994) and the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) (Ajzen, 1991) are combined to model the relationship between constructs hypothesised to increase the probability that audit support systems are used appropriately.  The theoretical model decomposes two TPB antecedents, perceived normative pressure (or subjective norms) and perceived behavioural control, into the exogenous constructs hypothesised to influence whether audit support systems are used appropriately.  Perceived normative pressure is decomposed into two socio-ideological control mechanisms, team and firm consensus on appropriation.  Perceived behavioural control is decomposed into self-efficacy and two technocratic control mechanisms, perceived system restrictiveness and perceived audit review effectiveness.

This rise is due to increases in electrode impedance which in turn is suggested to be a result of tissue growth around the electrode array.  The foreign body response initiated by the immune system encapsulates the array in a matrix of fibrous tissue, separating the electrode array from the rest of the body.  A second change in electrode impedance occurs with the onset of electrical stimulation.  A transitory reduction in impedance has been recorded in animals and humans after stimulation of electrodes.  Impedance returns to pre-stimulation levels following the cessation of stimulation.  It was suggested that these changes in impedance with stimulation were also related to the tissue growth around the electrode array.

A.</field><field name="description">This study investigated understorey management in Canterbury, New Zealand, apple orchards for the enhancement of populations of Dolichogenidea tasmanica (Cameron) (Braconidae) for leafroller (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) biological control. The first objective was to determine the influence of understorey plants on the abundance of D. tasmanica and leafroller parasitism, and to investigate the mechanisms behind this influence. The second was to determine the most suitable understorey plants in terms of their ability to enhance parasitoid abundance, leafroller parasitism, parasitoid longevity, parasitoid fecundity and its ability to not benefit leafroller. Results from three consecutive field trials showed that buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench), coriander (Coriandrum sativum L.), alyssum (Lobularia maritima (L.) Desv), and, to a lesser extent, broad bean (Vicia faba L.), enhanced parasitoid abundance and leafroller parasitism. The mechanisms behind the effects of understorey plants had previously been unexplored. However, results here showed that it was the flowers or the buckwheat that 'attracted' the parasitoid to the plant and not the shelter, aphids or microclimate that the plant may also provide. Providing flowering plants in the orchard understorey also increased immigration of parasitoids and enhanced parasitoids and enhanced parasitoid longevity and fecundity in the laboratory. In contrast, the understorey plants had no influence on the female:male ratio of D. tasmanica.  Although coriander enhanced leafroller parasitism three-fold in field experiments compared with controls, it failed to enhance the longevity of both sexes of D. tasmanica in the laboratory compared with water-only. Broad bean significantly enhanced parasitoid abundance three-fold and significantly increased parasitism from 0% to 75% compared with the controls on one leafroller release date. However, laboratory trials showed that of male D. tasmancia but it did not enhance female longevity. Also, female D. tasmanica foraging on broad bean produced a total of only three parasitoid cocoons, but this result was based on an overall 6.5% survival of larvae to pupae or to parasitoid cocoon. Furthermore, results suggested that extrafloral nectar secretion decreased as the plants matured. Phacelia (Phacelia tanacetifolia Benth.) did not significantly enhance parasitism rate in the field compared with controls, and numbers of D. tasmanica captured by suction sampling were significantly lower in phacelia treatments compared with alyssum, buckwheat and control plots. Also, laboratory experiments showed that survival of D. tasmanica on phacelia flowers was equivalent to that on water-only and significantly lower than on buckwheat. These results suggest that phacelia does not provide nectar to D. tasmanica, only pollen, and therefore is not a suitable understorey plant for D. tasmanica enhancement in orchards. Buckwheat and alyssum showed the most potential as understorey plants for the enhancement of natural enemies. Buckwheat not only increased numbers of D. tasmanica seven-fold, but also increased numbers of beneficial lacewings (Micromus tasmaniae (Walker)) and hover flies (Syrphidae) captured on yellow sticky traps compared with the controls. It significantly increased leafroller parasitism by D. tasmanica from 0% to 86% compared with the controls (on one date only), and in the laboratory enhanced D. tasmanica longevity and increased fecundity compared with water-only. Similarly, alyssum significantly increased parasitism rate compared with controls, and two-fold more D. tasmanica were suction sampled in these plots compared with controls. It also enhanced longevity of both sexes of D. tasmanica compared with water, and showed the most favourable characteristics in terms of being of no benefit to leafrollers. This is because it was not preferred over apple by leafroller larvae and when they were forced to feed on it, it caused high mortality (94.3%) and low pupal weight (15 mg). Furthermore, alyssum did not enhance the number of fertile eggs produced by adult leafrollers compared with water only. However, further research is required to address the overall effect of buckwheat and alyssum on crop production and orchard management, including effects on fruit yield and quality, frost risk, disease incidence, soil quality, weeds and other pests. Also, research into the ability of these plants to survive in the orchard with little maintenance, and into the optimal sowing rates, would be useful. Sampling natural populations of leafroller within each treatment showed that damage from leafrollers and the number of leafroller larvae were respectively 20.3% and 29.3% lower in the flowering treatments compared with the controls. Furthermore, field trials showed up to a six-fold increase in leafroller pupae in controls compared with buckwheat and alyssum. This suggests that increasing leafroller parasitism rate from understorey management in orchards will translate into lower pest populations, although neither larval numbers/damage nor pupal numbers differed significantly between treatments. Trapping D. tasmanica at a gradient of distances showed that this parasitoid travels into rows adjacent to buckwheat plots, indicating that growers may be able to sow flowering plants in every second or third row of the orchard, and still enhance leafroller biocontrol while minimising the adverse effects of a cover crop. Sowing buckwheat and alyssum in orchard understoreys may enhance biological control of apple pests in organic apple production and reduce the number of insect growth regulators applied in IFP programmes. However, the challenge still remains to investigate whether conservation biological control can reduce leafroller populations below economic thresholds.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">leafroller</field><field name="subject">Tortricidae</field><field name="subject">parasitoid</field><field name="subject">Dolichogenidea tasmanica</field><field name="subject">understorey management</field><field name="subject">apple orchard</field><field name="subject">enhancement</field><field name="subject">Phacelia tanacetifolia</field><field name="subject">Fagopyrum esculentum</field><field name="subject">Coriandrum sativum</field><field name="subject">Lobularia maritima</field><field name="subject">Vicia faba L.</field><field name="subject">conservation biological control</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270703 Terrestrial ecology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300300 Horticulture::300303 Plant protection (pests, diseases and weeds)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1111</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Haumanu taiao ihumanea: collaborative study with Te Tai O Marokura Kaitiaki Group : Tuakana Miriama Kahu, Teina Benita Wakefield</field><field name="creator">Wakefield, Benita</field><field name="description">The health of the environment is integral to the health and wellbeing of the people.  When the balance between Atua, whenua and tangata is disrupted, desecrated, disturbed or violated, it can have a detrimental impact on these relationships.  This research study explored alternative indigenous paradigms for conceptualizing an environmental health framework that would improve the potency and health of all living things.  A key question of the research study was to explore how Ngati Kuri sought to strengthen their relationship and connection with the natural world.  The Hapu established Te Tai O Marokura health and social services as a vehicle to improve potency: healthy environments, healthy people.  The specificity of Ngati Kuri experiences provided a broader context for researching and theorizing about restorative models that utilized traditional knowledge localized to a particular area.  Another key question was to examine how Maori cultural values that were embedded within a worldview, could offer insights and constructs for new ways of being and thinking in the modern world.  Kaupapa Maori philosophical positioning and theorizing informed the approaches and practices underpinning the study.  The key aspects of the methodology were constructed around the tikanga principles of tinorangatiratanga, whakapapa and kaitiakitanga to provide a rationale for the collaboration formed with the Hapu.  At the heart of the thesis is the validity given to the collective ownership of indigenous knowledge which challenges the fictional notion of a singular, temporally bound authorship.  The thesis reflects the whakawhanaungatanga (reciprocal understanding) relationship between the Tuakana represented by Miriama Kahu and the Teina, Benita Wakefield working collaboratively with the  Kaitiaki construct group formed to ensure that the use of indigenous knowledge and its transmission processes had honest transparency.  The Tuakana was responsible for providing guidance, wisdom and mentoring to the Teina,  the enrolled academic student responsible for producing the written thesis.  These innovative collaborative Kaupapa Maori methods and practices in the study have tested the boundaries of conventional doctoral processes, breaking university academic regulations and challenging the western academy in the political nature of collective knowledge production and validity of indigenous knowledge. Qualitative and quantitative processes, approaches and methods were also utilized to inform the study and to ensure reflexivity of research practices. The key findings of the study were: &#8226;	Improving potency requires a depth of intimacy and connection with all living things that involves a reciprocal understanding of the relationship between Atua, whenua and tangata. &#8226;	Indigenous knowledge is localized to a spatial area and embedded within a worldview that validates and affirms cultural values and beliefs which continue to have relevance in more contemporary times. &#8226;	The transformative nature of alternative indigenous paradigms must encompass the totality of creation, humanity and their genealogical and inter-generational linkages to all life. A major contribution of this PhD has been to create new knowledge, ways of thinking and meaning for restoring potency through the environmental health conceptual framework grounded in cultural and spiritual values.  The specific focus on Ngati Kuri traditional knowledge authentic to the Hapu and their application, has significantly contributed towards constructing alternative indigenous approaches for meeting the challenges within the modern world.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Collaboration</field><field name="subject">Tuakana-Teina</field><field name="subject">Kaupapa Maori</field><field name="subject">environmental health</field><field name="subject">potency</field><field name="subject">totality of knowledge</field><field name="subject">matauranga</field><field name="subject">Ngati Kuri</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science::300899 Environmental science not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1335</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nitrate leaching and nitrous oxide emission from grazed grassland: upscaling from lysimeters to farm</field><field name="creator">Dennis, S. J.</field><field name="description">Irish agriculture is becoming increasingly regulated, with restrictions on fertiliser application rates and stocking rates to reduce nitrate (NO&#8320;&#8315;) leaching losses. However these regulations have been, to date, based on minimal field research. The purpose of this study was to determine the actual leaching losses of nitrate from Irish dairy pasture at a range of stocking rates, and to investigate the effectiveness of the nitrification inhibitor DCD at reducing nitrate leaching losses where these are deemed excessive.  In grazed pastures, a major source of leached nitrate is the urine patch, where a high rate of N is applied in one application. This trial recorded the losses from urine and non-urine areas of pasture separately.  Nitrate leaching losses from three soils were recorded using lysimeters at Johnstown Castle, Co. Wexford, over two years. Total nitrate losses were higher from the freely drained Clonakilty and Elton soils than from the heavy Rathangan soil. Mean nitrate losses from urine patches ranged from 16 - 233 kg nitrate-N / ha&#8315;&#185;, and were reduced by up to 53% when DCD was applied. DCD also reduced peak and mean nitrate-N concentrations in many cases. In addition, DCD halved the nitrous oxide (N&#8322;O) emission factor on the Rathangan soil, caused increases in pasture N content, and increased herbage yield in some treatments.  The distribution of urine patches under dairy grazing was recorded using GPS at Kilworth, Co. Cork. Cows were also found to deposit 0.359 urine patches per grazing hour.  A model was produced to predict field-scale nitrate leaching losses from dairy pasture at a range of stocking rates. At 2.94 cows per hectare, the highest stocking rate, annual field N loss was below 34 kg nitrate-N ha&#8315;&#185;, mean drainage N concentrations were below 5.65 mg nitrate-N L&#8315;&#185; (the EU drinking water guideline value), and the worst-case-scenario autumn peak concentration did not exceed 21.55 mg nitrate-N L&#8315;&#185; (above the EU Maximum Allowable Concentration (MAC) but below the World Health Organisation (WHO) drinking water limit). DCD reduced total annual field N loss by 21% (a conservative estimate), and also reduced mean and peak nitrate concentrations.  Provided fertiliser application rates are at or below 291 kg N ha&#8315;&#185;, and based on current legislative values for drinking water quality, this trial does not support any blanket restrictions on the stocking rate of Irish dairy farms. However where particularly high water quality is required, DCD shows potential as a useful tool to achieve low nitrate concentrations.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nitrate</field><field name="subject">nitrous oxide</field><field name="subject">dicyandiamide</field><field name="subject">DCD</field><field name="subject">Ireland</field><field name="subject">leaching</field><field name="subject">gaseous emission</field><field name="subject">herbage</field><field name="subject">dairy</field><field name="subject">cattle</field><field name="subject">urine</field><field name="subject">spatial distribution</field><field name="subject">soil</field><field name="subject">water quality</field><field name="subject">nitrification inhibitor</field><field name="subject">grazed pastures</field><field name="subject">grassland</field><field name="subject">agriculture</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300100 Soil and Water Sciences::300199 Soil and water sciences not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300100 Soil and Water Sciences::300105 Applied hydrology (drainage, flooding, irrigation, quality etc)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1269</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Patterns of invertebrate distribution and abundance on Cordyline australis in human-modified landscapes</field><field name="creator">Guthrie, Ruth J.</field><field name="description">Fragmentation of forest habitat by urban and rural development has had profound effects on the distribution and abundance of many native species; however, little is known about the ecological processes driving patterns in community structure (species richness and composition) of host-specialised herbivores in modified habitats. I examined patterns in community structure of 9 specialist and 19 generalist invertebrate herbivores of cabbage trees (Cordyline australis Laxmanniaceae) across a highly-modified landscape. I found that, although species richness of specialists was highest in forest sites, the majority of host-specialised species were not restricted to forest habitats and were as widespread as many generalists. In terms of site occupancy, only two specialist and four generalist species were rare. I show that patterns of species occupancy and abundance reflect differing susceptibility to habitat modification, with landscape-level variation an important predictor of abundance for nearly all species. When species occurrences and life history traits were considered I did not find strong evidence for the importance of dispersal ability, which suggests that habitat variability had a stronger organising effect on the community. In a replicated common garden experiment, I found distinct regional patterns in the community structure of the specialist invertebrates occurring on different phylogenetic groups of C. australis. In contrast, community structure of generalist herbivores did not differ significantly among host genotypes. I speculate these patterns are due to historical changes in the distribution of cabbage trees in the Southern phylogenetic region that caused specialised herbivores to become locally adapted on populations of low genetic diversity following expansion after the last glacial maximum. However, this consistent selection pressure did not occur in the Northern region where C. australis habitat has been more consistently available over the past tens of thousands of years, reflected in higher host genetic diversity. This study has advanced our understanding of the patterns in community structure of an indigenous, host-specialised fauna in a highly modified and fragmented urban and rural landscapes.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand cabbage tree</field><field name="subject">Cordyline australis</field><field name="subject">habitat modification</field><field name="subject">insect herbivory</field><field name="subject">local adaptation</field><field name="subject">phylogeography</field><field name="subject">species composition</field><field name="subject">species richness</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270704 Landscape ecology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270708 Conservation and biodiversity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1235</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Components of grain yield in wheat</field><field name="creator">Scott, W.

First, can the structure and nature of motivation for the consumption of luxury products be identified? Second, are there differences between consumers from different parts of the world in their motivation for consuming luxury products? Third, can cultural values be used to predict motivation for the consumption of luxury products? Data was obtained by way of an online survey at a New Zealand University, and via a mixed-mode survey at a public University in Thailand. A total of 307 (NZ n=130; Thai n=177) usable responses were obtained.  In respect of the first research question, the model of motivation for consuming luxuries developed by Vigneron and Johnson (1999) was empirically tested. This model proposed that five forms of motivation would exist; status, uniqueness, conformity, quality, and hedonic. In the present study, a four factor model of consumer motivation was uncovered, consisting of status-seeking, pleasure-seeking, uniqueness-seeking, and value-seeking. Value-seeking emerged as the most important motivation for the consumption of luxury products. Status-seeking was the least important form of motivation. This finding suggests that the conventional emphasis in the luxury products literature, on status as a motivator of luxury consumption, may be misplaced. In respect of the second research question, differences were found to exist between New Zealanders and Thais in the importance that respondents attach to the different forms of motivation for consuming luxuries (Wilks Lambda = 0.540, F= 61.167, p = &lt;0.001). A series of univariate ANOVAs identified that Thais possess higher levels of value-seeking motivation than New Zealanders (F = 15.152, p = 0.000), and that New Zealanders possessed significantly higher levels of pleasure-seeking than Thais (F = 87.589, p = 0.000). No significant difference was found to exist between New Zealanders and Thais in respect of status-seeking and uniqueness-seeking.  In order to investigate the third and final research question, it was necessary to measure the orientation of participants in the research towards a set of cultural values. The four-quadrant individualism, collectivism and vertical, horizontal typology of cultural orientation was used as the basis of cultural values in this research (Triandis, 1995). This typology suggests that there are two forms of individualism: vertical (VI) and horizontal (HI), and two forms of collectivism: vertical (VC) and horizontal (HC). This was measured on the scale developed by Singelis, Triandis, Bhawuk and Gelfand (1995). The cultural orientation of individuals was found to be more heterogenous within countries than was anticipated. Whilst, as expected, Thais primarily orientated towards VC, there were significant numbers of individuals who orientated towards HI and HC. New Zealanders were largely split between HI and HC. Correlation analysis and a series of multiple regressions were conducted in order to investigate the relationship between cultural orientation and motivation for consuming luxuries. VI and VC were found to be related to status-seeking. VI and HC were positively related to pleasure-seeking, and VC was found to be negatively related to pleasure-seeking. HI was related to uniqueness-seeking. VC and HI were found to be related to value-seeking.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">consumer</field><field name="subject">luxury</field><field name="subject">cross-cultural</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1236</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Harvest index variability within and between field pea (Pisum sativum L.) crops</field><field name="creator">Moot, Derrick J.</field><field name="description">The association between individual plant performance and seed yield variability within and between field pea crops was investigated. In 1988/89 six F8 genotypes with morphologically distinct characteristics were selected from a yield evaluation trial. Analysis of the individual plant performance within these crops indicated an association between low seed yields and the location and dispersion of plant harvest index (PHI) and plant weight (PWT) distributions. The analyses also showed there was a strong linear relationship between the seed weight (SWT) and PWT of the individual plants within each crop, and that the smallest plants tended to have the lowest PHI values. A series of 20 simulations was used to formalize the relationships between SWT, PWT and PHI values within a crop into a principal axis model (PAM). The PAM was based on a principal axis which represented the linear relationship between SWT and PWT, and an ellipse which represented the scatter of data points around this line. When the principal axis passed through the origin, the PHI of a plant was independent of its PWT and the mean PHI was equal to the gradient of the axis. However, when the principal axis had a negative intercept then the PHI was dependent on PWT and a MPW was calculated. In 1989/90 four genotypes were sown at five plant populations, ranging from 9 to 400 plants m&#8315;&#178;. Significant seed and biological yield differences were detected among genotypes at 225 and 400 plants m&#8315;&#178;. The plasticity of yield components was highlighted, with significant genotype by environment interactions detected for each yield component. No relationship was found between results for yield components from spaced plants and those found at higher plant populations. The two highest yielding genotypes (CLU and SLU) showed either greater stability or higher genotypic means for PHI than genotypes CVN and SVU. Despite significant skewness and kurtosis in the SWT, PWT, and PHI distributions from the crops in this experiment, the assumptions of the PAM held. The lower seed yield and increased variability in PHI values for genotype CVN were explained by its higher MPW and the positioning of the ellipse closer to the PWT axis intercept than in other genotypes. For genotype SVU, the lower seed yield and mean PHI values were explained by a lower slope for the principal axis. Both low yielding genotypes were originally classified as having vigorous seedling growth and this characteristic may be detrimental to crop yields. A method for selection of field pea genotypes based on the PAM is proposed. This method enables the identification of weak competitors as single plants, which may have an advantage over vigorous plants when grown in a crop situation.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">field peas</field><field name="subject">conventional leafed</field><field name="subject">semi-leafless</field><field name="subject">harvest index variability</field><field name="subject">principal axis model</field><field name="subject">yield components</field><field name="subject">minimum plant weight</field><field name="subject">ideotype</field><field name="subject">seedling vigour</field><field name="subject">Pisum sativum L.</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300200 Crop and Pasture Production::300203 Plant improvement (selection, breeding and genetic engineering)</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300200 Crop and Pasture Production</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1285</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of water stress, nitrogen and gibberellic acid on the phytotoxicity of post-emergent herbicides to Avena spp.</field><field name="creator">Dickson, Ross L.</field><field name="description">A series of experiments was carried out on cultivated oat (Avena sativa L. cv Amuri) to examine the efficacies of fluazifop-butyl and glyphosate against water stressed plants, plants grown in low and high nitrogen and plants treated with gibberellic acid (GA&#8323;). Avena sativa L. was used as a test plant and on completion of the experiments, further studies were carried out on the weed species wild oat (Avena fatua L.).  In the laboratory, plants maintained at wilting point for five days before and nine days after spraying and treated with fluazifop-butyl (0.5 kg a.i./ha) appeared healthy 32 days after herbicide application, while plants supplied with water throughout the experiment were completely chlorotic/necrotic and had main stem detachment from within the leaf sheaths. In the field, plants maintained unirrigated until 14 days after spraying with fluazifop-butyl (0.25 kg a.i./ha) or glyphosate (0.18 kg a.i./ha) showed greater tolerance to the herbicides than plants irrigated regularly. Values for seed head yield for water stressed and irrigated plants, 45 days after applying fluazifop-butyl, were 66 g and zero g dryweight/m&#178; respectively. Comparable values for glyphosate treated plants were 65 g and 25 g dryweight/m&#178;. Radiolabel studies indicated that in comparision with well watered plants, water stressed plants absorbed 20% less applied &#185;&#8308;C-glyphosate. In addition, the proportion of absorbed &#185;&#8308;C-glyphosate translocated from the treated leaf was 15% less under water stress conditions. Uptake of &#185;&#8308;C-fluazifop-butyl was similar under well watered and water stress conditions and was 30-40% of that applied. The proportion of absorbed &#185;&#8308;C-activity which was transported was very low, but was greater under well watered conditions (7.6%) than under water stress conditions (4.4%). Under well watered conditions in the laboratory and field, fluazifop-butyl (0.25 kg a.i./ha) and glyphosate (0.18 kg a.i./ha) were less toxic at low nitrogen than high nitrogen. For example, 34 days after spraying with fluazifop-butyl under laboratory conditions total plant dry weight was 1.51 g and 0.56 g at 1.0 mol/m&#179; and 10 mol/m&#179; applied nitrate respectively. As with soil water content, soil nitrogen content had no effect on uptake of fluazifop-butyl. However, the proportion of absorbed fluazifop-butyl which was translocated out of the treated lamina was greater under high nitrogen conditions (26.1 %) than under low nitrogen conditions (9.3%). Under laboratory conditions, addition of 200 &#181;g GA&#8323;to the leaf sheaths two days prior to spraying with fluazifop-butyl or glyphosate increased the efficacy of both herbicides at low nitrogen. Similarly, under field conditions application of GA&#8323; (0.21 kg/ha) two days prior to spraying with glyphosate increased the performance of the herbicide against Avena sativa L. growing in a nitrogen depleted soil. At harvest, seed head yield for GA&#8323; treated and non-treated plants was zero and 7.4 g dry weight/m&#178; respectively. Experiments with Avena latua L. showed that this species was tolerant of fluazifop-butyl and glyphosate when grown in low water or low nitrogen conditions. Under water stress conditions, pre-treatment with GA&#8323; increased the phytotoxicity of fluazifop-butyl to Avena latua L. Similarily, GA&#8323; enhanced the phytotoxicity of glyphosate to Avena latua L. grown under low nitrogen conditions. Reduced performance of fluazifop-butyl under stress conditions involves a reduction in translocation of herbicide to meristems, but other factors are likely to be involved. It was concluded that for glyphosate, reductions in uptake and translocation of the herbicide are important factors causing reduced performance of this herbicide under stress conditions. Possible reasons for GA&#8323; enhancement of fluazifop-butyl and glyphosate activity under stress conditions are discussed and the potential of growth regulators as adjuvants is considered.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Avena sativa L.</field><field name="subject">fluazifop-butyl</field><field name="subject">glyphosate</field><field name="subject">water stress</field><field name="subject">herbicides</field><field name="subject">weed control</field><field name="subject">nitrogen</field><field name="subject">gibberellic acid</field><field name="subject">phytotoxicity</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300200 Crop and Pasture Production::300204 Plant protection (pests, diseases and weeds)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1283</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The socio-economic consequences of tourism in Levuka, Fiji</field><field name="creator">Fisher, David</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the proposition that the local population at a tourist destination copy the economic behaviour of tourists and learn to give economic value to the same objects and activities that are demonstrated by tourists. Levuka, the old capital of Fiji, served as the case study. It was found that decisions are based on the experiences and the cultural template of which those decisions are a part. There are many acculturating factors involved in the learning process as a subsistance-based economy becomes more monetised. The purchasing habits of tourists have little obvious effect. However, there is evidence that what is of value to tourists and what encourages them to visit the destination are not fully appreciated by many of the host population. Examples of these culturally dissimilar values are externalities such as the physical structures of the built environment and unquantifiable factors such as the ambience of the destination. It is argued that an understanding of the factors that have created cultural rules is necessary if a complete analysis of the effects of tourism is to be undertaken. This can be achieved by considering change as a process and tracing that process by examining the cultural history of the host community. Tourism should be seen as another aspect of change. The response to tourism will then be seen as a new challenge that will be met using the lessons previously learnt and incorporated into the cultural template.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="subject">local perceptions</field><field name="subject">Fiji</field><field name="subject">Levuka</field><field name="subject">economic behaviour</field><field name="subject">tourism development</field><field name="subject">heritage</field><field name="subject">westernisation</field><field name="subject">cultural values</field><field name="subject">spending patterns</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350500 Tourism</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420307 Pacific cultural studies</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370400 Human Geography::370404 Economic geography</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1284</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Study of the fate and transport of estrogenic hormones in dairy effluent applied to pasture soils</field><field name="creator">Steiner, Laure D.</field><field name="description">The disposal of waste from agricultural activities has been recognised as a  source of environmental contamination by endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). The New Zealand dairy industry produces a large volume of dairy farm effluent, which contains EDCs in the form of estrogens. Most of this dairy farm effluent is applied onto the land for disposal. Groundwater and soil contamination by estrogens following waste application on the land have been reported overseas, but our understanding of the processes and factors governing the fate of estrogens in the soil is poor. Therefore the main goal of the present study was to better understand the fate and transport of estrogens, in particular 17&#946;-estradiol (E2) and estrone (E1) in soil.  In order to quantify E1 and E2 in drainage water and soil samples, chemical analysis by gas-chromatography mass-spectrometry (GC-MS) was carried out. This included sample extraction, sample clean-up through silica gel and gel permeation chromatography, and sample extract derivatisation prior to analysis. In order to develop a reliable method to extract estrogens from soil, research was conducted to optimise E1 and E2 extraction conditions by adjusting the number of sonication and shaking events, as well as the volume and type of solvent. Among five solvents and solvent mixtures tested, the best recovery on spiked and aged soil was obtained using an isopropanol/water (1:1) mix.  A microcosm experiment was carried out to determine the dissipation rates of E2 and E1, at 8&#176;C and at field capacity, in the Templeton soil sampled at two different depths (5-10 cm and 30-35 cm). The dissipation rates decreased with time and half-life values of 0.6-0.8 d for E1 and 0.3-0.4 d for E2 were found for the two depths studied.  A field transport experiment was also carried out in winter, over three months, by applying dairy farm effluent spiked with estrogens onto undisturbed Templeton soil lysimeters (50 cm in diameter and 70 cm deep). The hormones were applied in dairy farm effluent at 120 mg m&#8315;&#178; for E2 and 137 mg m&#8315;&#178; for E1. The results of the transport experiment showed that in the presence of preferential/macropore flow pathways 0.3-0.7% of E2 and 8-13% of E1 was recovered in the leachate at the bottom of the lysimeters after 3 months, and 1-7% of the recovered E2 and 3-54% of the recovered E1 was leached within 2 days of application. These results suggest that leaching of estrogens via preferential/macropore flow pathways is the greatest concern for groundwater contamination. In the absence of preferential/macropore flow pathways, a significant amount (&gt; 99.94%) of both hormones dissipated in the top 70 cm of soil, due to sorption and rapid biodegradation. Surprisingly, in all cases, estrogen breakthrough occurred before that of an inert tracer (bromide). This could not be explained by the advection-dispersion transport of estrogens, nor by their presence as antecedent concentrations in the soil. It was therefore suggested that colloidal enhanced transport of estrogens was responsible for the earlier breakthrough of estrogens and caused the leaching of a fraction of the applied estrogens to a soil depth of 70 cm.  A two-phase model, adapted from a state-space mixing cell model, was built to describe the observed estrogen transport processes under transient flow. The model takes into account 3 transport processes namely, advection-dispersion, preferential/macropore flow and colloidal enhanced transport. This model was able to successfully describe the estrogen transport observed from the lysimeters.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Colloidal enhanced transport</field><field name="subject">contaminant transport</field><field name="subject">endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs)</field><field name="subject">17beta-estradiol (E2)</field><field name="subject">estrone (E1)</field><field name="subject">clean-up steps</field><field name="subject">gas-chromatography mass-spectrometry (GC-MS)</field><field name="subject">isopropanol/water</field><field name="subject">lysimeter</field><field name="subject">Templeton soil</field><field name="subject">preferential/macropore flow</field><field name="subject">modelling</field><field name="subject">sonication extraction</field><field name="subject">state-space mixing cell model</field><field name="subject">trace analysis</field><field name="subject">transient flow</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1306</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The dynamic interplay of mechanisms governing infiltration into structured and layered soil columns</field><field name="creator">Carrick, Sam</field><field name="description">Worldwide there is considerable concern over the effects of human activities on the quantity and quality of freshwater. Measurement of infiltration behaviour will be important for improving freshwater management. This study identifies that New Zealand has a sporadic history of measuring soil water movement attributes on a limited number of soil types, although the current practical demand should be large for management of irrigation, dairy farm effluent disposal, as well as municipal / domestic waste- and storm-water disposal. Previous research has demonstrated that infiltration behaviour is governed by the interplay between numerous mechanisms including hydrophobicity and preferential flow, the latter being an important mechanism of contaminant leaching for many NZ soils. Future characterisation will need to recognise the dynamic nature of these interactions, and be able to reliably characterise the key infiltration mechanisms. Since macropores are responsible for preferential flow, it is critical that infiltration studies use a representative sample of the macropore network. The aim of this project was to study the mechanisms governing the infiltration behaviour of a layered soil in large (50 x 70 cm) monolith lysimeters, where the connectivity of the macropore network remains undisturbed. Four lysimeters of the Gorge silt loam were collected, a structured soil with four distinct layers. On each lysimeter there were four separate infiltration experiments, with water applied under suctions of 0, 0.5, 1, and 1.5 kPa by a custom-built tension infiltrometer. Each lysimeter was instrumented with 30 tensiometers, located in arrays at the layer boundaries. There was also a field experiment using ponded dye infiltration to visually define preferential flowpaths. Analysis of dye patterns, temporal variability in soil matric potential (&#936;m), and solute breakthrough curves all show that preferential flow is an important infiltration mechanism. Preferential flowpaths were activated when &#936;m was above -1.5 kPa. During saturated infiltration, at least 97% of drainage was through the &#8216;mobile&#8217; pore volume of the lysimeter (&#952;m), estimated among the lysimeters at 5.4 &#8211; 8.7 % of the lysimeter volume. Early-time infiltration behaviour did not show the classical square-root of time behaviour, indicating sorptivity was not the governing mechanism. This was consistent across the four lysimeters, and during infiltration under different surface imposed suctions.  The most likely mechanism restricting sorptivity is weak hydrophobicity, which appears to restrict infiltration for the first 5 &#8211; 10 mm of infiltration. Overall, the Gorge soil&#8217;s early-time infiltration behaviour is governed by the dynamic interaction between sorptivity, hydrophobicity, the network of air-filled pores, preferential flow and air encapsulation. Long-time infiltration behaviour was intimately linked to the temporal dynamics of &#936;m, which was in turn controlled by preferential flow and soil layer interactions. Preferential flowpaths created strong inter-layer connectivity by allowing an irregular wetting front to reach lower layers within 2 &#8211; 15 mm of infiltration. Thereafter, layer interactions dominate infiltration for long-time periods, as &#936;m in soil layers with different K(&#936;m) relationships self-adjusts to try to maintain a constant Darcy velocity. An important finding was that &#936;m rarely attained the value set by the tension infiltrometer during unsaturated infiltration. The results show that &#8216;true&#8217; steady-state infiltration is unlikely to occur in layered soils. A quasi-steady state was identified once the whole column had fully wet and layer interactions had settled to where &#936;m changes occurred in unison through each soil layer. Quasi-steady state was difficult to identify from just the cumulative infiltration curve, but more robustly identified as when infiltration matched drainage, and &#936;m measurements showed each layer had a stable hydraulic gradient.  I conclude that the in-situ hydraulic conductivity, K(&#936;m), of individual soil layers can be accurately and meaningfully determined from lysimeter-scale infiltration experiments. My results show that K(&#936;m) is different for each soil layer, and that differences are consistent among the four lysimeters. Under saturated flow the subsoil had the lowest conductivity, and was the restricting layer. Most interestingly this pattern reversed during unsaturated flow. As &#936;m decreased below -0.5 to -1 kPa, the subsoil was markedly more conductive, and the topsoil layers became the restricting layers. All four soil layers demonstrate a sharp decline in K(&#936;m) as &#936;m decreases, with a break in slope at ~ -1 kPa indicating the dual-permeability nature of all layers.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">infiltration</field><field name="subject">layered soil</field><field name="subject">preferential flow</field><field name="subject">sorptivity</field><field name="subject">hydraulic conductivity</field><field name="subject">hydrophobicity</field><field name="subject">dual-permeability</field><field name="subject">mobile water content</field><field name="subject">lysimeter</field><field name="subject">tension infiltrometer</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300100 Soil and Water Sciences::300101 Soil physics</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300100 Soil and Water Sciences::300105 Applied hydrology (drainage, flooding, irrigation, quality etc)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1328</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of cow urine and its constituents on soil microbial populations and nitrous oxide emissions</field><field name="creator">Bertram, Janet</field><field name="description">New Zealand&#8217;s 5.3 million strong dairy herd returns approximately 106 million litres of urine to pasture soils daily. The urea in that urine is rapidly hydrolysed to ammonium (NH&#8324;&#8314;), which is then nitrified, with denitrification of nitrate (NO&#8323;&#8315;) ensuing. Nitrous oxide (N&#8322;O), a potent greenhouse gas (GHG), is produced via nitrification and denitrification, which are enzyme-catalysed processes mediated by soil microbes. Thus microbes are linked intrinsically to urine patch chemistry. However, few previous studies have investigated microbial dynamics in urine patches. Therefore the objective of these four experiments was to investigate the effects on soil microbial communities of cow urine deposition. Methods used included phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analyses of microbial community structure and microbial stress, dehydrogenase activity (DHA) assays measuring microbial activity, and headspace gas sampling of N&#8322;O, ammonia (NH&#8323;) and carbon dioxide (CO&#8322;) fluxes. Experiment 1, a laboratory study, examined the influence of soil moisture and urinary salt content on the microbial community. Both urine application and high soil moisture increased microbial stress, as evidenced by significant changes in PLFA trans/cis and iso/anteiso ratios. Total PLFAs and DHA showed a short-term (&lt; 1 week) stimulatory effect on microbes after urine application. Mean cumulative N&#8322;O-N fluxes were 2.75% and 0.05% of the nitrogen (N) applied, from the wet (70% WFPS) and dry (35% WFPS) soils, respectively. Experiment 2, a field trial, investigated nutrient dynamics and microbial stress with plants present. Concentrations of the micronutrients, copper, iron and molybdenum, increased up to 20-fold after urine application, while soil phosphorus (P) concentrations decreased from 0.87 mg kg &#8315;&#185; to 0.48 mg kg&#8315;&#185;. Plant P was also lower in urine patches, but total PLFAs were higher, suggesting that microbes had utilised the available nutrients. Microbial stress again resulted from urine application but, in contrast to experiment 1, the fungal biomass recovered after its initial inhibition. Studies published during the course of this thesis reported that hippuric acid (HA) and its hydrolysis product benzoic acid (BA) significantly reduced N&#8322;O-N emissions from synthetic cow urine, thus experiment 3 investigated this effect using real cow urine. Cumulative N&#8322;O-N fluxes were 16.8, 5.9 and 4.7% of N applied for urine (U) alone, U+HA and U+BA, respectively. Since NH&#8323;-N volatilisation remained unchanged, net gaseous N emissions were reduced. Trends in total PLFAs and microbial stress were comparable to experiment 1 results. Experiment 4 studied HA effects at different temperatures and found no inhibition of N&#8322;O-N fluxes from HA-amended urine. However, mean cumulative N&#8322;O-N fluxes were reduced from 7.6% of N applied at 15&#8211;20&#176;C to 0.2% at 5&#8211;10&#176;C. Total cumulative N emissions (N&#8322;O-N + NH&#8323;-N) were highest at 20&#176;C (17.5% of N applied) and lowest at 10&#176;C (9.8% of N applied). Microbial activity, measured as potential DHA, increased with increasing temperature. This work has clearly shown that the stimulation and inhibition of the soil microbial community by urine application are closely linked to soil chemistry and have significant impacts not only on soil nutrient dynamics but also on N&#8322;O-N emissions and their possible mitigation.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nitrous oxide</field><field name="subject">ruminant urine</field><field name="subject">urine patch</field><field name="subject">nitrogen dynamics</field><field name="subject">hippuric acid</field><field name="subject">benzoic acid</field><field name="subject">phospholipid fatty acid analysis</field><field name="subject">soil microbial community</field><field name="subject">microbial stress</field><field name="subject">dehydrogenase activity</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300100 Soil and Water Sciences::300102 Soil biology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300100 Soil and Water Sciences::300103 Soil chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1334</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biochemistry and genetics of carotenoid composition in potato tubers</field><field name="creator">Othman, Rashidi</field><field name="description">Potato cultivars exhibit a wide variation in skin and flesh colour due to the presence of pigments. This study established that potato cultivars differ greatly with respect to types and concentrations of carotenoids in tubers. A total of 46 cultivars were evaluated for quantitative and qualitative carotenoid composition in different growing seasons, locations, storage conditions and disease symptoms. Factors controlling carotenoid accumulation were also tested by developing an in vitro minituber system as a new high-throughput model system for carotenogenesis in potato tubers. Tuber flesh colour was found to correlate with total carotenoid content in potato cultivars grown in both New Zealand and Netherlands. The main carotenoids identified in 32 potato cultivars in New Zealand were lutein, neoxanthin, violaxanthin and &#946;-carotene. The ratio of these carotenoids varies between cultivars. Neoxanthin was detected in only 13 cultivars (10.59 to 69.21&#181;g/g DW); violaxanthin was found only in 1 cultivar (32.76 &#181;g/g DW). Whereas lutein and &#946;-carotene were found in most of the cultivars but the concentration varied from (0.00 to 160.63 &#181;g/g DW) and (0.00 to 13.62 &#181;g/g DW) respectively. The main carotenoids identified in 12 cultivars grown in the Netherlands were neoxanthin, violaxanthin and lutein, whereas zeaxanthin was not found in any of the cultivars analysed. Marked differences were observed between the same potato cultivars grown in New Zealand and the Netherlands. Therefore cultivars were analysed over a second growing season to assess stability in carotenoids composition. The carotenoid profiles of the potato tubers grown for two different seasons showed highly significant differences between the cultivars, the seasons, the carotenoid pigments, and all combinations of interactions, indicating the complex nature of factors influencing carotenoid composition. Reflectance colorimeter measurement of yellow hue component in this study confirmed that the higher the total carotenoid content, the greater the yellow intensity colour. Eight cultivars were grown at three locations in New Zealand and Agria and Desiree were grown at eight locations in the Netherlands to further investigate the stability of carotenoid composition. Highly significant differences were observed between the cultivars, the locations, the carotenoid pigments, and all combinations of interactions, which emphasises that changes in carotenoid composition are complex and the responses are not consistent across cultivars. Reflectance colorimeter measurement of yellow hue component confirmed the relationship between the yellow colour intensity of tuber flesh, as well as confirming the interaction between colour and locations. Disease and post harvest storage conditions markedly influenced the levels of total carotenoid, neoxanthin, violaxanthin, zeaxanthin, lutein and &#946;-carotene in potatoes. The magnitude of these effects depends on the cultivar, time of storage, and the intensity of powdery scab symptoms. Results showed that long term storage resulted in the accumulation of neoxanthin, violaxanthin and zeaxanthin with a concomitant decreased of lutein, &#946;-carotene and total carotenoid content. Genotypes infected with disease (lower and higher scab score) resulted in accumulation of violaxanthin, &#946;-carotene and total carotenoid with a concomitant decreased in neoxanthin and lutein. A high-throughput model system for investigating carotenoid biogenesis in potato tubers was developed. This involved in vitro potato minitubers and was validated by assessing the effects of environmental variables, such as drought stress, light intensity and nutrient availability on carotenoid accumulation. Light influenced the presence of zeaxanthin, whereas water stress and nutrient strength influenced the accumulation of neoxanthin and violaxanthin. Although these factors had an effect on the carotenoid content and profile, the most influential factor appeared to be cultivar selection.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">carotenoids</field><field name="subject">potato tuber</field><field name="subject">neoxanthin</field><field name="subject">violaxanthin</field><field name="subject">zeaxanthin</field><field name="subject">lutein</field><field name="subject">b-carotene</field><field name="subject">total carotenoid</field><field name="subject">potato minituber</field><field name="subject">genotype</field><field name="subject">growing season</field><field name="subject">location</field><field name="subject">storage condition</field><field name="subject">disease symptom</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1336</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Epidemiological aspects of MBC resistance in Monilinia fructicola (Wint.) Honey and mechanisms of resistance</field><field name="creator">Sanoamuang, Niwat</field><field name="description">Isolates of Monilinia fructicola (Wint.) Honey obtained from stone fruit orchards in Hawkes Bay, North Island and from Californian fruit exported to New Zealand, were tested for resistance to methyl benzimidazole carbamate (MBC). Resistant isolates from the North Island had EC&#8325;&#8320; values of &gt;30,000, and most isolates from the imported fruit had of values approximately 1.5 mg a.i./l carbendazim. Sensitive isolates failed to grow on 1 mg a.i./l carbendazim. A detached peach shoot system was used in controlled conditions for estimation of values for incubation period, latent period and rate of spore production on flowers (cv Glohaven). The same variables and the rate of colonisation of host tissue were measured on fruit (cv Fantasia) in controlled conditions. An inoculum density of 1x10&#8308; spore/flower or fruit greatly increased fitness in vivo compared to an inoculum density of 1x10&#178; spore/flower (fruit). Isolates varied considerably, but there was no consistent relationship between the degrees of resistance and fitness. This was in contrast to earlier studies with dicarboximide resistant strains of M. fructicola. The survival in the field of 10 isolates resistant or sensitive to MBC or dicarboximide fungicides on twig cankers and mummified fruit was compared. The ability to produce conidia on twig cankers inoculated in late spring 1989 was maintained by all sensitive and MBC resistant isolates for at least 1 year. The production of conidia on mummified fruit inoculated in February 1990 decreased after 2-3 months in the field but some conidia were still produced on all fruit in the following spring. Dicarboximide resistant isolates produced less conidia than either the MBC resistant and the sensitive isolates. The pathogenicity and fitness of all isolates were similar to the original values after survival for 1 year. A technique was developed to produce apothecia reliably from inoculated peach (cv Black Boy) and nectarine (cv Fantasia) fruit in controlled conditions in the laboratory. The fruit were inoculated with resistant or sensitive isolates, or combinations, and were incubated for 8 weeks at 25&#176;C (&#177;1&#176;C) with 12 hours photoperiod of fluorescent light (Sylvania 2x65 W, daylight) to produce mummified fruit. The fruit were then buried in moist autoclaved peat moss for 10 weeks at 25&#176;C (&#177;1&#176;C) in the dark to form stromata. These fruit were then hydrated with running tap-water (total hardness (CaCO&#8323;) = 47 g/m&#179; and conductivity at 20&#176;C = 12.7 mS/m) for 72 hours. The hydrated mummified fruit were placed in moist peat moss and were incubated for 13-14 weeks at 8&#176;C (&#177;0.5&#176;C) in the dark. At the end of this period, stipe initials were visible. Differentiation of stipe initials into mature apothecia occurred within 15-20 days after transfer to 12&#176;C (&#177;2 &#176;C) with a 12 hour photoperiod of fluorescent and incandescent light. All isolates produced apothecia when treated in this way. A technique for isolation of ascospore sets in linear arrangement was developed for tetrad analysis of the inheritance of resistance. At least 3 hours of fluorescent and incandescent light at 12&#176;C (&#177;2&#176;C) was essential to allow ascospore ejection from individual asci taken from apothecia previously maintained in a 12 hour photoperiod at 12&#176;C (&#177;1&#176;C). A water film on the surface of water agar was necessary to hold a set of ejected ascospores in linear sequence. Single ascospores were obtained in sequence with the aid of a micromanipulator. Genetic analysis of MBC resistant isolates was carried out on ascospores derived from apothecia produced in the laboratory. Analysis of ascospore sets in linear arrangement and ascospore populations indicated that resistance to &gt;30,000 mg a.i./l carbendazim (high-resistant) is governed by a single major gene and is affected by gene conversion mechanisms. Crossing over was frequent, suggesting that recombination of resistance with other characters, such as pathogenicity and fitness, may occur readily. The segregation ratio (1:1) from most resistant isolates revealed that heterokaryons containing both resistant and sensitive alleles were common in resistant populations and that resistance is dominant. Allozyme analysis of ascospore progeny through electrophoresis revealed a narrow genetic base of M. fructicola in New Zealand. The technique for reliable apothecial production in controlled conditions developed in this study provided an important step for the determination of the biology of M. fructicola strains resistant to MBC fungicides, and the complexity of its life cycle. Genetic heterogeneity in field populations can be conserved in one isolate through heterokaryosis, thus providing for adaptability of the pathogen to the changing environmental conditions. Knowledge on genetic variability, overwintering ability, pathogenicity and fitness factors may be useful for future management strategies of stone fruit brown rot. Special emphasis should be made in particular to prevent primary infection on blossoms, which would delay the establishment of recombinant strains of M. fructicola and the onset of brown rot epidemics.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Methyl benzimidazole carbamate (MBC)</field><field name="subject">carbendazim</field><field name="subject">resistance</field><field name="subject">nectarine</field><field name="subject">peach</field><field name="subject">stone fruit</field><field name="subject">Monilinia fructicola</field><field name="subject">brown rot</field><field name="subject">epidemiology</field><field name="subject">virulence</field><field name="subject">twig cankers</field><field name="subject">mummified fruit</field><field name="subject">genetic</field><field name="subject">apothecia</field><field name="subject">ascospores</field><field name="subject">mechanisms of resistance</field><field name="subject">inheritance</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300300 Horticulture::300303 Plant protection (pests, diseases and weeds)</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300300 Horticulture::300301 Plant improvement (selection, breeding and genetic engineering)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1362</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The vegetative and reproductive development of balansa clover</field><field name="creator">Monks, D. P.</field><field name="description">The vegetative and reproductive development of balansa clover (Trifolium michelianum Savi.) were quantified in relation to the environmental drivers of each phenophase in field and controlled environments. In a grazed experiment over 6 years, balansa clover sown with cocksfoot (Dactylis glomerata) contributed 1.6 t DM/ha/year, or ~20% of the total DM production. However, grazing management for increased seed production during flowering in the establishment year strongly influenced balansa clover regeneration. The earliest closed plot (September) averaged between 2.2 and 4.3 t DM/ha/year of balansa clover across all six years.  In an incubator, balansa clover required 29&#176;Cd for germination with an optimum temperature of 14&#176;C and a maximum of 40&#176;C. The base temperature for germination was 0&#176;C. A field experiment determined that 38&#176;Cd were required for emergence with an optimum soil temperature (Topt) of 8.5&#176;C.  The time from emergence until the first leaf appeared, the phyllochron and timing of axillary leaf appearance were compared with perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) and white clover (Trifolium repens L.). The rate of each was found to increase linearly with temperature. The balansa clover  cultivar &#8216;Frontier&#8217; required 97&#176;Cd from sowing for the first leaf to appear, had a phyllochron of 47&#176;Cd and secondary leaves appeared after 490&#176;Cd. For each vegetative stage, the base temperature was 2.5&#176;C. The timing of flower appearance depended on the quantity and direction of change of the photoperiod at emergence. A balansa clover plant, cv. &#8216;Bolta&#8217;, which emerged on 1 December into an increasing photoperiod of 15.6 hours flowered after 574&#176;Cd (Tbase = 2.5&#176;Cd) or 58 days after emergence. In contrast, if the plant emerged on 16 January into a similar but decreasing photoperiod it took 1503&#176;Cd or 227 days to flower. This length of time became progressively shorter until remaining constant after the shortest day. In contrast, &#8216;Frontier&#8217; took a constant 390 and 690 &#176;Cd in increasing and decreasing photoperiods, respectively. The time which an individual inflorescence took from pollination until seeds were physiologically mature was 250 &#176;Cd for both &#8216;Bolta&#8217; and &#8216;Frontier&#8217;. The re-establishment of balansa clover each year relied on a large seed set (&gt;1000 kg/ha) in the establishment year. The continued survival of balansa clover would then depend on a similar seeding event within a 4-5 year period to maintain the seed bank. Management considerations for balansa clover persistence and survival are discussed.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dactylis glomerata</field><field name="subject">day degrees</field><field name="subject">dryland</field><field name="subject">establishment</field><field name="subject">leaf area</field><field name="subject">mixed pastures</field><field name="subject">temperature</field><field name="subject">Trifolium michelianum Savi syn.

Experiment l compared sheep production from 3-year-old cocksfoot based pastures grown in combination with white, Caucasian, subterranean or balansa clover with a ryegrass-white clover pasture and a pure lucerne forage. Sheep liveweight gain per head from each pasture treatment and the pure lucerne stand was recorded in the 2006/07 and 2007/08 seasons. The cocksfoot-subterranean clover pasture provided equal (381 kg LW/ha in 2006) or higher (476 kg LW/ha in 2007) animal production in spring and gave the highest total animal production (646 kg LW/ha) averaged across years of the five grass based pastures. However, total annual liveweight production from lucerne was higher than any grass based pasture mainly due to superior animal production during summer when lucerne provided 42-85% higher animal production than any of the grass based pastures. In Experiment 2, the effect of stocking rate (8.3 (low) and 13.9 (high) ewes + twin lambs/ha) and time of closing in spring on lamb liveweight gain, pasture production and subterranean clover seedling populations was monitored over 2 years for a dryland cocksfoot-subterranean clover and ryegrass-subterranean clover pasture in Canterbury. In both years, twin lambs grew faster (g/head/d) in spring at low (327; 385) than high (253; 285) stocking rate but total liveweight gain/ha (kg/ha/d) was greater at high (7.26; 7.91) than low (5.43; 6.38) stocking rate. Ewes also gained 0.5 and 1.5 kg/head at the low stocking rate in 2006 and 2007 respectively but lost 0.2 kg/head in 2006 and gained 0.3 kg/head at high stocking rate in 2007. Mean subterranean clover seedling populations (per m&#178;) measured in autumn after grazing treatments in the first spring were similar at both low (2850) and high (2500) stocking rate but declined with later closing dates in spring (3850, 2950, 2100 and 1700 at 2, 4, 6, 8 weeks after first visible flower). Seedling populations measured in autumn after grazing treatments in the second spring were also unaffected by stocking rate (low 1290, high 1190) but declined with later closing dates in spring (1470, 1320 and 940 at 3, 5 and 8 weeks after first flowering, respectively). The effect of stocking rate and closing dates in spring on pasture and clover production in the following autumn was similar to the effects on seedling numbers in both years. However, clover production in the following spring was unaffected by stocking rate or closing date in the previous year at the relatively high seedling populations generated by the treatments. This was presumably due to runner growth compensating for lower plant populations in pastures that were closed later in spring. Subterranean clover runner growth in spring may not compensate in a similar manner if seedling numbers in autumn fall below 500/m&#178;. Mean annual dry matter production from cocksfoot and ryegrass pastures grown with and without annual clovers pasture production ranged from 6.4 to 12.4 t DM/ha/y but stocking rate (8.3 vs. 13.9 ewes/ha) during spring did not affect annual pasture production. Pastures overdrilled with annual clovers yielded 23-45% more dry matter production than pastures grown without annual clovers.  The study confirms the important role of subterranean clover in improving pasture production and liveweight gains of sheep in dryland cocksfoot and ryegrass pastures. Lowering stocking rate from 13.9 to 8.3 ewes/ha was a less effective method of increasing seed production of subterranean clover in dryland pastures although it did lead to increased liveweight gain per head.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cocksfoot</field><field name="subject">closing date</field><field name="subject">liveweight gain</field><field name="subject">seedling population</field><field name="subject">sheep grazing</field><field name="subject">stocking rate</field><field name="subject">subterranean clover</field><field name="subject">Trifolium subterraneum L.</field><field name="subject">Trifolium repens L.</field><field name="subject">Trifolium ambiguum L.</field><field name="subject">Trifolium michelianum L.</field><field name="subject">Medicago sativa L.</field><field name="subject">Dactylis glomerata L.</field><field name="subject">Lolium perenne L.</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300200 Crop and Pasture Production::300205 Agronomy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1338</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dynamical modelling of  feedback gene regulatory networks</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Lan K.</field><field name="description">Living cells are made up of networks of interacting genes, proteins and other bio-molecules. Simple interactions between network components in forms of feedback regulations can lead to complex collective dynamics. A key task in cell biology is to gain a thorough understanding of the dynamics of intracellular systems and processes. In this thesis, a combined approach of mathematical modelling, computational simulation and analytical techniques, has been used to obtain a deeper insight into the dynamical aspects of a variety of feedback systems commonly encountered in cells. These systems range from model system with detailed available molecular knowledge to general regulatory motifs with varying network structures. Deterministic as well as stochastic modelling techniques have been employed, depending primarily on the specific questions asked. The first part of the thesis focuses on dissecting the principles behind the regulatory design of the Tryptophan Operon system in Escherichia coli. It has evolved three negative feedback loops, namely repression, attenuation and enzyme inhibition, as core regulator mechanisms to control the intracellular level of tryptophan amino acid, which is taken up for protein synthesis. Despite extensive experimental knowledge, the roles of these seemingly redundant loops remain unclear from a dynamical point of view. We aim to understand why three loops, rather than one, have evolved. Using a large-scale perturbation/response analysis through modelling and simulations and novel metrics for transient dynamics quantification, it has been revealed that the multiple negative feedback loops employed by the tryptophan operon are not redundant. In fact, they have evolved to concertedly give rise to a much more efficient, adaptive and stable system, than any single mechanism would provide. Since even the full topology of feedback interactions within a network is insufficient to determine its behavioural dynamics, other factors underlying feedback loops must be characterised to better predict system dynamics. In the second part of the thesis, we aim to derive these factors and explore how they shape system dynamics. We develop an analytical approach for stability and bifurcation analysis and apply it to class of feedback systems commonly encountered in cells. Our analysis showed that the strength and the Hill coefficient of a feedback loop play key role in determining the dynamics of the system carrying the loop. Not only that, the position of the loop was also found to be crucial in this decision. The analytical method we developed also facilitates parameter sensitivity analysis in which we investigate how the production and degradation rates affect system dynamics. We find that these rates are quite different in the way they shape up system behaviour, with the degradation rates exhibiting a more intricate manner. We demonstrated that coupled-loop systems display greater complexity and a richer repertoire of behaviours in comparison with single-loop ones. Different combinations of the feedback strengths of individual loops give rise to different dynamical regimes.  The final part of the thesis aims to understand the effects of molecular noise on dynamics of specific systems, in this case the Tryptophan Operon. We developed two stochastic models for the system and compared their predictions to those given by the deterministic model. By means of simulations, we have shown that noise can induce oscillatory behaviour. On the other hand, incorporating noise in an oscillatory system can alter the characteristics of oscillation by shifting the bifurcation point of certain parameters by a substantial amount.  Measurement of fluctuations reveals that that noise at the transcript level is most significant while noise at the enzyme level is smallest. This study highlights that noise should not be neglected if we want to obtain a complete understanding of the dynamic behaviour of cells.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mathematical modelling</field><field name="subject">systems biology</field><field name="subject">computational biology</field><field name="subject">feedback regulation</field><field name="subject">dynamical modelling</field><field name="subject">stochastic modelling</field><field name="subject">molecular noise</field><field name="subject">design principle</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::239900 Other Mathematical Sciences::239901 Biological Mathematics</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1340</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of grazing management and pasture composition on the nitrogen dynamics of a dairy farm: a simulation analysis</field><field name="creator">Bates, Andrew John</field><field name="description">There is an extensive debate on the potential environmental impact of dairy farms and in particular the effect of dairy farms on the nitrogen cycle and the effect that this has on ecosystems. Within New Zealand and in particular in the South Island, the expansion of dairying and the adoption of new dairy systems has led to this becoming an increasingly important issue, locally through its effect on water quality and the environment and nationally and internationally through the production of green house gases. Increases in nitrogen usage at the expense of clover nitrogen fixation, irrigation, stocking rate and the introduction of dairy cows onto light free draining soils previously the preserve of arable or sheep farming has led to concern as to the effect intensive pastoral dairying may have on the nitrogen dynamics of the farm and the environment. This study is designed to assess how changes in grazing management in particular changes in pre-grazing and post-grazing residuals alter the clover/ryegrass balance on the farm and the effect that this has on the farm&#8217;s nitrogen dynamics. The effects of qualitative changes in grazing management on pasture composition are well established but little is known of the effect of quantitative changes in pasture management on composition, in particular the effect of grazing residuals. There are a number of detailed models of the physiological processes in the energy and nutrient cycling in plants, animals and the soil. There are a smaller number of whole farm models that through integration and simplification of component models attempt to represent the flux of nutrients though a dairy farm. None of these whole farm models is currently able to model the nitrogen flux through a dairy farm at a sufficient level of resolution to capture differences in pasture composition as these occur spatially, temporally and in response to grazing management. This project sought to better understand the nitrogen dynamics on a dairy farm by constructing and then linking component models &#8211; a pasture composition and growth model, a cow model, an excretal return model, a soil model and a water balance model &#8211; within a whole farm management schedule. The formal null hypothesis is that the mechanistic, mathematical model constructed for this PhD cannot capture and explain the full range of the changes in soil water content, soil nitrogen status, pasture production and composition and animal production, following the alteration in management of the dairy farm between 2002 and 2004. Individual component models were constructed by the author using the computer software package (Matlab) and validated against data extracted from the literature. The models were then converted into one simulation package using C-sharp as the source code language by Elizabeth Post, Senior Computer Scientist at Lincoln Ventures Ltd, Lincoln, New Zealand and the author. This model was then used to investigate the nitrogen dynamics of a dairy farm: the relationship with pasture composition and whether small changes in pasture residuals make a difference to pasture composition and nitrogen dynamics. Two different simulations were run based on the management practice of Lincoln University Dairy farm (LUDF) over two dairy seasons (2002-03 and 2003-04) and validated against the data recorded on this farm. In 2002-03, 50 cows were over wintered and 580 cows were subsequently milked on 200ha. Post grazing residuals where maintained at 1600-1750KgDM/ha. In 2003-04, 125 cows were overwintered and 635 cows were milked on 200ha with post grazing residuals maintained at 1400KgDm/ha. All models operate on a daily time step. Within the pasture model composition is described by 9 state variables describing different components of the pasture and pasture growth is modelled mechanistically from a calculation of component photosynthesis. A further 9 state variables describe the nitrogen composition of the pasture components. The soil model is a variable two layer, mechanistic representation, parametised for the shallow, stony soils of LUDF. Soil water status is an input for the pasture model while water uptake by the growing plants affects the soil water balance within the soil model. Animal intake and production are modelled mechanistically with model cows described in terms of their age, genetic merit, body weight, breed, pregnancy status, conception date and body condition score. Each cow type produces a different quantity of urinary and faecal excretion which varies with dry matter intake, milk yield and the sodium and potassium status of the pasture. Excretal nitrogen composition is predicted within a separate model which calculates daily nitrogen excretion in faeces, urine and milk. Excretions are deposited randomly over the grazed area and account is taken of overlapping excretions that are created on the same day and overlaps that occur with older excretal patches deposited in previous grazing rounds. Each excretal patch has its own associated pasture, water and soil model reflecting the differences in nitrogen status between patches. Grazing preference is expressed within the model between different classes of excretal patch and between excretal patches and the base pasture and between clover and grass. Supplementary silage is conserved and fed according to the management schedule of LUDF. Cows calve, become pregnant and are dried off within the model according to the relevant records from LUDF. Cows are deemed to arrive on the farm on the day of calving and to leave on the day that drying off is finished (a 5 day procedure within the model), except for those cows that are overwintering which remain on the farm. The soil model has multiple nitrogen/carbon pools and is dynamically linked to all the other models. External nitrogen losses from the system are modelled as volatilisation, leaching and denitrification, with pasture nitrogen uptake from the soil model and fixation by clover from the atmosphere. Both the individual component models and the final assembled composite model were successful in matching the available data in terms of pasture and animal production, pasture composition, soil water balance and nitrogen status and external losses. The model indicates that the low residual, high stocking rate farm returns more excreta to the soil. However, this is countered by a reduction in the amount of dead material returned to the paddock and this reduces the relative size of the pool of nitrogen in the dead organic matter. This produces a relative lack of substrate for the soil microbes which are thus unable to exploit all of the nitrogen in the available pool. Soil ammonium and nitrate pools are also increased from the increase in faecal and urinary return so precipitating an immobilising flux from these larger pools to the smaller pool of nitrogen available to the soil microbes. However, the relative inability of the soil bacteria to fully exploit this means that the production of soil organic live matter and the resulting mineralising flux from the dead organic matter pool through the available pool to the ammonium and nitrate pools is reduced. The larger ammonium and nitrate pools will also be associated with increased external losses from the system as denitrification, leaching and volatilisation are increased. The increase in the clover percentage within the sward in 2003-04 led to greater nitrogen fixation and the model suggests that some of the extra nitrogen is effectively captured by the animals in increased production. However, the reduction in the return of dead matter coupled with an increase in excretal return and the consequent increase in the mineral nitrogen pools within the soil lead to greater losses of nitrogen from the soil.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dairy farming</field><field name="subject">environmental impact</field><field name="subject">nitrogen cycle</field><field name="subject">grazing management</field><field name="subject">pasture modelling</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300200 Crop and Pasture Production::300205 Agronomy</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300400 Animal Production</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300100 Soil and Water Sciences::300103 Soil chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1360</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Noise-limited scene-change detection in images</field><field name="creator">Irie, Kenji</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the theoretical, experimental, and practical aspects of a noise-limited method for scene-change detection in images. The research is divided into three sections: noise analysis and modelling, dual illumination scene-change modelling, and integration of noise into the scene-change model.  The sources of noise within commercially available digital cameras are described, with a new model for image noise derived for charge-coupled device (CCD) cameras. The model is validated experimentally through the development of techniques that allow the individual noise components to be measured from the analysis of output images alone. A generic model for complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) cameras is also derived. Methods for the analysis of spatial (inter-pixel) and temporal (intra-pixel) noise are developed. These are used subsequently to investigate the effects of environmental temperature on camera noise. Based on the cameras tested, the results show that the CCD camera noise response to variation in environmental temperature is complex whereas the CMOS camera response simply increases monotonically.  A new concept for scene-change detection is proposed based upon a dual illumination concept where both direct and ambient illumination sources are present in an environment, such as that which occurs in natural outdoor scenes with direct sunlight and ambient skylight. The transition of pixel colour from the combined direct and ambient illuminants to the ambient illuminant only is modelled. A method for shadow-free scene-change is then developed that predicts a pixel's colour when the area in the scene is subjected to ambient illumination only, allowing pixel change to be distinguished as either being due to a cast shadow or due to a genuine change in the scene. Experiments on images captured in controlled lighting demonstrate 91% of scene-change and 83% of cast shadows are correctly determined from analysis of pixel colour change alone.  A statistical method for detecting shadow-free scene-change is developed. This is achieved by bounding the dual illumination model by the confidence interval associated with the pixel's noise. Three benefits arise from the integration of noise into the scene-change detection method:  - The necessity for pre-filtering images for noise is removed; - All empirical thresholds are removed; and - Performance is improved.   The noise-limited scene-change detection algorithm correctly classifies 93% of scene-change and 87% of cast shadows from pixel colour change alone. When simple post-analysis size-filtering is applied both these figures increase to 95%.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">camera noise</field><field name="subject">image noise</field><field name="subject">noise models</field><field name="subject">scene-change detection</field><field name="subject">object segmentation</field><field name="subject">shadow detection</field><field name="subject">illumination modelling</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280200 Artificial Intelligence and Signal and Image Processing::280203 Image processing</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280200 Artificial Intelligence and Signal and Image Processing::280204 Signal processing</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280200 Artificial Intelligence and Signal and Image Processing::280208 Computer vision</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1351</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Footsteps on the Ice: visitor experiences in the Ross Sea Region, Antarctica</field><field name="creator">Maher, P. T.</field><field name="description">Antarctica is one of the most beautiful and remote places on the planet. The moniker of being the highest, driest, coldest, iciest, windiest, most remote continent, surrounded by the stormiest ocean is well deserved, yet it also acts as quite a draw for visitors. Despite the fact that visitor numbers have been steadily rising for the past 15 years, very little is empirically known about the experience these visitors have, particularly outside of the Antarctic Peninsula region. This lack of understanding is particularly detrimental from the perspective of visitor management, as is being discovered by agencies worldwide. As such, the aim of this thesis is to report on a study of visitor experiences in the Ross Sea region of Antarctica. Visitors are defined as those who come into physical contact with the continent, and whose primary activity and purpose is simply "being there." Visitors are a wider population than just commercial tourists aboard cruise ships; visitors are not passengers on commercial overflights, the scientists or base and support staff. Experience is defined as a longitudinal period&#8212;looking at visitors well in advance of their visit, throughout their time on site, and following up back at their homes. The Ross Sea region is essentially equivalent to New Zealand's Ross Dependency, a section of the Antarctic "pie" from the South Pole to 60&#176;S, bounded by approximately 150&#176;E and 150&#176;W. Using a three-phase methodology to examine the cycle of experience, the purpose of this study is to compare groups of visitors with four organisations through this cycle, and analyse for change or transition as a result of their visit. The visitors were participants, to varying degrees, in a number of data-gathering methods during the 2002&#8211;2003 or 2003&#8211;2004 seasons. Such methods included: self-administered surveys sent to the respondents' home (up to three months in advance of the trip); personal narratives and journals while on the trip (regardless of trip length; 4&#8211;28 days); in-depth interviews held in Christchurch directly before and after the trip when possible; and email surveys (two to three months following the visit). In 2003&#8211;2004, a supplemental season of data was collected that included a researcher familiarisation visit, participant observation, and informal interviews at Scott Base. These supplemental data helped shape the researcher's own thoughts and thus comments in the Discussion sections. Results indicate both similarities and differences as compared to previous research; key findings include: scenery was a strong motivator and component of image;	expectations were for a safe and professional learning;	mood was positive throughout all phases; visitation was both acceptable and problematic; the environment was important, even in advance of the visit; education was an essential benefit of the visit; the Ross Sea region was an impressive and awe-inspiring locale; organisational differences were apparent when discussing people and the role of transportation to the continent; historic huts were uniformly amazing sites for the feelings they instil; expectations were virtually always exceeded; awareness changed over the experience; sharing of awareness and teaching from one's learning had occurred; action may or may not have occurred on various specific issues, but the label of ambassador was respondent-perceived to be acceptable. This study concludes with a number of  implications for theory, methods, and logistics, which will hopefully lead to future research that is much wider in scope (geographically), but equally inclusive in terms of methods and ability to utilize and critique theories built outside of purely tourism research.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Antarctica</field><field name="subject">visitation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350500 Tourism</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1369</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Attitudes of extension agents towards expert systems as decision support tools in Thailand</field><field name="creator">Chetsumon, Sireerat</field><field name="description">It has been suggested 'expert systems' might have a significant role in the future through enabling many more people to access human experts. It is, therefore, important to understand how potential users interact with these computer systems. This study investigates the effect of extension agents' attitudes towards the features and use of an example expert system for rice disease diagnosis and management(POSOP). It also considers the effect of extension agents' personality traits and intelligence on their attitudes towards its use, and the agents' perception of control over using it. Answers to these questions lead to developing better systems and to increasing their adoption. Using structural equation modelling, two models - the extension agents' perceived usefulness of POSOP, and their attitude towards the use of POSOP, were developed (Models ATU and ATP). Two of POSOP's features (its value as a decision support tool, and its user interface), two personality traits (Openness (0) and Extraversion (E)), and the agents' intelligence, proved to be significant, and were evaluated. The agents' attitude towards POSOP's value had a substantial impact on their perceived usefulness and their attitude towards using it, and thus their intention to use POSOP. Their attitude towards POSOP's user interface also had an impact on their attitude towards its perceived usefulness, but had no impact on their attitude towards using it. However, the user interface did contribute to its value. In Model ATU, neither Openness (0) nor Extraversion (E) had an impact on the agents' perceived usefulness indicating POSOP was considered useful regardless of the agents' personality background. However, Extraversion (E) had a negative impact on their intention to use POSOP in Model ATP indicating that 'introverted' agents had a clear intention to use POSOP relative to the 'extroverted' agents. Extension agents' intelligence, in terms of their GPA, had neither an impact on their attitude, nor their subjective norm (expectation of 'others' beliefs), to the use of POSOP. It also had no association with any of the variables in both models. Both models explain and predict that it is likely that the agents will use POSOP. However, the availability of computers, particularly their capacity, are likely to impede its use. Although the agents believed using POSOP would not be difficult, they still believed training would be beneficial. To be a useful decision support tool, the expert system's value and user interface as well as its usefulness and ease of use, are all crucially important to the preliminary acceptance of a system. Most importantly, the users' problems and needs should be assessed and taken into account as a first priority in developing an expert system. Furthermore, the users should be involved in the system development. The results emphasise that the use of an expert system is not only determined by the system's value and its user interface, but also the agents' perceived usefulness, and their attitude towards using it. In addition, the agents' perception of control over using it is also a significant factor. The results suggested improvements to the system's value and its user interface would increase its potential use, and also providing suitable computers, coupled with training, would encourage its use.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">attitudes</field><field name="subject">extension</field><field name="subject">expert systems</field><field name="subject">knowledge-based systems</field><field name="subject">decision support systems</field><field name="subject">personality traits</field><field name="subject">openness</field><field name="subject">extraversion</field><field name="subject">intelligence</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280300 Computer Software</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1371</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Metapopulation theory in practice</field><field name="creator">Kean, J. M.</field><field name="description">A metapopulation is defined as a set of potential local populations among which dispersal may occur. Metapopulation theory has grown rapidly in recent years, but much has focused on the mathematical properties of metapopulations rather than their relevance to real systems. Indeed, barring some notable exceptions, metapopulation theory remains largely untested in the field. This thesis investigates the importance of metapopulation structure in the &#8216;real world&#8217;, firstly by building additional realism into metapopulation models, and secondly through a 3-year field study of a real metapopulation system. The modelling analyses include discrete-and continuous-time models, and cover single species, host-parasitoid, and disease-host systems, with and without stochasticity. In all cases, metapopulation structure enhanced species persistence in time, and often allowed long-term continuance of otherwise non-persistent interactions. Spatial heterogeneity and patterning was evident whenever local populations were stochastic or deterministically unstable in isolation. In metapopulations, the latter case often gave rise to self-organising spatial patterns. These were composed of spiral wave fronts (or &#8216;arcs of infection&#8217; in disease models) of different sizes, and were related to the stability characteristics of local populations as well as the dispersal rates. There was no evidence for self-organising spatial patterns in the host-parasitoid system studied in the field (the weevil Sitona discoideus and its braconid parasitoid Microctonus aethiopoides), and a new model for the interaction suggested that this is probably due to the strong host density-dependence and stabilising parasitism acting on local populations. Dispersal may be important because of very high mortality in dispersing weevils, which may be related to the scarcity of their host plant in the landscape. If this is the case, the model suggested that local weevil density may be sensitive to the area of crop grown. Stochastic models showed that species in suitably large metapopulations may persist for very long times at relatively low overall density and with very low incidence of density-dependence. This suggests that metapopulation processes may explain a general inability to detect density-dependence in many real populations, and may also play an important part in the persistence of rare species. For host-parasitoid metapopulation models, persistence often depended on the way in which they were initialised. Initial conditions corresponding to a biological control release were the least likely to persist, and the maximum host suppression observed in this case was 84%, as compared with 60% for the corresponding non-spatial models and &gt;90% often observed in the field. Metapopulation structure also allowed persistence of &#8216;boom-bust&#8217; disease models, although the dynamics of these were particularly dependent on assumptions about what happens to disease classes at very low densities. Models assuming infinitely divisible units of density, models incorporating a non-zero extinction threshold, and individual-based models all gave differing results in terms of disease persistence and rate of spatial spread. Fitting models to overall metapopulation dynamics often gave misleading results in terms of underlying local dynamics, emphasising the need to sample real populations at an appropriate scale when seeking to understand their behaviour.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">metapopulations</field><field name="subject">models</field><field name="subject">host</field><field name="subject">parasitoid</field><field name="subject">disease</field><field name="subject">pest management</field><field name="subject">biological control</field><field name="subject">Sitona discoideus</field><field name="subject">Microctonus aethiopoides</field><field name="subject">population biology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::239900 Other Mathematical Sciences::239901 Biological Mathematics</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300200 Crop and Pasture Production::300204 Plant protection (pests, diseases and weeds)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1372</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Ma(r)king of memory and the right to remember: design, interpretation and the movement of meaning.

A potent container of memories and representation, the landscape provides both a symbolic role in which to honour the victims and give survivors a place to mourn and remember, but is also often infused with the tensions of post-genocide life.  The memoryscapes of the Cambodian and Rwandan genocides illustrate these contested concerns explicitly. The case study sites investigated in this study - the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum and the Choeung Ek Genocidal Centre in Cambodia, and the Kigali Memorial Centre in Rwanda - each express today (consciously or unconsciously) design strategies that engage the Euro-Western visitor.  Termed Euro-Western &#8216;cues to connect&#8217;, encountered and existential phenomenological data is analysed in relation to design interpretation and the affective cognition of meaning.

In recent years, it has, however, been criticised by rural developers for its lack of concern for the rural poor and for being too increasingly focused on tourism specifically. Instead, it is argued that these inadequacies can be addressed by the Sustainable Livelihoods Approach (SLA), a widely used organising framework for facilitating poverty reduction. But the application, and to an extent the principles, of the SLA may not fully fit the tourism situation, and vice versa. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding about the relationship between the SLA and tourism needs to be explored. This thesis incorporates a review of the literature on rural and tourism development. Gaps between the SLA and tourism are identified. It is suggested that the SLA cannot fully address the issues when tourism is used as a rural livelihood strategy. New knowledge and thinking are needed. Based on the literature review, a Sustainable Livelihoods Framework for Tourism (SLFT) is proposed as a guiding tool in rural development when tourism is a livelihood strategy. For testing the applicability of the SLFT, a mixed methodology and case study research method was adopted. Three mountainous rural villages, respectively at involvement, development and rejuvenation Tourism Area Life Cycle (TALC) stages, in central China, were examined. Before implementation of the case study, SLFT indicators were firstly developed. Findings show that the SLFT provides an overall organising framework for the consideration of rural development using tourism as a livelihood strategy at all stages of TALC. Revisiting the SLFT, it is argued that an additional attraction capital should be added to the SLFT. Attraction capital includes natural, cultural, and other attractions, and is defined as all resources used to attract tourist arrivals from which local people benefit for better livelihood objectives. Based on the findings, the SLFT and its key elements are revised to offer a more complete insight and understanding of a tourism livelihood system for the purpose of tourism planning and management. Particular attention is drawn to the newly introduced concept of institutional capital, mainly evidenced in community participation practice. Appropriate institutional policies and practices can ensure local people share the benefits from tourism. The implication of a participatory approach is extended to access to tourist markets, benefit sharing, as well as participation in the decision-making. This research indicates that improvement of livelihood assets by tourism enhances local people&#8217;s resilience to vulnerability contexts. Institutional arrangements play an important role in mediating this process as well as the impact of vulnerability contexts through the planning portfolio (e.g., planning, policy-making, and legislation). Future research is suggested to evaluate and improve the SLFT&#8217;s applicability in multiple development contexts, and to explore ways of further developing SLFT indicators as a means for evaluating the usefulness of the SLFT.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">rural development</field><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="subject">sustainable livelihoods approach</field><field name="subject">sustainability</field><field name="subject">community participation</field><field name="subject">sustainable livelihoods framework for tourism</field><field name="subject">indicators</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::220000 Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts-General</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370100 Sociology::370108 Rural Sociology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350500 Tourism</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1403</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influence of natural enemies on Cirsium arvense &#8212; a biogeographic perspective</field><field name="creator">Cripps, M. G.</field><field name="description">Cirsium arvense (L.) Scop. (Californian, Canada, or creeping thistle) is an exotic perennial herb indigenous to Eurasia that successfully established in New Zealand (NZ) approximately 130 years ago. Presently, C. arvense is considered one of the worst invasive weeds in NZ arable and pastoral productions systems.  The mechanism most commonly invoked to explain the apparent increased vigour of introduced weeds is release from natural enemies. The enemy release hypothesis (ERH) predicts that plants in an introduced range should experience reduced herbivory, particularly from specialists, and that release from this natural enemy pressure facilitates increased plant performance in the introduced range. In 2007 broad surveys were carried out in NZ and central Europe in order to quantify and compare growth characteristics of C. arvense in its native vs. introduced range.  Additionally, permanent field plots were established in NZ and Europe where natural enemies were excluded with the use of insecticide and fungicide applications, and compared with controls (ambient natural enemy pressure).  The impact of the specialist leaf-feeding beetle, Cassida rubiginosa M&#252;ller, which was recently released in NZ as a biological control agent against thistles, was also assessed.  From the field surveys, significantly more endophagous herbivory was present in the native range compared to the introduced range, as predicted by the ERH. Endophagous herbivory in NZ was solely from the capitulum-feeding weevil, Rhinocyllus conicus (Fr&#246;lich), and was only found in the North Island surveys.  No stem mining attack was found anywhere in NZ. The proportion of shoots attacked by the specialised rust pathogen, Puccinia punctiformis (Str.) R&#246;hl., was similar in both the native and introduced ranges.  Interestingly, this has casted doubt on the idea that stem-mining vectors, such as Ceratapion onopordi Kirby, are important for transmission of the rust pathogen.  Contrary to the ERH, there were no significant difference in plant performance between the native and introduced ranges, or differences could be explained by simple climatic factors.  Climate tended to be more favourable for growth of C. arvense in NZ.  In the permanent field plots in the native range, population growth of C. arvense was significantly greater where natural enemies were excluded, suggesting that insect herbivores and pathogens might have a regulating influence on the population growth of this plant.  Furthermore, the probability of shoots transitioning to the reproductive growth stage was enhanced when insect herbivores were excluded, indicating that natural enemies might influence plant development.  The biological control agent C. rubiginosa reduced the growth of C. arvense, although the impact of this herbivore was minimal in comparison to interspecific plant competition.  Thus, although there is reduced specialist natural enemy pressure in NZ, the growth of C. arvense is not significantly different from in its native range.  Nevertheless, there is some evidence that natural enemies in the native range might have a regulating influence on the population dynamics of the plant, and that the specialist herbivore, C. rubiginosa, can impact the plant in certain conditions.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cirsium arvense</field><field name="subject">Cassida rubiginosa</field><field name="subject">Ceratapion onopordi</field><field name="subject">Rhinocyllus conicus</field><field name="subject">Puccinia punctiformis</field><field name="subject">biological control</field><field name="subject">herbivory</field><field name="subject">enemy release hypothesis</field><field name="subject">Californian thistle</field><field name="subject">Canda thistle</field><field name="subject">creeping thistle</field><field name="subject">invasive species</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::279900 Other Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology::270505 Entomology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1411</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Post-classical economics approach to ecosystem management</field><field name="creator">Hearnshaw, Edward J. S.</field><field name="description">A principal purpose of this thesis is to present an economic evaluation of ecosystems. The concept of ecosystem health is adopted to ascertain the status of ecosystems. Ecosystem health is considered in part an economic concept and defined as a function of utility through the ecosystem services that satisfy various needs, subject to preserving the integrity of the adaptive cycle. In order to quantify the utility supplied by ecosystem services the novel utility index Ecosystem Outcome Protection Year (ECOPY) is developed. By forming this index, an evaluation can be performed using cost utility analysis, which avoids monetizing these benefits. An attempt is made to ascertain an appropriate approach for ecosystem management. It is reasoned that expert intuition can determine some kind of macro-regularities in ecosystems despite their complex dynamics. Hence, these inferences could be used for ecosystem management. Adaptive co-management is introduced as a means to bring about the collaboration of experts as resource co-managers. The concept of informed intuition is developed to bring about a systematic approach to learning and evaluation where the mental models of experts are transcribed using fuzzy cognitive mapping. However, it is argued that ecosystems as complex adaptive systems are non-ergodic and full of surprises. Accordingly, abduction, the logic of creative conjecture is systematically developed, for the purposes of maintaining mental model flexibility. This systematic application of abduction with an informed intuition forms the proposed abductive process of research, which is grounded in Shacklean potential surprise, a non-probabilistic function. To demonstrate this novel research process, a post-classical economic evaluation of Te Waihora lake ecosystem is undertaken, which employs the ECOPY index and potential surprise method. This empirical case study reveals various cost-effective management actions for improving lake health, which went beyond the intuitions of resource co-managers. This indicated the potential of the approach, which is considered a significant contribution for the methodological development of ecosystem management.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Abduction</field><field name="subject">Complex adaptive systems</field><field name="subject">Cost utility analysis</field><field name="subject">Adaptive co-management</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1425</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of an experimental approach to measure vitamin B12 production and absorption in sheep</field><field name="creator">Ludemann, M. R.</field><field name="description">Clinical diagnosis of vitamin B12/cobalt (Co) deficiency is difficult due to the unspecific nature of the clinical symptoms. The apparent increase in vitamin B12 deficiency in New Zealand in the late 1990&#8217;s made it clear that health providers were very reliant on plasma reference ranges to diagnose deficiency. However, the lack of quantitative data of what these reference ranges represent in terms of supply of vitamin B12, has prevented a better understanding of the metabolism of vitamin B12 within sheep. This thesis describes the development of an experimental approach to measure vitamin B12 production and absorption in sheep. The model was then used to investigate whether the type of carbohydrate source affects vitamin B12 production and/or absorption. In the first trial (Chapter 4), an adaptation of the repletion technique of Suttle (1974) for copper was used. Previously vitamin B12 depleted sheep were maintained on a diet of 400 g DM meadow hay and 250 g DM crushed barley and which provided a daily intake of 0.03 mg Co. Sheep were intravenously infused with known quantities of vitamin B12 (0 &#8211; 200 nmol hydroxycobalamin/d) to determine whether a relationship exists between plasma vitamin B12 concentration and rate of entry of the vitamin into the bloodstream and to quantify the relationship. Eight ewes fitted with rumen and abomasal cannulae were used in a paired 4x4 Latin square design. Four levels of vitamin B12 were infused into the jugular vein for 4 d followed by recovery period of 17 d and the plasma responses measured during this period. Control animals maintained relatively stable plasma levels while levels in treated animals rose sharply within 4 h after the start of infusion. The responses were proportional to infusion rate with a highly significant difference in concentrations observed between treatments (P&lt;0.001). Appearance of vitamin B12 in the plasma was quantified by the relationship Y(pmol/l) = 238 + 102x0.74 where x = infusion rate(nmol B12/d), R&#178; = 0.945. Plasma levels declined rapidly on cessation of infusion and had returned to original pre-treatment levels by the end of the recovery period.  The second trial (Chapter 5) quantified plasma responses in relation to dietary Co supply to the rumen. The same eight rumen and abomasal cannulated ewes were used in a paired 4x4 Latin square with 4 levels of intra-ruminal Co infusion in amounts ranging from 0 &#8211; 1 mg Co/d as CoSO&#8324;, infused for 4 d followed by a 19 d recovery period. Plasma vitamin B12 response was measured as were concentration of vitamin B12 in abomasal digesta supernatant and digesta liquid flow, the latter using polyethylene glycol as liquid phase marker. Plasma concentration increased from approximately 300 pmol/l to 750 &#8211; 800 pmol/l, peaking at day 5 after commencement of infusions. Control animals infused with water maintained base-line plasma vitamin B12 levels around 250 pmol/l. Digesta liquid flow was estimated at 14.6 l/d.  The results from Chapters 4 and 5 allowed estimates of vitamin B12 production and absorption. These results are discussed and efficiency of capture of Co into vitamin B12 from dietary Co intake was estimated to decrease from 8.4% to 0.74% as Co intake increased from 0.03 to 1.11 mg Co/d. Absorption coefficient was estimated from the relationships between abomasal vitamin B12 flow and plasma response. The absorption coefficient was calculated to increase from 7 to 10% as abomasal vitamin B12 flow increased from 108 to 142 nmol/d. The current animal model was subsequently used in the final trial (Chapter 6) to investigate whether the type of carbohydrate supplied in the diet influences vitamin B12 production and absorption. The same eight ewes fitted with rumen and abomasal cannulae were used in a 2x4 cross-over design. Half of the ewes were maintained on the basal diet and crushed barley while, for the remainder, the barley was replaced by 250 g of fructose:sucrose in a 80:20 mix during a 7 d period of adaptation. While on their respective diets, both groups were then infused with 0.3 mg Co/d for 6 d, a level chosen to optimise plasma vitamin B12 response. All ewes were then returned to the basal diet and barley for a 15 d recovery period after which treatments were reversed and the procedure repeated. Rumen pH, valeric, propionic, butyric, succinic, and acetic acid and ammonia concentrations were not significantly affected by diet. Digesta flow was 30% greater on a diet enriched with starch compared to sugar-enriched diet. There was an observed difference in vitamin B12 production. However there was no significant diet x time effect on plasma vitamin B12 concentration so any difference in production was negated by a difference in absorption. Carbohydrate supplied as water soluble carbohydrate or starch does not appear to influence plasma vitamin B12 concentration.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sheep</field><field name="subject">cobalt</field><field name="subject">vitamin B12</field><field name="subject">supplementation</field><field name="subject">infusion</field><field name="subject">production efficiency</field><field name="subject">absorption efficiency</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1424</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Attract and reward' : combining a floral resource subsidy with a herbivore-induced plant volatile to enhance conservation biological control</field><field name="creator">Orre, G. U. S.</field><field name="description">Experiments were conducted to assess whether a concept termed 'attract and reward' (A&amp;R) could enhance conservation biological control (CBC). In A&amp;R, a synthetically-produced herbivore induced plant volatile (HIPV) ('attract') is combined with a floral resource ('reward'). It is anticipated that the two will work synergistically attracting natural enemies into the crop ('attract') and maintaining them within the crop ('reward'). The study system consists of brassica, the most commonly occurring brassica herbivores, their natural enemies and higher order natural enemies. The HIPV deployed is methyl salicylate (MeSA) and the floral resource is buckwheat Fagopyrum esculentum. The aim of the first two field experiments, in 2007 and 2008, was to evaluate the effects of MeSA and MeSA combined with buckwheat (A&amp;R) on the abundance of arthropods from three trophic levels. In 2007, a field experiment was conducted using MeSA alone. The mean abundance of the leafmining fly Scaptomyza flava (trophic level 2), the diamondback moth (trophic level 2)(DBM) parasitoid Diadegma semiclausum (trophic level 2) and the hoverfly Melangyna novaezealandiae (trophic level 3) was increased in MeSA-treatments by up to 300% and for the brown lacewing parasitoid Anacharis zealandica a maximum mean increase of 600% was recorded. Significantly more females of the D. semiclausum and M. novaezealandiae were attracted to MeSA than males. When A&amp;R was deployed in 2008, were arthropods from the third and fourth trophic levels affected. For none of the species was there a synergistic effect between 'attract' and 'reward' on their abundance. The brown lacewing Micromus tasmaniae (trophic level 3), two parasitoids of DBM and one of cabbage white butterfly Pieris rapae (trophic level 2) increased significantly in treatments with buckwheat. The hoverfly Melanostoma fasciatum (trophic level 3) was significantly more abundant in treatments with MeSA, but significantly less abundant in treatments with buckwheat. The effect of MeSA on the fourth trophic level parasitoid Anacharis zealandica (trophic level 4) was inconsistent between years. Here it significantly decreased its abundance, while treatments with buckwheat increased it.  Significantly fewer male than female D. semiclausum were attracted to MeSA only treatments. These experiments show that MeSA and buckwheat can have unwanted effects on arthropod abundance which may disrupt CBC. To assess the effect of A&amp;R on CBC a further field experiment evaluating herbivore densities, predation, parasitism and hyper-parasitism rates was conducted. The only effect was significantly higher aphid parasitism in treatments with MeSA. Based on the results from the field experiments it remained unclear whether it was MeSA or a blend of volatiles produced by MeSA-induced host plants that were attractive to the arthropods. An olfactory experiment was conducted to evaluate if the aphid parasitoid Aphidius colemani can be attracted to two different concentrations of MeSA diluted in Synertrol oil. Significantly more parasitoids were attracted to 2.0% MeSA than to air while the parasitoid did not respond to the 0.5% concentration. These results indicate that A&amp;R has potential as a CBC technique, as long as any unwanted side effects can be managed. Although there were no synergistic effects between 'attract' and 'reward' on the abundance of individual natural enemies, combining MeSA and buckwheat could still be beneficial because the two techniques increase the abundance of different natural enemies.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">attract and reward</field><field name="subject">herbivore-induced plant volatile</field><field name="subject">methyl salicylate</field><field name="subject">buckwheat</field><field name="subject">brassica</field><field name="subject">trophic level</field><field name="subject">habitat manipulation</field><field name="subject">conservation biological control</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1429</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An experimental evaluation of resource allocation in island plants with respect to their invertebrate herbivores</field><field name="creator">Kay, M. K. (Nod)</field><field name="description">New Zealand&#8217;s isolation and periods of marine transgression have limited its biota to an extent which can be considered depauperate, even by island standards. Endemic vertebrates are rare and prominent invertebrate families, such as the renowned forest defoliators of the Lymantriidae, are absent. The proven vulnerability of the flora to introduced vertebrates reaffirms a belief in the invasiveness of islands and fuels the contingency plans aimed at averting similar devastation from further alien invertebrate defoliators. Nothofagus is a dominant element of the climax forests of New Zealand and the larger landmasses bordering the South Pacific Ocean. Assessments of the resistance to defoliation of continental and New Zealand species of Nothofagus, and a range of other forest genera endemic to New Zealand, was undertaken using bioassays of na&#239;ve polyphagous defoliators. The bioassays were undertaken in Europe, utilising gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar (Lepidoptera: Lymantriidae) and the fall webworm, Hyphantria cunea (Lepidoptera: Arctiidae) as defoliators, fed foliage plants growing in European arboreta. In New Zealand, bioassays utilised Australian painted apple moth, Teia anartoides (Lepidoptera: Lymantriidae) and tree species from local arboreta, gardens and natural populations. Larval growth rate was the primary parameter recorded to assess plant resistance. The relevance of growth rate was investigated by comparison with other recorded parameters and resistance to a surrogate pathogen, in the form of commercially available bio-insecticide. Larval growth rate was positively correlated with survivorship, potential fecundity, mating success and resistance to disease. The growth rate of larvae fed Nothofagus was positively correlated to the species-specific leaf nitrogen content. The results of the bioassays showed that despite the accepted paradigms, New Zealand&#8217;s flora was largely resistant to exotic defoliators. As an explanation of this apparent anomaly, the Island Resource Allocation (IRA) hypothesis was developed and posits that &#8216;the palatability iv of a plant to invertebrate herbivores is proportional to the geographic range of the plant&#8217;. The basis for the IRA hypothesis proposes a redefinition of the fundamental ecological principle of the species: area relationship. Islands, or similarly geographically constrained ecosystems, which support lower biodiversity, have impoverished trophic levels and consequently have weaker top-down regulation of herbivores by natural enemies. The IRA hypothesis argues that island ecosystem stability is achieved through the bottom-up process of plant defence. The IRA hypothesis was tested intra-specifically using bioassays using painted apple moth in which larvae were offered foliage of specimens from naturally discontinuous populations of Nothofagus truncata. The results supported the hypothesis in that the smallest populations of N. truncata exhibited the greatest resistance to the defoliator. The IRA hypothesis and a demonstrated mechanism for a differential resistance in Nothofagus species could resolve a number of enduring debates in ecology. Habitat area appears to explain the relative strengths of top-down and bottom-up regulation of herbivores. It also predicts the strengths of reciprocal evolution within the geographic mosaic of co-evolution and highlights the influence of biodiversity in invasive ecology. It may also help to resolve the contentious and extremely relevant debate of the role of biodiversity in ecosystem function.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">plant defence</field><field name="subject">Nothofagus</field><field name="subject">insect plant interactions</field><field name="subject">leaf nitrogen</field><field name="subject">co-evolution</field><field name="subject">biodiversity</field><field name="subject">resource allocation</field><field name="subject">island biogeography</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270708 Conservation and biodiversity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1442</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An exploration of entrepreneurship potential among rural youth in Namibia : the Arandis village</field><field name="creator">April, Wilfred Isak</field><field name="description">Background: Entrepreneurship potential amongst rural Nama youth should be considered a courageous idea to enhance the motivation and development of the community. At independence in 1990, Namibia developed its own economic and youth policies which were drafted in alignment with the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which address concerns about the role rural young people, can play in their own communities.  Theoretical Background: This paper explores the role of indigenous entrepreneurship as it pertains to development amongst rural youth in Namibia.  It considers the cultural context within which entrepreneurship takes place.  To identify and understand the cultural context, the study draws upon the theoretical frameworks of Geert Hofstede, specifically his continuum of individualism/collectivism. The need to continually incorporate new aspects whilst consciously maintaining the traditional, reflects a key African concept, that of "Ubuntu" (unmuntu ngumutu ngabantu).  Methodology: An empirical investigation of rural youth in Arandis village was conducted. To explore the significance of entrepreneurship, culture and the notion of Ubuntu in Africa, a comprehensive study of stakeholder views at both a community and national level was also carried out.  These investigations were guided by questionnaires, in-depth interviews (supported by story-telling), playback national radio interviews, a panel discussion and a review of Namibian policy documents. Analysis of data also explored practical initiatives and possible forms of enterprise which could contribute to the creation of opportunity for youth in Arandis and in Namibia. Findings: The major findings of this thesis are that: entrepreneurship in Namibia is defined by participants and stakeholders as the efforts made by an individual in accumulating the necessary resources to benefit the community; rural young people in Arandis are potential entrepreneurs (illustrated, by the strong passion they showed to be role models in their community and their strong sense of cultural identity).</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="subject">Nama</field><field name="subject">entrepreneurship</field><field name="subject">indigenous entrepreneurship</field><field name="subject">rural youth</field><field name="subject">Namibia</field><field name="subject">entrepreneurial potential</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::389900 Other Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::389999 Other behavioural and cognitive sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1459</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of the growth and development of yarrow (Achillea millefolium L.)</field><field name="creator">Bourdot, G. W.</field><field name="description">The response of yarrow (Achillea millefolium L.) seedlings to reduced light, interference from barley (Hordeum vulgare) and some aspects of regeneration from rhizomes were the subject of investigations from 1976 until 1980. Seedlings grown under four intensities of photosynthetically active radiation (100, 46.8, 23.7 and 6.4% of full summer daylight) were harvested on six occasions and the changes with time in the logarithms of leaf area, leaf, stem, root and total dry weights per plant were described by polynomial regression equations. Relative growth (RGR), net assimilation rate (NAR), leaf area ratio (LAR), specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf weight ratio (LWR) were derived directly from the growth curves. SLA and LWR increased with increased shading causing LAR to rise, while NAR declined. Response curves of RGR on light intensity, derived from linear regressions of LAR and NAR on the logarithm of relative light intensity predicted maximum RGR to occur at light intensities which decreased with time. This was a consequence of ontogenetic changes in LAR, and changes in NAR apparently related to self shading. Linear regressions of LAR and NAR at a constant total plant dry weight of 1.62 g showed that the increase in LAR almost completely compensated for the reduction in NAR down to approximately 40% full daylight, and maximum RGR was predicted to occur at 59% full daylight. The light compensation point was estimated to be 3.6% full daylight.  Yarrow populations established from 25 and 50 10 cm rhizome fragments m&#8315;&#178; were grown alone and with barley at 194 or 359 plants m&#8315;&#178;. The barley populations were also grown alone. Growth analysis employing the regression technique showed the RGR of yarrow was reduced by barley from before jointing (Feekes Scale, Stage 6) as a consequence of reduced NAR. The NAR of yarrow was significantly reduced in the continued presence of barely, which by the time of the final barely harvest resulted in 91 and 94% reduction in the accumulated yarrow dry matter at 194 and 359 barely plants m&#8315;&#178; respectively. The proportion of total dry matter allocated to seed and rhizome was also reduced by barley but the barley was unaffected by the yarrow. During the autumn and early winter, after removal of the barley, the suppressed yarrow had a higher RGR than the unsuppressed population, owing to higher LAR and NAR. Rhizome growth was vigorous during both autumn and winter in all yarrow populations, but the RGR of rhizome dry matter was higher in the suppressed yarrow during the autumn. This resulted in a progressive reduction in the difference in rhizome dry matter between suppressed and unsuppressed populations.  Several aspects of the development and regenerative potential of rhizomes were investigated. In the first experiment, plants were established from seed and rhizome fragments and harvested on several occasions. Plants from both propagules formed rhizomes on which approximately 97% of auxiliary buds remained dormant, as long as the plants were undisturbed. Buds on rhizomes attached to the parent plant formed rhizome branches when the apex was damaged, had emerged from the soil, or in situations where internodes were congested. In the second experiment, rhizome fragments of 4, 8 and 16 cm in length were planted in soil at depths of 0, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0, 20.0 and 30.0 cm. All fragments on the soil surface died without forming shoots owing to desiccation whilst 100% mortality at 20 and 30 cm was probably the result of flooding. Within the 2.5 to 10.0 cm range, an increasing percentage of fragments survived (produced an aerial shoot(s)) as burial depth was reduced and fragment length increased. Within this depth range, the percentage of buds which had become active on undecayed fragments declined with increased length and burial depth. In the third experiment, single-node rhizome pieces were excised from rhizomes retrieved from field populations over a one year period, and incubated at 25&#176;C for 10 days in darkness. More than 90% of buds formed vertical shoots throughout the year, indicating there was no period of innate dormancy in isolated buds. The effect of time of planting on the pattern of early regenerative development was assessed in the fourth experiment, in which 10 cm rhizome fragments were planted at 5 cm depth in soil on two occasions (in November and April). The developmental pattern was the same regardless of month of planting and new rhizomes were initiated at nodes on the vertical subterranean shoots when 5 to 6 aerial leaves had developed. The planted rhizome fragments declined in dry weight and a minimum weight occurred at about the time when rhizome initiation began.</field><field name="date">1980</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">yarrow</field><field name="subject">Achillea millefolium L.</field><field name="subject">light intensity</field><field name="subject">rhizome</field><field name="subject">regeneration</field><field name="subject">growth and development</field><field name="subject">barley</field><field name="subject">Hordeum vulgare L.</field><field name="subject">shading</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300200 Crop and Pasture Production::300204 Plant protection (pests, diseases and weeds)</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany::270401 Plant systematics, taxonomy and phylogeny</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1507</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling the proximal source of intercepted exotic insects</field><field name="creator">Guichard, Sylvain</field><field name="description">Biological invasions are major threats to any nation&#8217;s economy and biodiversity. To detect new biological incursions of some species biosecurity agencies deploy pheromone sentinel traps for targeted species at high risk sites such as airports, seaports and transitional facilities. A good example is the gypsy moth surveillance program in New Zealand. Following the detection of an incursion by an unwanted organism, ground-based searches to locate the source can be very expensive, but are essential to identify the introduction pathway and to increase the chances of success eradicating the unwanted organism. In such circumstances, the possibility of better targeting the search for the source of the incursion using a modelling approach is worthy of investigation A stochastic mechanistic model to hindcast moth flight from a recapture location to the release location was developed based on insect behaviour in response to wind and pheromones. The model was composed of two main processes, 1) downwind dispersal, assumed to result from an appetitive behaviour, indicated by an analysis of a previous mark-release-recapture experiment on painted apple moth (Teia anartoides, Walker) and, 2) anemotaxic dispersal inspired by pheromone anemotaxis theory but up-scaled from a fine-scaled behaviour model to a 2 m scale.  A genetic algorithm was used to fit some model parameters. A specialised fitness function was developed to allow the genetic algorithm to identify parameters that resulted in models that reflected both the spread and density patterns in the trapping data. The resulting function allowed the stochastic model results to be compared with the inherently stochastic trapping data. The resulting individual based model simulates the spatio-temporal dispersal pattern of painted apple moth recorded during a previous mark-release-recapture experiment. While the proposed model is shown to have limitations with respect to accuracy and precision it is also demonstrated to greatly improve biosecurity incursion response capability, by more efficient targeting of search effort for the proximal source of an incursion.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">anemotaxis</field><field name="subject">appetitive</field><field name="subject">casting</field><field name="subject">downwind</field><field name="subject">biosecurity</field><field name="subject">goodness of fit</field><field name="subject">individual based model</field><field name="subject">invasive alien species</field><field name="subject">Teia anartoides</field><field name="subject">pheromone</field><field name="subject">moth</field><field name="subject">Lymantria dispar</field><field name="subject">Lymantriidae</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology::270505 Entomology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1472</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling lucerne (Medicago sativa L.) crop response to light regimes in an agroforestry system</field><field name="creator">Varella, Alexandre Costa</field><field name="description">The general goal of this research was to understand the agronomic and physiological changes of a lucerne crop in distinct physical radiation environments and to verify the potential of lucerne to grow under shaded conditions. To achieve this, the research was conducted in four main steps: (i) firstly, experimental data collection in the field using two artificial shade materials (shade cloth and wooden slats) under inigated and non-irrigated conditions; (ii) a second experiment with data collection in a typical temperate dryland agroforestry area under non-irrigated conditions; (iii) generation of a light interception sub-model suitable for shaded crops and (iv) a linkage between the light interception sub-model and a canopy photosynthesis model for agroforestry use.  In experiments 1 and 2, lucerne crop was exposed to 6 different light regimes: full sunlight (FS), shade cloth (FS+CL), wooden slats (FS+SL), trees (T), trees+cloth (T +CL) and trees+slats (T+SL). The FS+SL structure produced a physical radiation environment (radiation transmission, radiation periodicity and spectral composition) that was similar to that observed in the agroforestry site (f). The mean annual photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) was 41 % under the FS+CL, 44% under FS+SL and 48% under T compared with FS in clear sky conditions. Plants were exposed to an intermittent (sun/shade) regime under both FS+SL and T, whereas under FS+CL the shaded light regime was continuous. The red to far-red (RIFR) ratio measured during the shade period under the slats was 0.74 and under the trees was 0.64. However, R/FR ratio increased to 1.26 and 1.23 during the illuminated period under FS+SL and T, respectively, and these were equivalent to the ratio of 1.28 observed under the FS+CL and 1.31 in FS. The radiation use efficiency (RUE) of shoots increased under the 5 shaded treatments compared with full sunlight. The pattern of radiation interception was unchanged by radiation flux, periodicity and spectral composition and all treatments had a mean extinction coefficient of 0.82. However, the magnitude of the decrease in canopy growth was less than those in PPFD transmissivity. The mean lucerne annual dry matter (DM) yield was 17.5 t ha&#8315;&#185; in FS and 10 t ha&#8315;&#185; under the FS+CL, FS+SL and T regimes. This declined to 3.4 t DM ha&#8315;&#185; under T+CL (22% PPFD transmissvity) and 4.1 t DM ha&#8315;&#185; under T+SL (23% transmissivity). A similar pattern of response was observed for leaf net photosynthesis (Pn) rates under the shade treatments compared with full sun. In addition, spectral changes observed under the trees and slats affected plant motphology by increasing the number of long stems, stem height and internode length compared with full sunlight. Thus, there were two main explanations for the increase in RUE under shade compared with full sun: (i) preferential partition of assimilates to shoot rather than root growth and/or (ii) leaves under shade were still operating at an efficient part of the photosynthetic light curve.  The changes proposed for the canopy Pn model were appropriate to simulate the radiation environment of an agroforestry system. However, the model underestimated DM yields under the continuous and intermittent shade regimes. These were considered to be mainly associated with plant factors, such as overestimation in maintenance respiration and partitioning between shoots and roots in shade and the intermittency light effect on leaf Pn rates. Further investigation in these topics must be addressed to accurately predict crop yield in agroforestry areas. Overall, the lucerne crop responded typically as a sun-adapted plant under shade. It was concluded that lucerne yield potential to grow under intermediate shade was superior to most of C3 pastures previously promoted in the literature.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">alfalfa</field><field name="subject">fluctuating light</field><field name="subject">light intensity</field><field name="subject">light quality</field><field name="subject">Pinus radiata</field><field name="subject">shade and silvopastoral system</field><field name="subject">lucerne crops</field><field name="subject">Medicago sativa L.</field><field name="subject">agroforestry</field><field name="subject">Total Dry Matter (TDM)</field><field name="subject">radiation use efficiency</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300200 Crop and Pasture Production::300205 Agronomy</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300200 Crop and Pasture Production</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1477</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Eco-climatic assessment of the potential establishment of exotic insects in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Peacock, Lora</field><field name="description">To refine our knowledge and to adequately test hypotheses concerning theoretical and applied aspects of invasion biology, successful and unsuccessful invaders should be compared. This study investigated insect establishment patterns by comparing the climatic preferences and biological attributes of two groups of polyphagous insect species that are constantly intercepted at New Zealand's border. One group of species is established in New Zealand (n = 15), the other group comprised species that are not established (n = 21). In the present study the two groups were considered to represent successful and unsuccessful invaders.  To provide background for interpretation of results of the comparative analysis, global areas that are climatically analogous to sites in New Zealand were identified by an eco-climatic assessment model, CLIMEX, to determine possible sources of insect pest invasion. It was found that south east Australia is one of the regions that are climatically very similar to New Zealand. Furthermore, New Zealand shares 90% of its insect pest species with that region. South east Australia has close trade and tourism links with New Zealand and because of its proximity a new incursion in that analogous climate should alert biosecurity authorities in New Zealand. Other regions in western Europe and the east coast of the United States are also climatically similar and share a high proportion of pest species with New Zealand.  Principal component analysis was used to investigate patterns in insect global distributions of the two groups of species in relation to climate. Climate variables were reduced to temperature and moisture based principal components defining four climate regions, that were identified in the present study as, warm/dry, warm/wet, cool/dry and cool/moist. Most of the insect species established in New Zealand had a wide distribution in all four climate regions defined by the principal components and their global distributions overlapped into the cool/moist, temperate climate where all the New Zealand sites belong. The insect species that have not established in New Zealand had narrow distributions within the warm/wet, tropical climates.  Discriminant analysis was then used to identify which climate variables best discriminate between species presence/absence at a site in relation to climate. The discriminant analysis classified the presence and absence of most insect species significantly better than chance. Late spring and early summer temperatures correctly classified a high proportion of sites where many insect species were present. Soil moisture and winter rainfall were less effective discriminating the presence of the insect species studied here.  Biological attributes were compared between the two groups of species. It was found that the species established in New Zealand had a significantly wider host plant range than species that have not established. The lower developmental threshold temperature was on average, 4&#176;C lower for established species compared with non-established species. These data suggest that species that establish well in New Zealand have a wide host range and can tolerate lower temperatures compared with those that have not established. No firm conclusions could be drawn about the importance of propagule pressure, body size, fecundity or phylogeny for successful establishment because data availability constrained sample sizes and the data were highly variable.  The predictive capacity of a new tool that has potential for eco-climatic assessment, the artificial neural network (ANN), was compared with other well used models. Using climate variables as predictors, artificial neural network predictions were compared with binary logistic regression and CLIMEX. Using bootstrapping, artificial neural networks predicted insect presence and absence significantly better than the binary logistic regression model. When model prediction success was assessed by the kappa statistic there were also significant differences in prediction performance between the two groups of study insects. For established species, the models were able to provide predictions that were in moderate agreement with the observed data. For non-established species, model predictions were on average only slightly better than chance. The predictions of CLIMEX and artificial neural networks when given novel data, were difficult to compare because both models have different theoretical bases and different climate databases. However, it is clear that both models have potential to give insights into invasive species distributions. Finally the results of the studies in this thesis were drawn together to provide a framework for a prototype pest risk assessment decision support system. Future research is needed to refine the analyses and models that are the components of this system.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">analogous climates</field><field name="subject">artificial neural networks</field><field name="subject">CLIMEX</field><field name="subject">discriminate analysis</field><field name="subject">establishment success</field><field name="subject">host plant</field><field name="subject">invasive species</field><field name="subject">kappa statistic</field><field name="subject">pest risk analysis</field><field name="subject">polyphagous insect pest species</field><field name="subject">principal component analysis</field><field name="subject">eco-climatic assessment model</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280200 Artificial Intelligence and Signal and Image Processing::280212 Neural networks, genetic algorithms and fuzzy logic</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology::270505 Entomology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300200 Crop and Pasture Production::300204 Plant protection (pests, diseases and weeds)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1530</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influence of root exudates on soil microbial diversity and activity</field><field name="creator">Shi, Shengjing</field><field name="description">Interactions between plant roots and soil microorganisms in the rhizosphere are critical for plant growth. However, understanding of precisely how root exudates influence the diversity and activity of rhizosphere microorganisms is limited. The main objective of this study was to investigate the effect of radiata pine (Pinus radiata) root exudates on rhizosphere soil microbial communities, with an emphasis on the role of low molecular weight organic anions. The study involved the development and validation of new methods for investigating rhizosphere processes in a purpose-built facility. This included development of an in situ sampling technique using an anion exchange membrane strip to collect a range of organic anions exuded from radiata pine roots grown in large-scale rhizotrons. These included tartarate, quinate, formate, malate, malonate, shikimate, lactate, acetate, maleate, citrate, succinate and fumarate. Soil microbial activity and diversity were determined using dehydrogenase activity and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. Links between organic anions in root exudates and rhizosphere soil microbial community structures were investigated by comparing wild type and genetically modified radiata pine trees which were grown in rhizotrons for 10 months. As expected, there was considerable temporal and spatial variability in the amounts and composition of organic anions collected, and there were no consistent or significant differences determined between the two tree lines. Significant differences in rhizosphere microbial communities were detected between wild type and genetically modified pine trees; however, they were inconsistent throughout the experiment. The shifts in microbial communities could have been related to changes in exudate production and composition. Based on results from the main rhizotron experiment, a microcosm study was carried out to investigate the influence of selected pine root exudate sugars (glucose, sucrose and fructose) and organic anions (quinate, lactate and maleate) on soil microbial activity and diversity. Soil microbial activity increased up to 3-fold in all of the sugar and organic anion treatments compared to the control, except for a mixture of sugars and maleate where it decreased. The corresponding impacts on soil microbial diversity were assessed using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and 16S rRNA phylochips. Addition of the exudate compounds had a dramatic impact on the composition and diversity of the soil microbial community. A large number of bacterial taxa (88 to 1043) responded positively to the presence of exudate compounds, although some taxa (12 to 24) responded negatively. Organic anions had a greater impact on microbial communities than sugars, which indicated that they may have important roles in rhizosphere ecology of radiata pine. In addition, a diverse range of potentially beneficial bacterial taxa were detected in soil amended with organic anions, indicating specific regulation of rhizosphere microbial communities by root exudates. This project highlighted the considerable challenges and difficulties involved in detailed investigation of in situ rhizosphere processes. Nonetheless, the findings of this study represent a significant contribution to advancing understanding of relationships between root exudates and soil microbial diversity, which will be further enhanced by refinement and application of the specific methodologies and techniques developed.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">rhizosphere</field><field name="subject">root exudates</field><field name="subject">organic anions</field><field name="subject">soil microbial community</field><field name="subject">diversity</field><field name="subject">in situ</field><field name="subject">anion exchange membrane</field><field name="subject">radiata pine (Pinus radiata)</field><field name="subject">genetically modified</field><field name="subject">rhizotron</field><field name="subject">rRNA</field><field name="subject">DGGE</field><field name="subject">phylochip</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1549</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of physiological and behavioural characteristics of parasitoids on host specificity testing outcomes and the biological control of Paropsis charybdis</field><field name="creator">Murray, Tara J.</field><field name="description">An established host-parasitoid-hyperparasitoid system was used to investigate how the physiological and behavioural characteristics of parasitoids influence the outcomes of laboratory-based host specificity tests. The characteristics of the two pteromalid egg parasitoids, Enoggera nassaui (Girault) and Neopolycystus insectifurax Girault, were assessed and interpreted in regard to the particular host specificity testing methods used and the control of the eucalypt defoliating beetle Paropsis charybdis St&#229;l (Chrysomelidae) in New Zealand.  The physiology of N. insectifurax was examined to determine how to increase production of female parasitoids that were physiologically capable and motivated to parasitise P. charybdis eggs in laboratory trials. Neopolycystus insectifurax were found to be more synovigenic than E. nassaui. Provisioning them with honey and host stimuli for three days, and allowing females to parasitise hosts in isolation (i.e. in the absence of competition) was an effective means of achieving these goals.  No-choice tests were conducted in Petri dish arenas with the four paropsine beetles established in New Zealand. All four were found to be within the physiological host ranges of E. nassaui and N. insectifurax, but their quality as hosts, as indicated by the percent parasitised and offspring sex ratios, varied. The results of paired choice tests between three of the four species agreed with those of no-choice tests in most instances. However, the host Trachymela catenata (Chapuis), which was parasitised at very low levels by E. nassaui in no-choice tests, was not accepted by that species in paired choice tests. A much stronger preference by N. insectifurax for P. charybdis over T. catenata was recorded in the paired choice test than expected considering the latter was parasitised at a high level in the no-choice test. The presence of the target host in paired choice tests reduced acceptance of lower ranked hosts. Both no-choice and choice tests failed to predict that eggs of the acacia feeding beetle Dicranosterna semipunctata (Chapuis) would not be within the ecological host range of E. nassaui and N. insectifurax.  Behavioural observations were made of interspecific competition between E. nassaui and N. insectifurax for access to P. charybdis eggs. Two very different oviposition strategies were identified. Neopolycystus insectifurax were characterised by taking possession of, and aggressively guarding host eggs during and after oviposition. They also appeared to selectively oviposit into host eggs already parasitised by E. nassaui, but did not emerge from significantly more multi-parasitised hosts than E. nassaui. Enoggera nassaui did not engage in contests and fled when approached by N. insectifurax. Although often prohibited from ovipositing by N. insectifurax, E. nassaui were able to locate and begin ovipositing more quickly, and did not remain to guard eggs after oviposition. It is hypothesised that although N. insectifurax have a competitive advantage in a Petri dish arena, E. nassaui may be able to locate and parasitise more host eggs in the field in New Zealand, where competition for hosts in is relatively low. The biology of the newly established encyrtid Baeoanusia albifunicle Girault was assessed. It was confirmed to be a direct obligate hyperparasitoid able to exploit E. nassaui but not N. insectifurax. Field and database surveys found that all three parasitoids have become established in many climatically different parts of New Zealand. Physiological characteristics were identified that may allow B. albifunicle to reduced effective parasitism of P. charybdis by E. nassaui to below 10%. However, the fact that hyperparasitism still prevents P. charybdis larvae from emerging, and that B. albifunicle does not attack N. insectifurax, may preclude any significant impact on the biological control of P. charybdis.  Overall, parasitoid ovigeny and behavioural interactions with other parasitoids were recognised as key characteristics having the potential to influence host acceptance in the laboratory and the successful biological control of P. charybdis in the field. It is recommended that such characteristics be considered in the design and implementation of host specificity tests and might best be assessed by conducting behavioural observations during parasitoid colony maintenance and the earliest stages of host specificity testing.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">biological control</field><field name="subject">host specificity testing</field><field name="subject">no-choice test</field><field name="subject">choice test</field><field name="subject">parasitoid</field><field name="subject">hyperparasitoid</field><field name="subject">parasitoid behaviour</field><field name="subject">Eucalyptus</field><field name="subject">Acacia</field><field name="subject">Paropsis charybdis</field><field name="subject">Enoggera nassaui</field><field name="subject">Neopolycystus insectifurax</field><field name="subject">Baeoanusia albifunicle</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology::270505 Entomology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300600 Forestry Sciences::300603 Pests, health and diseases</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1558</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Clean and green? Environmental quality on the New Zealand dairy farm</field><field name="creator">Menzies, Diane</field><field name="description">This study explores issues arising from the adoption of the term 'clean and green' for marketing New Zealand dairy products. Three dimensions of environmental quality were investigated: that of sustainable dairying and best practice for the benefit of farmers and the industry; resource management legislation and being a 'good neighbour'; and export marketing opportunities and issues.  The study was undertaken during a time of major structural upheaval in the dairy industry, including yearly company amalgamations in the study area, rapid conversion of farmland to dairying, as well as factory expansion to process the increasing supply of product.  The focus of the study was on the individual farmer, how perceptions and preferences are formed, and how in turn, these influence farm practice. World views drawn from Cultural Theory were adopted as the basis for analysis. Farmers were classified according to particular world views and the symbolic and reflexive use of concepts such as 'clean and green' was analysed. A model of overlapping ecological, agricultural and social systems was used to develop a wider understanding of preference formation. Through a mixed methodology, focusing on a case study approach, farmer and stakeholder world views were compared on key themes, including the 'clean green' pastoral myth, 'cues for care' and environmental issues. Media discourse as well as consumer views were used to expand understanding of the context. The study found that both farmers (within their groups) and stakeholders held different objectives and opinions on environmental issues and options for change, based on their various world views and preferences. There was general agreement both among farmers and stakeholders on the New Zealand 'clean green' image and 'cues for care', or signs that indicate good farm management. The reason for this was demonstrated to be the way in which these two aspects are communicated; through symbolic images that each individual perceived in terms of their respective world view.  A symbolic form of action, an environmental management system, was trialled with farmers. Analysis indicated that national aspirations created by the 'clean green' pastoral myth required farmers to respond to environmental expectations, but that an image that symbolized environment as care and quality, rather than as place was needed to provide a less ambiguous goal. The findings of the trial were integrated with theory to interpret context and develop policy, strategy and action proposals for a system for environmental quality for the industry.  The study has implications for non-regulatory mechanisms relevant to sustainable dairy farming, communication within the rural community, and branding.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">clean green</field><field name="subject">cues for care</field><field name="subject">cultural theory</field><field name="subject">dairy farming</field><field name="subject">environmental quality</field><field name="subject">symbols</field><field name="subject">sustainable agriculture</field><field name="subject">environmental management systems</field><field name="subject">world views</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370100 Sociology::370109 Environmental Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1553</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimisation of a buyer&#8217;s sourcing strategy in the mixed auction/direct supply of New Zealand wool</field><field name="creator">Aryal, Jagannath</field><field name="description">The New Zealand Wool Industry (NZWI) contributes over a billion dollars a year to NZ gross output. However, this industry is at a crossroads and the incumbent practitioners are looking for ways to increase the value of the New Zealand wool clip. The value of the industry to the economy is directly related to the price which buyers are prepared to pay for wool, primarily as a result of the marketing approaches used, physical parameters of wool as well as intra and inter-fibre competition. The inflation adjusted price has steadily decreased over recent years and understanding of its dynamics is a fundamental problem for the stakeholders. Among the stakeholders, buyers / exporters, heavily involved in the process of price formation currently face a real time problem of sourcing strong wool from two parallel but different marketing systems operated simultaneously &#8211; auction and direct supply. The underlying mathematics which governs the decision making of buyers on the price dynamics in these sourcing options is poorly understood.  This study developed system models for price formation in both auction and direct supply sourcing and an associated optimization model for the buyer / exporter of the New Zealand wool clip. All three of these models were original and none appear to have been described previously. It is hoped that these three models will be of quite general utility and also be useful therefore for other agricultural commodities that are traded simultaneously via auction and direct supply. The average price for a given wool type, which is the output from this new modelling exercise is precisely what is required as input data for solving the minimization problem in wool blending models.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">buyer/exporter</field><field name="subject">auction</field><field name="subject">direct supply</field><field name="subject">relative price</field><field name="subject">physical properties</field><field name="subject">New Zealand wool industry</field><field name="subject">iconic</field><field name="subject">market average</field><field name="subject">cost</field><field name="subject">global supply</field><field name="subject">demand</field><field name="subject">optimization</field><field name="subject">commodity</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::230100 Mathematics::230117 Operations research</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::230100 Mathematics::230118 Optimisation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1548</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors affecting nitric oxide and nitrous oxide emissions from grazed pasture urine patches under New Zealand conditions</field><field name="creator">Khan, Shabana</field><field name="description">New Zealand is dominated by its agricultural industry with one of the most intensive farming practices being that of intensive dairying. New Zealand currently has approximately 5.3 million dairy cows that excrete up to 2.2 L of urine, per urination event, up to 12 times per day. This equates to 5.1 x10&#185;&#8304; L per year or enough urine to fill over 1.2 million milk tankers. This sheer volume of urine and its associated N content has implications for the cycling of N within the pasture soils utilised, and New Zealand&#8217;s greenhouse gas budget due to the emission of N&#8322;O from urine affected areas. The emission of nitric oxide (NO) from agricultural systems is also receiving increasing attention due to concerns about alterations in the balance of atmospheric trace gases and sinks. Worldwide there is a dearth of information with respect to the emissions of NO from urine-N deposition onto soils with only two in situ studies and no studies on the effects of soil pH, environmental variables or urine-N rate on NO fluxes. This present study has provided some fundamental information on the factors and processes affecting the emission of NO from bovine urine applied to pasture soils. Five experiments were performed in total; three laboratory experiments and two field experiments.  The first laboratory experiment (chapter 4) examined the effect of the initial soil pH on NOx emissions from urine-N applied at 500 kg N ha&#8315;&#185;. Soil was treated to alter the initial soil pH over the range of 4.4 to 7.6. Initial soil pH affected rates of nitrification which in turn affected the decline in soil pH. Emissions of NO increased with increasing soil pH. However, a strong positive linear relationship was established between the NO-N flux, expressed as a percentage of the net NH4&#8314;-N depletion rate, and the level of soil acidity. The NO-N fluxes were higher under the more acidic soil conditions where N turnover was lower. The fluxes of N&#8322;O did not follow the same pattern and were attributed to biological mechanisms.  In experiment two (chapter 5) the objectives were to concurrently examine the effects of varying the soil temperature and the water-filled pore space (WFPS) on NOx emissions from urine-N. In this experiment increasing the soil temperature enhanced both the rate of nitrification and the rate of decrease in soil pH. The relationship between the net NO-N flux, expressed as a percentage of the net NH4&#8314;-N depletion rate, and the level of soil acidity was again demonstrated at the warmest soil temperature (22&#176;C) where soil acidification had progressed sufficiently to enable abiotic NO formation. The NO-N fluxes increased with decreasing soil moisture and increasing soil acidity indicating abiotic factors were responsible for NO production. The Q10 response of the NO flux between 5 to 15&#176;C decreased from 4.3 to 1.5 as WFPS increased from 11% to 87% respectively. Fluxes of N&#8322;O increased with increasing WFPS and temperature indicating that denitrification was the dominant process.  Results from experiments 2 and 3 indicated that the rate of nitrification had a direct bearing on the ensuing soil acidity and that it was this in conjunction with the available inorganic-N pools that affected NOx production. Therefore the third experiment examined the effect of urine-N rate on NOx emissions, with urine-N rate varied over 5 levels from 0 to 1000 kg N ha&#8315;&#185;, the highest rate being that found under maximal urine-N inputs to pasture. Rates of nitrification were diminished at the highest rates of urine-N applied and decreases in soil acidity were not as rapid due to this. Again significant but separate linear relationships were developed, for each urine-N rate used, between the NO-N flux, expressed as a percentage of the net NH4&#8314;-N depletion rate, and the level of soil acidity. The slope of these relationships increased with increasing urine-N rate. The NO-N flux, expressed as a percentage of the net NH4&#8314;-N depletion rate, versus soil acidity was higher under 1000 kg N ha&#8315;&#185;, despite the lower soil acidity in this treatment. This indicated that the enhanced inorganic-N pool was also playing a role in increasing the NO flux. The N&#8322;O fluxes were of limited duration in this experiment possibly due to conditions being disadvantageous for denitrification.  In the field experiments two urine-N rates were examined under both summer and winter conditions at two urine-N rates. The emission factors after 71 days for NO-N in the summer were 0.15 and 0.20% of the urine-N applied for the 500 and 1000 kg N ha&#8315;&#185; rates respectively while the respective N&#8322;O-N fluxes were 0.14 and 0.16%. Under winter conditions the emission factors after 42 days for NO-N were &lt;0.001% of the urine-N applied regardless of urine-N rate while the N&#8322;O-N fluxes were 0.05 and 0.09% for the 500 and 1000 kg N ha&#8315;&#185; urine-N rates respectively. The relationships and predictors of NO-N flux determined in the laboratory studies did not serve as strong indicators of the NO-N flux under summer conditions. Low emissions from urine-N over winter were due to the low soil temperatures and high WFPS.  These studies have demonstrated that soil chemical and environmental variables influence the production of NOx and N&#8322;O emissions from urine-N applied to soil and that seasonal effects have a significant impact on the relative amounts of NO-N and N&#8322;O-N emitted from urine patches. Suggestions for future work are also made.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nitric oxide</field><field name="subject">nitrous oxide</field><field name="subject">bovine urine</field><field name="subject">pasture soil</field><field name="subject">soil pH</field><field name="subject">soil moisture</field><field name="subject">soil temperature</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1570</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Protein nutrition of livestock grazing high quality pasture</field><field name="creator">Madibela, Othusitse Ricky</field><field name="description">This thesis describes a series of four experiments designed to evaluate the role of the supply of protein in livestock grazing high quality pasture during mating and during pregnancy. The first two studies investigated the effects of high crude protein content of spring or autumn re-growth pasture on the reproductive performance of dairy cows and of ewes at mating. The last two studies investigated how the dietary supply of protein, body condition and their interactions contribute to the breakdown of immunity during the peri-parturient period in ewes and investigated underlying endocrine mechanisms.  In the first study (Chapter 3) cows were blood sampled via the tail vein during the breeding period in spring. Plasma was then analysed for urea concentration. Cows with high plasma urea (HPU) or low plasma urea (LPU) were defined as those with plasma urea concentrations of &#8805; or &lt; 44.9 mg/dl respectively. Lactating cows (n = 200) were also categorized into high milk producers (HMP) or low milk producers (LPM) relative to an average daily yield of 26.6 l/d. Pasture clipping showed an average pasture CP (crude protein) content of 223 g/kg DM. Concentrations of plasma urea ranged from 26.6 to 64.4 mg/dl. No correlation was observed between plasma urea concentration and either reproductive indicators or milk parameters. Mean blood urea concentration of HPU cows was 50.8 compared to 38.5 mg/dl in LPU cows. There was a trend for more animals (P = 0.09) in the HPU group than in the LPU group not to return to oestrus. Cumulative pregnancy rate in HPU and LPU was similar except at week 6 after the start of mating when more (P &lt; 0.01) HPU than LPU cows were pregnant. Calving to conception interval, calving interval and interval between conception and first service were similar (P &gt; 0.05) between HPU and LPU cows. Gestation length, calving rate, milk yield and milk components were also similar (P &gt; 0.05) between LPU and HPU cows. There was no difference (P &gt; 0.05) in plasma urea concentrations between HMP and LMP milk producers. However, calving to conception interval, interval between calving and first service and calving interval were longer (P &lt; 0.001), submission rate higher (P &lt; 0.001) and NRR (Non-return rate) higher (P &lt; 0.05) in LMP than HMP. The number of services, the interval between first and second service, gestation length and CR (calving rate) were similar (P &gt; 0.05) between HMP and LMP cows. HMP had lower (P &lt; 0.001) milk protein and fat concentrations than LMP cows. This information indicates that, despite the fact that plasma urea was consistently higher than levels in the literature which have been associated with reduced fertility in dairy cows; no impairment of reproductive performance was observed. In the second experiment (Chapter 4) mature and dry Coopworth ewes were blocked by weight, body condition and previous prolificacy (high, HP vs low twinning frequency, LP) into two groups and thereafter randomly allocated to diet which were designed to provided either 1) high protein (163 g/kg DM, ryegrass/red clover pasture, HPP) or low protein (119 g/kg DM, hay and barley grain, HB) supply at joining. These were designed to provide high and low plasma urea concentration. Over a period of 17 days, ewes recorded as mated were examined by laparoscopy, at which time there was no difference in blood urea concentration (58.6 vs 56.1 mg/dl) between HPP and HB groups. Fifty days after the start of joining the number of foetuses present was counted using ultrasonography. As a consequence of lack of difference in the plasma urea concentration, irrespective of treatment group, individual animals were categorized into high (HU) and low plasma urea (LU) status based on whether plasma urea concentration was higher or lower than the sample mean of 51.5 mg urea/dl. Lambs which weighed greater than the mean plus one standard deviation for their litter size were classified as oversize. Ovulation rate and conception rate were similar (P &gt; 0.05) between HPP and BH and between HU and LU ewes. Ewes with previous high reproductive performance (HP) as would be expected had higher ovulation rate (P &lt; 0.001) and conception rate (P &lt; 0.01) than LP ewes. Embryo losses was not (P = 0.06) different between HB and HPP ewes. Urea category (HU vs LU) did not (P &gt; 0.05) influence embryo mortality. Foetal loss, neonatal loss, total reproductive loss and mean lamb birth weight was were not affected by diet, nor urea category (P &gt; 0.05). Single ovulations had tended (P = 0.08) to contribute to higher embryo loss compared to multiple ovulations, and, single foetuses suffered higher (P&lt;0.001) losses compared to multiples. While the study did not achieve large differences in plasma urea concentrations between diets, the levels of plasma urea operating were high yet reproductive wastage rates were similar to those recorded in the literature. Together with similar apparent lack of effect on a high plasma urea environment, the data suggest either that previous findings from controlled studies have a more complex aetiology or that pastoral animals can adapt to high tissue ammonia/urea status. The third trial (Chapter 5) was designed to provide information on the supply of amino acids to the abomasum from protein supplementation which have previously been found to overcome dietary scarcity associated with limitation of peri-parturient increase in FEC. Twin-suckling ewes were fitted with rumen and abomasal cannulae and grazed a ryegrass/clover sward (C) or the same sward but with a 500 g/h/d protein supplement (S). The trial was designed as a cross-over with two 14 day adaptation periods followed by two five-day digesta-sampling periods. All ewes were treated with anthelmintic 14 days after lambing. Weekly analysis of blood glucose was carried on whole blood and analysis of amino acids in plasma. The flows of amino acids (AA) and dry matter (DM) at the abomasum were measured during both sampling periods using intra-ruminally infused markers. Live weight and faecal egg count (FEC) were recorded weekly. Diurnal variation in AA flow at the abomasum peaked between 12:00 and 15:00 h and was greatest in S ewes. Flows of AA, including DAPA, were increased by supplementation by 16%, while sulphur amino acids (SAA) were the most enhanced (by 21%) and flows of leucine, lysine, glutamine and aspartate were increased by about 20%. There were significant time effects in rumen and abomasal pH (P &lt; 0.01; in both cases in both periods) reflecting increase in pH after 09.00 h. During Period II, rumen pH in digesta of C ewes was significantly higher (P &lt; 0.001) than that of S ewes (6.7 &#177; 0.05 vs 6.4 &#177; 0.05 for C and S ewes, respectively).  Plasma AA concentrations (P &lt; 0.01) were lower in S ewes 21 days after parturition, but similar (P &gt; 0.05) to those of C ewes at other times. Forty-three days after lambing (after cross over), the order was reversed as plasma methionine and cysteine concentrations of C ewes became low (P &lt; 0.05). These changes in plasma AA were accompanied by changes in body condition score between day 23 and 70 post-partum whereby C ewes lost more body condition than S ewes. There was evidence for a lower FEC in S ewes, being 46 vs. 670 epg, respectively for S and C groups (P = 0.08) 21 days after anthelmintic treatment. There were higher (P &lt; 0.05) blood glucose levels in C compared to S ewes at day +35 relative to lambing which was reversed and significantly higher (P &lt; 0.01) for S ewes by day +56 from lambing (after treatments were reversed). There was no significant effect of treatment on live weight and lamb performance. There are limited data in amino acid supply on lactating ewes on pasture and the present study contributes additional information on the supply of amino acids at the abomasum. The prediction that flow rates that sulphur amino acids may have been enhanced to the greatest degree could be significant since sulphur amino acids are needed for the synthesis of glutathione for immune response. It can be calculated that supplementation to supply the quantities of S-amino acid at pasture would be needed, since it would not be possible for sheep to increase pasture intake to achieve similar S-amino acid flow. Increase in bypass amino acids in S ewes at certain times in the day probably suggests influence by protein supplementation at certain times of the grazing cycle. Reduced plasma free amino acids at day +21 relative to lambing, may indicate sparing of body protein breakdown by protein supplementation. However, the difference in blood glucose on day 35 and day 56 may indicate re-adjustment of hormonal settings, responsible for nutrient partitioning. The last study (Chapter 6) used ewes during the peri-parturient period on pasture. Eighty pregnant ewes were allocated into four groups balanced for anticipated number of lambs. Group 1 had a high body condition score (BCS) of 4.0 which was maintained throughout pregnancy by pasture allowance (HM; n = 20). Group 2 (n= 40) had medium body condition (BCS 3.0) and were split into two subgroups; one was offered pasture to allow gain of condition (MH; n = 20) and the second allowed to lose condition by offering a low grazing allowance (ML; n = 20). Group 3 were thin ewes (BCS 2.4) and pasture allowance was designed to maintain this condition (LM; n = 20). These feeding regimes were maintained for 3 weeks from week -8 of pregnancy. During week -5 to -4 all ewes were acclimatized to a protein supplement (60 g/d). A glucose tolerance test (GTT) was conducted during week -4 after which half of the ewes in each group were offered a protein supplement at the rate of 500 g/d, creating &#8211;S and &#8211;NS groups. During wk -2, a second GTT was carried out. Animals were treated with an anthelmintic 3 wks before lambing, and were then challenged with a dose of 10 000 Teladorsagia circumcincta larvae on weeks -2 and -1 relative to lambing. Weekly recording of FEC, live weight and body condition was carried out. Lambs were weighed within 24 h of birth and again at 44 and 65 d of age. Computed tomography body scanning was carried out on ewes at weeks -8, -3 and +8 relative to lambing. There were no differences (P &gt; 0.05) in lamb performance due to body condition or protein supplementation. FEC of all groups was low (&#8776; 9 peg) and there was no (P &gt; 0.05) significant difference between ewes of different body condition or due to effects of protein supplementation. Ewes bearing/bearing multiple lambs had the highest FEC at day -32 and +12 relative to lambing, which was significant (P &lt; 0.05) on the latter date. There were no significant effects of supplementation on parasite status.  There were differences in basal plasma glucose concentration between groups (P &lt; 0.001), being highest in HM/S and least in ML/NS ewes and was generally higher (P &lt;0.001) during GTT 2 than GTT 1. Ewes carrying a single foetus had higher (P &lt;0.001) basal glucose than those carrying multiple lambs (2.2 vs. 1.7 mmol/L, respectively). Other plasma glucose response indexes were similar (P &lt;0.05) between groups. There were differences in insulin responsiveness between groups (P &lt; 0.001), being highest in MH/S and least in ML/S ewes. Insulin responsiveness tended (P = 0.06) to be lower during GTT 1 than GTT 2, but was higher (P &lt; 0.01) in ewes carrying singles than multiples. There was tendency for higher though non-significant, basal insulin concentrations in HM ewes. Insulin trends over time after glucose infusion suggest greater insulin response at GTT 1. Basal insulin was not correlated with CT muscle weight. Despite differences in body muscle mass at the start of the trial and differences induced by nutrition during late pregnancy, positive gains in muscle mass occurred during early pregnancy and muscle mass was similar in all groups by day 56 of lactation. Animals with greatest fat content at parturition (HM) mobilised the greatest amount and those with least fat (LM) deposited fat during lactation. Further experimentation may consider the use of the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp approach to more precisely estimate whether hormonal re-setting through insulin resistance may be involved in relaxation of immunity during the peri-parturient period.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fertility</field><field name="subject">urea</field><field name="subject">embryo</field><field name="subject">dairy cows</field><field name="subject">ewe</field><field name="subject">pasture</field><field name="subject">peri-parturient</field><field name="subject">protein</field><field name="subject">cytokines</field><field name="subject">immunity</field><field name="subject">insulin</field><field name="subject">glucose</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1571</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transition from subsistence farming to commercial agriculture in Quang Binh Province, Vietnam</field><field name="creator">Quan, Truong Tan</field><field name="description">The purpose of the study was to investigate how farmers in Quang Bing Province, Vietnam have been making the transition from subsistence farming to commercial agriculture. This process began in 1986 when the Vietnam economy changed from central planning to a market orientation.  The research strategy was based on case study analysis of two communes in each of three agro-ecological zones, defined as coastal, plains and mountains. Within each commune there were six embedded household case studies, i.e 36 in total.  Case studies were selected purposively to capture diversity of agro-ecological zones, market access and communications, wealth and income status, and ethnic communities. Households were interviewed twice; first in either late 2006 or early 2007, and again in late 2008. The study was approached using a constructivist paradigm and a lens of livelihood analysis, focusing on resources, institutions, interventions and the dynamics of change. Particular attention was given to the development of markets (inputs, outputs, land, labour and credit) and supply chain factors. Separate measures of commercialisation were constructed based on outputs and inputs, and at the level of both individual activities and the overall household.  Investigations were informed by existing theory, but no hypotheses were tested. Instead, the research focused on emergent patterns and insights, and the enrichment and modification of existing theory.  A review of literature indicated that the transition from subsistence farming to commercial agriculture in Vietnam was different from other countries on account of the specific combination of low technology agriculture, typical of much of developing Asia, combined with the transformation from a centrally planned economy to a market orientation as occurred in Central and Eastern European countries.  At commune level, the key determinants of commercialisation were strong physical connections to markets, with good road access being paramount. Once all weather road access for motorised vehicles was available, then rapid commercialisation occurred. Supply chains typically developed faster for outputs than inputs. New technologies that increased the yield of basic food crops, and facilitated by Government and NGO programs, led to the release of land resources no longer required for meeting food security needs. Households retained their production of food crops that provided food security, and added additional cash earning activities.  At the level of individual households, the commercialisation process was led by entrepreneurial families who perceived opportunities relating to profitable activities, and combined this with hard work. Often these opportunities were linked to what they had observed or learnt elsewhere. Once first movers took up a new technology, others observed and followed. There were many enabling factors, such as access to land, access to capital, and access to credit.  However, none of these could be considered a determinant, in that the absence of any one factor did not by itself preclude successful commercialisation.  Absence of an active male worker was a major constraint to commercialisation, as was lack of necessary crop and livestock skills. There was evidence that income disparities were increasing between the wealthy and the poor.  Output commerciality across all households averaged 88 % in 2008 and was higher for wealthy households (95 %) than poor households (83 %). All households still produced their own food crops, but these crops had low market values and hence had a low impact on the output commerciality index. Output commerciality measured in percentage terms obscured that wealthy families had net incomes almost 13 times greater than poor households.  A major theoretical insight was that key commercialisation factors are multiple and context dependent. Accordingly, there is a need in any investigation for a holistic approach, based on a livelihood framework that incorporates the complexities associated with the development of markets, as well as giving consideration to the range of interventions and institutional policies that impact on livelihood development.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">subsistence farming</field><field name="subject">commercial agriculture</field><field name="subject">Quang Binh</field><field name="subject">Vietnam</field><field name="subject">transition</field><field name="subject">commercial-based sustainable livelihood framework</field><field name="subject">case studies</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300900 Land, Parks and Agriculture Management::300901 Farm management, rural management and agribusiness</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370100 Sociology::370108 Rural Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1557</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bioavailability of cadmium, copper, nickel and zinc in soils treated with biosolids and metal salts</field><field name="creator">Black, Amanda</field><field name="description">It is widely accepted that bioavailability, rather than total soil concentration, is preferred when assessing the risk associated with metal contamination. Despite this, debate continues on what constitutes a bioavailable pool and how to best predict bioavailability, especially in relation to crop plants. The overall aim of this thesis was to assess and validate measures of cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni) and zinc (Zn) bioavailability in a range of soils amended with metal salts and biosolids. Six potential measures of bioavailability were investigated and compared: total metal; 0.04 M EDTA extraction; 0.05 M Ca(NO&#8323;)&#8322; extraction; soil solution extracted using rhizon probes; effective solution concentration (CE) determined using diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT); and modelled free ion activities (WHAM 6.0). These were compared to shoot metal concentrations obtained from plants grown in three soils with contrasting properties treated with biosolids and metal salts. The first study involved a wheat seedling (Triticum aestivum) assay carried out under controlled environmental conditions on incubated soils treated with metal salts and biosolids. Results showed that the presence of biosolids resulted in increases of DOC, salinity, Ca and Mg in soil solution as well as total concentrations of Cu and Zn, dry matter was also adversely affected by increased levels of salinity. The addition of biosolids did not significantly alter the extractability or solubility of Cd, Cu, Ni and Zn although concentrations of Cd in shoots were significantly lower in plants grown in biosolids amended soils compared with unamended soils. The second study involved a field experiment that used 20 cm diameter by 30 cm deep soil monoliths of the same three soils treated with metals and biosolids, and perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) was grown for 24 months. Results revealed the addition of biosolids significantly increased the amount of DOC, salinity, Ca and Mg in solution. The presence of biosolids also significantly altered the bioavailability of Cd, Cu, Ni and Zn, as measured by soil solution, CE and free ion activity. However, this change had little effect on plant metal uptake. The length of time following treatment application had the greatest effect on soil chemistry and metal availability, resulting in pH decreases and increases in DOC, soil solution salinity, Ca and Mg. The free ion activities of each metal increased with time, as did soil solution Cd and Zn and CE-Cu, with results for Zn indicative of migration through the soil profile with time. Plant uptake of Ni and Zn also changed with time. Nickel concentrations in shoots decreased, while concentrations of Zn in shoots increased. The findings from the two studies demonstrated that biosolids increased the amount of DOC, salinity, Ca and Mg present in soil solution. In the lysimeter study measures of metal availability were affected in soils amended with biosolids, but this did not effect shoot concentrations. The overall predictive strengths of the six potential measures of bioavailability was investigated using results from the previously described experiments and related studies carried out by ESR and Lincoln University using nine different soils amended with combinations of biosolids and metal salts. Of the four metals Ni provided the strongest correlations between metal bioavailability and shoot concentrations, with 0.05 M Ca(NO&#8323;)&#8322; extraction giving the strongest relationship for Ni concentrations in shoots (r&#178; = 0.73). This suggests that the solubility of Ni is highly indicative of shoot concentrations and that Ca(NO&#8323;)&#8322; is a robust measure of Ni bioavailability. In addition Ca(NO&#8323;)&#8322; provided the best estimate of Zn bioavailability (r&#178; = 0.65), and CE-Cd provided the best measure of Cd bioavailability, although it could only describe 47 % of shoot Cd concentration. Results for Cu were typical of previously described studies as assays of Cu availability are almost always poorly correlated with shoot concentrations, with total Cu having the strongest relationship (r&#178; = 0.34). Methods based on the extractability and solubility of Cu in soils were poor indicators of Cu concentration in shoots. Overall, the addition of biosolids did not alter the outcome of these bioavailability assays, and results indicated that total metal concentrations present in the soils and biosolids matrix, plus length of time since soil treatment, had a greater affect on metal bioavailability.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bioavailability</field><field name="subject">soils</field><field name="subject">cadmium</field><field name="subject">copper</field><field name="subject">nickel</field><field name="subject">zinc</field><field name="subject">ryegrass</field><field name="subject">wheat</field><field name="subject">biosolids</field><field name="subject">Triticum aestivum L.</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300100 Soil and Water Sciences::300103 Soil chemistry</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300100 Soil and Water Sciences::300102 Soil biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1561</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors influencing the occurrence of stinging jellyfish (Physalia spp.) at New Zealand beaches</field><field name="creator">Pontin, David R.</field><field name="description">Individuals of the cnidarian genus Physalia are a common sight at New Zealand beaches and are the primary cause of jellyfish stings to beachgoers each year. The identity of the species and the environmental factors that determine its presence are unknown. Lack of knowledge of many marine species is not unusual, as pelagic invertebrates often lack detailed taxonomic descriptions as well as information about their dispersal mechanisms such that meaningful patterns of distribution and dispersal are almost impossible to determine. Molecular systematics has proven to be a powerful tool for species identification and for determining geographical distributions. However, other techniques are needed to indicate the causal mechanisms that may result in a particular species distribution. The aim of this study was to apply molecular techniques to the cnidarian genus Physalia to establish which species occur in coastal New Zealand, and to apply models to attempt to forecast its occurrence and infer some mechanisms of dispersal. Physalia specimens were collected from New Zealand, Australia and Hawaii and sequenced for Cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) and the Internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1). Three clans were found: a Pacific-wide clan, an Australasian clan and New Zealand endemic clan with a distribution confined to the Bay of Plenty and the East Coast of the North Island. Forecasting Physalia occurrence directly from presence data using artificial neural networks (ANN) proved unsuccessful and it was necessary to pre-process the presence data using a variable sliding window to reduce noise and improve accuracy. This modelling approach outperformed the time lagged based networks giving improved forecasts in both regions that were assessed. The ANN models were able to indicated significant trends in the data but would require more data at higher resolution to give more accurate forecasts of Physalia occurrence suitable for decision making on New Zealand beaches.  To determine possible causal mechanisms of recorded occurrences and to identify possible origins of Physalia the presence and absence of Physalia on swimming beaches throughout the summer season was modelled using ANN and Na&#970;ve Bayesian Classifier (NBC). Both models were trained on the same data consisting of oceanographic variables. The modelling carried out in this study detected two dynamic systems, which matched the distribution of the molecular clans. One system was centralised in the Bay of Plenty matching the New Zealand endemic clan. The other involved a dynamic system that encompassed four other regions on both coasts of the country that matched the distribution of the other clans. By combining the results it was possible to propose a framework for Physalia distribution including a mechanism that has driven clan divergence. Moreover, potential blooming areas that are notoriously hard to establish for jellyfish were hypothesised for further study and/or validation.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">artificial neural networks</field><field name="subject">Physalia</field><field name="subject">Cnidaria</field><field name="subject">DNA barcoding</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270200 Genetics::270203 Population and ecological genetics</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270200 Genetics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1580</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of forest to pasture conversion on soil biological diversity and function</field><field name="creator">Lloyd, Davidson A.</field><field name="description">Recent declines in returns from primary forest products in New Zealand and projected increases in world food prices have led to the land-use conversion from plantation forest to pastoral farming in many lowland areas. After decades of forest cover the soils are in many cases less than adequate for pastoral farming, as they are acidic, with toxic levels of exchangeable aluminum, and contain low levels of available nitrogen (N), very high carbon (C):N ratio, and are devoid of earthworms and structural integrity. Overcoming the major site limitations of low soil pH and available N was a major priority and a field experiment was established in April 2005 to determine the impact of various rates of lime and N in relation to pasture establishment and production. Concerns about the short and long-term effects of these inputs on biological soil quality gave rise to the present study. The effects of land-use change and establishment inputs were assessed by comparison of selected treatment plots with two adjacent reference sites (long-term pasture and a 60&#8211;year Pinus radiata forest) on the same soil type. The effects of lime and N on soil biological quality were investigated under field and controlled environment conditions by determination of: microbial community structure (phospholipid fatty acids - PLFA), microbial biomass (total PLFA), and microbial activity (dehydrogenase activity). Soil physical (percentage water-stable aggregates) and chemical (pH, and total C and N) properties were also determined. Similarly, the effects of earthworm addition on soil biological properties were explored in a short-term glasshouse pot experiment. The role of earthworms as indicators of soil biological quality in the field was assumed by nematodes and these were assessed in field trial plots and the reference sites mentioned above. Land-use change and applications of lime and N contributed to changing the microbial community structure determined by principal component analysis of transformed PLFA data. However, the effect of lime was more pronounced in the field, while N contributed most to changing microbial community structure in the glasshouse. Mean microbial activity in the field increased from 4 &#181;g dwt/hr without lime to 16 and 21 &#181;g dwt/hr where lime was applied at 5 and 10 tons/hectare (t/ha), respectively. Mean microbial activity in the field was markedly higher (7-fold) than in the glasshouse at similar rates of lime. Lime application also increased soil moisture retention in the field, mean gravimetric soil moisture increased from 0.33 in control plots to 0.38 and 0.39 in plots treated with 5 and 10 t/ha lime, respectively. Lime application was associated with greater soil aggregate stability. Soils from test plots treated with 5 and 10 tons/ha lime had 45-50% water-stable aggregates compared to 34% in treatments without lime. After 16 weeks in pots, earthworm treatments increased mean plant dry matter (DM)/pot by at least 19% above the control. The increase was attributed primarily to greater N mineralization in the presence of earthworms. For the duration of the trial the earthworm species tested (Apporectodea caliginosa and Lumbricus rubellus, individually or combined) did not affect any of the measured soil microbial properties. However, the survival rate of A. caliginosa was 83% compared to 25% for L. rubellus. The control not receiving any lime or N and plots treated with 10t/ha lime and 200 kgN/ha had similar nematodes species composition, comprising 40% each of bacterial and fungal feeding nematodes. They differed markedly from the reference sites as the forest soil was dominated by plant associated species (38%) and the long-term pasture had 44% plant parasitic nematodes. Accordingly, the soil food web condition inferred from nematode faunal analysis characterized all test plots as basal, stressed and depleted, while the forest soil was categorized as highly structured and fungal dominated. The findings of this thesis demonstrated that land-use change from forest to pasture can have significant impacts on soil biological properties, earthworms can contribute to pasture productivity even in the short term, and nematode faunal analysis is a robust and reliable indicator of soil biological quality.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">forest</field><field name="subject">pasture</field><field name="subject">land-use change</field><field name="subject">microbial diversity</field><field name="subject">phospholipid fatty acid</field><field name="subject">earthworms</field><field name="subject">nematodes</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300100 Soil and Water Sciences::300102 Soil biology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270708 Conservation and biodiversity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/711</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Empirical analysis of the effects of market response to bank loan announcements in the Hong Kong stock market</field><field name="creator">Chen, Qing</field><field name="description">This study will validate several key results from previous studies of bank loan announcement effects by using the data from Hong Kong market following the 1997 Asian crisis. Banks are believed to play a unique role in financial market which could effectively reduce the problem of information asymmetry and moral hazard. Banks could access borrowers&#8217; inside information which is not available to other participants. Thus bank loan announcements convey valuable information to the market, and market response of the stock price should be positive. However, because of the significant reform in both financial market and information market, the valuation of bank loan announcement conveyed need to be reconsidered. This study investigates whether banks are still &#8220;unique&#8221; in the financial market or whether they are like middlemen between borrowers and investors. Data used in this study is collected from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange Index, and a standard event study with the market model is applied in the research to conduct the empirical analysis. The results suggest bank loan announcements are associated with significantly higher positive abnormal returns than non-bank loan announcements. Based on the market model of event study, market response is found to be significantly positive for loan syndication, short maturity loan and borrower&#8217;s debt ratio, and negatively related to firm size and loan size. Bank loans with refinancing and capital expenditure and no specific purpose have significantly higher positive abnormal returns, and borrowers with property and industrial industry type have more significant positive abnormal returns compared to other industry type. The findings also suggest the Hong Kong stock market is efficient in both strong and semi-strong form for bank loan announcements. A strong evidence of information leakage problem is found for non-bank loan announcements. The results are generally consistent with the existing literature.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bank loan announcements</field><field name="subject">abnormal returns</field><field name="subject">information asymmetry</field><field name="subject">market efficiency</field><field name="subject">syndication</field><field name="subject">loan size</field><field name="subject">loan maturity</field><field name="subject">loan purpose</field><field name="subject">firm size</field><field name="subject">industry type</field><field name="subject">debt ratio</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350300 Banking, Finance and Investment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1205</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Perceptions of sustainability of dairy support land farmers : a case study investigation</field><field name="creator">Bennett, Michael Robert</field><field name="description">This project investigated the business, environmental and social sustainability of dairy farms that include dairy support land. Seventeen farmers were interviewed using Yin&#8217;s case study method (Yin, 2003). The interviewees were selected from a list provided during a series of focus groups done with rural professionals prior to continuing with the main body of the research. Those interviewed saw that the primary role of dairy support land is to protect the dairy farm from external factors. Dairy farms are vulnerable to externalities due to high fixed costs and the relationship between cow condition and milk production. The ability of dairy support land to manage externalities relates to quantity of feed grown, therefore feed grown is perceived as the most appropriate measure of performance. For dairy support land to be sustainable, it must be well resourced. On a fully resourced DSL unit, there will be time to plan and carry out essential tasks and environmentally important developments such as riparian fences and stockwater systems are likely to be in place. If the dairy support land unit is not fully resourced it will become a liability to the overall system as the supply of feed becomes unreliable, cows calve in poor condition and dairy farm staff and management are overextended. Poorly resourced dairy support land is also unlikely to have environmentally friendly developments in place. The case studies also demonstrated that the fundamentals of sustainability and practice remain constant across a variety of soil and climatic conditions in Canterbury and Southland.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dairy support land</field><field name="subject">perceptions of sustainability</field><field name="subject">practices</field><field name="subject">externalities</field><field name="subject">dairying</field><field name="subject">sustainability</field><field name="subject">Canterbury</field><field name="subject">Southland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300900 Land, Parks and Agriculture Management::300901 Farm management, rural management and agribusiness</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1219</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Management of a marine protected area by a local NGO in Honduras: its implications for local communities</field><field name="creator">Jimenez-Castro, Claudia</field><field name="description">This study explores the factors that influence the management of a protected area situated on private land as well as the implications of these factors in the interaction between the NGO and the communities associated with this area. The protected area, Marine National Monument Cayos Cochinos, is an archipelago surrounded by reefs in the Honduran Caribbean. This area is home to a highly heterogeneous population of fisherfolk communities &#8211;most are members of the Garifuna ethnic group&#8211; and wealthy Honduran and foreign landowners. This case study also comprises three fisherfolk communities outside the protected area who fish in Cayos Cochinos. Local fishermen in Cayos Cochinos are settled in community-owned areas; however, these settlements started by the occupation of private lands. Wealthy landowners have either individual land titles or shares of a firm owning four of the islands. The protected area was established through the initiative of this firm to protect the natural resources. This area is nominally co-managed by a local nongovernmental organisation (NGO) and two government agencies; however in practice it is managed solely by the NGO. This study discusses the influence of the nature of the Honduran legislation regarding protected areas and of the co-management agreement on the management of Cayos Cochinos. This research also shows that the management priorities of this protected area are only partially based on the Honduran government&#8217;s laws and regulations and the guidelines specific for this area. Lack of government participation in the co-management of the area, financial constraints, influences on the NGO of stakeholders in higher positions of power with respect to it, personal preferences of the NGO managers and issues regarding the communities&#8217; leadership, have all had an influence on the management priorities of the protected area since its constitution. The combined effect of these factors has influenced the management of the NGO towards prioritising the natural resource conservation. This area is managed under a &#8216;people-out&#8217; conservation paradigm. The adoption of this paradigm has disadvantaged the fisherfolk communities inside and outside the protected area by restricting their access to the natural resources on which their livelihoods are highly dependent. However, the same situation has favoured the private landowners by limiting the access of the fisherfolk communities to the land owned by the former. The privileging of one community sector over another has created conflicts between the NGO and the fisherfolk communities. However, these conflicts have been fuelled by other factors such as the steady contesting of the land titles over the territories occupied by the latter, and by the support that external organisations have given to the latter at the expense of the original owners of the land. This research suggests that local NGOs in charge of the management of natural protected areas might have limited capacity to abide by national conservation and sustainable development priorities due to the likelihood to be influenced by external forces with different priorities.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">non-governmental organisation (NGO)</field><field name="subject">communities</field><field name="subject">protected area</field><field name="subject">conservation</field><field name="subject">management</field><field name="subject">power</field><field name="subject">marine protected area</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300900 Land, Parks and Agriculture Management</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science::300801 Environmental management and rehabilitation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1237</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Escaping the rhetoric: a Mongolian perspective on participation in rural development projects</field><field name="creator">Berends, J.

While previous research has provided an ethnographic snapshot of participation in rural development projects, none has yet focused on Mongolia &#8211; a post-socialist nation that receives significant amounts of foreign aid. To gain a holistic picture of 'participation', this study explores: how stakeholders understand participation; what stakeholders perceive and prioritise as the benefits of participation; and which factors motivate or inhibit participation. This study's methodology involved an inductive, qualitative approach with a multiple case study design. Three Mongolia rural development projects, each with objectives of poverty-reduction and participation, were selected from three different development organisations and interviews were conducted with different stakeholder groups: development organisation managers, field staff, and local people of the project sites (participants and non-participants). The results of this study revealed a dominant or 'Mongolian' understanding of 'participation' existed across the various stakeholders: 'Participation is local contributions of group labour and information for material benefits, within a top-down authoritarian structure (including local institutions)'. This understanding arose from development organisations' emphasis on efficiency and sustainable results and local people engaging with the project as a normative livelihood strategy. In this study, given the incidence and nature of rural poverty, stakeholders prioritised the tangible benefits of participation over the intangible and linked empowerment to tangible outcomes. Development staff prioritised the longer-term tangible benefits (food security and income), and to ensure their sustainability sub-benefits were provided sequentially, mental capital, then physical capital, with social capital built naturally through the project's formal and informal activities. In contrast, local people prioritised the manifest tangible benefits, which initially meant the physical capital gifted by the project, and then later the material outcomes of the new livelihoods. While development staff envisioned intangible benefits as important in their own right, for Mongolian participants they were a gateway to the project's tangible outputs. Four prominent intangible benefits emerged: knowledge/mental investment, 'power within', social connections, and involvement in groups &#8211; each uniquely valuable within the Mongolian context. The results also showed that the factors which shaped participation reflected the unique circumstances of rural Mongolia and each project's activities. Economic rationality appeared as the foundational incentive for participation, followed by social motivations that included: widespread, detailed, and positive information about the project; the perceived power, leadership, and organisational skills of the development organisation; a deep personal relationship between development staff and local people; and rurally-oriented seminars and workshops. The major barriers to 'Mongolian' participation included: a lack of opportunity or incentive to participate; the current situation of poverty and unemployment; Mongolia's governance structures, culture, and history; the geography of isolation; the development organisation&#8223;s procedures; and the dynamics of project 'groups'. Moreover, the results indicated that projects which require higher levels of local participation, i.e. decision-making, may face more fundamental obstacles because of the cultural value placed upon top-down, authoritarian leadership and a prevailing mentality of dependence. Based on these results, this study concludes that interpretations of participation arise out of field-level realities, and thus the level of participation incorporated into development projects needs to reflect the local culture, context, and history.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">participation</field><field name="subject">barriers</field><field name="subject">benefits</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="subject">development</field><field name="subject">empowerment</field><field name="subject">grass roots</field><field name="subject">Mongolia</field><field name="subject">motivation</field><field name="subject">rural development</field><field name="subject">social capital</field><field name="subject">projects</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::220000 Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1307</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of vine vigour and canopy ideotype on fruit composition and aroma of Sauvignon Blanc</field><field name="creator">Sutherland, M. J.</field><field name="description">The influence of soil texture on canopy growth, vine yield, and fruit composition of Sauvignon blanc were assessed on a mature vineyard from the Rapaura area in Marlborough. The subject vines were mature Sauvignon blanc in a commercial vineyard trained to four cane VSP and planted with a north south orientation. Row and vine spacings were typical of the area at 3m x 1.8m. Four areas of different soil texture were identified using trunk circumference measurements, visual assessment of the surface soil and aerial photographs to identify changes in vine growth. Soil pits were excavated at a later date to determine root numbers and record the soil texture in the different areas. Two crop treatments were imposed on half of the plots at approximately 50% veraison: unthinned crop and 50% crop. A shading treatment was also imposed at 50% veraison where three sets of tagged shoots had bunches that were exposed to sunlight, bunches that had some natural shading from leaves or bunches that had paper bags fastened over each to provide a completely shaded environment. Vine vegetative vigour for each plot was assessed during the growing season using the Point Quadrat method and at pruning using bud counts and pruning weights. Thirty berry samples were collected from the 32 plots and analysed weekly for soluble solids and berry weight. Harvest of bunches from the tagged shoots occurred on two different dates with the first harvest picked when fruit from one soil and crop treatment had reached 21 &#176;Brix. The second picking took place just before the commercial harvest, which coincided with last soil and crop treatment reaching 21 &#176;Brix. Bunches from each tagged shoot were weighed, frozen and later analysed for soluble solids, pH, organic acids, and methoxypyrazines.  Vines on very stony textured soils had small trunk circumferences with a high root density and yield to pruning weight ratio compared to those growing on deep silt soils. Vines on deep silt soils had more vigorous canopies with large shoots and a higher leaf layer number. The target soluble solids was reached first by the vines on the very stony plots despite the higher crop load with soil texture appearing to be a dominant factor by influencing the time of flowering. Cluster shading decreased soluble solids, consistent with other studies, whilst crop thinning resulted in an earlier harvest. This was contrary to popular opinion that crop thinning at veraison would have no impact on sugar accumulation. pH and organic acids were unaffected by shading or bunch thinning. Vines growing on deep silt soils had a significantly higher level of total acidity and malic acid than those on the stony soils. At harvest, methoxypyrazine levels were very low compared to previously reported figures for Marlborough, which may have been a result of sample preparation. IBMP was significantly higher on deep silt soils, however, with no impact from the shading or crop treatment. The findings are consistent with the hypothesis that IBMP synthesis may be increased by the number of leaves surrounding bunches (Roujou de Boubee, 2003). The results suggest that soil texture plays a dominant role in influencing Sauvignon blanc flavour and aroma and due consideration should be given to vineyard layout and site selection prior to new plantings taking place.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sauvignon Blanc</field><field name="subject">soil texture</field><field name="subject">fruit exposure</field><field name="subject">crop load</field><field name="subject">canopy</field><field name="subject">soluble solids</field><field name="subject">organic acids</field><field name="subject">methoxypyrazines</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany::270402 Plant physiology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::210000 Science-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1270</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Resource efficiency of the ski industry in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Reiser, Axel</field><field name="description">Skiing and snowboarding are popular recreation activities in New Zealand, as well as constituting important components of the winter tourism product. The 2001 snow season witnessed record visitor numbers. Skier days have increased by more than 10% compared with the previous year to 1.254 million. The traditionally &#8220;nature related&#8221; activity of skiing, however has increasingly often been discussed in the light of excessive resource consumption and pollution of alpine environments. Since no research on resource efficient management of ski fields has been undertaken in New Zealand, this study examined environmental awareness and actions of ski field managers, resource consumption benchmarks (water and energy use, solid waste production), along with resource use related visitor behaviour. Two separate surveys were undertaken to collect relevant information from ski field managers and ski field visitors. While a census of managers across New Zealand was conducted with a mail-back questionnaire (all 27 ski fields were contacted, response rate 44%), the visitor survey was undertaken on-site at six selected ski fields in Canterbury, South Island (total responses: N=259). Analysis of the survey results showed that managers generally acted to protect the environment and resources, however, at different levels for the various indicators measured. Energy use and air pollution were rarely perceived to be environmentally important. Accordingly, only few actions were undertaken to reduce energy use. This is surprising, since energy consumption proved to be a major feature of ski field management. Given the additionally large amounts of water consumed (mainly for snowmaking) and solid waste produced on the mountain, skiing has to be classified as a resource intensive activity. Resource consumption is intensified further, when the impacts associated with tourists being transported to, and from, the mountain are considered. Energy use for &#8220;ski trip transport&#8221; within New Zealand is two times larger (180 MJ) than energy use associated with ski field infrastructure use (90 MJ) on a per skier day basis. There are several options to improve the environmental performance of ski fields, ranging from modernising equipment, optimising snowmaking and providing efficient transport alternatives. Additionally, increased cooperation between ski field managers, local governments and research institutes could potentially result in environmentally smarter operational practices. Internationally, New Zealand&#8217;s ski areas compare relatively well, mainly because of limited on-mountain entertainment and accommodation development, which keeps resource consumption and pollution low compared with European and North American ski fields. However, this research also indicated that New Zealand&#8217;s ski field visitors increasingly demand facilities and services similar to those overseas, which in turn may result in larger environmental impacts. New Zealand is generally believed to be a green and nature-related destination and its ski areas still blend well into the natural environment. Hence, there is some potential for the New Zealand ski industry to develop a unique product in such a way that it is both, sustainable and distinguishable from other international markets.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">snow sport</field><field name="subject">resource consumption</field><field name="subject">resource efficiency</field><field name="subject">downhill skiing</field><field name="subject">snowboarding</field><field name="subject">benchmarking</field><field name="subject">environmental awareness</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350500 Tourism</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science::300804 Environmental impact assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1266</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Foraging strategies of Southern Royal Albatrosses, Diomedea epomophora, Campbell Island during incubation</field><field name="creator">Troup, Christina</field><field name="description">Among the species of Diomedea albatrosses, diverse foraging strategies during breeding have been described, indicating species differences in foraging ecology and behaviour. Foraging strategies of Southern Royal Albatrosses, Diomedea epomophora (SRA) breeding on Campbell Island were studied in January &#8211; early February 1999 during the latter half of incubation. Movements and activity of ten birds were monitored using satellite transmitters and wet-dry activity recorders. Three birds from a pilot tracking study in February 1997 were also included in some analyses. Foraging strategies, zones used, factors influencing the duration of foraging trips, and the influence of wind conditions were investigated. Foraging activity took place at sites with bathymetric characteristics associated with high productivity: outer shelf and shelf-break zones, with a concentration of activity on a shelf contour south of the Snares Islands. This is in contrast to Wandering (D. exulans) and Gibson&#8217;s (D. gibsoni) albatrosses, typically deep oceanic foragers, but is similar to Northern Royal Albatross (D. sanfordi). The maximum distance of foraging trips from the colony was 1250 kilometres (mean 584 +351(SD)). This was closer than for incubating Wandering and Gibson&#8217;s Albatrosses but more distant than for Northern Royal Albatross from the Otago Peninsula. The mean duration of 77 foraging trips from 52 nests was 10.11 days for females and 8.76 for males (ns). Foraging trips became shorter as incubation progressed. Foraging trips were shorter, but not significantly so, when the median wind speed throughout the foraging trip was higher. No significant relationship was found between bird mass and duration of foraging trips. The mean cumulative distance flown by the ten birds tracked in 1999 was 4262 km + 1318 (SD). Eight of the ten SRA employed a &#8216;commute, forage, commute&#8217; foraging strategy, and the other two alternated short bouts of commuting and foraging. Commuting phases were characterised by rapid directional flight with a straight-line distance (range) of 180 km to 800 km between positions 24 hours apart. Foraging phases were characterised by a range of less than 180 km per 24 hour interval and frequent tight turns. Displacement rate between successive uplinks was significantly higher during commuting phases (28.6 kph + 1.93 SE) than foraging phases (15.1 kph + 1.4 SE). Wind strength and direction influenced the timing of the return commute to the colony. SRA covered greater distances at more favourable wind angles relative to flight track (broad reach and close reach) than in head, tail or direct side winds. Birds of low mass (&lt; 8kg) made fewer landings in winds above 40 kph than in lighter winds, whereas heavier birds had a similar level of landing activity across all wind speed bands. One bird was delayed for several days by light winds, and another flew off course during strong winds. Two birds exploited the same window of wind conditions to return to the colony, each flying a similar course in both timing and route. These results define the foraging strategies of SRA during incubation, and demonstrate the influence of wind conditions and other factors on the overall duration of foraging trips and on the timing of commuting and foraging phases.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Diomedea epomophora</field><field name="subject">Southern Royal Albatross</field><field name="subject">foraging strategies</field><field name="subject">foraging behaviour</field><field name="subject">incubation</field><field name="subject">body weight</field><field name="subject">satellite tracking</field><field name="subject">wind</field><field name="subject">foraging trip duration</field><field name="subject">albatross</field><field name="subject">Campbell Island</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270706 Life histories (incl. population ecology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1273</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Determining seed vigour in selected Brassica species</field><field name="creator">Leeks, C. R. F.</field><field name="description">Variables for the accelerated ageing (AA) test, methods for reducing fungal contamination during the AA test, using the conductivity test as a vigour test, the effect of seed size on seed vigour and the relationship between laboratory test results and field perfonnance in selected Brassica spp were investigated. In the first experiment, three seed lots of turnip rape hybrid (B. rapa x campestris), turnip (B. campestris) and forage rape (B. napus); and seven seed lots of Asian rape (B. napus), six seed lots of Asian kale (B. oleraceae var. alboglabra L.) and five seed lots of choisum (B. rapa var. pekinensis) with germinations above 90% were aged at two different temperatures (41 and 42&#176;C &#177; 0.3&#176;C) and three ageing times (24, 48 and 72 &#177; 15 minutes). The second experiment was divided into three sections. In the first, the same seed lots and species were aged at one temperature (41&#176;C) and time (72 h), but either 40 ml of saturated salts; KCl (83%RH), NaCl (76%RH), NaBr (55%RH); or distilled water (96%RH) were used as the ageing solutions. In the second, one turnip rape hyprid seed lot was aged at three temperatures (41, 42 and 45&#176;C) and two times (72 and 96h), again using the three saturated salts and distilled water as ageing solutions. In the third, three turnip rape hybrid seed lots and three Asian kale seed lots were surface sterilised (1 % sodium hypochlorite) prior to ageing at one temperature (41&#176;C) and time (72 h). In the third experiment, the same species and seed lots used in experiment one at their original seed moisture content (SMC) were tested for conductivity after soaking in deionised water for 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 h. They were then re-tested after the SMC had been adjusted to 8.5%. In the fourth experiment, three seed lots of forage rape and three seed lots of Asian kale were graded into three seed size categories; large (retained on a 2.0 mm screen), medium (retained on a 1.7 mm screen) and small (passed through a 1.7 mm screen). Graded seeds were then tested for standard germination, AA (41&#176;C/48 h) and conductivity (measured at 16 and 24 h). In the final experiment, the relationships between laboratory tests for the six species (each consisting of three seed lots), field emergence from three sowings, and cold room emergence were evaluated. Both time and temperature influenced post-AA germination. Increasing the ageing period from 48 to 72 hours at 41&#176;C, and 24 to 48 hours at 42&#176;C resulted in decreased mean germination percentage for all species but not always clear separation of seed lots. While there were sometimes few differences between ageing at 41&#176;C and 42&#176;C, the former is preferred because it is already the temperature used for other species. For Asian rape, choisum and turnip, the previously recommended testing conditions of 41&#176;C/72 h provided good seed lot separation, but for Asian kale and turnip rape hybrid, AA testing at 41&#176;C/48 h provided better results. Seed moisture content after ageing ranged from 29-37% depending on species. Fungal growth on seeds during the ageing period appeared to reduce post-ageing germination in some seed lots . Substituting saturated salts for distilled water did not stress seed lots in the AA test, due to the lowered RH%, the exception being seed lots 1210 and 1296. For forage and Asian species, seed lot germination mostly remained above 90% when aged for 72 h at lowered RH%. Increasing the ageing duration from 72 to 96 hours resulted in some decreases in post-AA germination but no clear separation of seed lots. Surface sterilising the seeds prior to the AA test resulted in a lower incidence of contaminant fungi which was associated with a lower percentage of abnormal seedlings. The conductivity test was mostly able to identify vigour differences among forage and Asian vegetable brassica seed lots. Differences in conductivity readings were observed among seed lots in all species. Increasing the period of imbibition resulted in increased conductivity from most seed lots but radicle emergence occurred after 16-20 h of imbibition. Variation was observed in the time to reach 95% maximum of the imbibition curve for most species. Conductivity readings at 16 h would avoid possible influences of radicle emergence on results. Adjusting the SMC to 8.5% resulted in reduced variation in conductivity among replicates of seed lots, due to a reduction in imbibition damage. Seed size had a significant effect on both post-AA germination and conductivity results. In forage rape, large size seeds had higher post-AA germination cf. medium cf. small size seeds. In Asian kale, large size seeds had higher post-AA germination compared with small size seeds. For both forage rape and Asian kale, large size seeds had lower conductivity readings cf. small size seeds. The correlation analyses demonstrated significant relationships between AA testing and field emergence parameters (percentage emergence, emergence index and emergence rate). Significant relationships were also observed between conductivity testing and these field emergence parameters. Based on the correlation analysis, AA testing at 41&#176;C/48 hand/or 42&#176;C/48 h could be recommended to be used as an AA test for turnip and Asian rape; and 41&#176;C/48 hand/or 41&#176;C/72 h for Asian kale and choisum. Based on the correlation analysis, conductivity testing at 16 h can be used to predict the field emergence potential of forage and Asian vegetable seed lots. Vigour tests were consistently able to provide better indicators of field perfonnance than the standard germination test, although these relationships did vary with the different field sowings.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Brassica</field><field name="subject">seedling vigour</field><field name="subject">fungal contamination</field><field name="subject">germination</field><field name="subject">field emergence</field><field name="subject">accelerated ageing</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300200 Crop and Pasture Production::300203 Plant improvement (selection, breeding and genetic engineering)</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300200 Crop and Pasture Production</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1274</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Change in juvenile justice policy: implications for rights and responsibilities</field><field name="creator">Winter, N.

The size and diversity of bacterial populations associated with the rhizospheres of grapevine rootstocks: 101-14, 5C, Schwarzmann and Riparia Gloire were evaluated. Dilution plating showed that total bacterial (P=0.012, P=0.005 for NA and KB, respectively) and fluorescent Pseudomonad (P=0.035) rhizosphere counts differed between rhizosphere and bulk soils but did not correlate with the differing susceptibilities of the rootstock varieties to black foot. No varietal differences were found for spore forming bacteria (P=0.201). SSCP banding patterns showed that species diversity was similar for most rootstocks, but that there were some differences in the composition of bacterial populations, probably attributable to vigour.         Some functional characteristics of the bacteria isolated from the rhizospheres of the most and least susceptible rootstock varieties were assessed to investigate their potential to suppress the pathogen. In dual culture, bacteria from Riparia Gloire, 101-14 and the control soil all had little ability to antagonise Cylindrocarpon destructans. However, they differed in their degrees of activity for glucanase (P=0.000), protease (P=0.001) and siderophores (P=0.000). In all tests, bacterial isolates from the rhizosphere of 101-14 had the largest number of active isolates (P&#8804;0.002); however, those from Riparia Gloire had the greatest degree of positive responses for the glucanase and siderophore assays. Bacterial isolates from the control soil produced few glucanases and no siderophores, but had the highest degree of protease activity. Bands excised and sequenced from SSCP gels frequently matched to other &#8216;uncultured bacteria&#8217; in GenBank, as well as to other bacterial phyla, classes and genera commonly isolated from soil and sediment samples. These included members of the Firmicutes, Proteobacteria (&#945;, &#948;, &#947;), Verrucomicrobia, Acidobacteria and Chromatiales.                             The pathogenicity of C. destructans and Fusarium oxysporum was investigated by inoculating soil containing wounded ungrafted rootstocks of 101-14, 5C, Schwarzmann and Riparia Gloire. Results indicated that F. oxysporum might be a more aggressive pathogen than C. destructans. Inoculation with F. oxysporum or C. destructans increased disease severity, P=0.018 and P=0.056, respectively at 0 cm. Rootstock variety influenced disease severity caused by C. destructans (P&lt;0.001) and F. oxysporum (P=0.090), with rootstocks 101-14 and 5C being most susceptible to C. destructans, and Riparia Gloire and Schwarzmann most susceptible to F. oxysporum. There was also an indication that inoculation with one pathogen increased plant susceptibility to the other, with increased F. oxysporum infection in the C. destructans inoculated treatments of Riparia Gloire and Schwarzmann (P&lt;0.05).          The effect of carbohydrate stress (leaf trimming) and inoculation on C. destructans disease severity, incidence, and rootstock rhizosphere bacterial populations was evaluated by inoculating the soil containing one year old plants of Sauvignon Blanc scion wood grafted to rootstocks 101-14 and Schwarzmann. Disease severity and incidence was similar for both Schwarzmann (8.4% and 29.3%, respectively) and 101-14 (14.9% and 31.0%, respectively). When data for the moderate and no stress treatments were combined, because their effects were similar, the disease severity was significantly higher for the highly stressed plants(P=0.043). Stress did not influence disease incidence (P=0.551). Infection occurred in the non-inoculated plants, but disease severity was higher in the plants inoculated with C. destructans than those that were not. Root dry weight of highly stressed plants was lower than in both the moderately stressed (P=0.000) and unstressed plants (P=0.003). An interaction between inoculation and stress (P=0.031) showed that inoculated and highly stressed plants had the lowest root dry weight but there was no effect of rootstocks (P=0.062). There was no significant effect of carbohydrate stress (P=0.259) or inoculation (P=0.885) on shoot dry weight. SSCP banding patterns showed that bacterial diversity was generally similar between rootstocks, but stress and inoculation altered rhizosphere bacterial communities.                             This study has demonstrated that functionality of grapevine rhizosphere bacteria do differ between grapevine rootstock varieties that have different susceptibilities to black foot disease, but that this role needs to be further investigated if more accurate and practically relevant conclusions are to be drawn.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cylindrocarpon destructans</field><field name="subject">Fusarium oxysporum</field><field name="subject">grapevine</field><field name="subject">rootstock</field><field name="subject">bacteria</field><field name="subject">rhizosphere</field><field name="subject">SSCP</field><field name="subject">pathogen</field><field name="subject">soil</field><field name="subject">carbohydrate</field><field name="subject">biocontrol</field><field name="subject">stress</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany::270403 Plant pathology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270300 Microbiology::270307 Microbial ecology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1305</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of the soils and agronomy of a high country catchment</field><field name="creator">Patterson, R.

A range of landscape - soil - climate - plant systems were identified, then analysed and the legume responses measured. By isolating cause and effect and appreciating the driving variables of each system, lessons learnt could be reliably and objectively transferred to the rest of the farm. Extrapolation to the balance of the property (15,150 ha) permitted immediate large-scale development and engendered confidence to lending institutions, Lands Department, catchment authorities and ourselves. Soil (land) cannot be well managed and conserved unless it is mapped reliably and its characteristics measured and interpreted by skilled observers (Cutler, 1977). Soil resource surveys, and their interpretation, are an essential ingredient of rational resource evaluation and planning. This thesis is a figurative and comparative survey and study of the soil catenary bodies, resident vegetation, legume establishment and pasture production characteristics of a 400 hectare catchment, in relation to, and as influenced by soil landscape unit, slope component, altitude, aspect and time. The inherent diversity in landform, soil properties and vegetation communities in a single catchment in the high country has not previously been fully studied or appreciated. This has lead to blanket recommendations for fertilizer, seed and management regimes both within and between properties and even regions. This study reports on the diversity of, yet predictable change in soil properties with slope position (upper, middle and lower) aspect and altitude in terms of both soil physical properties e.g. soil depth and water holding capacity and soil chemical properties such as pH, BS%, %P, %S, %N and %C. The composition of the resident vegetation and its differential response to oversowing and topdressing and subsequent change through time is reported and discussed. Finally an epilogue gives an insight into the problems and frustrations of farming practices in the high country from a motivation and personal perspective and political point of view that it is essential to come to terms with.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">agronomy</field><field name="subject">high country</field><field name="subject">pastoral farming</field><field name="subject">pasture production</field><field name="subject">Longslip Station</field><field name="subject">soils</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300200 Crop and Pasture Production::300205 Agronomy</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300900 Land, Parks and Agriculture Management::300903 Sustainable development</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300900 Land, Parks and Agriculture Management::300901 Farm management, rural management and agribusiness</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1315</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a mass rearing technique for the Tasmanian brown lacewing, Micromus tasmaniae Walker</field><field name="creator">Simeonidis, Andrew</field><field name="description">Aphids are one of the most important insect pests of greenhouse crops yet to be controlled by biological means. Broad spectrum chemical control is becoming increasingly difficult to use in integrated pest management programmes, therefore, there is a need for a suitable biocontrol agent to be mass reared and released. The Tasmanian brown lacewing, Micromus tasmaniae Walker is an aphid predator that is found commonly throughout Australasia and has suitable characteristics that make it a candidate for mass rearing. A technique for rearing M. tasmaniae was developed. Eggs of M. tasmaniae were reared in batches of 50, 100 and 200 in 20 litre clear plastic containers. The oat aphid, Rhopalosiphum padi L. was fed to the larvae. The results revealed that the highest initial egg density (200 eggs per container) produced the cheapest adults at 22 cents per adult. However, mass rearing adults was considered not practical because of the high production cost, although, mass production of eggs is considered to be economically viable. The cost of producing one egg was 0.015 cents. M tasmaniae was maintained in mass culture for six generations. Simple experiments were carried out to monitor the quality of laboratory-reared insects. The 'wild' insect was used as a quality standard and comparisons with laboratory-reared insect populations were made. The fecundity, development rates and tolerance to pirimicarb, a carbamate insecticide, were determined. Fecundity was found to decline with successive generations in mass culture. The lacewing development experiment indicated that larval stages of each generation suffered the highest mortality rate and that between 35-45% of individuals emerged as adults. The tolerance of adults to pirimicarb did not alter over five generations. Recommendations for improving the mass rearing of M. tasmaniae are discussed.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tasmanian brown lacewing</field><field name="subject">Micromus tasmaniae Walker</field><field name="subject">aphids</field><field name="subject">Rhopalosiphum padi L.</field><field name="subject">mass rearing</field><field name="subject">quality control</field><field name="subject">biological control</field><field name="subject">inundative release</field><field name="subject">greenhouses</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300300 Horticulture::300303 Plant protection (pests, diseases and weeds)</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology::270505 Entomology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1302</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An agronomic evaluation of subterranean clover cultivars</field><field name="creator">Scott, W.

Although white clover is the main legume species used for this purpose its production and persistence in the drier eastern areas of the South Island often leaves much to be desired. In such situations subterranean clover may provide a useful alternative. Subterranean clover has been a very useful species in the past and will probably continue to play an important role in the future, provided the most climatically adapted cultivars are grown. The aim of the field trials was to evaluate the productive performance of several subterranean clover cultivars in Canterbury. Because of the big influence of seed yield on subsequent production and persistence in annuals, this aspect was also investigated. The subterranean clover cultivars Geraldton, Yarloop, Woogenellup, Clare, Mt. Barker and Tallarook were evaluated under cutting in swards at two sites in Canterbury.</field><field name="date">1969</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">subterranean clover</field><field name="subject">Trifolium subterraneum L.</field><field name="subject">cultivars</field><field name="subject">seed yield</field><field name="subject">agronomy</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300200 Crop and Pasture Production::300205 Agronomy</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300200 Crop and Pasture Production::300203 Plant improvement (selection, breeding and genetic engineering)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1321</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Probing the interactions between iron nutrition, salinity and ultraviolet-B radiation on the physiological responses of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)</field><field name="creator">Wong, H. M.</field><field name="description">When plants are exposed to multiple environmental stress factors, one form of stress can affect the response to another stress. This study used seedlings of a new cultivar of wheat(Triticum aestivum L. cv. 1862), grown under factorial combinations of two levels of ultraviolet-B (UV-B)radiation, two salinity regimes and two levels of iron treatment in chelator-buffered nutrient solutions in a growth chamber. A number of morphological and physiological measurements were made. The accumulation of chlorophyll, UVabsorbing compounds and proline in shoots, as well as phytosiderophores (PSs) in root exudates were measured. Feed value measurements included crude protein, water-soluble carbohydrates, acid detergent fibre and Fe in shoots and roots. After 21 days of stress exposure, results showed that Fe deficiency and NaCl stress generally decreased plant growth and function as well as nutritive value, but increased plant biochemical protection traits such as proline accumulation (16.3 fold under salinity stress) and release of PSs (2.4 fold under Fe deficiency). Interestingly, UV-B radiation affected belowground parameters, inducing a 47% reduction in PS release, together with decreasing root DM by 9% and Fe concentration in roots by 7%. When Fe deficiency and NaCl stress were combined, the results showed a decrease in PS release by 3.5 fold compared to unstressed plants. UV-B radiation synergistically increased UV-absorbing compound levels in combination with Fe deficiency, compared to plants grown under optimal Fe levels. This stress combination also resulted in a cumulative effect by decreasing Fe concentration in shoots and roots. However, salt stress did not interact with UV-B radiation for any of the traits measured. In addition, some three-way interactions were noted, with the Fe x NaCl x UV-B stress combination slightly decreasing PS release and resulting in a cumulative effect by decreasing Fe concentration in roots. In conclusion, this study found that aboveground stress factors such as UV-B can affect important aspects of belowground plant function, and that Fe deficiency can interact with UV-B and salinity stress in modifying plant responses to either stress alone.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fe deficiency</field><field name="subject">NaCl stress</field><field name="subject">UV-B radiation</field><field name="subject">wheat</field><field name="subject">morphology</field><field name="subject">phytosiderophores</field><field name="subject">UV-absorbing compounds</field><field name="subject">proline</field><field name="subject">photosynthesis</field><field name="subject">chlorophyll</field><field name="subject">crude protein</field><field name="subject">water-soluble carbohydrates</field><field name="subject">acid detergent fibre</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::210000 Science-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1327</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Conservation, livelihoods and the role of tourism: a case study of Sukau village in the Lower Kinabatangan District, Sabah, Malaysia.</field><field name="creator">Fletcher, Charlotte Jane</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to examine conservation, livelihoods, and the role of tourism. The village of Sukau in the Kinabatangan District of Sabah, Malaysia, served as a case study.  The vital importance of the Lower Kinabatangan in wildlife conservation, coupled with the tourism potential of the region, underpinned the creation of the Kinabatangan Wildlife Sanctuary in 2005. The 26,000 hectare sanctuary is fragmented in nature and surrounded by palm oil plantations. Still, with the protection of these fragmented forested areas, Sukau has evolved into the &#8216;hub&#8217; of tourism in the Lower Kinabatangan. The majority of visitors come to Sukau for the opportunity to view the flagship species of the Kinabatangan Wildlife Sanctuary (orang-utan, Bornean pygmy elephant, proboscis monkey, and hornbills) in the wild.  Many of the local villagers own land which is still forested and serves as important ecological links between the fragmented protected areas. However many of the villagers plan to use their lands for smallholder palm oil farming in the future. This will further fragment the forested areas of the Wildlife Sanctuary, and will have severe implications for nature conservation and tourism in Sukau. The Sabah Tourism Master Plan (1996) stresses that for the tourism-conservation linkage to be effective in Sukau, the local community must benefit from tourism. If the locals of Sukau are able to depend on tourism as a livelihood option, then perhaps the forested areas of the Wildlife Sanctuary will not be further fragmented in the near future. This study will attempt to answer whether tourism is an effective alternative livelihood source for the locals of Sukau.  Predominantly qualitative research methods were used for this study. These included semi-structured interviews with the local villagers of Sukau, and informal interviews with key informants in the area. Structured questionnaires and interviews were also undertaken with lodges in and near the village. The information gathered from these sources was further strengthened by my own personal and participatory observations.  In 2006, 10 per cent of the population of Sukau, and 23 per cent of the estimated total workforce were directly employed in tourism. Results indicate that having tourism as a livelihood option has made the villagers more motivated to protect their environment. Yet the locals of Sukau disagree that their community benefits sufficiently from tourism, and smallholder palm oil farming is viewed as the more lucrative livelihood option.  The current financial crisis (2008-9) has complicated the likely contribution of tourism to livelihoods and conservation in the future. Nevertheless it is likely that both the palm oil and tourism industries will recover from the economic downturn, and consequently they will both continue to be future livelihood options for the villagers of Sukau. Therefore steps should be made to improve both industries for the benefit of livelihoods and nature conservation in Sukau. There are a number of potential ways in which tourism could be improved in Sukau to bring more benefits to the locals. If these suggested improvements occur, then the effectiveness of tourism as an alternative livelihood source for the locals of Sukau will be enhanced.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Malaysia</field><field name="subject">Sabah</field><field name="subject">Sukau</field><field name="subject">Kinabatangan Wildlife Sanctuary</field><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="subject">conservation</field><field name="subject">livelihoods</field><field name="subject">oil palm</field><field name="subject">local communities</field><field name="subject">home-stay</field><field name="subject">wildlife conflicts</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350500 Tourism</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300900 Land, Parks and Agriculture Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1339</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Recreation in the Greenstone and Caples Valleys: for whom and how?</field><field name="creator">Cessford, Gordon R.</field><field name="description">This study investigates issues of changing recreation use and management in the Greenstone and Caples Valleys. Its underlying research themes are the differing characteristics and activities of four distinct user-groups, how such differences could contribute to conflict in recreation use and management, and the implications of such for management. The conceptual framework used to deal with these issues is the Recreation Opportunity Spectrum (ROS), which is based upon the assumption that quality in recreation experiences and management is best achieved through provision of a range of recreation opportunities. This recognises that objective research input into recreation management cannot substitute for the ultimate subjectivity required in decision-making. Management has two roles here. First, to maintain and/or enhance the range of recreation opportunities availible. Second, to provide users with appropriate signals regarding the availibility of opportunities, and the acceptable norms of use and behaviour. Thus user choice of area and activities undertaken within becomes more a consequence of management action. This differs from most recreation management to date, which has tended to be in response to changing conditions (eg'demand-driven'). The absence of an equitable management approach results in selective reduction of opportunities for certain experiences, as evident from research into effects of conflict/crowding perceptions. In contrast, approaches such as the ROS emphasise management for such opportunities. On this basis and from research results, this study found that maintenance of experiences associated with angling and hunting opportunities in the study area, should be the basis for its management. These opportunities were exploited by relatively more experienced participants. For anglers in particular this was reflected by their characteristics of high activity specialisation. Greater experience and specialisation involved more specific resource requirements and norms of appropriate behaviour. Thus opportunities for hunting and angling in the study area were more susceptible to negative impacts from other uses and users. These impacts would be greatest for angling experiences. This would be more a consequence of perceived inappropriate behaviour by less specialised anglers than a consequence of physical crowding. For hunters these impacts would be primarily a result of concern about the increased presence of others on hunting management, rather than their actual presence. Experiences from the tramping and commercial guided walking opportunities availible are also important, but their participants were relatively less experienced and their recreation opportunities less unique in the region. In the context of an equitable regional ROS approach, there is greater flexibility for their provision elsewhere than there is for experiences from hunting and fishing opportunities. For maintenance of a spectrum of opportunities in the regional ROS, these hunting and angling opportunities should be emphasised in management decision-making. Within the study area itself, management for a regional ROS requires that the Greenstone and Caples Valleys be managed differently. It was clear that the Caples was perceived as providing more 'back-country'-type experience opportunities. In the regional ROS context, management should emphasise maintenance of such opportunities there. Along with this should be noted the greater preference for the CapIes by hunters, and for the Greenstone by anglers.</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">recreation use</field><field name="subject">recreation management</field><field name="subject">Greenstone Valley</field><field name="subject">Caples Valley</field><field name="subject">Recreation Opportunity Spectrum (ROS)</field><field name="subject">angling</field><field name="subject">hunting</field><field name="subject">tramping</field><field name="subject">trekking</field><field name="subject">crowding</field><field name="subject">surveys</field><field name="subject">recreation experience</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370400 Human Geography::370403 Recreation and leisure studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1365</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A management study of light land farming in Canterbury, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Taylor, N. W.</field><field name="description">By far the greatest proportion of the 1,150,000 acres of light land in Canterbury is found on the Canterbury Plain. This plain, originally covered by "low tussock" and of easy contour, was enticing to the early pioneers and became one of the earliest areas in New Zealand to be settled and farmed. Over the years it has developed into one of the most intensively farmed and productive areas of New Zealand. The dominant characteristic of the light land of Canterbury is undoubtedly the climate. The rainfall is reasonably evenly distributed over the year, but because of the low humidity, high temperatures and warm winds experienced over the summer in association with a free draining soil, the effectiveness of the rainfall over this period is drastically reduced. Consequently active plant growth is severely restricted for several months over the summer, and occasionally extends into the spring and/or autumn periods. The uncertainty as to the length and severity of this restricted growth period and the associated problem of equating the variable feed supply to the stock requirements, both within and between years, is the basic problem confronting the light land farmer. In spite of the environmental difficulties the productivity of the light land has increased several fold since early settlement. The original holdings on the Canterbury Plain were large with their boundaries on the rivers so as to provide access to water. Fine wool sheep were extensively grazed. However the introduction of refrigerated shipping and the extension of the water race system in the 1880's brought about a reduction in the size of holdings and a change in the pattern of farming. Dual purpose sheep were run and by the 1930's in response to favourable crop prices the system of diversified farming was firmly established. Unfortunately this system placed excessive emphasis on cash cropping, particularly on the light soils. Soil fertility was drained, structure severely damaged and subsequent pasture establishment and survival poor. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, with declining crop yields and with more favourable prices being obtained for fat lambs and particularly wool, the emphasis shifted from cropping to livestock farming. The carrying capacity however, was restricted by the reduced soil fertility and poor quality pastures and an environment in which climatic uncertainty tended to inhibit the rapid expansion of stock numbers.  The results of research work carried out at the various institutions in Canterbury over the years have undoubtedly promoted a greater understanding and appreciation of the problems confronting the farmer and the limitations of the particular environment in which he must operate. For example, pasture species more suited to the low fertility conditions and climate were introduced with spectacular results. The most significant of these was subterranean clover (introduced in the 1930s), noted for its ability to withstand the summer droughts, to regenerate in the autumn, and to provide an increased bulk of feed in the spring. Research work had shown that both lime and phosphate were necessary on the light land soils, if high pasture production and persistency was to be expected. Soil fertility increased subsequent to a reduction in the emphasis on cropping and with the higher levels of fertiliser application. High fertility pasture species (e.g. white clover and lucerne), were introduced and not only gave higher and more reliable total production but exhibited improved seasonal spread of production. Investigations into pasture diseases and stock health provided answers to specific problems. Research into flock management generally and in comparisons between the productivity of various sheep breeds indicated the most suitable type of flock and breed for the light land farmer. From this and other research work (in conjunction with the observations of leading farmers in the area), an efficient system of light land farming has gradually evolved in which many of the basic problems have been overcome and which has resulted in a raising of the carrying capacity of the light land from &#190; stock unit per acre in the 1930's to 3&#189;-4 stock units per acre at present. A central feature of this system (particularly at high stocking rates), is the high degree of flexibility incorporated in both the stock policies and feed supplies. Where the objective function is to maximise productivity over a period of years, it is essential to utilise the available spring feed efficiently while maintaining the ability to destock when confronted with feed shortages in the spring and early summer. Because of the fluctuating feed supply, which is characteristic of light land, the need to maintain feed reserves and to incorporate a high degree of flexibility in the stock policy is evident if the feed supply and demand are to be equated. In summary, the increased productivity can be attributed to two factors: (1) The ability to grow a greatly increased quantity of herbage per acre with an improved seasonal pattern of production. (2) A more efficient utilisation of the herbage produced. Unlike his counterpart in more reliable farming districts, the light land farmer operates in an environment of uncertainty. Yield uncertainty, particularly at high stocking rates, is the major problem to be overcome and this dictates very largely the system of farming adopted. Price uncertainty is also a significant aspect of light land farming because of the reliance on a limited range of products and the inability to diversify. In an analysis of physical and financial data collected from a sample of light land farms in Canterbury (1) there was no evidence to suggest that any one particular pattern of output was superior to all others. This result was surprising, but may reflect the uncertainty inherent in the environment. (1) For a full discussion on this, see Section 3.3.2(a). Alternatively it may infer that the actual patterns of production are less important than the managerial skill with which they are implemented. These results pointed to the need to explore more fully the following facets of light land management: (1) Given a developed farm, is there any one optimal pattern of production which (a) generates increased profit under average seasonal and price conditions, and (b) is subject to only small variations in profit under changing seasonal and price conditions? (2) Given the potential for the development and expansion of light land farming, how profitable is this from the individual farmer's viewpoint? If, in an evaluation of the first problem, high levels of productivity are shown to be profitable on existing well developed farms, then a reallocation of resources to obtain the desired combination should be recommended. An optimum combination of enterprises shown by such an analysis might well serve as the goal where an undeveloped potential still exists on a farm and where a reallocation and intensification in the use of resources is necessary if productivity is to be increased. In this study of light land farming two case farms have been used and although the results refer specifically to these particular farms, some conclusions of a general nature are possible. In Chapter II the physical characteristics of the area are described. In Chapter III a review of the research into specific problems relating to the management of light land is presented. This is followed in Chapter IV by an explanation of the technical principles of light land farming which have evolved. Chapter V is devoted to the comparison of some of the production possibilities open to the light land farmer using linear programming. An analysis of light land development 1s presented in Chapter VI, while Chapter VII presents the conclusions and summary of the study.</field><field name="date">1967</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Canterbury farms</field><field name="subject">Canterbury Plains</field><field name="subject">farm management</field><field name="subject">light land farming</field><field name="subject">dry land farming</field><field name="subject">stock production</field><field name="subject">feed supply</field><field name="subject">clover</field><field name="subject">pasture production</field><field name="subject">stock condition</field><field name="subject">sheep farming</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300200 Crop and Pasture Production</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300400 Animal Production</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1370</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Supporting multiple output devices on an ad-hoc basis in visualisation</field><field name="creator">Zha, Xi</field><field name="description">In recent years, new visualisation techniques and devices, such as remote visualisation and stereoscopic displays, have been developed to help researchers. In a remote visualisation environment the user may want to see visualisation on a different device, such as a PDA or stereo device, and in different circumstances. Each device needs to be configured correctly, otherwise it may lead to an incorrect rendering of the output. For end users, however, it can be difficult to configure each device without a knowledge of the device property and rendering. Therefore, in a multiple user and multiple display environment, to obtain the correct display for each device can be a challenge. In this project, the focus on investigating a solution that can support end users to use different display devices easily. The proposed solution is to develop an application that can support the ad-hoc use of any display device without the system being preconfigured in advance. Thus, end users can obtain the correct visualisation output without any complex rendering configuration. We develop a client-server based approach to this problem. The client application can detect the properties of a device and the server application can use these properties to configure the rendering software to generate the correct image for subsequent display on the device. The approach has been evaluated through many tests and the results show that using the application is a useful in helping end users use different display devices in  visualisation.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">visualisation</field><field name="subject">multiple display devices</field><field name="subject">client-server based application</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1391</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dosalsal, the floating ones : exploring the socio-cultural impacts of cruise ship tourism on Port Vila, Vanuatu residents, and their coping strategies</field><field name="creator">Niatu, A. L.</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to explore the socio-cultural impacts of cruise ship tourism on Port Vila residents and their coping strategies. The study was conducted in Port Vila over the months of June and July 2006. It employs the use of a qualitative research methodology, of participant observation, and semi-structured interviews with a range of tourism stakeholders, including the government, the church and chiefs, as well as a number of small businesses such as public transport operators, small indigenous tour operators and market vendors. These observations and interviews were conducted at the Mama&#8217;s Haus project, Centre Point Market Place, and the main wharf area. This thesis was initially aimed at exploring the strategies that the residents of Port Vila used to cope with the impacts caused by cruise ship tourism. As the research progressed, it become apparent from primary data collected that market vendors have not just adapted to the impacts of cruise ship tourism, but that the consequences of their adaptation may be seen as empowering them. They are empowered not just economically, but also psychologically, socially and politically. However, it must be acknowledged that not all small tourist operators in this study felt positively about the impacts of cruise ship tourism; some may be seen as being disempowered. Furthermore, the empowerment of these market vendors is dependent on the continuous flow of cruise ship visits to Port Vila; something beyond their control. The cancellation of future trips or decrease in the number of cruise ship voyages will have significant consequences for the sustainability of this informal sector and the longevity of these micro-enterprises. The study finding implies that coping strategies should not just address how residents and communities cope or respond to tourism, but should also go further by addressing the consequences of the coping strategies adopted.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Vanuatu</field><field name="subject">cruise tourism</field><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="subject">Pacific Islands</field><field name="subject">coping strategies</field><field name="subject">attitudes and perceptions</field><field name="subject">socio-cultural impacts</field><field name="subject">small island states</field><field name="subject">empowerment</field><field name="subject">disempowerment</field><field name="subject">dependency</field><field name="subject">neo-colonialism</field><field name="subject">cruise ships</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350500 Tourism</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370100 Sociology::370104 Urban sociology and community studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1383</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Determining individuals&#8217; response to New Zealand biosecurity</field><field name="creator">Bewsell, Denise</field><field name="description">The effectiveness of biosecurity measures at national borders is influenced by the behaviour of individuals. One influence on the behaviour of individuals is level of involvement. Involvement is the importance or relevance of an object or situation to an individual. Involvement helps regulate the way in which people receive and process information and thus influences the extent of information searching for decision making, information processing and persuasion. A second area of influence on individuals is the way in which information is framed. Framing influences the persuasiveness of communications. In this study the concept of involvement was used to investigate the response of individuals to New Zealand biosecurity requirements and the response of individuals to differently framed biosecurity information. A range of people associated with the agricultural and food processing sectors were surveyed using a five item scale of involvement to measure their level of involvement in biosecurity. The results indicated that most respondents had medium to high levels of involvement. This implies that respondents were motivated to attend to and process information on biosecurity measures. However, not all respondents reported taking note of biosecurity information implying that involvement with biosecurity prompts some initial information processing which may or may not continue over time. Respondents were also asked to rate four postcards, each designed with a different message strategy. Individuals with high involvement indicated that the postcard with the negatively framed emotion/entertainment message strategy was most persuasive. The results indicate that specifically targeting information to individuals based on their level of involvement in biosecurity may increase compliance with biosecurity measures.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">behaviour</field><field name="subject">involvement</field><field name="subject">biosecurity</field><field name="subject">information processing</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1412</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fair trade coffee supply chains in the highlands of Papua New Guinea: do they give higher returns to smallholders?</field><field name="creator">Powae, Wayne Ishmael</field><field name="description">This research focussed on Fair Trade (FT) coffee supply chains in Papua New Guinea.  Three research questions were asked.  First, do small holders in the FT chains receive higher returns than the smallholders in the conventional chains?  Secondly, if smallholders in the FT coffee chains receive higher returns from their coffee than the smallholders in the conventional chains, what are the sources of these higher returns?  Finally, if smallholders in the FT chains don't receive higher returns than in the conventional chains, what are the constraints to smallholders receiving higher returns from the FT coffee chains than the conventional chains?  A conceptual framework for agribusiness supply chain was developed that was used to guide the field work.  A comparative case study methodology was selcted as an appropriate method for eliciting the required information.  Four case study chains were selected.  A paired FT and conventional coffee chains from Okapa and another paired FT and conventional chains from Kainantu districts, Eastern Highlands Province were selected for the study.  The research found that smallholders in the FT chains and vonventional chains receive very similar prices for their coffee (parchment price equivalent).  Hence, there was no evidence that smallholders in the FT chains received higher prices or returns from their coffee production than smallholders in conventional chains.  This study also found that there was no evidence of FLO certification improving returns to smallholders in the FT chains over those returns received in the conventional chains, but the community that the FT smallholder producers come from did benefit.  The sources of these community benefits lies in the shorter FT chains and the distributions of the margin that would have been otherwise made by processors to producers, exporters and the community.  In addition, this study found that constraints associated with value creation are similar in all the four chains studies.  However, there are some added hurdles for the FT chains in adhering to FT and organic coffee standards.  Moreover, FT co-oeratives lacked capacity to trade and their only functions were to help with FLO certification and distribute the FT premium to the community. The findings of this research support some aspects of the literature, but not others.  The research contribution is the finding that in this period of high conventional coffee prices, returns to smallholders from FT chains were no bettter than the returns gained in conventional chains, which leads to oppotunism and lack of loyalty by smallholders in the FT chains.  The other contribution of this research is in identifying a particular type of free rider who is not a member of the FT co-operative but has right to the community benefits generated by the FT chain.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Papua New Guinea</field><field name="subject">fair tade</field><field name="subject">smallholder coffee producers</field><field name="subject">conventional</field><field name="subject">coffee</field><field name="subject">agribusiness supply chains</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370100 Sociology::370108 Rural Sociology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics::340200 Applied Economics::340201 Agricultural economics</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300900 Land, Parks and Agriculture Management::300901 Farm management, rural management and agribusiness</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1413</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Perceived risk and entry mode strategies of Danish firms in Central and Eastern Europe</field><field name="creator">Br&#252;niche-Olsen, Lau</field><field name="description">In his assessment of the theory development within international market entry mode, Cumberland (2006) outlines the importance of devoting more attention to the research linking the theoretical level and the operational level. Other researchers have shown the performance of a firm is highly affected by its internationalisation process and selecting the right entry mode is one of the most critical managerial decisions. Despite many years of interest from researchers, the entry choice strategy area is still considered a frontier issue. Researchers have suggested that managing risk is one of the major strategic objectives for managers of multinational firms. Furthermore, risk is regarded as a key determinant in relation to entry mode choice. Research has found that the various risk variables should be regarded as an integrated measure in relation to entry mode choice and not single measures. By looking at a single risk variable, the firm might analyse the situation incorrectly, which may lead to an incorrect entry mode. This study investigates the relationship between entry mode choice, perceived risk and risk tolerance for Danish firms entering Central and Eastern Europe by using a probabilistic model. The results indicate risk should be regarded as an integrated measure in relation to entry mode. Despite not all risk variables showing significant correlation with entry mode, some relations were found. The preferred model for predicting entry mode included years of CEE experience, number of competitors, cultural difference, consumer taste and future market potential. In addition, the analysis showed that Danish firms generally are relatively risk averse. Regardless of entry mode, the analysis showed that Danish firms regard CEE as politically stable and do not see a potential risk in government involvement in their activities. Furthermore, Danish firms experience relatively high and increasing competition in CEE, however, they indicate the same methods are available for marketing in CEE as in Denmark.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Entry mode</field><field name="subject">risk</field><field name="subject">perceived risk</field><field name="subject">risk tolerance</field><field name="subject">Danish firms</field><field name="subject">Central and Eastern Europe</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics::340200 Applied Economics::340206 International economics and international finance</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1427</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular systematics and colour variation of Carpophilus species (Coleoptera: Nitidulidae) of the South Pacific</field><field name="creator">Brown, Samuel David James</field><field name="description">The sap beetle genus Carpophilus Stephens (Coleoptera: Nitidulidae) is a large genus consisting of over 200 species and are found worldwide. Several species are important pests of crops and stored products, and are frequently intercepted as part of biosecurity operations. The genus is poorly known taxonomically, and there are several species groups that are challenging to identify by morphological methods. In particular, two species found across the Pacific, C. maculatus Murray and C. oculatus Murray are frequently confused with each other. These two species are similar in size and colour, but differ primarily by the shape of the colour pattern on their elytra. However, this colour pattern is highly variable within both species, leading to ambiguity in the indentification of these species. Within C. oculatus, three subspecies have been described based on differences in the male genitalia and pronotal punctation: C. o. oculatus and C. o. gilloglyi Dobson are distributed widely across the Pacific, while C. o. cheesmani Dobson is known only from Vanuatu.  A search of literature records and specimen collections revealed 32 species of Carpophilus recorded from the Pacific region. In addition there remain several unidentified specimens representing at least four species, two of which will be described subsequent to this research. A number of species recorded in the literature may have been misidentified, and these require further field collections and inspection of museum specimens to confirm their presence in the Pacific.  To test the validity of the subspecies of C. oculatus, and its distinctiveness from C. maculatus, a phylogeny of available specimens of Carpophilus was inferred from one mitochondrial gene (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI)), and two nuclear genes (28S ribsomal RNA (28S) and the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2)). These data show large genetic distances between the three subspecies of C. oculatus of 7-12%. Given these distances are similar to those between other species in the genus, this indicates these subspecies may be elevated to full species. The data also consistently support a monophyletic relationship between C. o. oculatus and C. o. gilloglyi. Nuclear genes also support C. o. cheesmani as part of a clade with the other subspecies, but these relationships are unresolved in COI. Carpophilus maculatus was not supported as being the sister taxon of the C. o. oculatus and C. o. gilloglyi clade. Other relationships within Carpophilus were unresolved, possibly due to a combination of incomplete taxon sampling, and saturation of substitutions within the COI gene.  Phylogeographic analysis of specimens collected from several localities within the range of C. oculatus showed that, with only one exception, there were no shared haplotypes between archipelagoes. This result suggests it may be possible to determine the provenence of intercepted specimens, providing further information regarding potential invasion pathways. A degree of geographic structuring was also present within C. o. gilloglyi, being separated into a western clade found in Fiji and Rotuma and an eastern clade distributed from the Kermadec Islands and Tonga to French Polynesia. This separation was most profound in COI data, with a mean pairwise distance between the clades of 7%. ITS2 data also demonstrates a degree of differentiation between the two clades, based on differences in the insertions and deletions between the clades.  The variability in the shape and colour of the elytral pattern of C. oculatus was also investigated. Colour was quantified using a method based on Red-Green-Blue (RGB) colour values derived from digital photographs, while an outline analysis of the elytral pattern was conducted using elliptic Fourier analysis (EFA). Principal Components Analysis of the RGB values and EFA coefficients showed no clear separation between subspecies, nor were any trends correlated with host fruit or collection localities.  Variation at all levels and all measures studied in this thesis show that this geographic region and this genus of beetles offer intruiging insights into speciation, biogeography and biological invasions. There is much scope for further research on the causes and consequences of this variation and the lives of these interesting insects.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Carpophilus oculatus</field><field name="subject">taxonomy</field><field name="subject">systematics</field><field name="subject">COI</field><field name="subject">28S</field><field name="subject">ITS2</field><field name="subject">colour quantification</field><field name="subject">elliptic Fourier analysis</field><field name="subject">phylogeography</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology::270505 Entomology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology::270501 Animal systematics, taxonomy and phylogeny</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270703 Terrestrial ecology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270709 Biogeography</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270799 Ecology and evolution not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270200 Genetics::270203 Population and ecological genetics</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::210000 Science-General</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::230100 Mathematics::230108 Harmonic and Fourier analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1430</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Citizen-led environment management : learning from the &#8217;bush restorers&#8217;</field><field name="creator">Taylor, Rhys E.</field><field name="description">1. The resource management issue under consideration is the conservation and ecological restoration of natural lowland forest and its associated plant and animal communities (referred to here as native bush), which have considerable human-use and intrinsic values. 2. Within the issue of native bush conservation in New Zealand, the topic of this research is the phenomenon of citizens&#8217; involvement as pro-active volunteers, tackling &#8216;bush restoration&#8217; on public or trust-owned sites. This phenomenon is not rare but is little researched. Some key initial questions are: How extensive is citizen-led bush restoration as a means of environmental management? What motivates the volunteers and what factors advance or hinder their efforts? Why is this phenomenon not more widespread in New Zealand society, and how could it be? 3. The research strategy adopted to address the selected topic is firstly a scoping study to define the issue in context, including multi-disciplinary literature review, followed by a structured qualitative telephone survey of a representative sample of restoration project spokespeople. An analysis of these information sources provides insights and understanding related to the research questions, and raises additional questions. 4. Conclusions offer a potential contribution to the national and local-scale policy agenda in support of citizen-led bush restoration. Recommendations seek to recognise the value of voluntary bush restoration, better enable the committed volunteers, promote new voluntary action and improve the skills of volunteers with a view to enhanced quality of work.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">environmental management</field><field name="subject">citizen participation</field><field name="subject">nature conservation</field><field name="subject">restoration ecology</field><field name="subject">reforestation</field><field name="subject">resource management</field><field name="subject">bush restoration</field><field name="subject">native forest</field><field name="subject">surveys</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science::300801 Environmental management and rehabilitation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300600 Forestry Sciences::300604 Management and environment</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science::300805 Conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1474</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Why are some species invasive? : determining the importance of species traits across three invasion stages and enemy release of southern African native plants in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Nghidinwa, Kirsti C.</field><field name="description">There are many factors that have been proposed to contribute to plant invasiveness in nonnative ecosystems. Traits of invading species are one of them. It has been proposed that successful species at a certain invasion stage share particular traits, which could be used to predict the behaviour of potentially invasive plants at the respective stage. Three main stages of invasion are distinguished: introduction, naturalization, and invasion. I conducted a stageand trait-based analysis of available data for the invasion of New Zealand by the flora of southern Africa. Using 3076 southern African native vascular plant species introduced into New Zealand, generalised linear mixed model analysis was conducted to assess association of several species traits with the three invasion stages. The results showed that plant traits were significantly associated with introduction but fewer traits were associated with naturalization or invasion, suggesting that introduction can be predicted better using plant traits. It has been also hypothesized that species may become invasive in non-native ecosystems because they are removed from the regulatory effects of coevolved natural enemies (Enemy Release hypothesis). A detailed field study of the succulent plant Cotyledon orbiculata var. orbiculata L. (Crassulaceae) was conducted in the non-native New Zealand and native Namibian habitats to compare the extent of damage by herbivores and pathogens. C. orbiculata is a southern African species that is currently thriving in New Zealand in areas seemingly beyond the climatic conditions in its native range (occurring in higher rainfall areas in New Zealand than are represented in its native range). As hypothesised, C. orbiculata was less damaged by herbivores in New Zealand but, contrary to expectation, more infected by pathogens. Consequently, the plant was overall not any less damaged by natural enemies in the non-native habitat than in its native habitat, although the fitness impacts of the enemy damage in the native and invaded ranges were not assessed. The results suggest that climatic conditions may counteract enemy release, especially in situations where pathogens are more prevalent in areas of higher rainfall and humidity. To forecast plant invasions, it is concluded that species traits offer some potential, particularly at the early stage of invasion. Predicting which introduced plants will become weeds is more difficult. Enemy release may explain some invasions, but climatic factors may offset the predictability of release from natural enemies.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">plant ecology</field><field name="subject">invasive species</field><field name="subject">invasion</field><field name="subject">invasion stages</field><field name="subject">introduced plants</field><field name="subject">naturalization</field><field name="subject">species traits</field><field name="subject">herbivory</field><field name="subject">plant&#8211;herbivore interactions</field><field name="subject">plant pathogens</field><field name="subject">succulent plants</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">southern Africa</field><field name="subject">southern African flora</field><field name="subject">Namibia</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">rainfall</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1438</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A comparison of the cool season activity of two white clover cultivars</field><field name="creator">Smetham, M. L.</field><field name="description">Although New Zealand is fortunate in having a climate mild enough to allow some growth of pasture in winter even in the extreme south of the South Island (Duffy, 1971), growth is nevertheless considerably less than in spring and summer. O&#8217;Connor et al, (1968) point out that at Lincoln, Canterbury, winter production from a New Zealand Certified Grasslands Ruanui Perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne c.v.) and New Zealand Certified Grasslands Huia white clover (Trifolium repens c.v.) sward is at best only 8% of the mean total annual dry matter (D.M.) production. A similar seasonal pattern is shown by irrigated pastures (Rickard, 1968), as well as pastures in the milder North Island of New Zealand (O&#8217;Connor and Vartha, pers comm.). Stocking of grazing animals is normally related to the growth rate of pastures in the spring, with conserved hay or silage, plus specially grown greenfeed or root crops being fed if necessary to offset the winter feed deficit. However on hill country too steep for tractor cultivation, cropping and conservation are not possible. Animals have to rely upon in situ grazing of native or dominant browntop (Agrostis tenuis) swards which may not have been improved by the aerial introduction of clovers. In an unimproved state, the quality and quantity of the herbage grown on such areas are low, Molloy (1966) have discussed clover introduction into native swards and the notably beneficial result this has on stock thrift, particularly during the winter period. Considerably better growth rates of stock grazing legumes rather than grasses have been noted by many authors including Ulyatt, (1971), and McLean et al (1962); this superiority being due largely to the greater digestible organic matter intake and higher ratio of soluble to insoluble carbohydrate associated with the herbage of legumes (Ulyatt, 1971).  Consequently the presence of clover, and the winter activity of this, have an important influence on the productivity of steep hill country during winter. An increase of winter activity is also desirable, but not essential, in clover associated with flat or gently rolling pastures. The main pasture legume used in New Zealand has, in the past, been the white clover cultivar Huia. Whilst since 1945 selection and breeding of ryegrasses has brought about a very considerable improvement in the winter or cool season activity of these (Corkill, 1966), no legume cultivar having an increased level of cool-season activity has been released to commerce in New Zealand over the same period  to date.  Breeding for increased winter growth has been an objective of the Grasslands Division Plant Breeding Section for many years (Barclay, 1960). Since 1957, breeding and selection work has been proceeding with the objective of increasing the winter growth of the New Zealand  Certified Grasslands white clover cultivar &#8211; Huia (henceforth to be referred to as Huia) without sacrificing the moderately good summer growth of this strain, (Barclay, 1969). Seed of a promising cultivar selected during the course of this work &#8211; New Zealand Grasslands 4700 white clover, (henceforth to be referred to as 4700) became available for testing in 1967. The investigation to be reported here aimed to measure the cool-season activity of 4700 by comparison with that of Huia, at the same time elucidating if possible the factors controlling this growth.</field><field name="date">1972</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">white clover</field><field name="subject">Trifolium repens</field><field name="subject">ryegrass</field><field name="subject">Lolium perenne</field><field name="subject">Agrostis tenuis</field><field name="subject">browntop swards</field><field name="subject">cultivars</field><field name="subject">pasture growth</field><field name="subject">pasture production</field><field name="subject">cool season activity</field><field name="subject">climate</field><field name="subject">grazing</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300200 Crop and Pasture Production::300205 Agronomy</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300200 Crop and Pasture Production::300203 Plant improvement (selection, breeding and genetic engineering)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1475</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An examination of near-graduates' computer self-efficacy in light of business employers' expectations</field><field name="creator">Gibbs, S.

The high prevalence of computer use may lead employers to assume university graduates will have good computing skills. Such assumptions may be the reason that employers use broad terms to advertise the computing tasks required for graduate-level positions. This thesis investigates how well the expectations of employers match the perceptions of near-graduates about their computer skills. Four graduate-level positions were identified from advertisements placed in order to recruit graduates. The employers who placed these advertisements were surveyed by interview and questionnaire. Twenty-one students about to graduate from a university commerce programme were also interviewed and surveyed. It was found that the wording of the advertisements did not satisfactorily portray the requirements and intentions of the employers. It was also found that skills the near-graduates perceived they possessed frequently did not meet the expectations of employers. Results also show that the near-graduates did not fully understand which computing skills would be expected in the workplace. This study highlights implications for three groups: employers, graduates and educators.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">computer literacy</field><field name="subject">assessing computing skills</field><field name="subject">computer self-efficacy</field><field name="subject">end-user computing</field><field name="subject">business computing</field><field name="subject">business graduates computing skills</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1448</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An economic analysis of the domestication of the tuna fishery - the case of Kiribati</field><field name="creator">Yeeting, Agnes David</field><field name="description">The Western and Central Pacific Ocean (WCPO) is home to the largest tuna fishery stock in the world. However, Pacific Island members of the Western and Central Pacific Tuna Commission (WCPTC) argue that their share of the economic rent from the tuna catches taken out of the Pacific region is very small, being on average only about 6% of the total net benefit, when compared to the share earned by Distant Water Fishing Nations (DWFNs). Kiribati is one of the Pacific Island Countries (PICs), which relies heavily on its fishery for its economic development and sustainability. Kiribati earns 40% - 50 % of its government revenue from fisheries access fees paid by DWFNs for tuna caught in the the Kiribati EEZ. The Government of Kiribati (GoK) believes that Kiribati could get greater benefit if they develop their own domestic tuna fishery. This study uses Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) and SWOT Analysis to investigate whether domestication of the tuna fishery is the right move for Kiribati or not. The CBA reported in this thesis adapted a model developed by Campbell (2004) to investigate and evaluate fisheries policy in Papua New Guinea (PNG). However the model in this thesis is reflective of the situation and case of Kiribati. In analyzing the different options identified in this study, the CBA indicated negative (-) NPV(s) for the medium-sized vessel option and positive (+) NPV(s) for the large-sized vessel option. The SWOT analysis however, complemented the CBA by further investigating the tuna domestication options in the economic, social and business and business environment of Kiribati. The SWOT analysis indicated that the existing situation and business conditions in Kiribati appears to favor the small to medium sized vessel options which are less risky than the large purse seine vessel option.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cost-benefit analysis</field><field name="subject">tuna fishery</field><field name="subject">fisheries</field><field name="subject">tuna economic rent</field><field name="subject">Kiribati</field><field name="subject">economic issues</field><field name="subject">economic benefits</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics::340200 Applied Economics::340202 Environment and resource economics</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300700 Fisheries Science::300705 Evaluation of management strategies</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science::300803 Natural resources management</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics::340200 Applied Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1493</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Water use efficiency of six dryland pastures in Canterbury</field><field name="creator">Tonmukayakul, Nop</field><field name="description">The annual and seasonal water use efficiency of six pasture combinations were calculated from the &#8216;MaxClover&#8217; Grazing Experiment at Lincoln University.  Pastures have been established for six years and are grazed by best management practices for each combination. Measurements for this study are from individual plots of four replicates of ryegrass (RG)/white clover (Wc), cocksfoot (CF)/Wc; CF/balansa (Bal) clover; CF/Caucasian (Cc) clover; CF/subterranean  (Sub) clover or lucerne. Water extraction measurements showed soils for all dryland pastures had a similar plant available water content of 280&#177;19.8 mm. Dry matter measurements of yield, botanical composition and herbage quality were assessed from 1 July 2008 until 30 June 2009. Lucerne had the highest annual yield of 14260 kg DM/ha/y followed by the CF/Sub at 9390 kg DM/ha/y and the other grass based pastures at &#8804; 6900 kg DM/ha/y. All pastures used about 670&#177;24.4 mm/y of water for growth. Lucerne had the highest annual water use efficiency (WUE) of 21 kg DM/ha/mm/y of water used (total yield/total WU). The WUE of CF/Sub was the second highest at 15 kg DM/ha/mm/y, and the lowest was CF/Wc at 9 kg DM/ha/mm/y. The CF/Sub pastures had the highest total legume content of all grass based pastures at 21% and as a consequence had the highest annual nitrogen yield of 190 kg N/ha. This was lower than the monoculture of lucerne (470 kg N/ha). Ryegrass/white clover had the highest total weed component in all pastures of 61%.  For dryland farmers spring is vital for animal production when soil temperatures are rising and moisture levels are high. The water use efficiency at this time is important to maximize pasture production. In spring lucerne produced 8730 kg DM/ha, which was the highest dry matter yield of all pastures. The CF/Sub produced the second highest yield of 6100 kg/DM/ha. When calculated against thermal time, CF/Sub grew 5.9 kg DM/&#186;Cd compared with lucerne at 4.9 kg DM/&#186;Cd. The higher DM yield from lucerne was from an extra 400 &#186;Cd of growth. The highest seasonal WUE of all pastures occurred in the spring growing period. Linear regressions forced through the origin, showed lucerne (1/7/08-4/12/08) had a WUE of 30 kg DM/ha/mm (R2=0.98). Of the grass based pastures, CF/Sub produced 18 kg DM/ha/mm (R2=0.98) from 1/7 to 10/11/08 from 270 mm of water used. The lowest spring WUE was 13.5 kg DM/ha/mm by CF/Bal pastures which was comparable to the 14.3&#177;1.42 kg DM/ha/mm WUE of CF/Wc, CF/Cc and RG/Wc pastures. During the spring, CF/Sub clover had the highest spring legume component of the grass based pastures at 42% and produced 120 kg N/ha. This was lower than the 288 kg N/ha from the monoculture of lucerne. Sub clover was the most successful clover which persisted with the cocksfoot. Based on the results from this study dryland farmers should be encouraged to maximize the potential of lucerne on farm, use cocksfoot as the main grass species for persistence, rather than perennial ryegrass, and use subterranean clover as the main legume species in cocksfoot based pastures. By increasing the proportion of legume grown the water use efficiency of a pasture can be improved. When pastures are nitrogen deficient the use of inorganic nitrogen may also improve pasture yields particularly in spring.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dactylis glomerata L.</field><field name="subject">Lolium perenne L.</field><field name="subject">Medicago sativa L.</field><field name="subject">Trifolium ambiguum L.</field><field name="subject">T. repens L.</field><field name="subject">T. michelianum L.</field><field name="subject">water use efficiency</field><field name="subject">dryland pasture</field><field name="subject">lucerne</field><field name="subject">ryegrass</field><field name="subject">white clover</field><field name="subject">cocksfoot</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300200 Crop and Pasture Production</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300200 Crop and Pasture Production::300205 Agronomy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1498</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fixed asset revaluation: management incentives and market reactions</field><field name="creator">Tay, Ink</field><field name="description">There is a lack of relevant research of fixed assets revaluation practices in New Zealand. This study provides some insights as (1) why some New Zealand firms choose to revalue their fixed assets; (2) when will a firm revalue its fixed assets; and (3) whether fixed asset revaluation provides information to investors. This research attempts to explain the motivations of the management&#8217;s fixed asset revaluation decision in New Zealand. The empirical analysis includes five common explanatory variables, such as gearing (debt-equity ratio), liquidity, market-to-book ratio, firm size, and fixed asset intensity. In addition, the relationship between asset revaluation and share price movements of the firms are examined to determine the perceived usefulness of fixed asset revaluation information for the capital market in New Zealand.  The study results show that fixed asset intensity and firm size significantly contribute to the revaluation decision. In contrast to the findings of previous studies (Whittred and Chan, 1992; Brown, Izan, and Loh, 1992; and Missionier-Piera, 2007), the level of corporate gearing is negatively related to the probability of revaluing assets for the sample of New Zealand firms in this study. However, the effect of the level of gearing on the revaluation decision is insignificant. The empirical results did not show any significant outcomes and relationships for investigated year 1998. This is because 1998 signified the end of recession and the beginning of economic growth in New Zealand. At the end of a recession, the changes in the country&#8217;s economic environment might have superseded individual firms&#8217; considerations in management decision making process. The empirical results show that the practice of revaluation increased sharply with the adoption of the IFRS in 2005 in New Zealand. About 28.1% of the revaluation announcements under study were made in 2005 compared to just over 15.8% in 2001. Furthermore, the empirical results show negative returns accrue to firms prior to the publication of financial statements that carry revaluation announcements. These negative returns are reverted as soon as the revaluation information is made public. These gains are again maintained for at least a month after the announcements are made. Comparing frequent revaluers to first time revaluers, the results show that asset revaluation information is relevant to investors. Frequent revaluers gained only 0.8% announcement abnormal returns while First time revaluers gained over 4% in the 2005.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fixed asset revaluation</field><field name="subject">management incentives</field><field name="subject">market reaction</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1555</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Staying or leaving New Zealand after you graduate? &#8211; reflecting on brain drain and brain circulation issues facing graduates</field><field name="creator">Kaliyati, William Qinisela</field><field name="description">Brain drain and brain circulation are forms of skilled labour migration which have a significant impact on New Zealand&#8217;s economic growth. Based on their importance, it is suggested that economies rethink how they compete for skilled labour in an international labour market.  This research study reviews economic and non-economic factors that influence an individual&#8217;s decisions to stay or leave New Zealand. Data is collected from a survey sample of Lincoln University final year undergraduate and postgraduate students, who represent New Zealand&#8217;s future skilled labour. The research study employs a data reduction technique called factor analysis to collate large sets of variables into small sets for econometric analysis. The key econometric tool, logit analysis, provides probabilities of graduates leaving New Zealand and marginal effects of changes in key economic and non-economic variables. These key findings, providing new knowledge, are used to engage in a policy discussion in the last chapter. The research study importantly maintains focus on three key stakeholders, the government, the business community and the individual/student when addressing and analysing New Zealand&#8217;s brain drain and brain circulation issues.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">brain drain</field><field name="subject">brain circulation</field><field name="subject">skilled labour migration</field><field name="subject">brain exchange</field><field name="subject">graduate employment</field><field name="subject">econometric modelling</field><field name="subject">surveys</field><field name="subject">policy recommendations</field><field name="subject">Lincoln University</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics::340200 Applied Economics::340207 Labour economics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1535</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Breeding biology and threats to the blue penguin (Eudyptula minor) in South Westland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Braidwood, Jasmine</field><field name="description">The Blue Penguin (Eudyptula minor) is assumed to be declining over much of its range, largely due to introduced predators. Anecdotal evidence suggests that one of the areas of declining population is the West Coast of the South Island. The purpose of this study was to determine the reasons for the assumed decline of blue penguins in South Westland. This was done by studying breeding ecology at several blue penguin colonies to assess the importance of breeding success and adult mortality on the penguin population. Three blue penguin colonies in South Westland, at Five Mile and Three Mile beaches south of Okarito, and at the Wanganui River mouth near Harihari, were monitored throughout the 2008/09 breeding season. During each burrow visit the number of eggs and chicks were recorded as well as the date of laying, hatching or fledging. Five colonies of blue penguin were also monitored in Buller over the same breeding season in a study conducted by the West Coast Blue Penguin Trust, a community trust based on the West Coast. The results of both studies were compared to determine the effect of predator control on breeding parameters, such as breeding success.  Of 137 eggs laid in South Westland, 108 chicks survived until fledging, giving an overall breeding success of 78.8%. In Buller, 64 chicks survived to fledging from 101 eggs laid, resulting in an overall breeding success of 63.4%. Breeding success was significantly higher at penguin colonies in South Westland, compared to the Buller colonies. There was no evidence that predator control had an effect on breeding success in South Westland or Buller. The mean number of chicks fledged per pair that produced eggs was 1.55 in South Westland and 1.16 in Buller. The overall proportion of occupied breeding burrows compared to the total number of suitable burrows at the South Westland sites was 73.8% (n = 103). At the Buller sites, only 60.3 % (n = 151) of the total number of burrows was occupied.  Road kills are a major threat to blue penguins in Buller due to the proximity of colonies to the state highway. Fortunately, incidences of road death in South Westland are rare and due to the distance from roads, do not pose a significant threat to South Westland blue penguins. Further study of blue penguin colonies in South Westland is needed to learn more about annual variation in breeding productivity and to determine if breeding success is consistently high over an extended time period. If this is the case, then the cause of blue penguin decline on the West Coast is unlikely to be due to problems with breeding as the breeding success during this study is one of the highest recorded for blue penguins. Although there was no apparent effect of predator control on breeding productivity during this study there is evidence from other locations that predators, in particular stoats, have contributed to the decline of blue penguin populations. More research into the impact of predators on penguins over a longer period of time is needed on the West Coast before a change is made to how predators are managed.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">blue penguin</field><field name="subject">Eudyptula minor</field><field name="subject">South Westland</field><field name="subject">breeding timing</field><field name="subject">predator control</field><field name="subject">adult mortality</field><field name="subject">threats</field><field name="subject">breeding success</field><field name="subject">weights</field><field name="subject">burrow occupancy</field><field name="subject">West Coast Blue Penguin Trust</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270708 Conservation and biodiversity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1556</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Simulation and analysis of port bottlenecks: the case of Male'</field><field name="creator">Adam, Shammoon</field><field name="description">Maldives is an island nation that consists of around 1190 islands located in the Indian Ocean, southwest of Sri Lanka.  The country virtually imports everything it consumes. Male&#8217; Commercial Harbour handles all international sea cargo for the country. The land area assigned for the port is small; and there are frequent bottlenecks and congestion in the port. By using computer simulation techniques, this research investigates the situation of Male&#8217; Commercial Harbour and identifies logistic bottlenecks that exist at the port. Accordingly, a field research was conducted at Male&#8217; Commercial Harbour to collect required data. Both, qualitative and quantitative data were collected using focus group, interviews, on-site observations, and time and motion measures. The simulation models presented in this thesis were carried out with Arena software (Academic Version of Arena 10.0). The models were used to analyse the vessel turnaround time, berth capacity, yard capacity, container dwell time, queue values, utilisation of ship cranes and other container handling equipment. The results show that berth capacity seems to be the major bottleneck that creates longer queues and ship delays at Male&#8217; Commercial Harbour. Several scenarios were tested to identify the best scenario regarding ship waiting time at berth.  Based on the best scenario, a project was proposed focusing on the development of an extended alongside berth at Male&#8217; Commercial Harbour. A cost benefit analysis was performed to see whether the project is financially feasible.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">simulation</field><field name="subject">utilisation</field><field name="subject">vessel turnaround time</field><field name="subject">berth capacity</field><field name="subject">yard capacity</field><field name="subject">bottlenecks</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290300 Manufacturing Engineering::290308 Packaging, storage and transportation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1587</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Neutron capture mechanisms in the threshold region</field><field name="creator">Allen, Barry John</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2942</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Case study explorations of emergent literacy learners' transactions with picture story books</field><field name="creator">Parkes, Brenda Jean</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/996</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Wastewater treatment for remote and rural Aboriginal communities of Australia</field><field name="creator">Khalif&#233;, Mohsen A.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1281</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Water quality modelling of river systems</field><field name="creator">Musavi-Jahromi, S.

However, certain conditions including thermal and oxidative stress may cause proteins to partially unfold and aggregate.  Intracellular and/or extracellular protein aggregates have been identified in a large number of diseases, including Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, arthritis and type II diabetes. While intracellular quality control for the folding state of proteins is well characterized, corresponding mechanisms for extracellular protein folding quality control have yet to be described.Clusterin (CLU) is an abundant extracellular chaperone that can stabilize proteins and prevent their precipitation during exposure to elevated temperatures or oxidative stress in vitro. The work described here demonstrates that CLU stabilizes stressed client proteins by forming soluble, high molecular weight (HMW) complexes with them. The maximum loading of CLU appears to be at a mass ratio of CLU:stressed client protein of approximately 1:2 (irrespective of the identity of the client protein or the temperature used to induce heat stress). It was demonstrated that various human plasma proteins show increased association with CLU after plasma is subjected to mild shear stress or oxidative stress at 37&#176;C - the most abundant of these was fibrinogen (FGN) which co-purified with CLU from stressed plasma. In vitro, using purified proteins, heat stress of 45&#176;C for 12 h was required to induce FGN precipitation and the formation of HMW CLU-FGN complexes. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) of the stressed plasma suggested that a portion of the complexes formed in plasma between CLU and FGN may be similar in mass to those formed in vitro.Using surface plasmon resonance, although CLU was found to bind to megalin, only minimal (or no) binding of HMW complexes formed between CLU and glutathione-S-transferase, citrate synthase or lysozyme was detected. Similarly, negligible binding of these complexes to low density lipoprotein receptor superfamily members expressed on the surface of the rat yolk sac cell line BN was detected. However, the complexes were shown to preferentially bind to the surface of BN cells, peripheral human monocytes and rat hepatocytes (more so than uncomplexed CLU or client proteins). In all cases, this binding was inhibited by fucoidin (a scavenger receptor inhibitor). Confocal microscopy suggested that binding of HMW CLU-stressed protein complexes to the surface of BN cells or rat hepatocytes was followed by their internalization into lysosomes. Furthermore, Western blotting showed that hepatocytes were able to degrade the HMW CLU-stressed protein complexes and that the degradation was almost completely abolished by inhibiting lysosomal proteases with chloroquine. The results of in vivo biodistribution studies in Sprague Dawley rats were highly consistent for several different HMW CLU-stressed protein complexes. Intravenous 123I-labelled HMW CLU-stressed protein complexes were cleared more efficiently from circulation compared to free CLU and the uncomplexed client proteins. The liver and to a lesser degree the spleen appeared to be the key organs responsible for the uptake of complexes and this uptake was inhibited by pre-injection of the animals with fucoidin.The findings of this study suggest an important role for CLU in global quality control of extracellular protein folding. It appears likely that stressed (partially unfolded) extracellular proteins are stabilized and held in solution by CLU and that CLU-stressed protein complexes are subsequently taken up by fucoidin-inhibitable cell surface receptors for subsequent degradation within lysosomes. The precise physical characteristic or binding site that targets CLU-stressed protein complexes for receptor mediated uptake remains to be identified and further work is needed to determine the particular receptor(s) involved. The findings of this study support a model in which complexation with CLU is an important first step in the targeted disposal of stressed proteins via scavenger-like endocytic receptors.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/860</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Alkaloid-based syntheses of potential new glycosidase inhibators</field><field name="creator">Tarrant, Gregory James</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1109</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis, characterisation and applications of conducting polymer coated textiles</field><field name="creator">Wu, Jian</field><field name="description">This thesis describes preparation and characterisation of a range of novel conducting polymer coated textiles, which have potential in applications such as static dissipation, EMI shielding, heating elements, composite structures and many military applications. Conducting polypyrrole coated textiles such as nylon Lycra and polyester fabrics have been synthesised using different approaches (Chapter 3). The present study concentrates on preparation of conducting polypyrrole coated textile using an in-situ polymerisation method.  A range of characterisation techniques for the inherently conducting polymer (ICP) coated fabrics were used: the stability of the surface resistivity, cyclic voltammetry, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), UV-Vis spectroscopy and Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). It was found that the PPy-coated nylon Lycra fabric could be used as a wearable strain gauge. The strain gauge characteristics have been investigated using both an Instron machine and a &#8220;SmartMotor&#8221;. The use of molecular templates to facilitate the polymerisation and the integration of inherently conducting polymers (ICPs) into textiles has been investigated (Chapter 4). Poly(2-methoxyaniline-5 sulfonic acid) or [PMAS] is a water-soluble, fully sulfonated polyaniline that has been used as molecular template. In the first step &#8211; &#8220;dyeing&#8221; of PMAS into the textile, the effect of fabric pre-treatment, solution pH as well as solution temperature have been investigated. In the second step the effects of the ratio of PMAS to aniline, the ratio of aniline to ammonium persulfate and the polymerisation temperature on the polymerisation reaction have also been studied. Characterisation of the templated polyaniline coated fabric prepared using the above &#8220;Two step&#8221; process has been undertaken (Chapter 4). The stability of the conductivity, cyclic voltammetry, UV-Vis spectra, SEM studies, TGA analysis and strain gauge characteristics have been determined. Results indicate that templated PAn-coated wool nylon Lycra can be used as the strain gauge as tested with either the Instron machine or &#8220;SmartMotor&#8221;.Conducting polymer coated textile fabrics are easily prepared and integrated into truly wearable clothing and garments to create strain sensors with a wide dynamic range. Functional wearable textile sensing systems can monitor human motion, provide immediate bio-feedback to the wearer without changing the properties and functions of the fabric material and with no interference to normal human body motion. This innovative technique can be widely used for injury prevention, rehabilitation, sport technique modification and medical treatment. It will have a number of further potential applications to be used for daily living, work and recreation in the future.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1191</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The implementation of multidimensional discrete transforms for digital signal processing</field><field name="creator">Wu, Hong Hong</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1353</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gauge variation in twin-roll strip casting process</field><field name="creator">Nikolovski, Nikolco</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1363</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Integral and pulse mode silicon dosimetry for dose verification on radiation oncology modalities</field><field name="creator">Kaplan, Grigori I.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1364</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teaching secondary science with data loggers: the NSW experience</field><field name="creator">Silburn, Kenneth R</field><field name="description">Many countries have identified an urgent need to revitalise the way science is taught in secondary schools in an endeavour to increase the number of students electing to study science at senior school and continuing into science-related study at university. Recent changes to the New South Wales Higher School Certificate Stage 6 Science syllabuses have resulted in a shift towards the use of data acquisition and analysis technology in the science laboratory. Combined with the increase in technology available to schools and the decrease in cost associated with its use, data acquisition equipment and analysis software, such as data loggers, are now seen as an essential part of the science curriculum. The recent introduction of data loggers into the education system has been implemented despite a lack of empirical research into their effective use. This study addresses this gap in literature by investigating the implementation and use of data loggers in the secondary science classroom from the viewpoint of both students and teachers. The purpose of the study was to describe how teachers use data acquisition and analysis technology to support student learning in secondary physics. The study also sought to develop descriptions of effective practice in the use of data loggers in secondary physics teaching and also identified the purposes of the different approaches taken by teachers. An anticipated outcome of this research is an improved understanding of how teachers can better facilitate increased student learning through the use of appropriate technology in the classroom. The study was guided by three key questions: (1) What is the current impact of data loggers in secondary school physics classrooms? (2) What factors influence the ways teachers use data loggers with their classes? (3) What are the implications for integrating data loggers into the physics curriculum? A mixed method design combining qualitative and quantitative approaches including a combination of survey, interviews and case study research methods was used. Data were collected by surveys and interviews with students and teachers, and classroom observations. Student focus group interviews were carried out under supervision of an appropriate adult, in consultation with the principal. The study incorporated the researcher&#8217;s own school as well as nine other schools in the Campbelltown and Liverpool School Districts of Sydney, New South Wales. Professional people identified as being leaders in the area of data logging and education also were interviewed to triangulate findings from the schools. The study found that despite the rhetoric exalting their virtues, the implementation of data logger use in NSW schools has not been effective. Survey results indicated that data loggers were almost only used in the senior years of high school. Even though many teachers could identify the advantages of using data loggers in their classes they were not confident in using this technology, and cited a lack of professional development, the cost and scarcity of equipment, and the complexity and problems associated with classroom management of such equipment. The study also identified cases of best practice and highlighted strategies used by teachers to use data loggers to extend students&#8217; knowledge. The findings have implications for the future implementation of data loggers in schools and suggest avenues for further research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3065</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding the relationships of clergymen using personal construct psychology</field><field name="creator">Whetham, Paul James</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1700</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing healthy public policy: the case of Australian local government and food and nutrition policies</field><field name="creator">Yeatman, Heather</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1702</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An infrared study of metal Schiff-base complexes</field><field name="creator">Gluvchinksy, P.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2621</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dynamic analysis of the motion of linkages with relation to the upper extremity human limb</field><field name="creator">Hodkinson, Neville Thomas</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2659</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An application of the Mossbauer effect to the study of some magnetic properties of ilmenite</field><field name="creator">Lising, L.

Traditionally, heat stress equations have been used to identify scenarios likely to cause heat illness, based on the environmental conditions, and estimates of workload. However, as individuals respond differently to the same heat stress, it is often considered more appropriate to directly measure physiological responses (strain) so that behavioural changes may be used to reduce thermal strain. This project aimed to provide a theoretical basis for the development of a personal heat strain monitor, by evaluating a suitable surrogate index of core temperature for use in a working environment.This index was an insulated skin temperature (Tskin-insul), located laterally to the T2-T4 spine. Using linear regression modelling, we have found this Tskin-insul to closely approximate changes in oesophageal temperature (Tes). In this research, we applied these regression model to pre-existing data from our laboratory, resulting in 83% of the variance in Tes being explained on the basis of Tskin-insul, with a standard error of the estimate of 0.15&#176;C on individual trials. With multiple-linear regression analyses using physiological and psychophysical measures as potential predictor variables, the standard error of the estimate fell to 0.10&#176;C. Due to variation in the intercept and slope values, no single prediction equation was able to be derived for all situations, and this technique was considered impractical for use in a commercial monitor.By combining data collected at the same air temperature, four sets of equations were developed for each of three ambient temperature ranges. The predictor variables in these equations were: (i) Tskin-insul only (simple linear regression modelling); (ii) Tskin-insul and heart rate; (iii) Tskin-insul, heart rate, mass and sum of six skinfolds; and (iv) perceived exertion, Tskin-insul, mass and sum of six skinfolds. It was possible to predict Tes to an acceptable accuracy (standard error of estimate &lt;0.2&#176;C) using Tskin-insul, heart rate, body mass and sum of skinfolds in a multiple linear regression analysis.When these equations were trialed on independent datasets (air temperature $30&#176;C), all the equations developed for use in air temperatures of 30-36&#176;C resulted in the standard error of the estimate being &gt;0.2&#176;C. The equations developed on data collected at 40&#176;C had a similarly high error, with the most accurate equation, which utilised only Tskin-insul as a predictor variable, having a standard error of the estimate of 0.05&#176;C above the maximum recommended level. The prediction equations utilising additional variables recorded standard error of the estimate values exceeding twice the recommended maximum level.These prediction equations were examined in relation to their efficacy for use with industrial heat strain guidelines. The equations developed using Tskin-insul, heart rate, mass and sum of six skinfolds were the most accurate equations at measuring a 0.8&#176;C and 1.0&#176;C change in Tes, at air temperatures of 30&#176;C and 40&#176;C. The prediction of an Tes measurement of 38.0&#176;C and 38.5&#176;C revealed that equations using Tskin-insul as the only predictor variable were most accurate. The equations for use at an air temperature of 36-40&#176;C were considered sufficiently accurate for use in a personal monitoring system, with those developed for 30-36&#176;C deemed to be unsuitable in the present form.The prediction equations were trialed in two heat strain indices: the Physiological Strain Index and the Cumulative Heat Strain Index. The predicted Tes measurement was inserted into these indices. It was found that the prediction equations using Tskininsul as the only predictor variable in the Physiological Strain Index, created a result that could be considered desirable in the air temperature range of 30-40&#176;C. It was determined that, due to the level of inaccuracy of the equations, it was not possible to use surrogate measures of Tes in the Cumulative Heat Strain Index. Future research should primarily focus on reducing Tskin-insul measurement error, with the measurement then being trialed across a broad range of conditions to examine its efficacy for use in a personal monitoring system.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/588</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of the overoxidation of the conducting polymer polypyrrole</field><field name="creator">Lewis, Trevor W.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1107</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Asymmetric synthesis of chiral amines and benzazepine alkaloids from chiral sulfoxides</field><field name="creator">Hajipour, Abdol Reza</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1112</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Throwing some weight around: women and fatness in the contemporary, post-colonial societies of Australia, Canada and New New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Holm, Antoniette</field><field name="description">Body size is intrinsic to contemporary Western femininity. Disciplines of health and beauty not only shape the female body but define the limits of the form. Body size and eating is a topic that touches on the lives of most women in Australia, New Zealand and Canada. In this thesis I explore the parameters of the fat body, problematise popular notions of fatness, and look at the way in which body size is fundamental to the social construction of femininity in the post colonial, contemporary societies of Canada, New Zealand and Australia.This thesis is not about obesity or about medically-defined excess, it is about cultural ideas of fatness, and the way in which fatness is inscribed upon forms in excess of the "docile body". I am interested in the way in which fatness intersects with docility, the institutionally-desired disciplined body of idealised (and reduced) femininity, and the ramifications for both fat and docile bodies.The body addressed in this thesis is a textual one. Literature is a means by which to illuminate the discursive practices of society, and by contextualising literature within historical and cultural debates, it becomes possible to see the way in which the body at the centre of a text is constructed and positioned with regard to a number of competing discourses. It is also possible to identify the ways in which the feminine body is marked by, and negotiates, the processes of cultural inscription. The visual image, also, is a powerful medium through which socio-cultural images are reflected and challenged, and so I include a discussion of film within the thesis. In the following seven chapters selected films and novels from Australia, Canada and New Zealand are positioned within cultural, political and national contexts that impact upon the meanings of fatness.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1377</field></doc><doc><field

The results were compared with those obtained from WC-Co composite which had same binder volume fraction and fabricated under identical sintering conditions. Boron doped FeAl (FeooA14o) and NhAl alloys were selected as potential new alternative binders in place of cobalt for WC composites due to their particular combination of mechanical properties.Sub micron WC-40vol%(FeAl-B), WC40vol%(NhAl-B) and WC-4Ovol%Co composites were synthesized by powder processing followed by uniaxial hot-pressing at the optimized temperature of 1500 &#176;C under a pressure of20 MFa in argon atmosphere. Doped aluminide binders, with boron levels ranging from 0 to O.l&#176;W'fOIO, were prepared in ultrafine form using controlled atmosphere arc melting and then ring-grinding under argon atmosphere. Hardness and indentation fracture tests were performed on composite specimens and the microstructures were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Phase and compositional characterization were studied by XRD, TEM-EDS and electron diffraction. Abrasive wear performance was evaluated using a pin-on-drum apparatus and the worn surfaces studied by SEM.The results showed that WC sufficiently wet by the boron doped aluminide binders which resulted in sintered composites with near full densities. WC is also relatively stable in WC-4Ovol%(.FeAI-B) and WC-40vol%(NhAl-B) systems up to 0.1moJO B with no new phases observed at sintering temperature of 1500 "C. The microstructures exhibited faceted WC grains with no significant grain growth, with continuous aluminide binders and similar morphology to WC-Co. Increasing the amount of boron in the aluminide binders up to 0.1 moJO resulted in more faceting in WC particles and increasing amount of dissolved W in the aluminide binders. Furthermore, the WC contiguity (WC/WC contact) and grain sizes of aluminide binders decreased with increasing the amount ofboron in the aluminide binders. Hardness of WC-FeAl was found to be higher than that of WC-NiJAl but the we-co had lowest hardness. WC-FeAl showed the highest wear resistance and lowest fracture toughness compared to those of WC-NiJAl and WC-Co. Fracture toughness and wear resistance of WC-NbAl were found to be comparable to those for WC-Co. Boron addition up to 0.1wtO,Io in both WC-FeAl-B and WC-NhAl-B had no significant effect on the hardness but the boron addition showed significant enhancement in their fracture toughness (42% for WC-FeAl-B and 38% for WC-NhAl-B) and better wear resistance 24% for WC-FeAl-B and 14% for WC-NiJAl-B) which were found to be higher than those of WC-Co. Increasing boron content also resulted in decreasing of surface abrasion during abrasive wear testing by brittle processes such as pull out of particular phases and cracking of carbide particles. The improvement of the fracture toughness and wear resistance with addition of boron could be due to combination of factors including increasing WC solubility in the aluminide binders and reduction in WC contiguity as well as aluminide binder's grain sizes. This in turn could lead to improve the strength of WC/aluminides interfaces and wettability of WC with aluminides.Finally, the boron doped FeAl and NhAl alloys is proposed as alternative binders to replace Co in conventional WC-Co composites and it is envisaged that WC-FeAI-B and WC-Ni3Al-B composites could be considered as potential candidates in some specific applications.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/546</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An historically informed episodic study of state audit independence</field><field name="creator">Funnell, Warwick Norman</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1001</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of heat acclimation on body-fluid regulation</field><field name="creator">Patterson, Mark J.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1098</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Accounting education in developing countries: the case of Sri Lanka</field><field name="creator">Yapa, P.

The thesis argues that Jal lu'l-D&#237;n R&#250;mi, Sant Kab&#237;r, Matsuo Bash&#243; and William Blake are not only "mystic" and "symbolic" poets, but that they have enough in common to justify the creation of a new, more well-defined area of interdisciplinary research between the fields of literature and religious studies. This thesis refers to them as "perceptive poets" and aims to define this term. The selected poets represent mystical branches of Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism and Christianity. The thesis is, therefore, to some extent a comparative study of Sufism, N&#225;thism, Zen and the Gnostic tradition. The combination of poets allows for comparison of symbolism between diverse literary traditions, and also promotes examination of the crucial relationship between silent mystic experience and the creation of symbolic forms of writing.Current literary taxonomy does not allow for satisfactory comparative studies of poets who originate from different religious and literary backgrounds, but who in fact share profoundly similar spiritual insight. No particular field of literary studies simultaneously and completely: accommodates for the poet whose first priority is spiritual life; incorporates poets from both East and West; acknowledges the difference between the mystic state of expanded consciousness and the unconscious; and recognises the relationship between the "Perceptive Faculty" affected by certain mystic experiences and the "Imaginative Faculty" associated with the creation of symbols.This research aims to narrow the field of "mystic poetry" and enable distinction between the poet who has experienced expanded consciousness and the poet who displays random mystical tendencies. Through a comparative study of these four prominent poets, who have each been described as both "mystic" and "symbolic", the thesis identifies six common characteristics. These points of association are brought together to create a new framework suitable for the examination of similar poets from various religious and literary traditions.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/861</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of thin-walled structural behaviour</field><field name="creator">Salaheldin, Mohsen</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1229</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Children's recognition of consumption constellations: differences across three age groups</field><field name="creator">Davis, Teresa</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1477</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Amorphous and nanocrystalline hydrogen storage alloy materials for nickel-metal hydride batteries</field><field name="creator">Li, Sun</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1483</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification and optimisation of hopper-discharge chute systems for bulk granular materials</field><field name="creator">Montagner, G.

The thesis deploys classical Marxist concepts, in their connections to some of Indonesia&#8217;s political thinkers, especially Soekarno. It critiques some of the major in-depth (book length) struggles on political developments during this period as negating or downplaying the class factor, and in particular class struggle and mass mobilisation, in their studies.The thesis argues that it has been the nature of two crisis caused by the escalation of mass mobilisation of the popular classes against a ruling class and its political elite, and the nature of the resolution of these two crisis, that best explains what happens at two key conjunctures in modern Indonesian history, 1965 and 1998. In 1965 the sharpening polarization between two visions of Indonesia was resolved with mass repression and the emergence of the New Order regime. The thesis examines how the political activity one side of this polarization was increasingly manifested in mass mobilisation and how the new regime was structured to permanently end all mass mobilisation activity. The thesis examines the nature of the crisis, namely an impending threat of the forces of the mass mobilisation winning power.The thesis later examines the process whereby mass mobilisation politics in the period 1989-1998,  re-asserted itself, through the agency of a small initiating political group, the Peoples&#8217; Democratic Party, and through the increasing involvement of more and more elements from the popular classes. A part of the examination presents the analysis that the content of class struggle for this period, in the aftermath of the radical suppression of mass mobilisation, was the struggle of the popular classes to reassert a right to mobilize. The thesis then examines the nature of crisis caused by the escalating mass mobilisation of this period, especially as it climaxes between 1996 and 1998.Through an examination of the reasons for the inability of the political movement based on mass mobilisation to win power and its inability to sustain further escalation between 1998 and 2001, the thesis attempts to locate political weaknesses of the mass mobilisation politics that emerged in the 1990s, identifying in particular its weak ideological activity and dependence on alliance with dissident elements from within the ruling class and its elite.The conclusion sums up these arguments as well as looks at possible future trends and the research agendas that would be needed to pursue this kind of approach in regard to future developments.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3045</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of chemo-mechanical actuation in polymer gels</field><field name="creator">Larios, Salvador Enrique Lobato</field><field name="description">The objective of this thesis is to investigate chemically &#8211; driven gel actuators and their usefulness to perform mechanical work. The thesis work has mainly concentrated on chitosan as the gel actuator material. Chitosan is a widely used biopolymer that shows a large volume transition through changing pH.	The pH induced actuation behaviour of polymer gels makes these materials analogous to a biological muscle. From a mechanics viewpoint, polymers gels are very compliant, unlike more common engineering material such as metals or ceramics or even most polymers. 		The mechanical work output of an actuation system is determined from a combination of the displacement and force generated. A complication arises with gel actuators since prior work has shown that the application of an external force can change the gel volume transition. Very little information is available regarding the specific effect of an external load on the displacement generated by a gel actuator. 		The thesis included experiments on a homogeneous solvent swollen rubber as a model system. Actuation of the rubber was effected through solvent exchange.	The mechanical actuation was investigated by three different approaches: Linear Elastic, Thermodynamic and Linear Elastic generalized to 3D (finite element model). These models are to account for both the mechanical properties and the actuation behaviour of these materials. Uniaxial mechanical testing has been conducted on natural rubber and chitosan gel in both the fully expanded and fully contracted states, and the material parameters from these mechanical tests were used in the various models. The model and material parameters are then used to predict the rubber/chitosan actuation behaviour under isotonic loading. 	Actuation tests on chitosan fibres showed unexpected results. Chitosan fibres showed a considerable strain difference between length and diameter during free actuation. An applied load during actuation process gave completely unexpected results: contraction in the length direction when expansion was expected and vice versa. The 3 - dimensional elastic approach based on the Finite Element Model was modified from the isotropic material (natural rubber) to account for the anisotropic chitosan fibres. This model enables a reasonable estimate of the Young&#8217;s modulus and Poisson&#8217;s ratio. The results suggest that the materials have different Young&#8217;s modulus in the longitudinal and transversal directions which produces a high expansion in the transversal direction in comparison with the longitudinal, affecting directly the actuation process.Moreover the changes in Poisson&#8217;s ratio and modulus due to a change in the chemical environment (pH or solvent) were also shown to account for the unexpected actuation results.	Useful dynamic information on the molecular scale was obtained on the structure of the fibre using a real-time small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) technique. Parameters (particularly correlation lengths and intensity) fitted to the experimental data clearly indicated structural differences in the directions perpendicular and parallel to the fibre axis, however detailed description of the molecular organisation requires further investigation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3069</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The restructuring of the NSW coalmining industry, 1903-1982</field><field name="creator">Dingsdag, Donald Pierre</field><field name="description">The thesis is developed chronologically into nine chapters, the first two dealing with the 19th century and the remaining seven with the 20th century.

As well as empirically, treatment of the 19th century is essential to the development of the major theoretical considerations of the thesis. For, well before the end of the century, the relations of production characteristic of the industry during the 20th century were firmly entrenched: trade practices and union custom and practice were resolutely in place. These were not even affected by the changes to the means of production caused by technological change from 1903.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1444</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A metallurgical investigation of the bath smelting of composite organic and ferrous wastes</field><field name="creator">Street, Stuart John</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1479</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of zinc-nickel galvanized coating of silicon steels</field><field name="creator">Notowidjojo, Budi Dharma</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1480</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intelligent chip control and tool wear estimation in automated machining systems</field><field name="creator">Fang, Xiang Dong</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1585</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development and evaluation of a model of drug education for adolecents</field><field name="creator">Wragg, Jeffrey</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1686</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The knowledge building community project: a grounded theory of an alternative teacher education model</field><field name="creator">Kiggins, Julie Maree</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1800</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The times of our lives: women, leisure and postgraduate research</field><field name="creator">McCormack, Coralie</field><field name="description">This study explores the interconnections between leisure and postgraduate research in the lives of six women. The author and the text draw the reader into interactions to create meanings as the women tell their stories. The value of this thesis derives from its time perspective &#8212; the simultaneous view of the women's everyday lives 'across time' (across each woman's lifetime) and 'in time' (during her time as a postgraduate researcher).This research develops and documents a process I term storying stories as an alternative way to approach and re-present interview transcripts. In this three-stage process interview transcripts were viewed through multiple lenses &#8212; active listening, narrative processes, language, context and moments &#8212; to highlight both the individuality and the complexity of a life. The views highlighted by these lenses were then used to write interpretive stories. Finally the interpretive stories were brought together to form a personal experience narrative.These narratives portray how each woman resolved competing demands on her identity to reflexively construct a sense of self over time. Each woman's process of storying leisure revealed a more detailed picture of leisure as 'My Time' &#8212; time just for me &#8212; than has been revealed in the literature to date. The narratives highlighted the storylines (cultural fictions) each woman drew on to construct her leisure around the tension between 'time for me' and 'time for others'. Some women identified and challenged the existing storylines to make time and create spaces for leisure in their busy postgraduate lives.The innovative process of storying stories revealed that postgraduate study itself could be experienced as leisure, or at least tantalisingly leisure-like. Also revealed were the structures and strategies each woman drew upon to balance her life in this context. Some women's stories challenged the pattern of narrative closure suggested by the storylines most often available to women postgraduate researchers. This thesis provides the personal and collective knowledge of the postgraduate experience that is missing from both the texts currently available to postgraduates as well as from universities' postgraduate support programs.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1806</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigations into the molecular mechanism of apoptosis</field><field name="creator">Gilmore, Kerry June</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1865</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigations into the role of mitochandrial permeability transition in apoptosis</field><field name="creator">Smail, Alison</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1866</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The application of continuous conducting analogues for the solution of field problems</field><field name="creator">Thomas, I.

The thesis contains three main parts. First there is a study to characterise the emissions from forest fires in southeast Australia. This uses ground-based Fourier transform infrared solar absorption spectroscopy, coupled with ultra-violet/visible spectroscopy, to explore the properties of smoke plumes from Australian forest fires that passed over the observation site at Wollongong, in New South Wales, Australia (34.4&#176;S, 150.9&#176;E). The particulate loading in the smoke plumes is characterised by the aerosol optical depth, measured at visible wavelengths. Vertically integrated amounts of a several emitted trace gases are also determined, (limited to those detectable by solar absorption spectroscopy in the infrared). Enhanced trace gas amounts of carbon monoxide, hydrogen cyanide, formaldehyde, ammonia, acetylene, ethylene, ethane, formic acid and methanol were measured in the smoke plumes and quantified via the use of emission ratios. The emission ratios determined in this study indicate that emissions from fires in southeastern Australian forests (which are predominantly eucalypts) are broadly similar to those from other geographical regions except for comparatively low emissions of ethane. The second part of this thesis describes a new method of making estimates of gaseous emissions from fires. Strong correlations between trace gases and aerosol optical depth (AOD) in smoke plumes are used in conjunction with satellite-based measurements of AOD to estimate the total amounts of carbon monoxide and other gases emitted from the Canberra fires of 2003. There are significant difficulties with the new method, in particular the interruption of the satellite record due to clouds or technical problems with the satellite. Nevertheless the estimated emissions of carbon monoxide from the Canberra fires (4.9 &#8211; 9.6 Tg), is in agreement with an estimate made by existing techniques. The addition of another tool for making estimates of gaseous emissions from biomass burning is useful for corroborating existing techniques, especially since the sources ofuncertainties inherent in the different techniques are largely independent of one another. The third part of the thesis is a study to characterise the emissions from savanna fires in the tropical north of Australia. Again ground-based Fourier transform infrared solar absorption spectroscopy is used with automated measurements in the near infrared from a site in Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia, (12.4&#176;S, 130.9&#176;E). Alternatively measurements in the mid infrared can be made by overriding the automated system, and this has been done when there is evidence of significant smoke plumes in the area. Total column amounts of carbon monoxide from Darwin from 2005-2008 show a very clear annual cycle, with evidence of transported pollution from Indonesian fires in 2006. The time series agrees within the expected uncertainties with measurements of carbon monoxide derived from the MOPITT satellite instrument, giving greater confidence to MOPITT retrievals in the tropics. Mid infrared spectra have been recorded through smoke plumes over Darwin on 20 separate days, yielding column amounts of carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, acetylene, ethane and hydrogen cyanide and emission ratios with respect to carbon monoxide for the four latter gases from tropical north Australian savanna fires. Emission ratios for acetylene and ethane from this work are in broad agreement with other literature values, whilst emission ratios for formaldehyde and hydrogen cyanide are significantly higher than the only previous field measurements from Australian savannas (but in agreement with laboratory studies) suggesting storage losses in the earlier study.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3022</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Christian communication and its impact on Korean society : past, present and future</field><field name="creator">Lee, Soon Nim</field><field name="description">Background: Although it is historically acknowledged that the Republic of Korea (South) has become a modern democratic republic, very little has been written or researched about the processes that were involved in achieving this state and the role of Christian Communication in national development.  Traditionally, for many centuries, Korea was a feudal kingdom, known as the &#8216;Hermit Kingdom&#8217;.  How then, did the country move in a short space of time from this kingdom to the republic of today?  What were the most influential factors?Aims: The purpose of this thesis is to demonstrate that Christian Communication has been, and continues to be a major influence in the social and national development of modern Korea.Methods and procedures: First, to research the development of Christian Communication in the nation since the time of the last kingdom to the present time, an examination of historical documents and records were conducted.  Secondly, the lives of national leaders were examined and national identities were interviewed for their assessments of the impact of Christian Communication on the character of the nation.  Thirdly, the thesis explains the ongoing development of modern methods of Christian Communication and the continuous impact that they have on the nation.Outcome and results: Looking at the overall period from the 19th century to 2008, it is clear that Christian Communication has been one of the most important factors in the development of the character and society of South Korea. The initial decision of the early missionaries in the 1880s to use the old, common, but neglected Hanguel language was probably the most important decision in the life of any nation in the last 150 years.  Without the widespread use of this language and the consequent publishing of books and newspapers, Korea would still have been locked in the restrictive use of a Chinese script and traditional governmental methods. The general population would have been denied the possibility of national communication across all levels of society.  The people of Korea would not have been equipped to survive as a culture, under the Japanese occupation and, later, the catastrophic Korean War.Conclusion: Christian Communication, especially publishing in all its forms, has had a major impact on the character of the democratic life of the nation as seen in the rediscovery of Hanguel, as the modern language of communication and the development of various communications media pioneered by the early Christian leaders within Korea.This impact continues today through the use of the electronic as well as the more traditional methods of publishing.Without the dynamic Christian Communication in its many forms, Korea would not be the nation that it is today.  Its prosperity and its educational and social institutions would not have developed as rapidly and dramatically as it can be seen in most areas of national life. Keywords: Christian communication, Hanguel, publishing, newspapers, Japanese occupation, Christian political participation, radio, television, internet, leaders, missionaries.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3051</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design development amd utilisation of conducting polymer sensors</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Tuan Anh</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1131</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of transverse cold cracking in weld metal of a high strength quenched and tempered steel</field><field name="creator">Chen, Liang</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1485</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Natural convection in enclosures with localised heating and cooling</field><field name="creator">Kulkarni, Ratnakar</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1587</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reactors, radioisotopes, and the HIFAR controversy</field><field name="creator">Green, James</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1714</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of innovation capabilities on firm performance: an empirical study on industrial firms in China's transitional economy</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Jing</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2031</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The intensification of labour market polarisation in metals manufacturing in Australia in the 1900s</field><field name="creator">Mylett, Terri</field><field name="description">In Australia during the 1990s, jobs offered by employers had increasingly differentiated standards of wages, conditions and security. For some workers, this has meant experiencing wages and working conditions that challenge the Australian tradition that employment will be sufficient for avoiding poverty and securing the reproduction of labour. The trend of polarisation nationally was also evident in the Metals Manufacturing industry and in the lllawarra region. The two most significant developments in Metals Manufacturing in the 1990s were (i) the rise in casual employment (including labour hire); and (ii) the masculinisation of employment in the industry, including non-standard employment. These two developments occurred in the context of prolonged decline in total employment in Metals Manufacturing.Polarisation in Metals Manufacturing was most evident in wages, hours of work and by employment status. Studying polarisation in this industry revealed a dynamic relation between the degradation and polarisation of labour market standards. The disadvantages of casual employment relative to the advantages of permanent employment mean that its expansion contributed to polarisation. But employment decline and casualisation (particularly through labour hire and outsourcing) were found to have placed pressure on the standards and working conditions of permanent workers. So degradation was evident. Nevertheless, the declioe in employment and the casualisation of employment also made permanent work much more valuable because of its relative scarcity. This change in relativity between permanent and casual employment represents polarisation, regardless of the degradation in standards experienced by permanent workers.In keeping with labour market segmentation theory, it was found that labour market trends in the 1990s were constructed upon long-standing segmentation based on sex and language-background. However, segmentation in the Metals Manufacturing industry at the end of the 1990s is different from traditional labour market segmentation because labour market disadvantage is not limited to those workers traditionally considered to have secondary or marginal status because of their sex or language-background.The causes of polarisation were considered through the lens of labour market segmentation theory, which places most weight on the role of employers when explaining labour market advantage and disadvantage. Such an explanation was assessed relative to competing explanations provided by neo-classical labour economics and by Metals Manufacturing employers that gave market forces and the choices of individual employees most weight. Segmentation theory was shown to provide a much more plausible explanation of polarisation on empirical and ontological grounds.Extensive and intensive methods were used to reach this conclusion, with the research design guided by critical realism, geography and organisation theory as well as labour market segmentation theory. The research design was aimed at explaining the labour market in terms of causal relations at multiple levels, where levels were taken to be in an interconstitutive relation rather than separate (like the way that tiles can form a mosaic while retaining their own distinctiveness). The levels studied were: the nation, the region, the industry, the workplace and that of individual employees. The research design also depended on developing a more accurate and useful conception of the employer-labour market relation. Segmentation theorists have retained the internal labour market concept from neo-classical labour economics that impedes analysis of the way that actions of one employer can influence the actions of another. A new approach to understanding the employer-labour market relation that has more explanatory power is developed and applied in this thesis. It unpacks the employer-labour market relation by distinguishing employers singularly, employers singularly as an interactive group, and employers collectively. Considering the role of employers in this way provides deeper understanding of the contemporary spatial struggle in Metals Manufacturing between employers' preferences for an enterprise-level approach to industrial relations and trade unions' preferences for an industry-level approach, and the consequences of this struggle for industrial relations, gender equity and the management of labour.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2034</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exact integration of nonlinear differential equations</field><field name="creator">Roman-Miller, Lance</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2047</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling and control of conducting polymer actuators</field><field name="creator">John, Stephen William</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2066</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Claiming selfhood: three black South African women writersunder apartheid</field><field name="creator">Dean, Jeanette A.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2192</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Prospect and retrospect: a composer analyses thirteen of his own compositions</field><field name="creator">Dixon, John Wayne</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2261</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of commercialisation in restructuring the New South Wales public sector and the implication for industrial relations...</field><field name="creator">Johnson, Liwayway</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2290</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Planning and logistics in mining operations</field><field name="creator">Greenhill, G.

This technology became known as the intrauterine contraceptive device. By 1930 it enjoyed limited international success through its alliance with the International Sex Reform movement. The devices became linked with campaigns to take the suffrage struggle into the private sphere, a technological means for achieving modernity for women. In the 1960s the Population Council remade this contraceptive system as a mass produced global network of population control. Then in the 1970s the Dalkon Shield became synonymous with corporate misconduct. The women's health movement accused intrauterine device protagonists of exploiting women's inequality to produce a dangerous technology that was destroying women's health. Whilst copper intrauterine devices escaped the tarnish of the Dalkon Shield, the litigation over the Copper-7 that resulted in a punitive damages finding against Searle in 1988, resulted in a serious decline in further research into intrauterine devices. This thesis explores the production processes through which the discovery, success, development and failure of intrauterine devices were constructed.My work is a case study located at the intersection of feminist critiques of science and technology, and constructivist sociology of science. I investigate gendered outcomes of the heterogeneous negotiations that stabilise intrauterine device technologies, paying attention to the effects generated by the active participation of social movements in such negotiations. This study is informed by a modified actor network framework (Latour and Gallon), presenting the social, identity, the technical, the natural and the boundary between them as network effects. I focus on the translations of human and non-human actants constitutive of intrauterine device contraceptives as socio-technical networks, whether they occur in courts or in laboratories. I examine how authority is distributed to particular research sites, and how we learn to trust in numbers as calculations of risks and benefits. I suggest that such a form of story-telling about technologies opens novel possibilities for solidarity formation and collective engagement with sociotechnical networks, including issues of regulation and policy formation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1710</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The social shaping of children's manufactured toys</field><field name="creator">Varney, Wendy</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1721</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Metacognitive processes in reading</field><field name="creator">Winser, William N.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1788</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis and modelling of weld metal mechanical properties in flux cored arc welded steels</field><field name="creator">Tsuei, Hai-En</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1484</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The legal regime governing shipping in Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Chairijah,</field><field name="description">Marine development, particularly that of the shipping industry, constitutes an integral and essential element of Indonesia's on-going national progress in not only meeting the needs of the domestic movement of npassengers and trade, but also in supporting export and import activities.Sea transportation is still the cheapest, most effective and efficient type of transportation, particularly for the more isolated areas of Indonesia. Despite these benefits sea transportation is potentially risky. For this reason the development and management of shipping must be integrated with other areas of the economy by means of clear and sustainable planning.Obstacles to the rapid development and modernisation include the scarcity of qualified persons, insufficient facilities and infrastructure, hmited budgets, too few marine institutions, and a lack of strong interest in gaining expertise in the marine sector generally. However, significant strides have been made in Indonesia since the 1990s through Government's Long Term Development Plan (PJP).This thesis examines the regulatory framework governing shipping in Indonesia. The areas of focus are the development and implementation of the regulation of shipping and water transportation, including shipowners" responsibility, port management, search and rescue, and court jurisdiction. The thesis argues that the development of the shipping industry really needs to be supported by a proper legal framework, which is inadequate at the moment.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1861</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Force and low speed control in mechatronic systems with friction</field><field name="creator">Simpson, John William</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1947</field></doc><doc><field name="title">GP education in dual diagnosis</field><field name="creator">Marshall, Kellie Lynne</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2149</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An effective teaching model based on classroom observations of students with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder</field><field name="creator">Konza, Deslea</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1769</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of a correspondence fat loss program for men</field><field name="creator">Parrish, Anne-Maree</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2613</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Clich&#233;s, generations, space and friendship: the self-identity narratives of two entrepreneurs</field><field name="creator">Down, Simon</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2033</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mathematical modelling of corrosion measurements</field><field name="creator">El-Feki, Ahmed Ali</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2051</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An analysis of the Rakan Muda youth programme as a crime prevention mechanism in Malaysia</field><field name="creator">Ali, Kamsiah</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2236</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design of a programmable array manipulator</field><field name="creator">Ciufo, P.

The concept of integration impacting on the attitudinal development in this study is based on the socio-cultural perspectives of child development (Bronfenbrenner, 1989; Vygotsky, 1993) and the discourse of contact experience (Allport, 1954; Zajonc, 2001). Child development theorists advocate that children&#8217;s learning requires support structures such as informed adults to guide learning and that development is intricately intertwined with the socio-cultural contexts. Alternatively, contact theory suggests that the contact experience has an inherent positive impact on attitudes and behaviour. The 397 participants were grade 4 and grade 5 students from integrated and regular classes in integrated and regular schools in Singapore. Qualitative and quantitative methodologies were used to assess the attitudes of regular students in both integrated and regular classes towards people with disabilities. The participants completed a researcher-designed questionnaire, took part in focus group interviews and were observed in class. The integrated class teachers were also interviewed.This study supported the conclusion that an integrated learning environment had a significant impact on regular students&#8217; attitudes towards people with disabilities. In the quantitative study, regular students in integrated classrooms were found to have negative attitudes towards peers who had a disability. On the other hand, students in regular classes were found to be generally more able to appreciate the strengths of people with disabilities. The findings challenged the &#8216;contact model&#8217; that states that contacts with people with disabilities influence children&#8217;s attitudes in a positive way. The qualitative study highlighted the importance of the socio-cultural context and the quality of the contact experience in students&#8217; attitudes towards people with disabilities. It was found that contact which was supported by specific school and classroom programs at school and class level was associated with positive attitudes of regular students towards peers with disabilities. Such support programs promoted inclusive ideals, positive differentiation and provided opportunities for meaningful experiences. The study affirmed the significant role of the teacher in facilitating the positive contact experience. The integrated class with the teacher, who modelled positive communication that promoted acceptance and positive perception, was found to have more positive attitudes. The teachers in the integrated classes, where students&#8217; attitudes towards people with disabilities were found to be negative, were lacking in knowledge of special education and needed guidelines to intervene with their special needs students. This suggests that appropriately informed teaching practice that encourages social interaction among students could help reduce misunderstanding and stereotyping of people with disabilities. The social-cultural contexts at a broader level were also examined in this research.  It was found that societal aspirations for academic excellence had an impact on students. The students in this study displayed signs of being anxious over their academic performance being affected by the presence of peers with disabilities. Regular students perceived integration as acceptable only if it was not at the expense of their academic performance.The findings of this study have significant implications for the future of integration in Singaporean schools and understanding the impact of integration on regular students. The study affirmed that positive integrated learning experiences articulated through supportive school cultures, effective classroom practice and enlightened teachers could affect regular students&#8217; attitudes towards people with disabilities in a positive way. However, an achievement-focused culture can impact on students&#8217; acceptance of people with disabilities. Achievement pressure experienced by regular students is entwined with societal values and this can challenge the potential outcomes of integration programs in the Singaporean context.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3037</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Study of methane gas migration in coal sorption tests</field><field name="creator">Siahaan, Boni B.S.N.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/866</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The distributed server network design problem</field><field name="creator">Stacey, Christopher Howard</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1360</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On steady and unsteady free-surface flows</field><field name="creator">Yinglong, Yinglong</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1557</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Voiced identity: a study of central characters in seven operas from Australia 1988-1998</field><field name="creator">Power, Anne</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1761</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Flux pinning behaviour of different types of Bi2212 single crystals</field><field name="creator">Uprety, Krishna Kamal</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2540</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Numerical methods used in neutronics calculations</field><field name="creator">Pollard, John P.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2934</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regulation of tissue oxygen levels in the ocular lens</field><field name="creator">McNulty, Richard</field><field name="description">Age-related nuclear cataract is a major cause of blindness and is thought to result from oxidation of key cellular  omponents. Molecular oxygen (O2) is a possible oxidant in this process. The aim of this thesis was to investigate the regulation of tissue O2 levels in the ocular lens. We mapped the distribution of O2 within isolated lenses using a fluorescent optode. All lenses examined (bovine, rabbit and human) showed U-shaped Po2 profiles across both the optic and equatorial axes resulting in core hypoxia. When equilibrated in physiological conditions (Po2 environment of 36mmHg), the lens nucleus Po2 was 1.6 &#177; 0.5 mmHg (n=6), 12.5 &#177; 2.5 mmHg (n=6), and 13.8 &#177; 7.6 mmHg (n=24 pairs) in the bovine, rabbit and human lens, respectively.We examined a possible role of Po2 gradients on the development of the embryonic chicken lens. The lens contains two populations of fibre cells, differentiating fibers (DF) in the outer cortex that contain a full complement of organelles (including mitochondria), and mature fibers (MF) in the lens core that do not. Incubating chicken embryos in hyperoxic conditions resulted in larger lenses and an increase in the depth of the DF population compared to lenses from embryos raised in normoxia. This is consistent with the hypothesis that hypoxia triggers the elimination of organelles from the lens.The consumption of O2 by the lens was region-dependent. Both respirometric measurements (performed on dissected regions of the bovine lens) and a diffusion/consumption mathematical model showed that approximately 90% of O2 consumption occurred in the cortex, the remainder occurring in the core which contains only MF. The distribution of mitochondria in the DF layer was mapped using 2-photon or confocal microscopy on living lenses treated with mitochondria-specific dyes (rhodamine 123 or Mito Tracker) and in fixed tissue by immunofluorecence using an antibody to cytochrome c-oxidase. The depth of the mitochondria-containing cell layer varied in different species, being 500-760 &#956;m in the bovine lens and 50-100 &#956;m in the human. The Po2 gradients in the lens extended beyond the boundaries of the mitochondria-containing DF layer, consistent with a role for non-mitochondrial O2 consumption (albeit a minor one) in the MF region in the intact lens. We therefore examined both mitochondrial and nonmitochondrial processes which may be responsible for modulating lens O2 levels. Mitochondria-inhibition studies showed that the contribution of oxidative phosphorylation to bovine lens QO2 was approximately 90%. Interestingly, mitochondria-inhibiting drugs and age had an insignificant effect on human lens QO2. Ascorbate, found in high levels in the lens, was investigated as an O2 consumer. Bovine and human lens core O2 consumption could be induced by metals and inhibited by the metal-chelator DETAPAC, characteristics which are consistent with ascorbate-dependent O2 consumption. We found no evidence for a role for a trans-plasma membrane oxido-reductase system or photo-oxidation as nonmitochondrial O2 consumers.The movement of O2 through the lens tissue was studied by decreasing lens QO2. Sub-physiological temperatures resulted in a marked decrease in lens QO2 and a concomitant flooding of the lens core with O2. The rapid rise in lens Po2 at lower temperatures may be of clinical relevance. During vitrectomy, cool, O2-rich solutions are infused into the eye. We hypothesise that rising lens core O2 levels during vitrectomy are the cause of the strikingly high incidence of post-vitrectomy nuclear cataract. We have initiated a clinical study to examine whether the use of warmed solutions during surgery can decrease the incidence of post-vitrectomy cataract.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/652</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of red meat consumption and high-intensity resistance training of skeletal muscle strength, muscle mass and functional status in healthy older adults</field><field name="creator">Gutteridge, Irene Fe</field><field name="description">With the older adult representing an increasingly large percentage of the Western world, attempts are being sought to improve their healthy aging through various modes of prevention. The age-associated declines that occur in the physiological and functional systems along with levels of physical activity and quality of life have the potential to be attenuated and ameliorated with various forms of health-related interventions. It has been suggested that intake of dietary protein in the elderly may be too low to sustain normal muscle mass and red meat intake declines in the over 65 y age group in Australia.The present study examined the effects of a high-intensity resistance training program and two levels of red meat intake on skeletal muscle strength, body composition and other health-related markers in healthy, community-dwelling older adults. Twenty-eight healthy male and female subjects with mean age (&#177;SD) of 67 &#177;3 y and randomized to either a moderate (400g/wk) or high (800g/wk) red meat diet, completed a supervised twice weekly, twelve week high-intensity resistance training program of the lower extremities. The moderate meat diet represented the usual intake for older Australians over 65 y. Diet histories, body composition assessments, mid-thigh CT scans, grip strength, lower extremity performance, physical activity levels, one-mile walk test, fasted blood samples and morning urine samples were taken at baseline and twelve weeks. Four repetition maximum strength testing of the lower extremity was undertaken at pre-, mid- and postintervention.Leg strength was greater in males than in females and this was strongly associated with their muscle mass and stature independent of gender. Age related declines in grip strength and leg muscle strength were evident at baseline. Resistance training significantly increased leg muscle strength &gt;50% (p&lt;0.001) irrespective of gender and age but grip strength (not targeted by the training program) remained unchanged. In subjects on the higher meat diet, mid-intervention leg press strength improvements were greater than those seen with the moderate meat diet (p&lt;0.01), although significant differences between diets were not sustained at week twelve.  The sum of seven skinfolds (mm) decreased significantly in all subjects with training (131.2&#177;8.8 to 119.9&#177;7.3, p&lt;0.001) and significant improvement to the proportion of cross-sectional area of thigh muscle and thigh fat were measured in the non-dominant leg (p&lt;0.05). Physical activity levels and lower extremity performance remained unchanged. The high red meat diet provided additional short-term benefits for building muscle strength without compromising cardiovascular disease risk factors, but in the longer term had no additional beneficial effects to strength and functional parameters.In summary, healthy older adults exhibit an age related decline in strength, yet all have the capacity to greatly increase strength with muscle specific exercise training.  Marked increases in strength can be rapidly achieved with short term high intensity resistance training. Resistance training is well tolerated and can be recommended for improving strength and enhancing other health-related parameters as part of a prevention based healthy aging strategy.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/813</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Building a prototype for quality information retrieval from the World Wide Web</field><field name="creator">Kc, Milly Wei-Tsen</field><field name="description">Given the phenomenal rate by which the World Wide Web is changing, retrieval methods and quality assurance have become bottleneck issues for many information retrieval services on the Internet, e.g. Web search engine designs. In this thesis, approaches that increase the efficiency of information retrieval methods, and provide for quality assurance of information obtained from the Web, are developed through the implementation of a quality-focused information retrieval system. A novel approach to the retrieval of quality information from the Internet is introduced. Implemented as a component of a vertical search application, this results in a focused crawler which is capable of retrieving quality information from the Internet. The three main contributions of this research are: (1) An effective and flexible crawling application that is well-suited for information retrieving tasks on the dynamic World Wide Web (WWW) is implemented. The resulting crawling application (crawler) is designed after having observed the dynamics of the web evolution through regular monitoring of the WWW; it also addresses the shortcomings of some existing crawlers, therefore presenting itself as a practical implementation. (2) A mechanism that converts human quality judgement through user surveys into an algorithm is developed, so that user perceptions of a set of criteria which may lead to determination of the quality content on the web page concerned, can be applied to a large amount of Web documents with minimal manual effort. This was obtained through a relatively large user survey which was conducted in a collaborative research work with Dr Shirlee-Ann Knight of Edith Cowan University. The survey was conducted to determine what criteria Web documents are perceived to meet to qualify as a quality document. This results in an aggregate numeric score for each web page between 0 and 1 respectively indicating that it does not meet any quality criteria, or that it meets all quality criteria perfectly. (3) This research proposes an approach to predict the quality of a web page before it is retrieved by a crawler. The approach allows its incorporation into a vertical search application which focuses on the retrieval of quality information. Experimental results on real world data show that the proposed approach is more effective than any other brute force approaches which have been published so far. The proposed methods produce a numerical quality score for any text based Web document. This thesis will show that such score can also be used as a web page ranking criterion for horizontal search engines. As part of this research project, this ranking scheme has been implemented and embedded into a working search engine. The observed user feedback confirms that search results when ranked by quality score, satisfy user needs more satisfactorily than when ranked by other popular ranking schemes such as PageRank or relevancy ranking. It is also investigated whether the combination of quality score with existing ranking schemes can further enhance the user experience with search engines.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/858</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A specialised upper body exercise system for injury risk reduction in adolescent rugleague players</field><field name="creator">Ritchie, Peter Gordon</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/967</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of the role of trust in the relationship between pension fund trustees and investment managers: an Indonesian case study</field><field name="creator">Wintoro, Djoko</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1017</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of European honeybees (Apis mellifera) on the pollination ecology of bird-and insect-adapted Australian plants</field><field name="creator">Celebrezze, Thomas Martin</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1046</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of reproduction and dispersal on the population structure of a freshwater ostracod</field><field name="creator">Chaplin, Jennifer Ann</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1078</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Asymmetric synthesis of proline derivatives</field><field name="creator">Javidan, Abdollah</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1116</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Conducting polymer electrodes for electrochemical detection of amino acids and haloacetic acids</field><field name="creator">Akhtar, Parveen</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1126</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Some analytical applications of chemically modified electrodes</field><field name="creator">Riley, Peter John</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1173</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of novel immunosuppressant drugs: the synthesis of thiazole analogues of 2-acetyl-1', 2', 3', 4' - tetrahydroxybutylimidazole</field><field name="creator">Jeoffreys, George Robert</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1204</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dynamic investigation of semi-rigid tubular T-joints</field><field name="creator">Hoshyari, Iraj</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1240</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Engineering geologic factors influencing the stability of slopes in the northern Illawarra region</field><field name="creator">Ghobadi, Mohammad Hossein</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1244</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Numerical and experimental modelling of sedimentation tanks</field><field name="creator">Lowe, Scott Arthur</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1253</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Attitudes of Australian small business firms and financial institutions towards the profit/loss sharing method of finance</field><field name="creator">Jalaluddin, Abul</field><field name="description">Small business firms usually obtain finance from commercial lenders on fixed or variable rates of interest. These businesses, or any other borrower for that matter, will have to pay back the principal borrowed along with its stipulated interest at the end of the specified period. They are willing to pay the interest on the loan over and above the principal borrowed because they expect the borrowed amount of capital would make a marginal contribution in their profit at least equal to the total interest paid. They are legally liable for the payment of the interest and the principal regardless of their actual level of earnings. They must make these payments as per contract even if they suffer heavy losses in the project. This arrangement, which is common in most, if not all countries of the world, may cause a great deal of hardship on the part of the borrowers, especially at times of economic slowdown.There is a method of finance called profit/loss sharing practiced in some South-East Asian and Middle Eastern countries. A number of financial institutions in the Western countries including UK, Denmark, Luxembourg and Switzerland has been applying this method since the early 1980s.The main objective of this thesis is to find out the attitudes towards, motivations for and probability of using the profit/loss sharing principle of finance by the Australian small businesses and financial institutions. Two surveys were conducted to achieve this objective. Multivariate statistical analysis, especially factor analysis, discriminant analysis and logit and probit regressions, was applied to the survey results.Factor analysis identified five factors which may explain why small businesses are motivated to borrow funds using the profit/loss sharing method of finance. These factors are business support, risk sharing, risk of default in the traditional system, cost of borrowing and suitability of the profit/loss sharing method. Another three factors were identified to provide reasons why small businesses would not borrow funds using this new principle namely, terms of borrowing, management intervention and high cost of borrowing.Discriminant analysis indicates that risk sharing between borrowers and lenders is the most important predictor in discriminating between the two groups of small businesses those who would and those who would not like to borrow funds using this method. The other discriminating variables include motivation for business expansion, cost of borrowing and management intervention.The logit and probit models show that the higher the degree of risk sharing, the lesser the cost of borrowing and the greater the motivation to business expansion, the higher the probability that the small businesses would apply the profit/loss sharing method. The respondents also indicated that the lower the degree of management intervention, the higher the likelihood that the small businesses would be prepared to apply this method of finance.A large number of variables determining the motives of financial institutions to lend funds on the basis of the profit/loss sharing method were reduced to four factors namely, business support, growth in demand for funds, risk of default under the traditional system and potential higher return to lenders. At least three underlying factors may explain why some financial institutions would not like to lend funds on this basis namely, management complication, unfamiliarity of the profit/loss sharing method and risk sharing with borrowers.Discriminant analysis applied to financial institutions suggests that the growth in demand for funds is the most important predictor in discriminating between the financial institutions who are prepared to lend money on the basis of the profit/loss sharing method and those who are not. The other significantly discriminating variables include the potential higher return on funds, depositors' concern, monetary regulation, management complexity and risk sharing with borrowers.As a majority of the responding small businesses (59.5%) are willing to borrow and a sizeable percentage of the financial institutions (41.2%) are willing to lend funds on the principle of the profit/loss sharing, the Australian monetary authority could consider offering this new method of finance as an integral part of the Australian financial system.The financial institutions may introduce the new method on a trial basis to selected customers. The financial institutions should find some mechanisms to minimise the concerns of depositors for lending their money using this principle, perhaps through obtaining prior consent of depositors in this regard. They should also conduct serious research in the areas of simplified business performance monitoring, auditing and record keeping to minimise the cost of lending and secure a greater share of the market.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1313</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reconstruction algorithms for electrical impedance tomography</field><field name="creator">Chen, Z.

From 1907 that history is the history of the Clothing and Allied Trades' Union, an organisation established in that year under the aegis of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration.The Introduction establishes explicit organising questions and themes and locates them within current debates about labour history. The Introduction asks the question: 'what is the Clothing Trades' Union?' The thesis examines how this question has been answered by unionists themselves and it examines the circumstances under which those solutions have been conceived. This requires an analysis of the industry itself and of the economic and social structures of which it is a part.The first three chapters examine the origins of the Union. They show that at the very founding of the Union, there were tensions within the new structure and contradictions in the forces which shaped it. These are important because they are themes which are addressed in all the subsequent chapters. Although the Union was formally a law-made organisation, it was not only that. It was created by craft unions which had traditions of workshop control and resistance. These led to conflict with the needs of state-based arbitration. Second, the constituent unions were very different from each other. Although many craftsmen believed in the principle of amalgamation, there was neither a need nor a desire for a powerful Federal structure.A deeper series of contradictions lay in the nature of the industry. By 1907 the clothing trade was already overwhelmingly a female trade but the most durable unions were those of male artisans. They carried with them craft motifs of control and exclusivism which were directed as much against women as employers. Because of social practice, the nature of work and union traditions, women were poorly placed to exercise control within the Union.Chapters Four and Five show how industrial and political change led to conflicts about arbitration itself. The Union was torn between competing ideologies before the principle of Commonwealth arbitration was restored in 1919. Chapters Six and Seven deal with the inter-war years and they explain how, after a period of industrial militancy and political unity, the Union relied increasingly upon arbitration and was unable to develop policies to defend the mass of its membership. The Depression of the 1930s fractured what unity there was and the autonomy of the Branches again increased.The state gave greater impetus to centralism and" enhanced Federal Council's authority as against the Branches because of the needs of War-time planning. Chapter Eight discusses this trend and its reversal after 1945. The final chapter examines more explicitly than any other the question of the nature and purpose of unionism. It argues that this is largely how the split in the labour movement in the 1950s should be understood. Although the more radical groups triumphed, they did so on terms which meant that the Union's structure was little changed and that, indeed, the definition of trade union activity was no wider than in the past.The Union was and is a loose amalgamation of relatively autonomous State Branches under a weak and self-styled non-political Federal Council. The thesis concludes that this structure has its origins in the arbitration system and has been sustained by both the differences between Branches and the limitations to those differences. Industrial and social stability meant that the Union itself was stable. Underpinning and explaining the nature of union structure and practice is the tension between two forms of organisation: craft and industrial unionism. Despite the nature of the industry it is the former which has held sway.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1421</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Boundary integral method applied to cavitation bubble dynamics</field><field name="creator">Bachok, Bachok Bin</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1542</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"Kept in": an examination of the impact of prolonged multiple demands upon women employed in a Catholic secondary school</field><field name="creator">Vezgoff, Patricia Margaret</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1722</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of an Australian classification and costing system for palliative care, rehabilitaion and aged care services</field><field name="creator">Eagar, K.

This is important given women&#8217;s considerable and continuing influence on family food decisions and their reported use of magazines as a source of information in the media. Women frequently cite women&#8217;s magazines to be an important source of nutrition information, however few studies have investigated this relationship in depth. It is important to understand how women use the information in women&#8217;s magazines and to what extent they have the potential to influence the food decisions women make on a day to day basis.The principle objective of this study was to gain insight into the food and nutrition issues considered to be of importance among women and in popular women&#8217;s magazines. This project aimed to identify similarities and differences in the food and nutrition issues raised by women and those presented in women&#8217;s magazines in order to provide insight into the role women&#8217;s magazines have in the provision of food and nutrition information to women. This study was conducted in three parts.The first study involved focus group discussions with three cohorts of women, that is, teenage girls aged 13-16 years, and women aged 25-34 years and 45-54 years. Nine focus groups were conducted. This study provided insight into women&#8217;s use and perceptions of women&#8217;s magazines and aided in the development of the content analysis instrument. Results indicated that participants in this study did not actively seek nutrition information from magazines. Rather, magazines primarily operated as an incidental source of information, and nutrition information acted as a feature that helped to sell one magazine over another. Learning about current nutrition issues was generally not the participants&#8217; motivation for buying women&#8217;s magazines. Participants also indicated that they did not place a high degree of trust in, and were skeptical of, the information presented in women&#8217;s magazines.The second study involved two semi-structured interviews with approximately half the women from each cohort who participated in the focus group discussions. Each woman participated in two semi-structured interviews. The first interview was conducted approximately five months after the focus groups and the second interview four months after the first interview. The interviews provided insight into the food and nutrition concerns of women. The results indicated that participants were not anxious about food and nutrition issues and did not think about food and nutrition in a risk framework. Weight concerns and the desire to lose weight were the most frequently discussed food and nutrition issue among all groups of women. Non-weight concerns were more likely to be raised by women who had current health concerns for themselves or someone in their family.The third study consisted of a 12 month content analysis of eight popular women's magazines. This study was conducted concurrently with the semistructured interviews. Magazines were analysed for the food and nutrition content of advertisements, editorial items and cover headlines. This study provided insight into the food and nutrition messages presented in women's magazines.The results of this study indicated that magazine advertising content is largely dominated by advertisements for non-core products (i.e. foods that were not listed as a part of the core food groups according to the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating (Commonwealth of Australia 1998). Advertisements were also more likely to use consumer related statements as primary promotion messages. The majority of nutrition related statements were related to general nutrition. Results of the content analysis of editorial content highlighted that the predominant food and nutrition messages related to dieting and weight loss, followed by food or product specific articles. The dominance of dieting and weight loss messages was also reflected in magazine headlines. The content analysis demonstrated clear inconsistencies in the food and nutrition messages they presented to women and were surprising in the limited presentation of food and nutrition issues that could be considered of direct interest to women such as osteoporosis, nutrition and aging or vegetarianism.This thesis demonstrated a close alignment between the food and nutrition concerns of women and the issues presented to them via the content of women&#8217;s magazines. Both the women who participated in focus groups and semistructured interviews and the content of women&#8217;s magazines content analysed have a very narrow focus regarding food and nutrition issues. Weight concern related to self identity (but not health) was the main concern raised by both the women and the magazines. This close alignment supports the findings of previous surveys where women have self reported that they consider magazines an important source of food and nutrition information. However it is not possible in this study to determine the direction of this alignment, that is, whether the magazines responded to or acted to lead women&#8217;s food and nutrition concerns.In addition, it was evident from the content analysis that magazines were driven by the commercial imperative to sell products, including food and nutrition products, to women. Interestingly, the women who participated in the focus group discussions identified that women&#8217;s magazines aimed to sell them products. Despite this, the women who participated in the semi-structured interviews indicated that magazines did raise their awareness of some food and nutrition issues.This study has highlighted the potential for health professionals to utilise women&#8217;s magazines to raise a broader range of food and nutrition issues, and to provide the necessary &#8216;expert credence&#8217; sought by the women. However, this involvement of health professionals should be within the &#8216;recreational&#8217; and entertainment context of the role of magazines in women&#8217;s lives. The women in this study clearly identified that they primarily buy magazines for the entertainment they provide. It is therefore important that health professionals learn to position broader food and nutrition issues within an entertainment framework.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/859</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A finite element approach to molecular vibration</field><field name="creator">Hamilton, Margaret Joan</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1539</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Techniques for low-rate scalable compression of speech signals</field><field name="creator">Lukasiak, Jason</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1852</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Accountablilty and accounting in a religious organisation: an interpretive ethnographic study of the Pentecostal Church of Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Saerang, David Paul</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1902</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Osmoregulation in cyanobacteria</field><field name="creator">Mackay, Mark Alexander</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2616</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Shocks in the internal tide on the Australian North West Shelf</field><field name="creator">Pincombe, Adrian Hall</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2656</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The dynamics of barchans and dome dunes Namib Desert, Namibia</field><field name="creator">Hastings, Kathleen</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2825</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quest for aboriginality: the WilDoctor of Creative Artst novels of Mudrooroo</field><field name="creator">Rosser, Garry</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2197</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Calculation of resonance absorption in heterogeneous reactor systems</field><field name="creator">Chiarella, Carl</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2932</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Philips hot-gas engine and its application to refrigeration</field><field name="creator">Street, Ron</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3010</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Use of aerofoils for flow measurement</field><field name="creator">Woods, K.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3017</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Use of solar power for domestic water heating</field><field name="creator">Boetje, J.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3018</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring novel radiotherapy techniques with Monte Carlo simulation and measurement</field><field name="creator">Nettelbeck, Heidi</field><field name="description">This work is the first comprehensive investigation of potential changes in the radiobiological effectiveness of clinical photon beams caused by a redistribution of electrons in a magnetic field. It is also a fundamental study of both the influence of magnetic fields on the peak-to-valley dose ratio of microbeams and the accuracy of theoretical modelling for dose planning in Microbeam Radiation Therapy (MRT).The application of a strong transverse magnetic field to a volume undergoing irradiation by a photon beam can produce localised regions of dose enhancement and dose reduction. Results from Monte Carlo PENELOPE simulation show regions of enhancement and reduction of as much as 111% and 77% respectively for magnetic fields of 1 to 100 T applied to Co60, 6, 10, 15, and 24 MV photon beams. The dose redistribution is shown to occur predominantly through an alteration in the lower energy electron population, which may correspond to a change in the relative biological effectiveness. In MRT, an experimental and theoretical investigation of the influence of transverse and longitudinal magnetic fields on the lateral dose profile and peak-to-valley dose ratio (PVDR) of microbeams is presented. Results show that longitudinal magnetic fields greater than 10 T are needed to produce an effect. Strong transverse magnetic fields, on the other hand, have no influence on microbeam profiles. The radiation response of the edge-on MOSFET and its ability to measure dose profiles of monoenergetic and polyenergetic microbeams are also investigated.Simulations investigating the dependence of microbeam dose profiles on the accuracy of beamline modelling (i.e. synchrotron source, multislit collimator, and beam divergence) are also presented. Results show the asymmetric collimator construction is responsible for a 10% variation in the full-width at half-maximum of microbeams which affects the PVDR. Modelling the distributed source and beam divergence increases the penumbral dose by almost 30%. The influence of the collimator alignment, interaction medium, and the height of scoring regions on the PVDR are also investigated.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3024</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Statistical tolerances for concrete road pavement surfaces</field><field name="creator">Ollis, James Edward</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2917</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Control valves</field><field name="creator">Hodges, D.

The colonial home is recognised as a highly charged political site crucial to colonial projects. The domestic service relationship has been conceptualised as a symbol and a site of colonial power. The literature on colonial domestic service is, however, limited by three key factors. The notion that only European homes constitute &#8216;colonial&#8217; homes, the focus on the white mistress as the key domestic actor regardless of historical period and the lack of analysis of the master-male servant relationship has ensured an incomplete understanding of the dynamics of colonial power. This thesis addresses these limitations by undertaking a comparative and transcolonial history of domestic service and colonialism in Darwin and Singapore from the 1890s to the 1930s. The thesis considers the politics of colonial intimacy beyond European homes, taking masculinity into consideration, and, with an understanding of how colonial home-life was subject to change. I analyse male and female domestic servants from a variety of ethnic groups &#8211; including Chinese, Malay and Australian Aboriginals &#8211; working in Chinese and European homes. I argue that in Darwin and Singapore a &#8216;transcolonial culture of domestic service&#8217; developed. This term describes the commonalities in the structure of the domestic workforce in these two sites, the shared discourses surrounding servitude and mastery which circulated and the common domestic dilemmas which employers of servants lamented. The notion of a transcolonial culture of domestic service is not just a description of commonalities. It offers a framework of analysis which draws attention to how factors within specific colonial encounters, influences between colonial sites and forces at a global level impacted on the colonial home and the domestic service relationship.The combination of a comparative approach and the notion of a transcolonial culture of domestic service raises new questions and points of discussion which can be used to think outside the confines of the &#8216;colonial home&#8217; as it has been conceptualised. It points to the importance of previously untheorised domestic power relations, including the power of white men over non-white men in the home, the power of servants to determine the course of household change and the colonial significance of domestic power in non-European homes.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3041</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Art one one: an artist's analysis of ambiguities in contemporary Formosan art</field><field name="creator">Chen, Yin-Wei</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/914</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of a subsurface lime-fly ash barrier in the mitigation of acid sulphate soils</field><field name="creator">Banasiak, Laura Joan</field><field name="description">The effectiveness of using a sub-surface lime-fly ash barrier to reduce the oxidation of a pyritic soil layer and to improve groundwater and surface water quality was investigated for land affected by acid sulphate soils near Berry in southeastern NSW, Australia. Prior to the installation of the lime-fly ash barrier, groundwater and surface water analyses indicated a highly acidic environment. High concentrations of dissolved aluminium, total iron and sulphate in the groundwater were a result of falling groundwater tables and biotic oxidation. Traditional management techniques of ground water manipulation, via floodgates or weirs, would be rendered ineffective in arresting biotic oxidation where the pyrite layer is submerged. The study combined field and laboratory analysis in order to determine the feasibility of the lime-fly ash barrier at the study site. A comprehensive field study incorporated the installation of piezometers and observation wells to determine the level of the phreatic surface along with the monitoring of water quality parameters at the site of the lime-fly ash barrier, and also floodgate sites and the site of the self-regulating tilting weir. The installation of the lime-fly ash barrier was undertaken by the pumping of a slurry through boreholes via pressure pumping. The subsurface lime-fly ash barrier, as an acid sulphate soil remediation technique, was shown to significantly improve groundwater quality. Groundwater pH increased to values between 4.5 and 5.5. The concentration of the pyritic oxidation products, acidic cations Al&#179;+ and Fetotal, basic cations Ca&#178;+ and Mg&#178;+ and anions Cl- and SO4&#178; -, also, on average decreased in the groundwater after the installation of the lime-fly ash barrier. A comparison between the average roundwater table elevations before and after the installation of the barrier also indicated a perched water table, which would reduce the exposure of pyritic soil to oxygen, and in turn reduce pyritic oxidation and the generation of acidic products. The Lime-fly ash barrier is effective in remediating acid sulphate soils in areas in which floodgates and weirs cannot be installed. A comparison of the result shows that the lime-fly ash barrier had greater success in increasing the groundwater pH than the self-regulating tilting weir. The lime-fly ash barrier treats acid sulphate soils and the related environmental problems before they occur, whereas, the floodgates treat the pyrite oxidation products generated after they have been discharged into the flood mitigation drains. Significantly greater concentrations of Al&#179;+, Fetotal and SO4 &#178;- were found in the groundwater at the floodgate sites.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/391</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of postweld heat treatment of quenched and tempered pressure vessel steels</field><field name="creator">Sterjovski, Zoran</field><field name="description">Longitudinal and circumferential welds in transportable pressure vessels are produced by submerged-arc welding using a single vee preparation and multiple weld runs. Quenched and tempered (QT) steels, which are commonly used for transportable pressure vessels, require mandatory postweld heat treatment (PWHT) regardless of the plate thickness. During their life transportable pressure vessels may have up to four PWHT cycles, and concerns have emerged about possible effects on material properties such as hardness, tensile strength, impact toughness and fracture toughness.This thesis reports on the weld procedure, microstructural evaluation and various mechanical properties (bend, yield strength, tensile strength, elongation, fatigue, impact toughness, CTOD fracture toughness and hardness) for 11 mm, 12 mm and 20 mm QT steel weldments. The 11 mm and 20 mm base plates investigated were BIS80PV, which is a pressure vessel grade steel. The 12 mm plate was BIS80, which is structural grade steel but deemed a possible candidate for pressure vessels due to superior impact and fracture toughness properties over currently used QT pressure vessel steels. The parent metal, heat affected zone and weld metal regions of each weldment were examined, and then exposed to temperatures and times in the PWHT range.Although there was no apparent change in microstructure at an optical level and little change in hardness for up to four postweld heat treatments, there was a marked decrease in hardness of the parent metal for more extensive heat treatments (increasing Holloman parameter). There was also evidence of minor secondary hardening in the 11 mm and 20 mm BIS80PV parent plate following short heat treatment times. The weld metal (WM) and HAZ hardness typically decreased with one PWHT cycle and subsequently stabilised with further PWHT cycles.For all test plates, results are also presented for Charpy V-notch impact tests in the parent metal, HAZ and weld metal region, and CTOD fracture toughness tests in the PM region. The effect of exposure to multiple PWHT cycles on these properties is discussed. A decrease in impact energy and fracture toughness with an increase in the number of heat treatments was evident in the parent metal. In contrast, the weld metal showed a decrease in impact energy after two PWHT cycles, and then an increase towards the original impact energy after a further two cycles.In PM samples, which have been extensively tempered in the manufacturing process, the mechanism by which toughness properties are affected by cumulative PWHT holding time is through the coarsening and coalescence of second phase carbide particles. These particles decrease impact energy by the formation of larger voids in the plastic zone ahead of the crack tip or by the initiation of cleavage fracture. These two phenomena decrease the energy required for fracture.In WM with an as-solidified structure, ductile failure in the form of void coalescence is initiated by non-metallic inclusions. This leads to an initially high impact toughness, which then decreases after PWHT because of the nucleation and coarsening of metastable Fe3C precipitates that promote quasi-cleavage type fracture. Upon exposure to further PWHT cycles the impact energy begins to increase again due to the dissolution of the metastable carbides and the formation of finer, more stable carbides based on elements such as Cr, Mo, Ni and Nb. This change in the form of the carbide promotes localised fracture by micro-plasticity, with void formation and coalescence.Additionally, cross-weld root bend (180&#176;) and tensile tests were carried out before and after PWHT. None of the bend samples showed any evidence of  cracking or tearing, hence confirming the ductility of the weldment. The tensile properties of the BIS80PV cross-weld samples complied with the Australian Standards, but the tensile properties of the BIS80 cross-weld samples only complied in the as-welded condition.Tensile properties of the PM showed no significant trends with the number of PWHT cycles and the fatigue crack growth rate increased slightly in relation to the number of PWHT cycles or PWHT holding time.One of the primary roles of PWHT is to reduce residual stresses caused by the welding process. Residual stress measurements using the hole drilling method were made to ascertain the need for PWHT. Residual stresses, measured in the weld centre-line by the hole drilling technique, were compressive along both the longitudinal and transverse directions and were no greater than 250 MPa (between 0.2-0.5 times the yield strength at room temperature). Although, the presence of residual stresses (tensile and compressive) of greater magnitude is not excluded, the residual stress measurements demonstrated that PWHT significantly reduced the magnitude of the residual stresses.The ability to predict the impact energy of a pressure vessel steel subjected to various cumulative PWHT holding times is beneficial to pressure vessel inspectors, who are misguidedly instructed to be wary of the mechanical properties of vessels after 6 hours of cumulative PWHT holding time. The original impact energy of the steel, which is determined by its chemical composition, microstructure and thermo-mechanical treatment determines the cumulative PWHT time before the impact properties of the QT steel decrease below the specified 40 J limit at &#8211;20&#176;C. An artificial neural network (ANN) model has been developed using an artificial neural network to predict the effect of PWHT time and other variables such as composition and test temperature on impact energy. This ANN model provides a valuable design tool for predicting impact toughness as a function of composition, heat treatment and testing conditions.Finally, the performance of BIS80 was evaluated and its superior impact  oughness and fracture toughness properties over BIS80PV were confirmed. However, the tensile properties of postweld heat-treated 12 mm BIS80 cross-weld samples did not comply with AS3597, the Australian Standard for QT steels; and the PM stress ratio exceeded the specified limit of 0.93. These &#8216;deficiencies&#8217; could be remedied by (i) discarding PWHT or (ii) using a high strength WM; and (iii) abandoning or relaxing the stress ratio requirement, which is of questionable significance, under conditions of high strain rate impact loading (road collision).</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/464</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation on advanced active materials for lithium-ion batteries</field><field name="creator">Chen, Yao</field><field name="description">The objectives of the Ph.D project were: (1) to prepare and study advanced active materials with high capacity and long cycle life for rechargeable lithium ion batteries; (2)to understand the relationship between the structural, physical, and  lectrochemical properties of the electrode materials; (3) to identify the main parameters which are responsible for the differences in electrochemical behaviour. In this study, several methods have been used to improve the performance of electrodes, including element substitution, synthesis methods, carbon-enriching, etc.A starting point for the study was a survey of the literature pertaining to the cathode and anode materials for lithium ion batteries. Many different electrode materials are described. The thesis provides a detailed description of the status of current research and development in electrode materials for lithium ion batteries. A variety of cathode materials have been investigated. Some of them have shown good electrochemical performance when used in lithium ion cells. Electroactive LiCoxMnyNi1- x-yO2 powders were prepared from lithium compounds and CoxMnyNi1-x-y(OH)2 precursor by heating at 850-900 &#176;C.High density spherical LiCo0.25Ni0.75O2 compounds were synthesized from lithium compounds and spherical Co0.25Ni0.75 (OH)2 precursor by heating in oxygen at 750&#176;C and 800&#176;C for 12 hrs. The structural characteristics of the compounds were determined by x-ray diffraction. The best sintering temperature was found to be 800 &#176;C, in terms of stabilising the layered structure and improving the cycle life. It was found that the spherical LiCo0.25Ni0.75O2 compounds sintered at 800 &#176;C have a highly ordered layered structure with reduced cation mixing.Carbon-enriched nanocrystalline LiFePO4 compounds were prepared by the sol-gel method and the R/F carbon gel method, respectively. A layer of carbon was laid down as a coating on the surface of the lithium crystals, which dramatically enhanced the electronic conductivity of the LiFePO4 compounds. A high capacity of 160 mAh/g at the C/5 rate has been demonstrated for the LiFePO4 electrode. These electrodes also exhibited good cyclability at different charge/discharge rates.A variety of anode materials have also been investigated to search out alternative anode materials to replace graphite for lithium ion batteries. Five types of cobalt oxides were prepared by high temperature decomposition, low temperature decomposition, high energy ball-milling, and the chemical decomposition of cobalt octacarbonyl in toluene, respectively. The LT-Co3O4, the CoO, and the nanosize Co3O4 powders prepared by decomposing organo-cobalt compounds at low temperature show good capacity retention on charge/discharge cycling, which is promising for their use as anode materials in Liion cells. It was found that the electrochemical properties of cobalt oxides are sensitive to the crystallinity, morphology, and particle size.Nanosize Ag powders were prepared via a reverse micelle approach. The size of Ag nanoparticles can be influenced by the concentration of the reduction agent. In addition, SnO2 nanopowders were synthesized by using the same method. 1D structured SnO2 nanorods were observed in the SnO2 nanopowders. The SnO2 nanopowder electrodes show high electrochemical reactivity toward lithium in Li-ion cells.The synthesized materials were characterized by x-ray diffraction, SEM and TEM, through which the phase composition and microstructure were observed. The capacity and cycle life of the cathode materials were obtained from charge/discharge cycling tests. The kinetic characteristics and kinetic parameters of lithium ion insertion and extraction within the electrode materials were determined by a.c. impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammograms.In summary, the investigations in this project have produced several types of electrode materials with high capacity and long cycle life. In particular, the study focuses on the preparation of cathode materials with high density and ordered structure, and anode materials with ultrafine particles. Analysis of the electrochemical processes in lithium ion cells was conducted by various techniques. All of these studies provide a fundamental basis for the development of high energy density electrode materials.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/709</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Heidegger and the mystery of being</field><field name="creator">Reddan, Marion</field><field name="description">Martin Heidegger has been described as the philosopher of being. His work is a critique of the dualistic thinking of the metaphysical tradition, where being is regarded as a fundamental ground, and indubitable knowledge is prioritised over sensuous experience. Heidegger&#8217;s own view is that being is an absence of ground, and a dynamic process in which things emerge into presence from concealment. Whereas the tradition interprets being as a concept, Heidegger focuses on what he describes as &#8220;the experience of being.&#8221; His inquiry draws upon the medieval mystics&#8217; relationship to God, and the Presocratic philosophers&#8217; experience of wonder at the mystery of existence. In an attempt to understand being itself, Heidegger analyses the being of the human, &#8220;Dasein.&#8221; He argues that because we find ourselves thrown into the world and having to face the imminent possibility of death, we engage in a process of self-creation by projecting ourselves into possibilities. In his later work, Heidegger presents the idea that being and Dasein belong to each other, and can only be understood on the basis of an originary form of difference that is both a union and a separation.                    My theory is that the dualities structuring thought and language are a consequence of our existence as embodied, spatio-temporal beings, and that metaphysics is one of the ways in which that duality is expressed. I compare Heidegger&#8217;s notion of originary difference with the concepts of ch&#333;ra in Plato, and the apeiron in Anaximander. The two Greek philosophers describe a dynamic, non-dual state of potential from which everything that exists is generated and sustained. Such a state is reflected in the interpretations of mystical experience, where subjects in various traditions throughout history have reported a sense of oneness in the apparent dissolution of the temporal and the spatial. In contrast to Heidegger&#8217;s later view that mysticism is an expression of metaphysics, I propose that mystical experience is a pathway to the experience of being. {Contact author: vkaqm88d@netspace.net.au}</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/825</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The grotesque poetics of Rodney Hall's dream trilogies</field><field name="creator">Ratcliffe, Greg</field><field name="description">The grotesque is a constantly changing mode of representation that depends on the artist's particular socio-historic context for its form. In A Dream More Luminous Than Love and The Island in the Mind, Rodney Hall develops a poetics of the grotesque which is applicable to his interrogation of Australia's representation in the "official" archive. From the time that the classical writers began to hypothesise the existence of a continent in the southern hemisphere Terra Incognita was portrayed as a grotesque space inhabited with monstrous beings. This image was compounded in the late eighteenth century when the British discovered the east coast of Australia and colonized it with their own abject body, the convicts and lower classes.In A Dream More Luminous Than Love and The Island in the Mind, Hall interrogates the discursive construction of the self and Other, and argues that the discrepancies between the image and the object reveal the ideological investments of (neo-) classicism, primitivism and capitalism in the pre-colonial and colonial representations of Australia. The "primitive" is repressed, not eliminated, in the clean and proper body, and Hall disturbs the binary structure of self/Other, civilised/primitive, West/East centre/margin by using the devices of inversion and reversal to locate traits of the grotesque body in the depurated subject. Paradoxically, the proper body is a figure of lack, for which the grotesque Other is the supplement.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/845</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An examination of the characteristics of young, potentially gifted children from culturally diverse backgrounds as the basis for the development of appropriate educational programs</field><field name="creator">Carnellor, Yvonne Emily</field><field name="description">Despite agreement among scholars and researchers that identification of gifted children should be based on multiple criteria, current research continues to indicate a heavy reliance on an IQ score (Alvino, McDonnel &amp; Richert, 1981; Frasier, 1987). This practice often prevents economically disadvantaged, culturally diverse, bilingual, or minority students from taking part in a gifted program.Significant numbers of these students do not meet traditional criteria for gifted programs, but possess cognitive, motivational, artistic or creative potentials that clearly enable them to participate in the types of programmed experiences designed to develop and nurture academic and creative behaviours. Gallagher (1988) noted that vigorous efforts to establish programs to search out high intellectual ability in underserved and unserved subgroups (for example, underachieving gifted, culturally diverse gifted, gifted handicapped, gifted females) is a major priority in the field of education.The purposes of this study were: 1) to investigate the characteristics of gifted NESB, Aboriginal and economically disadvantaged students, 2) to use these characteristics to investigate new procedures for their identification, and 3) to develop an appropriate differentiated Early Childhood Intervention Program that will meet the specific needs of these students.This qualitative research study, using multiple case study design, investigated the characteristics of academic giftedness displayed by 52 children, aged 5-6 years, from culturally diverse and/or economically disadvantaged backgrounds. A researcher-designed instrument, IPMAI, was used to develop comprehensive intellectual profiles of each child.  These were then used as the basis for the development of a proposed gifted program at three school sites in the Illawarra region of New South Wales.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/867</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of the organic complexes of oxovanadium (IV)</field><field name="creator">Skevington, Richard Clement</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/895</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sound and circle dualities of culture and content within creative work 1987-97</field><field name="creator">Schaefer, Peter</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/931</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A touch of loneliness: from loneliness, emptiness and silence to essence</field><field name="creator">Aerts, Jos&#233;</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/945</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Social and intercultural dynamics in industry's commercialisation of technology from publicly-funded research laboratories</field><field name="creator">Murnain, Ronald W</field><field name="description">The commercialisation process through which industry uses technology from publicly-funded research laboratories, involves a laboratory and one or more companies establishing a commercialisation interface. This brings together the sometimes conflicting research and business cultures. Although commercialisation is ultimately a social process, studies of commercialisation interfaces have often focused more on the contractual, administrative or economic structures set up to manage them, than on the social and intercultural dynamics that create and sustain them. So previous research has largely left unanswered the questions that drive this thesis:* How does the social structure of the laboratory-company interface emerge and endure?* What behaviour contributes to the interface's social effectiveness?The study draws on theories on intergroup contact, trust, conflict, power, ethnic adaptation, organisational adaptation and symbolic representation, to identify dimensions of social behaviour likely to influence the status of the commercialisation interface. These dimensions provide an analytical framework for investigating what makes commercialisation interfaces effective. The framework is applied to analyse commercialisation case studies and to formulate a theoretical model which helps explain the social/intercultural basis of commercialisation. The analysis reveals that different dimensions of behaviour influence the social effectiveness of interfaces not only to different degrees, but also in fundamentally different ways.The impact on interface effectiveness of several influential dimensions of social behaviour was encouraged or reinforced by the contexts of the interfaces in the case studies: their historical, cultural context and/ or their contemporary, structural context. Other influential dimensions were largely unaffected by the interfaces' contexts. Behaviour's source of influence on interface effectiveness is therefore important.The dimensions of social behaviour were found also to have different modes of influence on interface effectiveness. Some dimensions affected the way participants approached their forthcoming involvement in the interface (an 'individual ' mode of influence). Other dimensions had a 'collective' mode of influence; here the behaviour was tightly bound up with the collective activity of both partners and their representatives within the interface itself, as that small group set about its tasks.The importance of these channels through which behaviour actually gains its influence on interface effectiveness suggests that the interpretation and management of social behaviour in commercialisation must focus on the interplay between behaviour's mode and source of influence. The thesis argues that this interaction is crucial in generating the interface's social/intercultural dynamics. The interface is very much the product of social adaptation: adaptation of individuals to social forces generated in the interface itself and elsewhere, and adaptation of the interface as a small group to cultural and other forces. The thesis shows that these processes of adaptation can readily be understood in terms of the interplay of behaviour's mode and source of influence.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/995</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A power and knowledge analysis of Indonesian accounting history: social, political and economic forces shaping the emergence and development of accounting</field><field name="creator">Sukoharsono, Eko Ganis</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/998</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A search for local knowledge of the interplay between the culture of an organisation and its management accounting practices: a case study of an Indonesian listed company</field><field name="creator">Rasyid, Eddy R.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1008</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Shari'ate organisation and accounting: the reflections of self's faith and knowledge</field><field name="creator">Triyuwono, Iwan</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1027</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Conservation and management in variable environments: the surf clam, donax deltoides</field><field name="creator">Murray-Jones, Sue</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1041</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adaptive reorganization of database structures through dynamic vertical partitioning of relational tables</field><field name="creator">Zhenjie, Liu</field><field name="description">Performance tuning of relational database systems is always a challenging task for database administrator. Automated performance tuning has been proposed recently as a new approach to detect and to eliminate performance problems and to support the decisions of database administrators.   This work considers one of the techniques used in automated performance tuning, dynamic vertical partitioning. Dynamic vertical partitioning of relational tables is one of the ways in which the physical structures of a relational database can be reorganized automatically in order to improve the performance of future database applications. The thesis presents how dynamic vertical partitioning can be used for the comprehensive analysis and optimisation of an adaptive reorganisation of database structures. In particular, we propose the algorithms to use to predict the future workload of the system, to analyse the characteristics of the workload, and to &#175;nd a near optimal vertical partitioning of relational tables. Then, we discuss the implementation aspects of vertical partitioning with the materialized view and index-based techniques.   Our contributions to automated performance tuning of relational database systems can be summarised as follows: 1. Propose a cost model to perform a detailed analysis of the costs of query and data manipulation processing over a given configuration of a relational database; 2. Propose a new algorithm for vertical partitioning of relational schemas in a data-base system with a given level of redundancies for a given workload; 3. Discuss the limitations of static vertical partitioning and propose dynamical vertical partitioning; 4. Discuss the characteristics of workload in order to predict the future workloads of the system; 5. Implementation aspects of vertical partition discussion: materialized view based and index based; 6. Discussion of the implementation of a vertical partition as a virtual view; 7. Conduct experiments to confirm the correctness of the cost model used by the vertical partitioning algorithm and demonstrate the expected performance gains from the partitioning</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/33</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Holocene sea-level change and the aminostratigraphy of wave-dominated barrier estuaries on the southeast coast of Australia</field><field name="creator">Sloss, Craig R</field><field name="description">The degree of aspartic acid racemisation measured in radiocarbon dated specimens of fossil molluscs collected from Holocene barrier estuaries on the southeast coast of Australia is evaluated in the context of results of laboratory-induced racemisation established in heating (simulated ageing) experiments. The general kinetic trend of aspartic acid racemisation, in both heating experiments, and at ambient temperatures during diagenesis in the fossil molluscs Anadara trapezia and Notospisula trigonella conforms to a model of apparent parabolic kinetics. Using the apparent parabolic kinetic model, numeric ages based on the degree of aspartic acid racemisation in fossil specimens of A. trapezia and N. trigonella have been determined. Aspartic acid D/L ratios in Holocene specimens of A. trapezia and N. trigonella range from 0.049&#177;0.005 to 0.510&#177;0.009, representing an age range from &lt;50 yr to ca 8,000 yr. Accordingly, the Holocene amino- and chronostratigraphies of the wavedominated barrier estuaries Lake Illawarra, St Georges Basin, Swan Lake and Burrill Lake have been established based on the extent of aspartic acid racemisation measured in 290 specimens of fossil molluscs. For fossil material beyond the time span of the radiocarbon dating method (ca &gt;50 ka) and the calibration range of aspartic acid, relative ages have been determined based on the slower racemising acids alanine, valine, leucine and proline. The relative age determinations on older fossils indicate that Last Interglacial successions have been preserved at depth within the incised valleys on the southeast coast of Australia. Aminostratigraphy, in conjunction with thermoluminescence dating, additional radiocarbon ages, and the litho- and biostratigraphic analysis of 141 vibracores, allowed the detailed assessment of the geomorphological evolution of wave-dominated barrier estuaries that formed in both broad, and narrow, incised valleys on the southeast coast of Australia. Results from the stratigraphic and geochronological analysis show that the estuaries investigated in this thesis have an evolutionary pathway that is different to previous models of barrier estuary evolution. In contrast to the earlier models of barrier estuary evolution, this thesis places a greater emphasis on the influence of the antecedent Late Pleistocene landsurface on hegeomorphological evolution of barrier estuaries on the southeast coast of Australia. The Late Pleistocene sediments are represented by dense, mottled estuarine clays and/or by remnant barrier systems comprising medium-grained quartz sand with a clay matrix. The Late Pleistocene sediments preserved within the incised bedrock valleys represent sedimentary successions deposited during previous high-stands in sea-level that have undergone minor diagenetic alteration during subsequent sea-level lowstands. Therefore, the Late Pleistocene sediments now represent low-stand weathering profiles and provided the substrate over which Holocene sedimentary successions have been deposited. In particular, the preservation of remnant Last Interglacial barrier systems are found underlying the Holocene barrier systems and provide a core over which Holocene barrier sediments have accumulated.Results from this study have also shown that Holocene transgressive sands are more extensive than previously anticipated and form a basal, near basin-wide shell-rich deposit that extends almost up to present sea-level. The transgressive sandsheet facies lies unconformably over the Late Pleistocene antecedent landsurface and was deposited during the most recent post-glacial marine transgression (PMT) when rising sea-levels breached Last Interglacial remnant barriers and inundated shallow incised valleys causing more open marine conditions to persist between 8,000 and ca 5,500 years ago. This contrasts with established models for barrier estuary evolution on the southeast coast of Australia where Holocene PMT sandsheets were restricted to the mouths of incised valleys and back-barrier central basin muds lie directly over the antecedent Pleistocene landsurface. This study also presents a database of 121 previously published radiocarbon ages obtained from fossil molluscs, organic material and fixed biological indicators from back-barrier sedimentary successions and the marginal marine environment on the southeast coast of Australia that have been used to constrain Holocene sea-level fluctuations. The database has been limited to fossil materials that have an accurate description of facies association and stratigraphic relationship to present mean sea-level (PMSL). An assessment of the uncertainty terms associated with the various proxy sea-level indicators is made and radiocarbon ages are calibrated to sidereal years. Additional radiocarbon ages and aspartic acid racemisationderived ages obtained on fossils preserved in the Holocene PMT sandsheets deposited inshallow incised valleys are presented in this thesis. A synthesis of the previously published radiocarbon ages and new data presented in this thesis has permitted a revised Holocene sealevel curve for the southeast coast of Australia to be delineated. Results show that rising sea levels during the most recent PMT attained an elevation of around -10 m by 10,000 cal yr BP and continued to rise to ca -5 m by 8,500 cal yr BP. Between 8,300 and 8,000 cal yr BP sealevel had risen to at least 3 m below PMSL and inundated shallow incised valleys, resulting in the deposition of shell-rich transgressive sandsheets. The most recent PMT sea-levels attained present levels around 7,700 cal yr BP, slightly earlier than a previously proposed culmination of ca 7,000 cal yr BP. Results indicate that sea-level continued to rise to between 1 and 1.5 m above PMSL by 7,400 cal yr BP during the culmination of the most recent PMT and was followed by a sea-level highstand that lasted to some time between 3,000 and 2,000 years ago. This was followed by a relatively slow and smooth regression of sea-level from ca +1.5 m to present levels. A series of minor negative and positive oscillations in relative sealevel associated with variations in ocean topography and/or climate change during the mid to late Holocene appear to be superimposed over the Holocene sea-level highstand and subsequent smooth sea-level regression.This study highlights the potential of aspartic acid racemisation as an important supplement for dating of fossils preserved in Holocene marginal marine deposits. This thesis also represents the most rigorous application of the aspartic acid racemisation dating method to the investigation of Holocene sedimentary infill of incised valley systems, and sea-level change during the most recent PMT. The evolutionary models of barrier estuary evolution developed in this thesis show that both the antecedent Late Pleistocene substrate and fluctuating Holocene sea levels have had a greater influence on the geomorphological evolution of barrier estuaries than previously anticipated. These revised models of estuary evolution can be applied to other shallow incised valley systems on tectonically stable, wavedominated coastlines, and provide a template for future studies in wave-dominated barrier estuaries on the southeast coast of Australia.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/447</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electrospray tandem mass spectrometry of oligonucleotides and ligand-oligonucleotide addults</field><field name="creator">Iannitti, Paula</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1151</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Determining the parameters of the flood hydrograph model WBNM for urban catchments</field><field name="creator">Milevski, Petar</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1235</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Shear behaviour of soft rock joints under constant normal stiffness</field><field name="creator">Haque, Asadul</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1266</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environment exploration and path planning algorithms for mobile robot navigation using sonar</field><field name="creator">Zelinsky, Alexander</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1295</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An analysis of the determinants of investment in developing countries a case study of Iran (1970-93)</field><field name="creator">Ghassemi, Ahmad</field><field name="description">This study attempts to identify the major determinants of private investment , along with the effects of such investments on other macroeconomic factors, in developing countries, using Iran as a case study. In this regard we identify a number of macroeconomic variables which played a major role in enhancing private investment in developing countries, and Iran in particular, between 1970 and 1993. An empirical investment model, a simultaneous investment model by industry and a macroeconomic model are applied to study the investment behaviour in this country. Lack of economic data, differences in economic structure, and different economic concepts between developed and developing countries, were the major issues that made this study more complicated.The adopted empirical investment model is based on the Blejer and Khan (1984) and the Greene and Villanueva (1990) approach, which are related to investment behaviour in developing countries. The model enables us to show the effects of public current and capital expenditure, funded by oil export revenue, on private investment and other macroeconomic factors. The simultaneous investment function for major economic activities, indicates that domestic investment was affected by output, capital stock, bank financing, oil exports and public investment rather than the official (fixed) or real exchange rate in the parallel market and/or interest rate. The Harvie and Kearney (1995) macroeconomic model is amended to study the crowding out, or crowding in, effects of public current and capital expenditure on private investment in developing countries, focusing upon Iran as a case study. This model also examines the effects of the interest rate, real exchange rate and world income on the behaviour of major macroeconomic variables in the product, money and asset markets, and especially private investment.The estimation results indicate that private investment was negatively affected by an increase in the interest rate, but positively by the major components of aggregate demand such as private consumption and public current and capital expenditure. These results also suggest that both public current and capital expenditure crowd in private investment.The simulation results suggest a number of alternative government policies for achieving economic development goals and enhancing private investment. The policies presented are: 1. A two tier interest rate policy should be administered by the government, a lower interest rate for investment purposes, accompanied with a higher interest rate for savings, term deposits and bank credits. 2. Allocation of a higher proportion of oil export revenues for public investment only in infrastructure fields and/or financing private investment. 3. Pursuing a unified floating exchange rate policy.The experience of billions of petro-dollars investment in various public enterprises in the 1970s, and nationalisation of hundreds of large scale private industries after the revolution, centralised the economy, aimed at pursuing the strategic goal of economic development. Eventually, however, the government also realised that the contribution of private investment was a prerequisite for sustainable economic development. This experience implied the need for a number of microeconomic reforms. Liberalisation of the economy including^ that of trade, privatisation of nationalised industries, reform of public enterprises, floating the exchange rate and the attraction of foreign direct investment are a concise summary of these essential microeconomic reforms.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1310</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis and characterisation of chiral substituted polyanilines</field><field name="creator">Strounina, Ekaterina V.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1184</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sediment transport in the surf zone: variations in suspended sediment characteristics, hydrodynamics and morphology, southeast coast Australia</field><field name="creator">Shen, Jiashu</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1388</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A comparative study of the petrology of permian coals of India and Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Mishra, H.

name="description">This thesis considers the refraction and diffraction of both linear and nonlinear waves.  In the first part, a linear numerical model based on the dual reciprocity boundary element method (DRBEM) is presented for the study of combined diffraction and refraction of linear waves. This model is more general than that presented by Zhu (1993a) in the sense that areas or coastlines where the water depth is zero can be successfully dealt with. Our comparison study shows that the new model is very accurate for the propagation of long waves such as tsunamis. Moreover, it is numerically very efficient in comparison with models based on finite elements or differences. Using the new model, the interaction between the diffractive and refractive effects is examined.In the second part, a numerical model is developed by expanding the Boussinesq equations using a perturbation method and the DRBEM. Based on the assumption that the incident waves are harmonic, the time-dependent nonlinear Boussinesq equations are transformed into three time-independent linear equations, where no approximation for the seabed slope is made. Then the first-order solution No is found as the solution of the linear shallow-water equation. The first-order solution is then used in the governing equations at second-order. By employing a transformation, all the third-order and the fourth-order partial derivatives of No in the right-hand sides are removed, resulting in the minimization of any errors which occur in approximating these derivatives. To validate the new model, the wave run-ups of weakly-nonlinear waves scattered by islands are found. Thirteen cases of run-ups around a vertical cylindrical island are considered and it is found that the nonlinear and dispersive contributions of the new model are significant and a much better comparison with experimental results is obtained than for the linear diffraction theory. The combined wave diffraction and refraction by a conical island is also modelled and discussed. Our model is found to be more accurate than other nonlinear models as the dispersive effects have been included, but is also more computationally efficient since there is no time marching and the spatial dimensionality of the numerical calculation has been reduced by one with the adoption of the DRBEM.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2053</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A magnetochemical investigation of some copper (II) salicylates and bromobenzoates</field><field name="creator">Hamilton, Geoffrey John</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/903</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The desulphurisation of thionesters</field><field name="creator">Frier, Robert D.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/907</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a live oral vaccine against porcine enzootic pneumonia</field><field name="creator">Fagan, Peter</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1042</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pollen in the diet of Australian mammals</field><field name="creator">Van Tets, Ian Gerard</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1051</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Access control in object-oriented databases</field><field name="creator">Baraabi-Dastjerdi, Ahmad</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1290</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Semi-analytical and numerical solutions describing microwave heating in waveguides</field><field name="creator">Liu, Bin</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2056</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Determinants of relationship commitment in personal financial planning services</field><field name="creator">Sharma, Neeru</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2303</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of design methods for bulk transport containers</field><field name="creator">Devine, J.

The continued subduction of the Indo-Australian Plate under continental Sundaland was responsible for the development of this asymmetrical, tectonically-active forearc basin which is located along the west coast of the Aceh region of northwestern Sumatra. Significant petroleum discoveries have not been found in any Indonesian forearc basin and this study was initiated to assess the hydrocarbon generation potential of the West Aceh Basin and to formulate a model to aid future exploration in this and other forearc basins. The type, abundance and maturity of organic matter in the Tertiary sequence was determined using optical microscopy and geochemical techniques. The organic matter in both coals and clastic rocks is derived from land plants with a minor algal component in some of the claystones and shales. The coals, ranging in age from Oligocene to Pliocene, are dominated by vitrinite with lesser liptinite and only very minor inertinite. A distinctive feature of the coals is the abundance of exsudatinite, resinite, suberinite and cutinite. Using optical properties and textural features, exsudatinite can be divided into two groups and much of this secondary maceral is derived from resinite and suberinite. The significance of exsudatinite as an indicator of petroleum generation is discussed.Dispersed organic matter (DOM) in the clastic rocks comprises mostiy liptinite with lesser vitrinite and only minor inertinite. The rocks contain small but significant quantities of bitumen which indicate migration of hydrocarbons through the rocks or in situ generation of hydrocarbons.The coal and clastic rocks are potential source rocks but most are immature and have not produced significant liquid hydrocarbons. Use of a modified petrographic scoring system shows that of the clastic rocks, the Tangla Formation shales and to a lesser extent, the Kueh Formation, are the best source rocks. The Oligocene coal, and possibly the Miocene coal, have very good hydrocarbon generation potential. The onshore vitrinite reflectance gradients are greater than those offshore and thus the oil window is predicted to be shallower in the onshore areas. Geochemical data confirms the source rock potential of the rocks although the organic matter is mostly Type III or transitional Type II/III using the 1984 classification of Tissot and Welte. The shale contain 1 to 5 % Total Organic Carbon (TOC) and Rock Eval data show that the organic matter in the shale and coal is oil to gas prone witii Hydrogen Indices (HI) of less than 200 to 465. S2 values are highest in the Tangla Formation but lowest in the Tutut Formation. . Samples from the..Tangla Formation contain the highest extractable hydrocarbons (mgHC/gTOC) although petrographic data suggest that this is due to bitumen impregnation. Pyrolysis-GC traces of these Oligocene and Miocene coals are characterised by a high abundance of normal alkane hydrocarbons. In many respects, the pyrograms are similar to those of the Talang Akar coal which are known source rocks.Future exploration should be directed towards the onshore areas or those offshore areas where the sequence is thick and the potential for intersecting the oil window is greater.

Data from exploration boreholes, underground mines and laboratory sorption-desorption tests are used to investigate the composition and distribution of gases in the coal seams. The influences of thermal history, coal composition, rank, geological structure, stratigraphy and igneous activity are evaluated.The coals of the Late Permian lllawarra Coal Measures attained ranks of up to medium- and low volatile bituminous coals as a result of high palaeo-heat flows (up to 2.5 HFU) and deep burial (up to 2500 m) in the Cretaceous. During the interval between Early Triassic and Middle Jurassic, large volumes of COz and H20 and subsidiary amounts of hydrocarbons were generated by coalification. The major phase of CH4 and other hydrocarbon generation occurred between the Middle Jurassic and Late Cretaceous at burial depths between 1.5 krn and 2.5 km.The gas retention and emission characteristics of coals are primarily dependent on pore-size distribution. The Permian coals studied composed of mostly vitrinite and inertinite and the porosity of these coals is dominated by micro- and meso-pores &#171; 50 nm). Pores associated with the mineral matter are mainly macro-pores (&gt; 50 nm) hence the presence of mineral matter in coal relatively decreases its micro-porosity.The gas sorption in coals mainly occurs in the micro-pores and increases with fixed carbon content, vitrinite reflectance and content but decreases with increasing mineral matter, volatile matter and moisture content. The CO2 sorption capacity of coal is between two to three times higher than that for C~. Coal also desorbs CO2 at a significantly higher rate than CH4&#8226; For a given gas, the desorption rates are related to the abundance of macro-pores and fractures and accordingly increases with mineral matter and vitrinite content. Hence the residual gas content decreases with the increasing COz, mineral matter and vitrinite content.CH4 and longer chain hydrocarbons presently occurring within the Illawarra Coal Measures were generated during coalification, whereas most of the COz was introduced into the sequence in association with the periodic igneous activity since the Middle Jurassic. Most of the CO2 generated during the early stages of coalification have been expelled from the coal measures.  The variations in the gas composition are mainly related to structural features and depth; the volume of CO2 increases towards structural highs with highest concentration occurring in anticlines and near some faults. Structural lows contain dominantly CH4 but local pockets of CO2 sometimes occur adjacent to faults and dykes. Furthermore, in majority of the boreholes, the volume of CO2 increases with decreasing depth. These variations are mainly related to the migration and solubility properties of CO2.The quantity of ethane and longer chain hydrocarbons occurring at depths less than 500m is very small &#171; 0.1%) but increases with depth. It is postulated that this trend is related to theready expulsion of most of the early-formed longer chain hydrocarbons from shallow depths and the subsequent invasion by later-formed CH4.The total in-situ gas content of coal, measured from core desorption test, varies from &lt; 1 m'It to 20 m3/t. The desorbable gas content at depths shallower than 200 m is negligible but, on average, increases by approximately 4 m'It per 100m in increase depth up to 600 m, and thereafter the rate of increases is significantly low. However, at a given depth, individual values can show up to 80% variability depending on gas composition, geological structure, coal composition and rank. Elevated gas contents occur where the gas is dominantly CO2 whereas anomalously low gas contents occur near highly faulted zones.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/346</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reading the land: the mark in post colonial landscape</field><field name="creator">Walters, Marilyn</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/927</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Domination, autopoiesis and regulatory failure: the accountancy connection</field><field name="creator">Cooper, Kathleen A.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1003</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nitrogen-containing heterocycles derived from isoquinoline alkaloids</field><field name="creator">Sudarma, I.

Since the introduction of IT enabled IS in the 1980&#8217;s, there have been numerous reports of problematic and failed implementations. The implementation stage has been emphasised as the stage in the IS life cycle where a large number of issues arise, and the implementation phenomenon has been widely studied. Despite this research focus, there is still not a consensus within the IS research community about what factors lead to implementation failure, and what factors facilitate implementation success. There are many studies that examine the use of IS through models of user behaviour, typically focussing on explaining the variance of a particular variable such as usage frequency. Two such studies raised questions that were important in framing this thesis. Venkatesh, Morris, Davis, G. and Davis, F. (2003) asked whether or not efforts put into understanding factors that contribute to increased usage actually help predict IS success, and to what degree systems considered to have been successfully adopted are actually successful from an organisational perspective. Jasperson, Carter and Zmud (2005) suggested that research should look further than simple dependent variables such as usage, and that uptake of system features might be a better indicator of implementation success. Further, it was suggested that the implementation outcome might be influenced by behaviours and factors that occurred after the installation of IS, and that few models of implementation actually contained a post-adoptive stage. In order to answer these and other questions concerning the implementation of IS within organisations, a longitudinal, qualitative study of the implementation of an enterprise wide IS within an organisation was conducted using the ethnographic methodology of participant observation. The focus of the study was the impact of individual and group behaviour on the implementation success of IS. This focus necessitated exploration of the concept of implementation success, its measurement and how implementation success is perceived throughout an organisation. An important outcome from this study was a Conceptual Model of Information System Implementation within Organisations (CMISIO). The CMISIO, based upon observations from the study, describes implementation as a multi-faceted phenomenon guided within organisational constraints to achieve a pre-determined organisational fit. Organisational fit captures the notion of success, which was seen to vary depending upon the perspective of an observer within the organisation. In this way implementation success was seen to be a multi-faceted phenomenon. The intent of the model was not to reduce the implementation phenomenon to components, but rather to capture those organisational factors that lead to site-specific variations in IS implementation. There were a number of important findings from the study that have relevance for both IS researchers and practitioners. The IS implementation process can take much longer than is widely reported. Studies that only focus upon a part of the process might fail to capture salient factors that are important in the overall implementation outcome. Evidence to support the importance of Jasperson et al.&#8217;s (2005) adoption phase, as well as a later phase of adaptation was found. Adaptation, where organisational users adapt the new IS to their particular needs, can take months or years, and a lack of organisational support within this phase can lead to eventual implementation failure. An IS within an organisation is only special for a certain time, and management focus can shift before the implementation process has been completed. The organisational climate that exists at the time of implementation provides constraints that IS project teams must recognise and work within. Elements of the organisation&#8217;s culture can also be important factors in understanding motivations behind behaviours that may be either supportive of or detrimental to the implementation. The study found evidence that some behaviours seen as negative towards the IS implementation were likely motivated by psychological reactance (Brehm, 1966), where individuals react to real or perceived threats to their organisational freedom. The reactance was generated by factors not just associated with the IS, and this finding suggests that in order to predict the implementation outcome within an organisation it is necessary to understand factors other than those directly associated with the IS being implemented. Finally, the scientist-practitioner model used within psychology was suggested as a working model that could be used to help integrate the large body of IS research into organisations. The model focuses on the integration of science-based research and day-to-day practice whereby each informs the other through involvement. This proposal addresses a perceived gap between the researchers looking at IS on the one hand and practitioners implementing IS within organisations on the other.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cognitive Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3052</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Novel synthetic and characterisation strategies towards a-Fulleryl amino acids</field><field name="creator">Burley, Glenn A.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1166</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies in reverse transcriptase: synthesis of inhibitors, conformational analysis, and integration of drug design</field><field name="creator">Luu, Tien T.T.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1176</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The analysis and synthesis of bulk loading facilities with reference to the port of Newcastle</field><field name="creator">Binh, Dinh-Nho</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1596</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Psychophysiology of movement-related brain potentials</field><field name="creator">VaezMousavi, S.

A second aim of this thesis is to explore the psychophysiological changes experienced during challenging adventure activities, and whether these changes reflect changes in state anxiety and self esteem.A preliminary study carried out on the Ropes Course, an Outdoor Education adventure activity, indicated that participants experienced strong emotional and physiological changes during this activity. Dissociation of HR and blood pressure measures was found in this Study, with only systolic blood pressure reflecting group changes in state anxiety. In the main field studies, children aged 10-12 years participating on a Ropes Course activity were monitored "in situ" for HR and SCL changes using an ambulatory monitor with laboratory levels of precision. Fractionation of the HR and SCL measures was confirmed in the second study, with different HR and SCL response patterns found across the Ropes Course element epochs. In contrast to predictions based on Fowles' (1980) hypothesis, analyses of the physiological and emotion data in Study 3 found that the average HR and SCL levels recorded on the six elements of the Ropes Course differentially reflected levels of negative and positive emotion (respectively). These findings were confirmed in Study 5 after consideration of motility (movement) effects on the HR and SCL measures. Further studies using the Ropes Course activity indicated that increases in self esteem were associated with either higher SCL or lower HR levels during some of the more challenging elements of the Ropes Course. These data imply a relationship between self esteem and the experience of emotion during the successful completion of challenging adventure activities.In the laboratory, adult students participated in 10 one minute imagery sessions that were used to evoke positive and negative emotions of various intensity. The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS; Watson, Clark and Tellegen, 1988) confirmed that students experienced emotions that were significantly different from a baseline state. The NA and PA scores were used to plot each imagery session on the experimental "affective space". Analyses of the physiological data in both laboratory studies supported the association of HR with negative emotion. The SCL measure was found to be not as responsive under imagery conditions, although greater sensitivity in this measure was found for positive emotion. In the second laboratory study, the PA and NA scores were also used to calculate an arousal, valence and emotion intensity score for each imagery session. Exploratory regression analyses indicated that HR reflected both emotion intensity and arousal emotion characteristics.The field and laboratory studies described in this thesis support linkages of HR with negative emotion and SCL with positive emotion contradicting Fowles' hypothesis. Together, these studies present a unique and more theoretical approach to the study of emotion. In addition, the field studies illustrate the benefits of psychophysiological research in Outdoor Education and the value of "in situ" monitoring.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1674</field></doc><doc><field name="title">When the way out was in: avant-garde theatre in Australia, 1965-1985</field><field name="creator">Guthrie, Adrian John</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1762</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Promoting physical activity among overweight and obese children: a randomised controlled trial comparing a physical activity program, a dietary program and a combined physical activity plus dietary program</field><field name="creator">Cliff, Dylan P.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1795</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The constituents of Schefferomitra and Boletus species from New Guinea</field><field name="creator">Rudzats, Richards</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1197</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimisation of road location and design</field><field name="creator">Nasr, Majid</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1254</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improvement of critical current density in MgB2 by optimizing process parameters and chemical doping</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Yun</field><field name="description">The discovery of superconductivity in MgB2 in January 2001 has triggered enormous interest around the world. MgB2 has evolved as a promising superconductor for the next generation of superconductor applications, due to not only its higher critical temperature (Tc = 39 K), low material cost, and good weak-link tolerance, but also its rich multiple-band structure. However, several issues exist that urgently need to be solved, such as its low upper critical field (Hc2) and rapid decrease in critical current density (Jc) under magnetic field compared to Nb-based superconductors. High Jc(H) performance is crucial for the application of this material in the so-called &#8220;strong electrical application&#8221; field. Therefore, the objective of this thesis is to increase Jc of bulk polycrystalline MgB2 via studying the influence of the boron precursor powder and the nominal Mg/B mixing ratio and efforts to further enhance Jc by doping with two types of sources: carbon sources (such as SiC and sucrose) and oxygen sources (such as TiO2/SiO2 and processing atmospheres with different oxygen content).The control of the boron powder is one of most promising methods to enhance Jc at high fields without significant decrease of the self-field Jc. The particle size, purity, and form of the starting boron powders play an important role in the superconducting properties of MgB2. It has been proved the precursor B powder is very important to critical current density of MgB2. In terms of the influence of boron precursor on the superconducting properties of MgB2, Jc values for MgB2 made from ball-milled high purity boron powders with crystalline phase are at least two times higher than for a comparable MgB2 sample made from ball-milled amorphous boron powder and a factor of 40 higher than typical values of standard MgB2 samples. The possible mechanism proposed to account for this difference is Hc2 enhancement caused by the increased disorder. Nano-particle SiC is a very effective dopant to improve the in-field Jc of MgB2. However, Jc at lower field become lower than the undoped one. It would be desirable to maintain a high low-field Jc while improve the high field Jc. In order to solve this issue, the influence of Mg content was investigated in a series of undoped and SiC-doped MgB2 samples with systematic variation of the nominal Mg/B ratio (x:2). It has been found that in the undoped MgB2 samples Jc increases with x to a maximum value at x = 1.1 and then decreases. The higher Jc at x = 1.1 is attributed to the better connectivity caused by smaller amounts of impurities. In the SiC-doped samples, it has been found that the sample with x = 1.15 exhibits the best Jc performance for all fields  from 0 &#8211; 8.5 T, including the self-field, and its Tc is higher than for the sample with x = 1. The enhancement of Jc is attributed to the improved connectivity and the increased disorder. The optimized Mg/B ratio (1.15:2) also diminishes the interband scattering caused by the Mg or B vacancies and, in turn, increases Tc.Carbonhydrates such as sucrose can decompose at high emperature. The resulting carbon from the decomposition can be used as carbon source to dope into MgB2. This kind of carbon is very reactive and can be incorporated into MgB2 easier. A comprehensive study of the effects of carbohydrate doping on the superconductivity of MgB2 has been conducted. Doping with sucrose at varying rates and annealing temperatures results in an optimal Jc value in MgB2-xCx at x = 0.2 and 850 oC. At 5 K and 6 T, the x = 0.2 sample shows one order of magnitude improvement compared to pure sample. It has been found that sucrose doping causes a small depression in Tc and high resistivity, while Hc2 performance is improved. The reason for the enhancement of Hc2 is likely to be increased disorder caused by C substitution for B and/or diffusion of C atoms in the MgB2 lattice as interstitial atoms. TiO2/SiO2 additions lead to improved Jc values. Jc values are the highest at the doping ratio of 10 wt% at 5 K and 20 K, and at the doping ratio of 5 wt% at 30 K, when the sintering temperature is fixed at 750 oC. When the doping ratio is fixed at 5 wt%, the sample with the sintering temperature of 750 oC has the best Jc for 5 K and 20 K, while the sample with the sintering temperature of 850 oC exhibits the highest Jc at 30 K. In addition, it has been found that the addition of TiO2/SiO2 nanoparticles results in a small depression in Tc, while the Hc2 and irreversibility field (Hirr) performances are improved. The enhancement of Hc2 and Hirr can be attributed to the existence of precipitates induced by the TiO2/SiO2 doping. The effect of processing atmosphere on microstructure and superconducting properties was studied for MgB2 samples made using the in situ reaction technique under argon atmosphere with three different purities, ultra-high, high, and welding grade. The critical temperature, Tc, decreases by 0.5 K while the FWHM, the resistivity and the amount of MgO show an increase in the welding Ar processed sample. The Jc, Hirr and Hc2 for the welding Ar processed sample are improved in comparison with the samples treated in ultra-high and high purity argon. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) examination revealed that the sample processed in welding grade argon possessed small grains, a high density of defects, and larger crystalline strains, which act as effective pinning centres. These results verify the dual reaction model where the MgB2 formation and the reaction between oxygen and precursor take place simultaneously, resulting in an optimal doping effect. The Jc(H) behaviour for samples treated at 800oC for 60 hours in the sealed Fe tube shows little difference among the three different Ar atmospheres.  The optimal Jc and flux pinning properties in MgB2 can be achieved by using readily available and economical welding grade Ar as the protective atmosphere instead of using ultra-high or high purity Ar. The effects of the sintering time on the superconductivity of MgB2 with sintering in the welding grade Ar atmosphere have been investigated.  The sample sintered for 30 min exhibits the highest Jc at high fields. The reason can be attributed to the improved connectivity and the increased Hc2.Overall, the works in this thesis are mainly on material process and characterization. I have studied many factors such as precursor powder, process parameters, dopants that have strong effects on Jc. The results are useful for future MgB2 fabrications.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3060</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Web-based computer assisted laboratory instruction</field><field name="creator">Chen, Yuxin</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2559</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rehabilitation for workers with noise-induced hearing loss: a community health approach</field><field name="creator">Hogan, Anthony G.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2871</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Computer networks for social change: the social re-shaping of telematics</field><field name="creator">Holland, Geoffrey M.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2227</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physiological adaptations to acute stress in the ewe</field><field name="creator">Newman, R.

It was the first of three great voyages by Cook, and part of his commission was to observe the Transit of Venus in Tahiti in June, 1769, and to then locate, if possible, the Great Southern Continent before returning to England. Cook completed the former, and on the 19th of April, 1770, he located the latter, sailing up the east coast of Australia till the Endeavour ran aground near Cape Tribulation on the 11th of June, 1770. The ship was repaired and finally reached England on 13 July, 1771.In his daily journal, Cook recorded the details of the voyage along the east coast of Australia, and ascribed the main cause of his ship running aground to the inconstancy of unfamiliar waters.My thesis. The Secret Journal of Captain Cook, concentrates on the Australian section of Cook's first voyage, from April 19, 1770 till mid June, 1770, and purports to be Cook's 'truthful' account of what really happened during that time. It was supposedly written in his house at Mile End not long after he had returned to England. As he states in this 'newly-discovered' work, it was not the inconstancy of unfamiliar waters which was the cause of the ship running aground. The truth of the matter was that the crew Cook took with him was so incompetent and preoccupied with personal feuds that disaster was inevitable.Being an honourable man. Cook felt  compelled to set  the record straight, irrespective of the cost to his reputation or naval future.Cook's authentic and serious account of his first voyage was written in diary format. Unlike that diary, my thesis is a humorous, largely fictitious, first-person narrative.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/960</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Clusterin: a novel chaperone protein with putative cytoprotective properties</field><field name="creator">Humphreys, David Thomas</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1040</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Numerical modelling of mining subsidence, upsidence and valley closure using UDEC</field><field name="creator">Keilich, Walter</field><field name="description">Ground subsidence due to mining has been the subject of intensive research for several decades, and it remains to be an important topic confronting the mining industry today. In the Southern Coalfield of New South Wales, Australia, there is particular concern about subsidence impacts on incised river valleys &#8211; valley closure, upsidence, and the resulting localised loss of surface water under low flow conditions. Most of the reported cases have occurred when the river valley is directly undermined. More importantly, there are a number of cases where closure and upsidence have been reported above unmined coal. These latter events are especially significant as they influence decisions regarding stand-off distances and hence mine layouts and reserve recovery.The deformation of a valley indicates the onset of locally compressive stress conditions concentrated at the base of the valley. Compressive conditions are anticipated when the surface deforms in a sagging mode, for example directly above the longwall extraction; but they are not expected when the surface deforms in a hogging mode at the edge of the extraction as that area is typically in tension. To date, explanations for valley closure under the hogging mode have considered undefined compressive stress redistributions in the horizontal plane, or lateral block movements and displacement along discontinuities generated in the sagging mode. This research is investigating the possibilities of the block movement model and its role in generating compressive stresses at the base of valleys, in the tensile portion of the subsidence profile. The numerical modelling in this research project has demonstrated that the block movement proposal is feasible provided that the curvatures developed are sufficient to allow lateral block movement. Valley closure and the onset of valley base yield are able to be quantified with the possibility of using analytical solutions.  To achieve this, a methodology of subsidence prediction using the Distinct Element code UDEC has been developed as an alternative for subsidence modelling and prediction for isolated longwall panels. The numerical models have been validated by comparison with empirical results, observed caving behaviour and analytical solutions, all of which are in good agreement. The techniques developed in the subsidence prediction UDEC models have then been used to develop the conceptual block movement model. The outcomes of this research have vast implications. Firstly, it is shown that valley closure and upsidence is primarily a function of ground curvature. Since the magnitude of curvature is directly related to the magnitude of vertical subsidence there is an opportunity to consider changes in the mine layout as a strategy to reduce valley closure. Secondly, with further research there is the possibility that mining companies can assess potential damage to river valleys based on how close longwall panels approach the river valley in question. This has the added advantage of optimising the required stand off distances to river valley and increasing coal recovery.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/862</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Billy Pogo's fire: a creative arts project in drama, poetry and visual arts on the theme of an aboriginal wiringin or clever man</field><field name="creator">Stone, Ken</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/917</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Relationships to realisation: an investigation of the process from invention to communication, as the artist selects and develops specific orders in a progressive series of works</field><field name="creator">Amos, Mavis Irene</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/955</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Creating engaging self-learning opportunities for out-of-school children in Sri Lanka: employing constructivist design principles for distance and open learning</field><field name="creator">Wanniarachchi Kankanange, Nandawathie</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/968</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The encouragement of "reasonableness" through the practice of philosophy with high school students at risk</field><field name="creator">McDermott, Maureen</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/982</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experimental and theoretical investigation of tandem laser welding</field><field name="creator">Frewin, Michael Richard</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1494</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Energy absorption in structural frames</field><field name="creator">Horr, Amir Masoud</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1243</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental issues related to the surface transportation of coal</field><field name="creator">Loveday, P.

A.</field><field name="description">The handling and storage of black coal has always presented industry with problems of erratic or spasmodic feed, partial reclamation of the total contents of bins and flow blockages at hopper outlets. These problems can lead to extreme cost penalties for all users, from the coal producers and export market loading facilities to the secondary industries using coal for process energy requirements. Any reduction in the occurrence of these handling problems and the subsequent increase in efficiency would be of benefit. The aim of this work was to investigate two major aspects in the design of coal storage bins to ensure reliable and predictable operation, particularly in regard to gravity assisted discharge. First an experimental study investigated the flow properties of black coal and the influence on these flow properties of variations in the physical characteristics of the test samples. Variables considered included moisture content, particle top size of test samples, coal particle shape, time consolidation at rest and ash content. Samples for the test program were obtained from the six collieries located in the Southern Coalfields (Illawarra Measures) of the Sydney Basin of New South Wales. The coals ranged in rank from sub-bituminous to semi-anthracite.The study highlighted the most influential variables to be moisture content, sample particle size and time consolidation at rest.  Other factors such as particle shape, coal rank and ash content were minor considerations. Often a variation of variable affected other properties and led to decreased sample flowability. A common example was that of coals with a high friability; this leads to greater particle degradation and generation of fines with handling operations, which then leads to higher moisture retention capabilities and significantly large critical arching dimensions, particularly with time storage.The flow property testing program utilised a Jenike - type Direct Shear Tester for the coal sample shear testing. To improve the consistency of this instrument, and eliminate operator and test data interpretation related errors a standardised testing procedure was developed. The second aspect of investigation dealt with the design procedures for the determination of mass flow hopper geometries based on the coal flow properties and utilising the well accepted theories of Jenike. A novel method of design data presentation was developed which links the flow properties and the hopper geometry parameters. This was achieved by presenting all parameters as a function of a common independent variable, the major consolidation stress. This approach has advantages in accounting for experimental error in the flow properties and for the determination of hopper geometries that have design constraints.The hopper design procedures were further advanced by the development of an alternate presentation of the original Jenike flow factor charts .These alternative charts have been abbreviated to display only the critical design values in the border region between mass flow and funnel flow. The charts eliminate the need for imprecise parameter interpolations by displaying the required design parameters in the form of contours of constant wall slope and flow factor as a function of the effective angle of internal friction and kinematic angle of wall friction.These new concepts were combined to allow the generation of manual hopper geometry design nomograms or worksheets. This design presentation represents a compact and rapid method for the determination of mass flow hopper geometry parameters for axisymmetric and plane flow outlets.The influence and sensitivity of the coal sample variations was explored further by determining the hopper geometry parameters of wall slope and outlet dimension based on the respective flow properties. This has allowed standardised hopper design guidelines to be formulated. An important aspect highlighted by this study was the significant role of wall friction in achieving a successful design.In consideration of the design procedures for bulk solid storage, computer software was developed and implemented for the computer aided design of storage bins. Two programs were developed, the first, to aid in the rapid processing and analysis of experimental flow property data, describing the flow properties by empirical equations and graphically. The second program utilised the empirical flow property equations for the determination of critical hopper geometry parameters and the generation of other design graphs. The programs operate both on a mainframe computer and a microcomputer, and utilise interactive execution and high resolution graphics.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1580</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mastery through psychotherapy</field><field name="creator">Grenyer, Brin Felix</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1667</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application and evaluation of shoreline segmentation mapping approaches to assessing response to climate change on the Illawarra Coast, South East Australia</field><field name="creator">Abuodha, Pamela A.O.</field><field name="description">Climate change, particularly sea-level rise, threatens many coastal systems around the world. Coastal managers and decision-makers require information that enables them to assess the vulnerability of the coastlines to the range of impacts and to develop cheap, simple, generic tools, prompting the need to develop tools that can be used to study the impacts of climate change and sea-level rise on the coastal zones. This thesis examines tools that are available to assist in determining sensitivity of the coast, and then describes strengths and weaknesses of three different coastal assessment tools that adopt a GIS (Geographical Information System) approach to assess sensitivity of the shoreline, segmenting it on the basis of different variables. Each tool is applied to one case study section of the coast, the Illawarra region in southern New South Wales, Southeast Australia. The three tools are Dynamic Interactive Vulnerability Assessment (DIVA) tool, Geomorphic Stability Mapping (GSM) approach and the Coastal Sensitivity Index (CSI). The DIVA tool uses a global shoreline database (DINAS-Coast) and can be run using sea-level rise and the socio-economic scenarios in timesteps to the year 2100. The DIVA tool incorporates, socio-economic variables, and provides a vulnerability assessment. The Illawarra coast is represented by a single segment (segment 11105), and the tool is not designed for use at such a fine segment scale. The GSM approach, based on vulnerability mapping of the Tasmanian coast, segments the coast on the basis of form and fabric. It involves a user-defined set of segments that are divided where any of the variables change alongshore. In applying GSM approach to the Illawarra coast, several fields have been redefined and new classes of shoreline landforms identified, of which open ocean sandy shores backed by plains and dunes were scored with the highest sensitivity. After mapping the relative sensitivity of the Illawarra coast on the basis of the GSM approach, a time-series of aerial photographs was used to assess the pattern of historical shoreline change. The Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) tool was employed to describe rates of shoreline change of the high water line (HWL) and the vegetation line indicators for 11 beaches, and MIKE Marine DHI was used to calculate the subaerial beach and dune sediment volumes from 1938 to 2001 for 3 beaches, in order to determine to what extent modelled sensitivity corresponded with observed patterns of change. Abuodha, P. A. O., 2009 xv Application and Evaluation of Shoreline Segmentation Mapping Approaches in SE Australia This historical reconstruction provided further data from which to derive the CSI, modifying the CVI method that has been used in many developed countries. Where previous assessments have used six or seven variables, this analysis of the Illawarra coast used nine variables, of which six were structural variables (rock type, geomorphology, barrier type, shoreline change, segment exposure, coastal slope), and three were process variables (relative sea-level rise, mean wave height and tidal range). The patterns of change on the Illawarra coast are highly variable, many beaches were found to have accreted when the vegetation line was mapped over time, but different trends and different rates are observed from one beach to another and in some cases within the same beach. Each of the tools involves a level of generalisation, and their application is intended only as a first stage in assessment of shoreline vulnerability. Applying the three tools to the one case study enabled an evaluation of their relative strengths and weaknesses on the basis of several different criteria. The results from this study are useful to decision-makers and local councils in undertaking a more detailed, site-specific assessment for the Illawarra coast in the near future.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/852</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Technology, labour markets and the organisation of technical work: CADoctor of Creative ArtsM in Australia</field><field name="creator">Hyland, Paul William</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1718</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Art and transference: a comparative study of psychoanalytic transference and art and documentation of the exhibition Memory, Mammary, Mummery</field><field name="creator">Hull, Anthony</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1751</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fourteen stations of the Cross</field><field name="creator">Milgate, Rod</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1752</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of the attitudes and activities of the Church of England in the Illawarra during the First World War</field><field name="creator">Westwood, Susan</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/876</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Toward a conceptual model of the relationships between women's orientations to mothering, post-partum mood and infant-mother interaction</field><field name="creator">Earle, Michelle</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/909</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Journals of a stranger: documents of a life</field><field name="creator">Storey, John David</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/952</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Water law and the nature of customary water rights in Papua New Guinea</field><field name="creator">Kalinoe, Lawrence Kuna</field><field name="description">Majority of the indigenous people in Papua New Guinea (about 87 per cent) live on their customary land by engaging in fishing, hunting, gathering and subsistence agriculture for their daily sustenance. Water is obtained directly from rivers, lakes, and other watercourses.At present, Papua New Guinea is undergoing rapid economic growth in forestry, agroforestry, mining, and petroleum development activities. Most (if not all) of these natural resources development activities are conducted on customary land and in and around the environment in which the majority of the indigenous peoples live and on which they rely for their subsistence way of life. Many of these natural resource development projects have caused stress on the water resources: indeed in some instances, the projects have so impaired the quality of the water and water resources as to render such resources unsuitable for human consumption, and thereby adversely affecting the indigenous peoples' subsistence way of life.This has in turn prompted many indigenous peoples to aggressively assert their customary rights as customary right holders to the land and water resources. The now abandoned law suit by the customary water rights holders of the OK Tedi river discussed in Chapter 13 of this thesis stands as a pre-eminent example of this response.The law in Papua New Guinea allows for the customs of the indigenous peoples of the country to be pleaded and applied as law. In keeping with this, statute law on water resources management does not extinguish customary water use rights but allows for coexistence with statute based water use rights. Whilst on the one hand statute based water use rights are elaborately specified, on the other hand, customary water rights are left unspecified and hence remain vague. The challenge therefore is to ascertain the nature of customary water rights. That challenge is the focus of this thesis.To properly meet that challenge, it is imperative that we understand the customary regime by studying the customs, practices and perceptions of the owners of customary land adjacent to rivers, lakes and other watercourses about their rights over water and water resources (as holders of customary water rights).This thesis attempts to do that by first exploring and presenting, by way of introduction in Part I, the general and basic water law principles pertinent to indigenous water use rights at common law and secondly in Part II, by scrutinising the statutory water law regime in Papua New Guinea to ascertain the possible impacts on the exercise of customary water rights. Thirdly and more importantly, Part III presents and discusses empirical field work data on the customs, practices and perceptions of customary water rights holders. Finally Part IV, attempts to ascertain the nature in law of customary water rights and the modes of establishing and enforcing customary water right at Papua New Guinea law.In the final analysis, it is asserted in this thesis that customary water rights as they currently exist in Papua New Guinea are rights in the nature of property rights and therefore capable of enforcement by the holders of those rights in the event of breach. Customary water rights as they occur in Papua New Guinea are not mere water use rights but rather encompass and include not only the right to the take and use of water per se, but also the access rights to all of the other water resources, both living and non living which occur in the rivers, lakes and other watercourses which the indigenous people have  rights over.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1862</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Shallow water seagrass fish communities of Intermittently Closed and Open Lakes and Lagoons (ICOLLs) of south-eastern Australia</field><field name="creator">Jones, Martine V.</field><field name="description">The structure and dynamics of fish communities associated with shallow water seagrass habitats were investigated in estuaries along the south-eastern coast of Australia. The majority of estuarine systems in this region of southeast Australia are intermittently closed and open lakes and lagoons (ICOLLs). The fish communities within these coastal lakes have not been previously studied in detail. The sampling method employed in this study was aimed at the capture of new recruits, mainly small juveniles of marine and estuarine fish species using the seagrass beds as a nursery habitat, as well as species that were permanent residents of the seagrass meadows. Research was conducted over a three-year period in eight estuaries spanning approximately 500km of southern New South Wales (NSW). These estuaries are Lake Illawarra, St Georges Basin, Lake Conjola, Burrill Lake, Durras Lake, Coila Lake, Wallaga Lake and Merimbula Lake. Within seven of these estuaries, three locations representative of the entrance, central and upper locations were sampled quarterly for three years. Fish sampling was undertaken using a seine net (6mm stretch mesh, 25m long), primarily in Zostera capricomi seagrass beds. Environmental data was also recorded during each sampling event, and included salinity, conductivity, temperature, pH and turbidity.Overall, 101 fish species were found within the region. Within individual estuaries species diversity ranged from 41 to 61 species. The most specious families were the Gobiidae, Syngnathidae and Monacanthidae. The catch was dominated by large abundances of a few species, particularly from the Ambassidae, Atherinidae and Gobiidae families. There were significant spatial and temporal differences in the species diversity of seagrass fish fauna for each individual estuary. With the exception with Merimbula Lake, spatial and temporal differences in the abundance of fish were also evident. However, there was little consistency to these patterns, either within estuaries or between them. The location factor had little influence on fish diversity and abundance patterns, and there were no decline in species diversity and abundance with increasing distance from the estuary mouth. The largest percentage of variation was due to either lower species diversity or abundance found during the winter months, or large single catches of schooling fish species.Fish community dynamics were investigated by multivariate analyses. The results indicated that the fish species compositions within each estuary were highly similar on a spatial scale. There was little compositional change in the fish assemblages with increasing distance from the estuary mouth. Yearly changes in fish community composition were more noticeable than seasonal changes. It was found that the south coast fish fauna was composed of a "core" group of species that were caught consistently throughout time and were found at all locations. There were no 'restricted' species that had strong or distinct location-associations within these estuaries. Rather, some species may have had preferences for certain regions but were not restricted to them.Commercial fish species diversity and abundance patterns were investigated for six of the estuaries, and the recruitment dynamics of five major species were also examined for seven of the estuaries. The major findings were that there was a substantial increase in the strength of recruitment in 1998, and this was evident across all of the selected species and across all estuaries. This indicated that for these commercially important species, processes responsible for widespread and substantial increase in recruitment must be large-scale, and not restrictive processes confined to an individual species life-history characteristics or to a particular local area. Rainfall data from the south coast of NSW, and data relating to El Nino phenomena were discussed as the probable trigger for the high recruitment that occurred in the spring/summer of 1998. Overall, there were no consistent sites of recruitment in these ICOLLs, and patterns of settlement for all species at the three locations within each estuary were not consistent through time. However, there were small regional differences in the timing and magnitude of recruitment in the seven estuaries along a latitudinal scale.The results from the large-scale sampling program indicated that local processes within individual ICOLLs may be a much more important factor in the structuring of these fish communities than differences in geomorphology or biogeography for these ICOLLs. To investigate these local processes in detail, a sampling program was undertaken in two estuaries. Lake Illawarra and Durras Lake. These two estuaries were chosen, as they are very different systems in terms of shape and size, entrance conditions and degree of catchment and lake usage. Sampling of the shallow water seagrass fish communities was conducted at thirty-two sites within each estuary every six weeks for one year. The high degree of similarity in the shallow water fish community around each estuary that was found in the larger sampling program was still evident at a finer scale of sampling, and there were still inconsistent patterns of settlement through time within each estuary. This intensive sampling program provided a clearer understanding of the effects of individual lake morphology and hydrology on fish community patterns.Consideration of the information and conclusions from the two sampling programs have led to a number of hypotheses. It is proposed that lake morphology, individual hydrological characteristics and the local climatic regime are important determinants in the structuring of ICOLL fish assemblages in southeast Australia. The patterns in fish diversity and abundance, and in community dynamics were contrary to traditional concepts of estuarine fish patterns, which have been largely developed from research carried out in large riverine and permanently open estuaries, or in intermittently open estuaries where there are distinct seasonal rainfall patterns that influence the salinity gradients within the estuary. It would appear that the small size of ICOLLs in southern NSW, lack of seasonal rainfall patterns, the dominance of wind-induced transport rather than tidal-induced water transport, and the relatively stable salinity around the perimeter of the ICOLLs allows the widespread distribution of marine spawning species within these systems.This research has direct implications for the sustainable management and conservation of ICOLL environments and their fish communities. These coastal lakes were found to be important fish habitats, particularly in terms of their role as recruitment and nursery areas for a wide range of marine and estuarine species. However there were few, if any, consistent patterns in species recruitment, diversity and abundance, either between locations within estuaries, between estuaries within the region, or between seasons and years. Local hydrology, morphology and climate affecting individual ICOLLs are the most important factors structuring fish communities. Currently these ICOLLs are managed using a generic approach, based on the assumption that different ICOLLs have similar ecological characteristics. Based on the results from this research, the most suitable approach for management purposes is to consider each estuary as a unique situation requiring a detailed and localised approach.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1869</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Academic achievement and its relation to family background and locus of control</field><field name="creator">Khayyer, Mohammad</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1873</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stratigraphy, sedimentology and tectonic significance of the Talaterang and Shoalhaven groups in the Southern Sydney Basin</field><field name="creator">Tye, Stuart Clifford</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1983</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Health and service use in old age: longitudinal population based studies in Taiwan</field><field name="creator">Chen, Chun-Min</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1993</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of non-covalent small molecule DNA interactions and protein-DNA interactions</field><field name="creator">Kapur, Amit</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1178</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Determinants of e-government services adoption in developing countries: a field survey and a case study</field><field name="creator">Alhujran, Omar</field><field name="description">The rapid growth of investment in public service delivery through e-government has drawn attention to research on this area. However, both governments and academic researchers recognise the problem of low-level adoption of e-government services among citizens; the common problem in both developed and developing countries. E-government adoption, unlike most of IT adoption by employees in private-sector organizations, is voluntary and occurs often in turbulent social-political environments. Therefore, the problem needs to be addressed comprehensively from technological, social, political, and cultural perspectives. However, e-government adoption research currently lacks a comprehensive conceptual framework for explaining citizen adoption of e-government services. To fill this gap, this study extends the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) (Davis et al., 1989) by adding a set of social, political, and cultural constructs that are derived from different research literatures: government trustworthiness, perceived public value e-government programs, and national culture dimensions.  The extended model is then tested using multiple research methods: a large-scale, multi-site questionnaire survey of 335 Jordanian citizens, and case study interviews with e-government officials. Structural equation modelling and regressions analysis results indicate that citizen attitude towards using e-government services is the most significant determinant of citizen intention to use e-government services. Moreover, citizen attitude, in turn, is jointly determined by citizen belief: perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use of an e-government service. These results provide new evidence for considering the attitude construct to study citizen adoption of e-government services which is voluntary in nature. Importantly, the results also suggest the importance of perceived public value as a significant determinant of the citizen&#8217;s belief. Furthermore, the results show strong evidence of a positive relationship between trustworthiness and citizen belief. Research limitations and future directions as well as managerial implications are also discussed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1998</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contributions to authentication logics and analysis of authentication protocols</field><field name="creator">Mathuria, Anish</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2009</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Decision making in the secondary school: a case study of the constructs of the teacher using the repertory grid</field><field name="creator">Moffat, Kevin Patrick</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1331</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Health informatics: moving from technics and the fragmentation of knowledge to a socio-political understanding of the design and diffusion of computerised health records (CHRs) among general practitioners (GPs)</field><field name="creator">Bomba, David</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2014</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synchronisation of composite operations in multithreaded object-oriented programs</field><field name="creator">Lawler, Michael</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2021</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The colonisation of scientific uncertainty: liminality &amp; agency in science boundary work</field><field name="creator">Th&#233;r&#232;se, Sandrine A.</field><field name="description">The thesis focusses on the traditional problem of demarcation in science through the study of the politics of scientific "boundary work" and cultural cartography amidst scientific controversies where claims about the constitution of science and its "other" are asserted, contested and renegotiated. Human and non-human agents and agency are characterised via recourse to a critical practice theory and performative idiom approach where dialectical interactions between social structures and between collective, individual and natural agents are axiomatic. The study aims to provide a multi-sited ethnography of how notions of scientific convention and deviance are (re)defined in the course of scientific practice.Scientific texts and qualitative data yielded from ethnographic interviews and participant observation are analysed to provide insights into how the demarcation of science is achieved, contested and renegotiated by various science boundary workers. The symmetrical analysis of two case-studies of recent controversy in (Australian) science will show the ways in which both orthodox and controversial scientists and other scientific boundary workers deploy similar discursive tactics in order to "seduce" and "colonise" the minds (and therefore the bodies and resources) of their audience(s). The colonisation of uncertainty in scientific confroversies involves the discursive upgrading of certainty in one's own methods, claims and motives while undermining those of opponents. Hegemonic visions of ideal scientific agency as value-free, acultural and apolitical are reproduced in both dissident and orthodox discourses, despite the strategic deployment by dissidents of a quasi-sociological critique of their denouncers. Both controversial workers and their denouncers engage in justificatory discursive work that "domesticates" or "colonises" uncertainty in descriptions of natural agents and in the general trustworthiness of scientific claims. The strategic presentation through various public 'performances' of scientific work as the product of a scientific collective is seen to provide a highly seductive means by which scientific boundary workers galvanise confidence and support. However, an asymmetry in the scientific boundary work sampled can be seen in dissident workers' definitions of the non-uman or natural agents they study as complex, dynamic and non-linear. Lmear, machine-like or "machinic" visions of "natural" agency provide an ontological ground from which new scientific work may be denounced as liminal or ambiguous and thus suspect or controversial, or as clearly "polluted" and thus "deviant" and stigmatised.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2072</field></doc><doc><field name="title">[Doctor of Philosophy submission]</field><field name="creator">Reinecke, Ian</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2075</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gravity flowrate of bulk solids from mass flow bins</field><field name="creator">Gu, Zhi Hong</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2095</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Human cytomegalovirus induced plasma membrane glycoproteins in fibroblasts</field><field name="creator">Holmes, Shan</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2096</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of a Novel Silicon Microdosimeter for high LET radiation therapy</field><field name="creator">Bradley, Peter D.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1367</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Online memorials: adaptive practices in technoscientific and social change</field><field name="creator">Smith, Alison Jane</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2176</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A partnership model for development: Australian non-government organisations and the special case of the Asia Partnership for Human Development</field><field name="creator">Pollard, David</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2160</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The anatomy of a best-seller: the making of "Come in spinner"</field><field name="creator">North, Marilla</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2201</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of the influence of culture on management accounting</field><field name="creator">Ahl, Ebba Josephine</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2266</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Parliament and the British army: the structure of financial control, 1846-1899</field><field name="creator">Funnell, Warwick N.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2276</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of trade unions on the economic performance of the Australian building and construction industry: 1984-1996</field><field name="creator">Knight, Warren B.</field><field name="description">In order to estimate the effects of unions on the economic performance of the Australian Building and Construction Industry for the period 1984- 1996, an OLS regression is performed with union density acting as the measure of industry unionism. Output, profits and productivity are the industry performance measures under investigation. This paper finds that higher levels of union density are associated with increases in output and profits, a result that may have been surprising if the union voice function had been excluded from all reckoning. No significant result was recorded for the indicator of productivity. Voice, it is argued, was the key factor in producing the estimated results. The voice expressed by unions in the period under review (1984-1996) differed markedly from the voice expressed in the period immediately before it. It was this alteration in the expression of voice that represented the changing role of unions in the industry. From being overtly militant and anti-capitalist, they moved towards a position where at times they were incorporated into the greater movement of the neo-corporatist ethic. It is from this standpoint that it is argued that the estimated significant union positive influence on output and productivity in the Australian building and construction industry is a  likely and non-spurious result</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2289</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The form of the keyboard prelude</field><field name="creator">Forrest, David Lawrence</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2315</field></doc><doc><field name="title">To draw or not to draw?: an investigation of the place of drawing in the writing of four kindergarten children</field><field name="creator">Burrow, Nancy Narene</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2331</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"I'm Turkish but look at me, I'm also gifted" (Baldwin 1987): ethnic gifted and talented children : the difficulties in achieving educational excellence</field><field name="creator">Little, Marilyn</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2332</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mix design of rice husk ash concrete: an Australian experience</field><field name="creator">Semaan, Nelson</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2428</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intelligent impact control in anti-personnel mine detection</field><field name="creator">Shahri, Alireza Mohammad</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1952</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ferrite formation from deformed austenite in Nb-V and Nb-V-Ti microalloyed steels</field><field name="creator">Somantri, Amung</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2485</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Separation and purification of proteins using movel polymer structures</field><field name="creator">Yang, Xiaojun</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2627</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The preparation of isotopically labelled organic nitrogenous compounds</field><field name="creator">Robson, John</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2636</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Respite care for people with a terminal illness: what do carers want?</field><field name="creator">Nightingale, Ellen</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2694</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Concepts of "sufficiency" in women's physical activity for health: lay perspectives and the national guidelines</field><field name="creator">Giles, Belinda Gay</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2707</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The regeneration capacity of a remnant of Cumberland Plain Woodlands in Holsworthy military area</field><field name="creator">Hill, Sarah</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2753</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electronic cash: cryptography &amp;

Nature and accountability are 'foundational' concepts upon which environmental accounting has been built and in this work I show how these can be, and are, contested. If environmental accounting is to comment seriously on environmental concerns, these theoretical underpinnings must be explicitly (re)explored. This requires us to have a more comprehensive understanding of both what the project is about (nature) and what it is trying to achieve (environmental accountability and ultimately abating the ongoing destruction of the environment). In light of this, notions of nature and accountability are extensively re-examined to expose their multiplicity and to open up the assumptions that have surrounded these representational categories. This stages a return to these 'core' concepts to show how they are, and can be re-negotiated in order to develop less exploitative relationships with the non-human world.This thesis considers these concepts and contextualises its developments in relation to global negotiations over the issue of climate change. Discourses of climate change are explored, as is the Kyoto Protocol and Australian responses to global warming.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1025</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Petrological and petrophysical study of Permian arenites for potential subsurface storage of natural gas, Sydney basin, New South Wales, Australia</field><field name="creator">Ozimic, Stanley</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1400</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The packing of solid particles</field><field name="creator">Yu, Ai Bing</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1531</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ethnic nationalism and the state in Pakistan</field><field name="creator">Khan, Adeel</field><field name="description">Nationalism is a way of dealing with a world where 'everything melts into thin air'. It is a form of self-love in which individuals elebrate their collective identity. And like all forms of self-love it gets its strength more from the hatred of others than its love for the self Here lies the secret behind some of the most intractable conflicts in the world.Nationalism is, probably, the only form of self-love that gets its life-blood from an institution, the modem state. Had the state not been behind the self-love of the Germans, they would not have been able to torture and murder so many Jews in such a short period of time. Likewise, had the west not helped the Jews to establish their own state in Palestine, the Jews would never have been able to displace and kill so many Palestinians.Nationalism is not the 'pathology' of the odem world, but is, as a sentiment and as a doctrine, only a pathetic way to deal with a pathetic world. But nationalism as a game of power, as a politics, is lethal and destructive. As a sentiment and as a doctrine nationalism may be the child of an unstable and fast changing world but as a politics it is the child of the nation state. This thesis explores the relationship between the nation-state and the nationalisms of four ethnic groups, namely, Pukhtun, Sindhi, Baloch and Mohajir, who have, at various points in time, contested the legitimacy of the administrative structure of the Pakistani state. It starts with identifying the issue of ethnic conflicts, goes on to review the available literature and then outlines a framework for studying ethnic nationalism. As the emphasis here is on the role of the modem state in provoking ethnic discontent and resistance the second chapter discusses the interventionist role of the state and tries to highlight its relationship with nationalism. The second section of the chapter looks at various approaches to nationalism and explains as to which approach is more suitable and why for dealing with ethnic nationalism. The third chapter endeavours to explicate the difference between pre-colonial and colonial state in India as well as the way the colonial state despite being modem was different from the modem state system in the west. The fourth chapter discusses the state system in Pakistan and argues that the postcolonial state is a replica of the colonial state. The next four chapters examine the emergence of four ethnic movements and their varying strategies for dealing with the centralising and homogenising policies of the state. Throughout, the focus remains on the ethnic groups' distance from and proximity to the state system as the major factor in determining their relationships.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1736</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Harnessing Wiki technology for knowledge management in learning organisations</field><field name="creator">Pfaff, Charmaine C.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1745</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Food safety in pregnancy: an exploration of lay and professional perspectives</field><field name="creator">Bondarianzadeh, Dolly</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1992</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Doppler broadening of resonance profiles for fuels in the solid state</field><field name="creator">McKeegan, Daniel James</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2038</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Medication alliance: development and implementation of a mental health staff training program for the enhancement of patient medication adherence</field><field name="creator">Byrne, Mitchell K</field><field name="description">Patient nonadherence to prescribed medications remains a major hurdle in the effective delivery of health care services for people experiencing chronic illnesses. Nonadherence rates are particularly high among those with major mental health problems and account for a significant proportion of hospitalisations due to relapse in conditions previously well-managed by medications. Therefore, interventions to enhance the adherence of patients with mental health disorders should be an essential part of mental health services; however this is not always the case. This thesis involved a series of studies which investigated barriers to the implementation of adherence interventions, in particular, clinician skills, attitudes and knowledge, as well as describing a potential strategy to overcome these barriers.  The first study investigated the relationship between the beliefs and knowledge mental health nurses hold about medications and how this influences their self-reported use of strategies to enhance patient adherence to treatment. Participants comprised a convenience sample of 64 mental health nurses who completed questionnaires on their beliefs about medicines, their knowledge of neuroleptic medications and their self-reported difficulties in using commonly cited strategies for enhancing patient adherence. The results indicated that both poorer knowledge and more negative attitudes were associated with greater perceived difficulty in implementing standard adherence strategies.   The first study provided the impetus for a closer examination of specific clinician attitudes in relation to working with non-adherent patients and how such attitudes might influence clinician behaviour. Study 2 was a cross-sectional anonymous survey of 292 mental health clinicians and explored their attitudes about nonadherence in patients.  Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis of the attitudes items produced a 19 item, 5 factor scale: the Medication Alliance Beliefs Questionnaire (MABQ). The MABQ subscale &#8216;Adequacy&#8217;, (beliefs about the the sufficiency of the clinicians&#8217; own knowledge and skills in working with people who have nonadherence issues), was found to predict the extent to which mental health clinicians tried to enhance patient adherence.   The first two studies identified deficits in clinician skills, knowledge and attitudes as significant barriers to the implementation of adherence interventions. A clinician training program called &#8220;Medication Alliance&#8221; was then developed which specifically targeted skills, attitudes and knowledge relevant to the enhancement of patient medication adherence. Study 3 provided an initial evaluation of this training program in terms of the extent to which clinician participants showed improved skills, had enhanced knowledge and more positive attitudes toward working on adherence issues (using the MABQ). Participants were 23 experienced mental health workers who worked actively with non-adherent patients. The results indicated pre-post training improvements in all three domains (skills, knowledge and attitudes).   The first three studies identified the barriers to the implementation of adherence interventions, (clinician skills, knowledge and attitudes), and demonstrated that the Medication Alliance training program could improve these three clinician domains. Study 4 sought to determine whether Medication Alliance could be implemented in practice by clinicians and whether this resulted in improvements in patient adherence and reductions in levels of mental ill-health. A total of 46 clinicians participated in an &#8216;implementation trial&#8217; of Medication Alliance, with 51 patients providing clinical data. Data was collected at baseline, 6 months following clinician training and then again at 12 months post training. As with Study 3, improvements in clinician knowledge, attitudes and skills coincided with training. In an extension of these findings, most of these improvements were maintained over a 12 month period. It was also shown that clinicians&#8217; ratings of patients&#8217; adherence and their rating of therapeutic alliance also increased over the 12 month period.  Patients demonstrated improved insight into the need for treatment and reduced psychopathology. Overall, the results of Studies 1 through 4 indicated that clinician&#8217;s attitudes are an important consideration in implementing adherence strategies and that these attitudes can be successfully improved as a result of training. Further, preliminary research suggests that clinicians can learn, sustain and implement skills to facilitate medication adherence in their patients. Finally, these training effects appear to be associated with improvements in adherence and mental health in patients.   Although results from these implementation studies are encouraging, there is a need for a randomised clinical trial of Medication Alliance training compared to treatment as usual or a viable comparison intervention.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2070</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Psychological predictors of fitness to drive</field><field name="creator">Leung, Judith</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2135</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The politics of technological decision-making: the establishment of ANAHL</field><field name="creator">Scott, Pam</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2170</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Woman, wife and (m)other: post-colonial metaphors for negation</field><field name="creator">Hanley, Derek</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2209</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The global competitiveness of the Australian information technology industry: an assessment of the partnership for developmentprogram</field><field name="creator">Poornima, Ramakrishnan</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2298</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pitch detection techniques for prototype waveform coding</field><field name="creator">Gambino, Pasquale M.B.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2407</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of size segregation in the top part of an HYL-III reactor</field><field name="creator">Setyadi, Gunawan</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2472</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A simulation of roll wear in hot rolling processes</field><field name="creator">Wang, Bo</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2508</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of the properties of coal agglomerates and their effect on bulk density</field><field name="creator">Lu, Yuan</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2584</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Australianisation of American dietary research materials and the development of an extensive food database</field><field name="creator">Tsivis, Effie N.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2682</field></doc><doc><field name="title">High temperature superconducting coils and devices: design, fabrication, and testing - for power applications</field><field name="creator">Darmann, Frank</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2930</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of superconducting magnesium diboride conductors</field><field name="creator">Soltanian, Saeid</field><field name="description">The work in this thesis concentrates on the fabrication and characterization of MgB2 superconducting bulk wire and tape. An overview of the research on MgB2 superconductor during the last three years is also provided. High transport and magnetic critical current density values above 105 A/cm2 have been obtained for metal-clad wires and tapes. Fe-clad MgB2 tapes were fabricated using a powder-in-tube technique. The tape shows a sharp transition with a transition width &#916;Tc of 0.2 K and a Tc0 of 37.5 K. An high transport critical current value of 1.7 &#215; 104 A/cm2 for both 29.5 K in 1 Tesla and 33 K in zero applied field has been achieved. The effects of sintering time and temperature on the formation and critical current densities of Feclad MgB2 wires is also investigated. MgB2 wires were sintered for different periods of time at predetermined temperatures. In contrast to the common practice of sintering for several hours, results show that there is no need for prolonged heat treatment in the fabrication of Fe/MgB2 wires. A total time in the furnace of several minutes is enough to form nearly pure MgB2. Jc of 4.5&#215;105 A/cm2 in zero field and above 105 A/cm2 in 2 T at 15 K has been achieved for Fe/MgB2 wires sintered for a short time. These findings substantially simplify the fabrication process, making it possible to have a continuous process for fabrication and reducing the costs for large-scale production of MgB2 wires. Ag and Cu clad MgB2 wires were also fabricated using an in-situ reaction method. The effects of a shorter than usual sintering on the critical current densities of Ag and Cu clad MgB2 wires were studied. For Ag clad wire Jc is improved by more than two times after the short period sintering process. Jc values of 1.2&#215;105 A/cm2 in zero field and above 104 A/cm2 in 2 T at 20 K have been achieved for Ag clad MgB2 wire which is only sintered for a few minutes at 800 oC. However, a remarkable degree of reaction has been found between the superconducting cores and the sheath materials, leading to the formation of Cu2Mg and Ag3Mg for copper and silver clad wires, respectively. The results show that the short sintering causes less reaction between the magnesium and the sheath materials and markedly improves the critical current density. Our results also show that iron is still the best sheath material for MgB2 superconductor wire and tape. Sixteen-filament stainless steel/Fe/MgB2 wires were fabricated by the powder-in-tube method followed by groove rolling. Magnetic critical current densities of 3.4&#215;105 A/cm2 in 0.5 T and about 1.9&#215;105 A/cm2 in 1 T at 5 K were achieved. Results on transport Jc of solenoid coils up to 100 turns fabricated with Cu-sheathed MgB2 wires using a windreaction in-situ technique are reported. Despite the low density of the single core and some reaction between the Mg and the Cu-sheath, our results demonstrate that the decrease in transport Jc with increasing length of MgB2 wires is insignificant. Solenoid coils with diameters as small as 10 mm can be readily fabricated using a wind-reaction in-situ technique. The Jc of coils is essentially the same as for straight wires. Jc values of 133,000 A/cm2 and 125,000 A/cm2 at 4 K and self field have been achieved for small coil wound using Cu-sheathed tape and Cu-sheathed wire respectively. The results indicate that the MgB2 wires have potential for large scale applications. The effect of chemical doping on the superconductivity and critical current density of MgB2 superconductor is investigated. Enhancements in the Jc field performance as well as the irreversibility field were obtained due to chemical doping with both C and SiC nano-particles. Doping MgB2-x(SiC)x/2 with x = 0, 0.2 and 0.3 and a 10 wt% nano-SiC doped MgB2 sample, led to slight decrease in Tc and significantly enhanced Hc2, Hirr and Jc at high magnetic fields. Compared to the non-doped sample, Jc for the 10 wt% doped sample increased by a factor of 32 at 5 K and 8 T, 42 at 20 K and 5 T, and 14 at 30 K and 2 T. At 20 K, which is considered to be a benchmark operating temperature for MgB2, the best Jc for the doped sample was 2.4&#215;105 A/cm2 at 2 T, which is comparable to Jc of the best Ag/Bi-2223 tapes. At 20 K and 4 T, Jc was 36,000 A/cm2, which is an order of magnitude higher than for the Fe/MgB2 tape. Our results show that there are two distinguishable but closely related mechanisms: increase of Hc2 and improvement of flux pinning that control the performance of Jc(H) in the samples. SiC-doping introduced many nano-scale precipitates and disorders at B and Mg sites, provoking a high resistivity of &#961; (40K) = 300 &#956;&#937;-cm (RRR = 1.75) for the SiC-doped sample, leading to significant enhancement of both Hc2 and Hirr with only minor effects on Tc. EELS and TEM analysis revealed impurity phases: Mg2Si, MgO, MgB4, BOx, SixByOz, and BC at a scale below 10 m and an extensive domain structure of 2-4nm domains in the doped sample which serve as strong pinning centers. The effect of nano-SiC doping on the critical current density and flux pinning of Fe/MgB2 wires is also investigated. The depression of Tc with increasing SiC doping level remained rather small. High level SiC doping resulted in a substantial enhancement in the Jc(H) performance. The transport Jc for all the wires is comparable to the magnetic Jc at higher fields despite the low density of the samples. The transport Ic for the 10 wt% doped Fe/MgB2 wire reached 675 A at 24 K and 1 T (Jc = 140,000 A/cm2) and 500 A at 20 K and 2T (Jc = 103,000A/cm2). The transport Jc for the 10wt% SiC doped MgB2 wire is 30 times higher than for the undoped wire. SiC doped MgB2 polycrystalline samples were fabricated using different grain sizes (20 nm, 100 nm, and 37 &#956;m) of SiC and different doping levels (0, 8, 10, 12, 15 wt %) in order to investigate the effect of the particle size of the starting SiC powder on the properties of samples. Results show that grain sizes of the starting precursors of SiC have a strong effect on the critical current density and its field dependence. The smaller the SiC grains are, the better the Jc field performance is. Significant enhancement of Jc and the irreversibility field Hirr were revealed for all the SiC doped MgB2 with additions up to 15 wt%. A Jc as high as 20,000 A/cm2 in 8 T at 5 K was achieved for the sample doped with 10 wt% SiC with a grain size of 20 nm. Results indicate that the nano-inclusions and substitution inside MgB2 are responsible for the enhancement of flux pinning. Polycrystalline MgB2-xCx samples with x=0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 nano-particle carbon powder were prepared using an in-situ reaction method under well-controlled conditions to limit the extent of C substitution. It was found that both the a-axis lattice parameter and the Tc decreased monotonically with increasing doping level. However, for the sample doped with the highest nominal composition of x=0.4 the Tc dropped only 2.7 K. The nano-C doped samples showed an improved field dependence of the Jc compared with the undoped sample over a wide temperature range. The nhancement by C-doping is not as strong as for nano-SiC doped MgB2. X-ray diffraction results indicate that C reacted with Mg to form nano-size Mg2C3 and MgB2C2 particles. A study of ac susceptibility, magnetic shielding and the sample size effect is presented in Chapter 6. Systematic ac susceptibility measurements were performed on MgB2 bulk samples. It is shown that the flux creep activation energy is a nonlinear function of the current density U , indicating a nonlogarithmic relaxation of the current density in this material. The dependence of the activation energy on the magnetic field is determined to be a power law (J ) &#8733; J &#8722;0.2 U(B) &#8733; B&#8722;1.33 , showing a steep decline in the activation energy with magnetic field, which accounts for the steep drop in the critical current density with magnetic field that is observed in MgB2. Magnetic shielding was investigated by means of transport critical current measurements for Fe-sheathed MgB2 round wires. Strong magnetic shielding by the iron sheath was observed, resulting in a decrease in Ic by only 15% in a field of 0.6 T at 32 K. In addition to shielding, interaction between the iron sheath and the superconductor resulted in a constant Ic between 0.2 and 0.6 T. This was well beyond the maximum field for effective shielding of 0.2 T. This effect can be used to substantially improve the field performance of MgB2/Fe wires at fields at least 3 times higher than the range allowed by mere magnetic shielding by the iron sheath. The dependence of Ic on the angle between the field and the current showed that the transport current does not flow straight across the wire, but meanders between the grains. The effect of sample size on the critical current density and the flux pinning of pure and SiC doped MgB2 bulk samples has been investigated. At high fields a systematic degradation of magnetic Jc and Hirr was observed as the sample size decreased. However, Jc remarkably increased on decreasing the sample volume at low magnetic fields below 1 T. The SiC doped samples show less sample size effect than the pure samples, indicating a larger n-factor and therefore a stronger pinning effect due to SiC doping.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/381</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The mathematical background of primary teachers in the Illawarra Region, 1962-1981</field><field name="creator">Snow, Dianne</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/870</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Determination of odour compounds in surface waters</field><field name="creator">Korth, Wolfgang</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1133</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stormwater quality modelling of urban catchments</field><field name="creator">Boroumand-Nasab, Saied</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1273</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modeling and generation of computing platform for distributed manipulation environment</field><field name="creator">Tuominen, Juha Olavi</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1345</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re-presenting human nature: body and soul language in the poetry of George Herbert</field><field name="creator">Lear, Anne Veronica</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1374</field></doc></add>
