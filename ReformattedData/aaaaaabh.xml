<add><doc><field name="title">Anodic films on Bismuth</field><field name="creator">Williams, David Edward</field><field name="description">This thesis deals with the nucleation, growth and defect structure of anodic oxide films formed on bismuth in aqueous electrolytes. The early stages in the formation of continuous anodic layers of bismuth oxide were studied using the technique of cyclic voltammetry. During this period, the oxide, Bi2O3, covered the surface by a process of simultaneous thickening and spreading of patches. The study of oxide nucleation classified the metal surface into two different areas with different kinetics of oxide nucleation. The ratio of the two areas varied according to the history and original preparation of the surface. Film nucleation was also studied by the galvanostatic step and potentiostatic step methods. The rate of spreading of the oxide patches over the surface was shown to be controlled by the magnitude of the surface area still uncovered. Film thickening was studied using both galvanostatic and cyclic voltammetric techniques. The high field growth law i = &#256; exp (B&#274;) where i is the current density and &#274; the field in the oxide layer, was found with parameters &#256; = (1 &#177; 0.5) x 10-5 A cm-2 B = (2.0 &#177; 0.5) x 10-6 cm V-1 This value of B gives an activation distance for high-field ion transport, a* = 0.2 nm, comparable to the radius of a lattice site. These parameters were determined for very thin films in strongly alkaline electrolyte (pH 13; thickness &lt;30 nm). At greater film thickness, cracking of the film gave a porous layer on top of a continuous barrier layer, and the apparent value of the parameter B increased to 1.7 x 10-5 cm v-1. All previous work on the bismuth anodic film thickening process has been affected to some extent by cracking of the film. In this work, cracking of the film was confirmed by microscopic observation, including scanning electron microscopy. Dissolution of the film, giving breakdown of the oxide layer and pitting of the metal, was an important phenomenon. It became particularly significant for pH &lt;8. The thickness attained by the anodic bismuth oxide layer was limited by this process to only 4 nm at pH 5, increasing to over 200 nm at pH 13. The cathodic reduction of the oxide proceeded from the outer surface inwards, and a rough, porous metal surface resulted. A model involving electron injection from the metal into the oxide, diffusion of electrons through the film and their reaction at the outer surface has been proposed. Microscopic observation confirmed the porous nature of the electro-reduced surface. The transient conductivity of the bismuth anodic film has been investigated, and the effects of standing at open-circuit in the electrolyte or of heating in air studied. The galvanostatic method was used. The observed effects could be adequately explained as being due to the presence ofanon-stoichiometric, n-type (excess metal) layer at the film-solution interface. Cyclic voltammetry was used to investigate the possibility of nucleation of anodic bismuth oxo-halides from solutions containing halide ions. Solutions containing fluoride, chloride, bromide or iodide at pH 4-9, phosphate and phosphate with added methanol at pH 8.5 were used. Consideration of thermodynamic stability would indicate the formation of new phases, but results showed that, in the comparatively short time scale of the experiments, kinetic factors resulted in the formation of anodic Bi2O3, except when the solution contained iodide at low pH, when the oxo-iodide, BiOI, was probably formed. Room lighting had no effect on the cyclic voltammetric or galvanostatic measurements. The transient response of anodic films on bismuth to an intense flash of white light was studied. In the case of a thick anodic oxide film (240 nm), the results were interpreted in terms of photo-excitation of the film, producing electron-hole pairs which were separated by the applied field. The recombination process was best described as rate-limiting thermal excitation of trapped electrons. The lifetime of an electron in the conduction band of anodic Bi2O3 was determined: &#964;c = 23 ms. The photo-response of a very thin anodic oxide film (4 nm) involved internal photo-emission of electrons from the metal into the oxide. Formation of a positive space charge by the injection of extra cations from the metal into the film followed. The transient photo-potential (galvanostatic experiments) or photo-current (potentiostatic experiments) showed the decay of both excess electronic and ionic space charges. The density of electron traps in the anodic oxide film was determined as NT &gt; 3 x 1018 cm-3. When the anodic film was formed in a solution containing bromide or iodide at pH 5, an inversion of the sign of the primary photo-effect from that observed in the absence of additives (4 nm thick film) was seen, and interpreted in terms of the photo-excitation of halide ions incorporated in the film. The lifetime of a conduction electron in anodic BiOI was determined as 1.5 &#177; 0.2 ms, much less than in anodic Bi2O3 (23 ms). In all the studies of the photo-effect, Gauss' theorem was used to relate the observed photo-potential (galvanostatic experiments) to the photo-induced charge separation. An approximate value of the conduction electron mobility in anodic Bi2O3 was thus obtained: &#956; &#8771; 5 x 10-8 cm2 V-1 s-1. Parameters for the evolution of hydrogen on the bare bismuth metal surface, were obtained: b = 0.11 V, log10(i0/Acm-2) = -10.3 and (&#8706;(log10i0)/&#8706;(PH))&#951; = 0 where &#951; = E &#8211; 60 pH mV.</field><field name="date">1974</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2460</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of serial correlation on linear models</field><field name="creator">Triggs, Christopher M.</field><field name="description">Given a linear regression model y = X&#946; + e, where e has a multivariate normal distribution N(0, &#931;) consequences of the erroneous assumption that e is distributed as N(0, I) are considered.

As it is the first regional input-output model in this country to incorporate significant survey and secondary data the survey procedure and model construction are outlined. The input-output table is used to discuss important regional transactions and the purchase and sales patterns of industries. The model analyses industries' contributions to export receipts and import payments and calculates the impact of changes in export receipts on regional income and imports. A comprehensive multiplier analysis of Northland's economy covers output, income, employment and imports and confidence limits for the multipliers are developed using the Monte Carlo technique to simulate survey errors. The model explores the economic implications of forestry expansion in Northland and discusses the areas available for afforestation, planting rates, tree management, wood supply and wood processing options in the region. The modifications made to the model and data requirements for simulating forestry expansion are outlined and employment and income impacts given for three types of processing complexes and for forestry expansion as a whole. Finally an economic evaluation is made of the impacts of processing-plant construction and supporting services.</field><field name="date">1981</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290500 Mechanical and Industrial Engineering::290501 Mechanical engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2467</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bonding in d10 transition metal complexes</field><field name="creator">Whiting, R.

These are interpreted in terms of the structures of the complexes and the various possible bonding schemes for these d10 transition elements. To interpret the n.q.r. spectra the contributions to the field gradient at the copper nucleus of the various orbitals in the copper atoms are calculated and the Townes and Dailey approximations are revaluated. From this the s-d mixing theory of Orgel is chosen as the most satisfactory description of the bonding in these complexes.

(Cheng Yi), 1938-</field><field name="description">Building on Kibblewhite's long term investigations of the nonlinear wave-wave interactions and the infrasonic ocean noise and the microseisms these induce, this thesis further explores the physical nature of these processes. The classical description of this interaction, which takes into account only the homogeneous component of the induced field, has been extended to include the inhomogeneous component. A complete expression for the wave induced noise spectrum is established following a geometrical analysis of the dispersion relations among interacting waves. The relative importance of these two components and their directivity properties are also calculated and discussed. It is shown that while at observation points deeper than 500 meters the effects of the inhomogeneous component can be regarded as negligible, it can cause an increase of noise level of up to 40 dB in the region near the surface of the sea. Furthermore, in contrast to the nearly omni-directional distribution of the homogeneous component of the induced acoustic field, there is a tendency for the energy associated with the inhomogeneous component to focus in the wind direction. Based upon a multilayer analysis of a visco-elastic geoacoustic model, Green's functions and the spectral transfer functions relating the surface source pressure field to the underwater noise and microseism fields are derived for both near and far field cases. A 3-dimensional presentation defined on the dispersion plane (frequency and horizontal wave number) is introduced to describe the sea bottom reflection-loss and, Green's functions, and is extended to include the inhomogeneous region for the first time. The characteristics of this 3-D presentation are explained in terms of the geoacoustic parameters. The influence of the interaction of multiple seas (and swell) on the induced acoustic field are also discussed in this thesis. All these effects are considered in the calculation of the synthetic spectra of both the noise and microseism field. When compared with measured data excellent agreement is found between the theoretical and experimental results, which provides further confirmation that the nonlinear interaction is the most important source of the infrasonic ocean noise, as well as confirming the basic validity of the procedure introduced by Kibblewhite and Ewans to derive the ocean noise spectra from microseism records.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2469</field></doc><doc><field name="title">X-ray structural studies of selected group VIII metal complexes</field><field name="creator">Marsden, Karen</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the single crystal x-ray analyses of six novel organometallic osmium complexes and three complexes of the tridentate dentate ligand 1,6-bis(diphenylphosphino)-trans-hex-3-ene with the transition metals iridium, rhodium and ruthenium. The complexes of carbon monosulphide and carbon monotelluride with osmium, OsCl2(CO)(CS)(PPh3)2 and OsCl2(CO)(CTe)(PPh3)2, exhibit linear thio- and telluro-coordination similar to that of the carbonyl. The -CS and -CTe ligands exert strong trans-bond weakening influences. In the dihapto-thioacyl complex of osmium, Os(&#951;1-o2CCF3)[C(S)-(p-tolyl)](CO)(PPh3)2, the bidentate thioacyl is coordinated to the osmium through the carbon and sulphur atoms. This bonding involves a considerable degree of &#960;-interaction between the C, S and Os atoms, concomitant with a lengthening of the C-S bond. The dichlorocarbene complex, OsCl2(CO)(CCl2)(PPh3)2 is disordered in the crystalline state. Consequently, while the presence of the dichlorocarbene is verified, no unambiguous conclusions can be drawn from the associated geometry. In the carbyne complex of osmium, Os(C-p-tolyl)Cl(CO)(PPh3)2, the osmium is in a trigonal bipyramidal environment with an approximately linear arrangement of the Os-C-R group. The Os-Ccarbyne bond is short (corresponding to a bond order of ca. 3), confirming the formation of the C-p-tolyl group as a carbyne. The formaldehyde ligand in the osmium complex, Os(&#951;2-CH2O)(CO)2(PPh3)2, is bonded to the osmium centre via both the carbon and oxygen atoms. The C-O bond of the formaldehyde lengthens considerably upon coordination, resulting in a bond order apparently less than 1. Also present in the crystal structure are molecules of water which are hydrogen bonded into pairs (O&#8230;O separation 2.56 &#197;). The (H2O)2 units do not hydrogen bond to any other atoms, but rather occupy hydrophobic interstices in the structure. The three complexes of 1,6-bis(diphenylphosphino)-trans-hex-3-ene, (BDPH), IrIIICl3(BDPH), RhIIICl3(BDPH), and RuIICl2(CO)(BDPH) are isomorphous. The ruthenium complex is, however, disordered in the crystalline state. In each of the three structures the olefin of the BDPH moiety is only weakly bound to the metal, leaving the C-C double bond virtually unchanged from that of the free ligand. The olefin exerts a stronger trans-bond weakening influence than do the chlorine ligands in these complexes.</field><field name="date">1981</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2477</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Oxidation of Ring-A Aromatic Steroids</field><field name="creator">Carlisle, Valerie F.</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with a study of the oxidation of ring-A aromatic steroids using either chromium trioxide-aqueous sulphuric acid-acetone or chromium trioxide-aqueous acetic acid mixtures. It was found that chromic acid oxidation of ring-A aromatic steroids substituted with a strong electron-donating group, gives rise to products with the site of oxidation being predominantly that para to the activating group. Thus C-3 methoxy ring-A aromatic steroids give the corresponding 9b-hydroxy-11-oxo and 9-oxo-9,11-seco-11-oic acid derivatives as the major products and the 6-oxo derivative as a minor oxidation product. However, a ketol was not formed if a C-3 methoxy ring-A aromatic steroid also contained a substituent at C-1. The C-1-methoxy-4-methyl ring-A aromatic steroids give the 4-carboxy derivative as the major product and again the 6-oxo compound as a minor neutral product. The acetoxy and methyl substituted ring-A aromatic steroids, however, all give rise to the 6-oxo derivatives as the major products. The usual oxidation product of a ring-A aromatic steroid is therefore the 6-oxo product unless it is substituted with a methoxy group in a position which will stabilise an electron deficiency at a site other than C-6. Oxidation will then occur predominantly at the stabilised site unless it is sterically blocked.</field><field name="date">1969</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2484</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on Nucleic Acids in Relation to Protein Synthesis</field><field name="creator">Baguley, Bruce C.</field><field name="description">Several methods for the fractionation of transfer RNA have been investigated.

In little more than a century a transformation has occurred in Maori agriculture. Before 1840, most Maori agriculture could best be described as shifting cultivation. The existence of this form of cultivation in Maori life can be indicated by such terms a Tohea Whenua which means a field exhausted by cultivation and Oneone hou which signifies new soil. In this system the sweet potatoe (Ipomea batatus)was the major crop. Apart from the dog, no other animals were kept. Today shifting cultivation in its technical sense is non-existent and Maori agriculturists are mostly commercial pastoral farmers, keeping dairy cows and sheep. The production of dairy produce and of other pastoral products by the Maori who form 7 percent of the population, is not a very significant proportion of the New Zealand total. It is nevertheless of quite noticeable volume when compared on a world basis with the total output of pastoral production in many other countries. The number of Maori holding in 1959-1960 was 5,227.</field><field name="date">1966</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::269900 Other Earth Sciences::269901 Physical geography</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2489</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies with organoruthenium complexes of substituted arenes</field><field name="creator">Coulson, Sally Anne.</field><field name="description">The modified reactivity observed when a substituted arene is complexed to a cycIopentadienylruthenium moiety has been exploited to prepare a range of synthetically interesting target molecules. Activation of nitrogen- and halogen- substituted arenes has been achieved by compIexation to the cyclopentadienylruthenium moiety. Double nucleophilic substitution reactions between substituted (7 6- 1,2-dichlorw benzene)RuCp+ salts and substituted 1,2-benzenediols were carried out under mild conditions to prepare substituted (q6-dibenzodioxin)ruthenium complexes. Both mono- and di-substituted dibenzodioxin complexes were prepared. The dibenzodioxin ligands were subsequently liberated by photolysis. The complexation of a range of substituted benzimidazoles to the cyclopentadienylruthenium moiety has been studied. Several complexes were isolated and structures proposed. The metal moiety has been used to influence the stereoselection achieved in the reduction of carbonyl substituted arenes. A number of keto-arene complexes were prepared and reduced with sodium borohydride. The resulting alcohol complexes were characterised and the observed diastereoselectivity rationalised. Yanovsky-like adducts were prepared by nucleophilic addition to the cationic ruthenium salts to produce neutral (n5-cyclohexadienyl)ruthenuim complexes.

It also examines in detail the effects of the high degree of degeneracy in scheduling set partitioning models. Degeneracy can cause severe computational difficulties because it inflates the number of simplex iterations needed to solve the set partitioning linear programme. In this thesis, it is shown that a maximum-pivot leaving variable criterion can considerably improve the performance of the simplex method, but that this alone is insufficient. Experiments with several degeneracy-resolving techniques have been performed on a class of highly degenerate problems arising from an air crew rostering application, and the results are discussed. Before the set partitioning model can be applied to scheduling, the problem size must be heuristically reduced. Therefore the overall Christchurch system is divided into several subsystems which are solved sequentially. Also, a three-stage method has been developed which essentially considers each type of duty individually. At the first stage, meal-breaks are allocated carefully to reduce the effects of the loss of interaction among the subproblems. A further heuristic reduction technique is then applied to each subproblem, not only to reduce its size but also to improve its integer properties. The resulting solution method has been applied to the Christchurch weekday scheduling problem. A special technique for the Sunday scheduling problem has also been developed. The two methods are described and the promising results which have been achieved are discussed.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2517</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploitation of geothermal reservoirs</field><field name="creator">Krol, Dexter E.</field><field name="description">This work presents a numerical model for simulating the response of a geothermal reservoir to exploitation.

The techniques enable simulation of a geothermal flow in all three thermodynamic states &#8211; compressed water, two-phase and superheated steam regions &#8211; and transitions between these states. The model is able to simulate a geothermal system where the presence of carbon dioxide as a second component influences exploitation response. Results are presented for a range of reservoir states. The effects of different physical parameters are considered.

Adsorption onto iron oxyhydroxides is the dominant mechanism controlling the transport and toxicity of trace metals in water bodies impacted by AMD. The purpose of this study was to apply the Diffuse Layer Model (DLM) to describe the adsorption of trace metals by iron oxyhydroxides from these systems, using synthetic iron oxyhydroxide minerals, ferrihydrite, pure acicular goethite, SO4-rich goethite prepared from FeSO4 oxidation and a synthetic schwertmannite.  The ferrihydrite adsorption of the trace metals Cu, Zn, Cd and Co from single sorbate systems was accurately described using the DLM with two surface site types (type-1 and type-2) having site densities of 0.005 and 0.2 mol (mol Fe)-1 respectively. The ferrihydrite adsorption of SO4 from single sorbate systems was accurately described using the DLM with adsorption on the type-2 sites. However, the enhanced adsorption of Cu, Zn, Cd and Co in the presence of SO4 was not predicted using adsorption constants derived from single sorbate systems. By including a neutral ternary complex with stoichiometry &#61626;Fe(2)OHMeSO4 (where &#61626;Fe(2)OH is a type-2 surface site and Me is the trace metal) the effect of SO4 on metal adsorption was accurately described for the range of Me, Fe and SO4 concentrations studied. The adsorption of Cu and Zn onto schwertmannite at total metal to iron ratios (MeT:Fe) up to 8 x 10-3 was almost identical to that predicted for ferrihydrite in the presence of 0.01 mol kg-1 SO4. To model the ferrihydrite adsorption of Pb from single sorbate systems a third higher affinity site (type-0) with a site density of 0.00035 mol (mol Fe)-1 was required. The effect of SO4 on Pb adsorption could only be modelled by including a neutral ternary complex on both the type 1 and type 2 sites in the case of Pb. Metal adsorption onto a pure acicular goethite could be accurately described by the DLM with two surface site types. The type 2 site density that provided the best fit to the goethite adsorption data was 0.027 mol (mol Fe)-1 corresponding to 2.3 nm-2. The type-1 site density that provided the best fit to goethite adsorption of Cu, Pb and Cd was 0.00028 mol (mol Fe)-1 corresponding to 0.024 nm-2. For Zn adsorption on goethite the type-1 site density was significantly larger at 0.0015 mol (mol Fe)-1 corresponding to 0.13 nm-2. In all cases studied the presence of SO4 caused an increase in the extent of metal adsorption by goethite. This increased adsorption of metals in the presence of SO4 was accurately predicted by including ternary complex formation at both the high and low affinity adsorption sites. For both ferrihydrite and goethite the values of adsorption constants for ternary complex formation (logKxMeTC) were related to the adsorption constant for metal adsorption in the absence of SO4 (logKxMeINT). This was evident from a plot of logKxMeTC as a function of logKxMeINT for all metals, which showed a linear relationship with slope of 0.69 and intercept of 8.03. This relationship suggests that the enhancement of metal adsorption on both oxyhydroxides due to SO4 occurs by the same process.  When comparing Cu, Zn and Cd adsorption onto ferrihydrite and acicular goethite the effect of the larger goethite adsorption constants are approximately compensated for by the lower goethite site densities. Therefore the Cu, Cd and Zn adsorption isotherms on ferrihydrite and acicular goethite are fairly similar at low adsorption densities. In the case of Pb, the site densities and adsorption constants are both larger on ferrihydrite and there is a large difference between the ferrihydrite and acicular goethite adsorption isotherms.  Sulfate-rich goethite had considerably higher site densities, per mol of oxide, than the pure acicular goethite. Adsorption onto the sulfate-rich goethite could be modelled reasonably accurately using the parameters developed to model adsorption onto the pure acicular goethite but with a higher surface area and a higher ratio of type-1 to type 2 sites. In general, therefore, the parameters developed for pure goethite are apparently similar to those for the sulfate-rich goethite, but are not directly transferable. The difficulty in measuring the surface area of the highly aggregated sulfate-rich goethite makes comparisons between the two goethites more difficult.  The adsorption of Cu, Zn and Cd onto the SO4-rich goethite exceeds that of ferrihydrite because the higher adsorption constants of goethite are combined with the considerably higher site densities of the SO4-rich goethite compared to the acicular goethite. In contrast the higher site densities of the SO4-rich goethite does not completely compensate for the low logKINT values of Pb adsorption on goethite. Therefore SO4-rich goethite adsorption of Pb is lower than that of ferrihydrite.  When applied to literature data from AMD oxides the parameters derived in this thesis have significantly improved the ability of the DLM to predict trace metal adsorption in AMD systems, compared to using ferrihydrite as a proxy for all iron oxyhydroxides and adsorption data derived only from single sorbate systems.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Acid mine drainage</field><field name="subject">adsorption</field><field name="subject">ferrihydrite</field><field name="subject">goethite</field><field name="subject">sulfate</field><field name="subject">copper</field><field name="subject">cadmium</field><field name="subject">lead</field><field name="subject">zinc</field><field name="subject">AMD</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2553</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Study of near-surface ozone concentrations in the city of Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Adeeb, Farah</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2571</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Foraminifera from the Mahoenui Group North Wanganui basin</field><field name="creator">Topping, Robert Mark</field><field name="description">The Mahoenui Group is a body of Oligocene and early Miocene marine clastic sedimentary rock in which two formations are recognized. The first, the Taumatamaire Formation (Happy, 1971) consists of up to 1000m of blue grey calcareous mudstone together with two minor limestones, the Awakino Limestone Member (Hay, 1967) and the Black Creek Limestone Member (new name). The second Formation, the Taumarunui Formation (Nelson &amp; Hume, 1977) is made up of 1000m of flysch. Two facies types are seen in the flysch, the proximal and distal flysch facies. 350 species of Foraminifera are recorded in 167 samples from 47 sections. Their systematics are discussed and many are illustrated using scanning electron photomicrographs. 11 new species are recognised in the genera, Almaena, Anomalina, Epistominella, Gavelinopsis, Globocassidulina, Guttulina, Lamarckina, Lenticulina, Melonis and Verneuilina. One new subspecies of Bolivina reticulata is also recognised. These are not formally named here but will be described in papers to be published later. An appraisal of numerical techniques in taxonomy is made while considering the Globigerina woodi "group" from the Mahoenui.

The paleoecology and paleobathymetry of the samples is investigated using both conventional and numerical methods.

This group is established to contain the igneous and proximal sedimentary products of the lower to mid Miocene west Northland volcanic arc and is divided into three subgroups. The northern, Waipoua, Subgroup (new), consists of the Waipoua Basalt and associated volcaniclastic sediments of the Hokianga - Kaihu area. The central, Hukatere, Subgroup (new), contains volcaniclastic and igneous rocks of the Tokatoka &#8211; okahukura Peninsula area, Kaipara. The southern, Manukau, Subgroup, contains igneous rocks and associated volcaniclastic sediments of the Waitakere Hills and adjacent areas. The Waitakere Hills and their northern extension to Helensville (c.500 km2) have been systematically mapped at a scale of 1:25000 and found to consist of a number of tilted or gently folded blocks of Manukau Subgroup having a low, overall, west to north-west tilt. Five formations and thirteen members are established. The oldest sediments are volcanic-rich proximal turbidites (Cornwallis Formation, upper Po, lower Miocene) that overlie and interfinger with the more distal flysch of the Waitemata Group to the east. Cornwallis Formation, and many of the overlying sediments, accumulated at bathyal depths (800 &#8211; 3000 m+) on the western side of the Waitemata basin. The proximal turbidites were deposited by south-east flowing turbidity currents that passed down submarine canyons from the neritic Kaipara shelf in the north and north-west. Lenticular conglomerates (Albany Conglomerate, Helensville Conglomerate) accumulated in these canyons and distributary channels of the upper and mid fan regions. In uppermost Otaian to mid Altonian times (late lower Miocene), an apron of coarse volcaniclastic sediments (Piha Formation) spread eastwards over the Waitakere Hills area from a growing volcanic pile centred west of the present coastline. Piha Formation contains well-stratified rudites, subsidiary lenticular, cross-bedded and massive rudites, large slump deposits and peripheral submarine extrusions of and site flows, pillows and hyaloclastite. This coarse volcaniclastic belt was deposited on the neritic and upper.bathyal slopes of the volcanic pile and grades eastwards towards the centre of the basin into a fine volcaniclastic belt (Nihotupu Formation) containing well-bedded arenites and lutites, cross-bedded arenites, lenticular conglomerates, slump units and small piles of pillowed andesite. These were deposited at mid to lower bathyal depths. Substantial mid Altonian uplift in the Waitakere Hills was probably connected with eastwards advancing volcanism. The northern area around Muriwai remained marine for a time and several submarine canyons were eroded through the uplifted shelf and filled with pyroclastic-rich sediments (Tirikohua Formation). An extensive, predominantly terrestrial sheet of andesite flows and pyroclastics (Lone Kauri Formation) was erupted over the uplifted central Waitakere Hills area. This sheet vras possibly erupted from the two north-north-west trending, fault-controlled lineations of volcanic necks, craters, plugs, dyke swarms and intrusions that outcrop today along either side of the hills. Volcanian, strombolian and rare pelean eruptions from these centres produced mostly andesitic products plus one dacite dome (watchman Dacite); these were the last known phases of volcanism in the area (upper Pl - ?Sc, lower to mid Miocene). Macrofaunas have been collected from seventy-six localities in the Waitakere Hills. These can be divided into undisplaced bathyal biocoenoses and displaced thanatocoenoses in which neritic and bathyal faunas were mixed during subaqueous mass flow transport. Analysis of these faunas allows recognition of ten neritic and three bathyal macrofaunal biofacies. Remains of the crustacean Callianassa are recorded. From burrow networks (Thalassinoides) developed in bathyal sediments. Sparse ichnocoenoses composed entirely of feeding and dwelling structures produced by burrowing polychaetes, echinoids and possibly sipunculids occur in basin (mid - lower bathyal) and submarine canyon (outer neritic - upper bathyal) sediments around Maori Bay. A canyon wall ichnocoenosis (outer neritic &#8211; upper bathyal), produced in semi-consolidated sediments by burrowing polychaetes, decapod crustacea and possibly amphipods and other organisms, occurs south of Maori Bay. Twelve species from nine genera of hermatypic (reef-building) corals occur in mass flow deposits. They are inferred to have come from sporadically developed communities growing on shallow-water boulder banks around volcanic islands. Comparison of the total lower Miocene hermatypic coral fauna of Northland with present day reefs indicates that seasonal sea termperatures were 5 - 7&#176;c warmer than now. Taxonomic descriptions of fossil corals, molluscs, polychaetes, benthonic foraminifera and trace fossils are given. Archesabella bartrumi gen. et sp. nov. is proposed for fossil tubes containing the body casts of sabellid-like worms. The hermatypic coral genus Goniastrea, trace fossil genus Rhizocorallium, and molluscan subgenera Dentalium (Gadilina), Solariella (Solaricida) and Turbo (Marmarostoma), are recorded from New Zealand for the first time. A new subgenus and species of the gastropod Monilea and new species of the gastropod genera Conacmea, Notoacmea (Parvacmea), Tecticrater, solariella (Solaricida), Turbo (Marmarostoma), Agathirses, "Bartrumella" and Vaqinella are described. A new genus and species of nuculanid bivalve, and new species of the mollusca Nucula, Saccella, Dentalium (Gadilina), Turbo (Marmarostoma), Agathirses, Argobuccinum (Ratifusus), Uttleya and Concholepas are but not named. The New Zealand species of the pteropod Vaginella are redescribed and figured, and the ontogeny of the oyster Crenostrea, discussed. The foraminiferal genus Sherbornina is recorded from New Zealand for the first time, together with thirty-nine overseas species. A further seventeen unnamed foraminiferal species are described. Planktonic foraminifera allow division of the Manukau Subgroup into three biostratigraphic units: upper otaian, lower altonian and mid Altonian. Three-fold subdivision of Scott's Altonian is shown to be possible in northern New Zealand. The lower - middle Altonian boundary is based on the Globorotalia (T.) zealandica zealandica datum, supported by both the temporary absence of Globoguadrina dehiscens and the measurements on the rate of chamber expansion in Globigerinoides t. trilobus populations. The middle &#8211; upper Altonian boundary is taken as the Globorotalia (G.) miozea miozea datum, supported by both the reappearance of G. dehiscens and the rate of chamber expansion measurements. Uniformitarian and computer approaches allow the thirty-one richest benthonic foraminiferal samples to be grouped into eight neritic and bathyal thanatotopes. Separate analysis of each thanatotope enables approximate depth limits to be placed on each and gives basin depths of 1500 - 3000 m+. Multidimensional scaling technique using Edwards Great Circle distances was found to be the most useful computer method in clustering the samples. Formations of the Waipoua Subgroup are summarised, and the paleogeography and eruptive history of the Waitakere Group is inferred.</field><field name="date">1975</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::269900 Other Earth Sciences::269901 Physical geography</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2597</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Polarographic studies in the anthraquinone series</field><field name="creator">Sprott, Thomas James</field><field name="description">Polarographic chemical analysis, although invented only twenty-five years ago, has already become a standard method ror the research worker and industrial analyst alike.

With this growth in fundamental knowledge the interpretation and use of the physical properties of complex compounds has become possible.

Its interest to this Departmen arose from its abundant, occurrence in Coprosma species, most of which are native to New Zealand. Since the aglycone of asperuloside is now known to possess the carbon skeleton (1) , asperuloside may be formally regarded as monoterpenoid. This Introduction therefore considers the structures, interrelationships, and biogenesis of cyclopentanoid monoterpenoids possessing the 1,2-dimethyl-3-isopropylcyc clopentane carbon skeleton (1). Cyclopentanoid Monoterpenoids: Although acyclic and cyclohexanoid monoterpenoids have been characterised for nearly eight years, naturally occurring compounds possessing the carbon skeleton (1) have been defined relatively recently. Despite their frequently unusual chemical behaviour and physiological actions, which have often been recorded in the early literature, progress in the elucidation of their structures has awaited the application of modern physical techniques. The carbon skeletons are frequently highly oxygenated, and the characteristic chemistry of the compounds arises from the interactions of contiguous functional groups. Since the chemistry of the type compounds, nepetalactone (2), iridomyrmecin (3), and iridodial (4) has been reviewed, only more recent work will be discusse below.</field><field name="date">1963</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2591</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Time variations in cosmic ray extensive air showers.</field><field name="creator">Storey, John Richard</field><field name="description">Two motives are responsible for the investigation of cosmic rays.

A particular study is made of the hydromagnetic wave theory and of the probability of these waves being produced by gyrating charged particles in the magnetosphere. The conditions are discussed under which gyration-induced hydromagnetic waves have frequencies within the micropulsation range. Assuming the production of Alfv&#233;n waves by some process in the magnetosphere, a layer model is developed to investigate the transmission of these waves down along the Earth&#8217;s magnetic field lines to the ionosphere. One feature of this model is a realistic ionospheric termination, in which a phase shift and amplitude reduction may be introduced into back reflected waves. Calculations using the model indicate a definite harmonic structure associated with micropulsations and only a small variation of frequency with geomagnetic latitude; they also provide a good explanation of the frequency structure and diurnal variation of &#8216;pearls&#8217;.</field><field name="date">1965</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260200 Geophysics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2592</field></doc><doc><field name="title">X-ray structural investigations of bromo-oxoditerpenoids and the nickel (II) chelate of a pyridoxal-amino acid intermediate</field><field name="creator">Cutfield, John Franklin</field><field name="description">The crystal structure of bis-(pyridoxylidene-L-valine)nickel(II) hydrate (referred to as nickel(II) pyridoxylidene L-valine) has been determined but the difficulty in detecting small deviations from body-centred symmetry, and in locating all solvent molecules, has precluded an accurate analysis.

Whale and others at the Seagrove Radio Research Station (now the Radio Research Centre, University of Auckland), to the examination of some of the problems involved in HF radio propagation. Among these were the evaluation of the effects of large-scale ionospheric tilts, the scattering which occurs at the earth and ionosphere, and the measurement and prediction of incoming bearing and elevation angles of signals from distant stations. In the latter stages of this work it became obvious that little was known about effects occurring at antipodal distances, so attempts were made to examine these and to postulate a propagation model consistent with the effects observed. The results presented in this thesis are a logical extension of this early work, and comprise investigations in three main areas: (1) The shape and size of the antipodal focussing area, (2) The development of a more general and less idealised propagation model, (3) The shape of the incoming angular power spectrum at antipodal distances. A summary of the theory and experimental results contained in chapters 4, 5, 6 and 7 has been published (Bold, 1969), and that contained in chapters 8 and 9 will be submitted for publication shortly.</field><field name="date">1970</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291700 Communications Technologies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2595</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Xray diffraction Study of a diterpene</field><field name="creator">Anderson, Bryan Frederick</field><field name="description">The diterpene hydrocarbon rimuene has exercised over the years, the interest of a number of laboratories engaged in natural product research. As is usual with this class of compound its occurrence is confined almost entirely to the native New Zealand flora and although only two types of tree have been used as sources, it has been identified, often only in small amounts, in at least ten different species. Its co-occurrence with other diterpenes of similar chemical and physical properties has often made it hard to isolate and this, together with its geographic distribution has probably tended to limit its availability for research purposes, and hence delayed the elucidation of its structure. The awareness of the existence of this compound of undetermined structure has, therefore, caused a noticable gap in the knowledge of the diterpenoids, and this hiatus has been accentuated by Wenkert who, believing it to have a pimarane skeleton, suggested that it might be the important biogenetic precursor of a number of tetracyclic diterpenoids. Recent work, confirmed by the present investigation has, however, shown that previous structural predictions were incorrect and in actual fact rimuene has a rosane skeleton. As Ruzicka has shown for this class of compound, it has probably been formed from a pimarane diterpenoid and therefore represents a later biogenetic step than the other diterpene hydrocarbons which are always found with it in nature.</field><field name="date">1967</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2593</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The crystal structures of the bromo and chloro derivatives of picrotoxinin / Bryan Maxwell Craven</field><field name="creator">Craven, Bryan Maxwell</field><field name="description">Picrotoxin is the bitter tasting convulsive poison, obtained from the cocculus berries, the fruit of  the East Indian creepers, Menispermum cocculus and Anamirta paniculata.

From this analysis 20 taxa are recognised as constituting the New Zealand Monotis fauna, with the future possible addition of two further taxa. M. richmondiana Zittel, claimed by some overseas workers as a junior synonym of M. ochotica (Keyserling), is established as validly separable and is seen to include Trechmann's (1918) Pseudomonotis ochotica var. acutecostata as a subspecies. The presence of the New Caledonian M. routhieri and M. ochotica gigantea (Avias, 1953) is confirmed and the latter is transferred to M. subcircularis Gabb. Monotis salinaria var. hemispherica and var. intermedia (of Trechmann, 1918) are reinstated as valid taxa and given full specific rank. M. calvata Marwick (1953) is retained as a full species. In addition, the following species and subspecies are proposed: awakinoensis, kiritehereensis, maniapotoi, marwicki, murihikuensis, murihikuensis taringatura, pinensis aotearoa, rauparaha, rauparaha aries, rauparaha mokaui, subcircularis discordans, wairakae, and warepana. Only Pseudomonotis richmondiana var. truncata Frech (1908) amongst names previously proposed for New Zealand Monotis is rejected as a nomen dubium; it is probably synonymous with M. richmondiana acutecostata (Trechmann). The species-group concept of Westermann (1973b) is formalised by the proposal of five subgeneric divisions to accommodate the 55 definite and up to 5 possible taxa included in the genus. The subgenera Monotis, Entomonotis Marwick (type: M. richmondiana), Eomonotis n.subgen. (type: Pseudomonotis scutiformis var. typica Kiparisova), Inflatomonotis n.subgen. (type: Monotis salinaria var. hemispherica Trechmann), and Maorimonotis n.subgen. (type: Monotis routhieri) are differentiated on the basis of adult size, prominence and sculpture of the posterior auricle, the degree to which it is separated from the disc, shell inflation, radial ribbing and shell thickness. Eomonotis is the oldest subgenus and the stem-stock for the others; it probably evolved from Otapiria. It is unclear from morphologic evidence whether Monotis (s.s.) and Entomonotis developed one from the other or both from Eomonotis independently. Maorimonotis is confidently believed to have sprung from an Entomonotis similar to M. pachypleura (Teller) and Inflatomonotis is most likely to have evolved from an Eomonotis with strongly inflated left valve (e.g. M. jakutica (Teller) or M. iwaiensis Ichikawa). Eomonotis and Entomonotis are geographically the most widespread, the former being absent only from the Andean area of Monotis distribution and Entomonotis not having been recorded in the western or central Tethys. Monotis (s.s.) is common only in the western Tethys. Inflatomonotis and Maorimonotis are confined to New Zealand-New Caledonia except for one record of the former in British Columbia. In many regions the stratigraphic sequence of Monotis is too inadequately known for evolutionary sequences to be deduced but some examples of chronologic and geographic subspeciation are pinpointed. The only clearly defined lineage is that within Maorimonotis from maniapotoi through awakinoensis and routhieri to calvata. The genus can be seen to have a high taxonomic diversity and rapid rate of evolution. Apart from three questionable lower Triassic and lower Jurassic species, Monotis is confined to the Norian Stage, and possibly to the Columbianus and Suessi Zones of the mid and upper Norian. Monotis is postulated as having been epibyssate throughout life and normally epiplanktonic on drifting or floating marine vegetation, with coexisting taxa occupying different microenvironments on different parts of the plants. A serious objection to this mode of life is the massive algal production necessary to provide a substrate for the tremendous numbers of individuals involved in Monotis shellbeds. Reduction of the byssal ear in Maorimonotis is seen as a significant event and coupled with the trend to an equivalved condition is interpreted as indicating change to an endobyssate benthic existence for M. routhieri and calvata; this adequately explains the restricted distribution of this subgenus. Detailed stratigraphic analysis of Monotis in Murihiku sequences necessitates rejection of the Rocky Dome section as stratotype for the Warepan Stage on the grounds that although M. richmondiana has been cited as the marker fossil for the stage, past usage has clearly equated the base of the stage with the incoming of the genus, and richmondiana is not the oldest member of the genus to be found in Murihiku sections. Earlier members are absent from the stratotype which therefore must be relocated in order to retain the stage in its accepted scope. The Kiritehere coastal section suffers the disadvantage of penecontemporaneous submarine slumping, but is proposed as stratotype for a new Marakopan Stage because it is the thickest, best exposed, clearest and best known sequence of Monotis beds and adjacent strata in New Zealand. Within this stage a sequence of five formal and three informal chronozones is defined. The lower Marakopan Mokaui and Murihikuensis Chronozones can be grouped together as an Eomonotis chronozone when faunas are too poor for better correlation, and similarly the overlying Acutecostata, Richmondiana and Calvata Chronozones can be grouped as an Entomonotis chronozone. In addition a topmost Marakopan chronozone can be recognised from the absence of Monotis and basal Otapirian indicators and the presence of a fauna which at present seems common to the two stages. Monotis is the most common fossil in the Torlesse Super-group and the lower four Chronozones, and probably also the Calvata Chronozone, are all represented. Most forms present in Murihiku rocks are also present in Torlesse, but two common Torlesse forms are unknown in Murihiku sequences and this is believed to indicate both communication and barriers between the two regions in Marakopan times. Monotis-bearing Torlesse lithologies are more varied than Murihiku and indicate different depositional regimes. Whilst Murihiku Marakopan strata are all of normal clastic lithologies and show a southwards increase in grain-size, the Torlesse picture is more complex. Firstly, an increasingly deeper and offshore situation is suggested by some deposits with Murihiku faunas: inner or middle neritic origin for Monotis-bearing clasts in a (?) late Jurassic conglomerate at Morrinsville which possibly accumulated in the outer neritic zone or slightly deeper, outer neritic for in situ strata near Aria, slightly further offshore accumulation for ? middle Jurassic m&#233;lange in the Oroua Valley and Marakopan slump deposits in the Otaki Gorge, and bathyal or even abyssal deposition for argillites with scattered Monotis in the Mt Arthur-Bealey area. The Aria Monotis beds lie west of the Waipa Fault, yet fit best into Kear's (1967, 1971) Morrinsville Facies, and indicate that the Hakarimata Anticline, Waipa Fault and the facies relations postulated by Kear date from the mid-Jurassic and that there was no feature like the modern continental edge and slope during upper Triassic times in the region. Close paleogeographic relations between these areas and the Murihiku region in Marakopan times is indicated and is not disproven by any sedimentologic evidence yet known. One lithologic association not represented in and showing distinct geographic separation from the Murihiku area is the shell limestone-submarine lava-chert association, which is that containing Monotis species endemic to the Torlesse.

The reaction of DFO with fingermarks has been widely studied phenomenologically, but there are few studies focusing on the chemistry of the reaction. Since the accepted mechanism for the reaction of DFO with amino acids shows that DFO reacts in a 2: 1 stoichiometry with primary amino acids, linking two DFO moieties into one molecule could provide the following advantages: First, the two DFO moieties are maintained in close proximity thus increasing the chance that both can react with a single amino acid. Second, fluorescence is dependent on the overall flexibility of the molecule, so a bridged DFO dimer could lead to a more rigid product exhibiting greater fluorescence. Finally, a cyclic product should be less susceptible to hydrolysis. The synthetic route taken to synthesise DFO dimers involved five steps. The first step, synthesis of the mono-N-oxide of DFO, proceeded cleanly and in good yields. The second step involved the introduction of a halogen (chlorine and bromine) at the 2-position of the N-oxide. The 2-chloro DFO was prepared cleanly and in good yields from the N-oxide, while the 2-bromo derivative was prepared from the 2-chloro derivative via 2-amino DFO. After protection of the carbonyl functional group (using acetals) the 2-halo DFO intermediates were reacted with selected diols in basic conditions to form bridged dimers. The final step involved deprotection of the acetal to give the carbonyl functional group. Four bridged DFO dimers were synthesised. Crystal structures supporting two of these compounds were obtained, while most of the intermediate compounds in the synthetic route were characterised by NMR and mass spectrometry. Reaction of alanine with the dimer synthesised with a 2,2'-dimethyl-propane-1,3-diol bridge leads to a colour change similar to that seen with DFO. This suggests that the bridged analogues do react with amino acids and can therefore potentially be used as alternatives to DFO. Characterisation of the product with L-alanine was difficult as mass spectrometry indicated that it was polymeric. Attempted reactions at low concentrations of both the dimer and the amino acid did not lead to the formation of the desired cyclic product and in most instances, no reaction occurred. Attempts at metal ion templating also were unsuccessful, possibly since metal ions can catalyse hydrolysis of the product and intermediates during the reaction with amino acids. The products obtained from the reaction of L-alanine with a series of 2-substituted monomeric DFO compounds had similar absorbance and fluorescence spectra to the unsubstituted product, although they showed decreased fluorescence intensity in solution. Studies on porous substrates also indicated that none of the derivatives showed higher fluorescence than DFO upon reaction with fingermarks. However, the halo- derivatives appeared less susceptible to hydrolysis. The imine of DFO is stable in ethanol: acetic acid and reacts about 10 times more rapidly with L-alanine than does DFO at 60 oC and 78 oC, suggesting that the imine might allow development of fingermarks at lower temperature than required for DFO. However, when a fingermark on paper was treated with DFO and DFO imine, the DFO imine treated fingermark did not show significantly more colour or fluorescence than that with DFO treatment.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2610</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analogues of Natural Product-like Scaffolds: Synthesis of Spiroacetal Derivatives</field><field name="creator">Choi, Ka Wai</field><field name="description">Diversity-oriented synthesis (DOS) involves the synthesis of several synthetic targets by transforming a collection of structurally simple and similar starting materials into a collection of structurally more complex and diverse products.

This thesis describes the development of three separate techniques that perform measurements in either the time domain, frequency domain or the phase space of the optical signal. The first section investigates phase-sensitive pulse measurement techniques. A high- resolution SHG-FROG apparatus was custom-designed to measure 40GHz RZ pulse trains, from which an operational characterisation of a Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM) was realised. A numerical model of a nonlinear pulse compressor was developed to compress 40GHz RZ pulses from 8.5ps down to 3.4ps. These pulses were time-division multiplexed to 80GHz, and phase-retrievals of the 80GHz pulse trains were measured. A comparison between the techniques of SHG-FROG and linear spectrogram has been undertaken for 10GHz pulse sources, exposing SHG-FROG's weaknesses at this particular repetition rate. The second section investigates a simple, time-averaged, nonlinear detection technique. Two-photon absorption in a GaAs/InGaAs quantum-well laser diode was used to measure the duty cycle (and by extension, the pulse duration) of a range of pulse sources. This technique was further developed to measure the extinction ratio of NRZ pulse trains. Additionally, the pulse duration of a mode-locked laser source was measured using the nonlinear absorption in a 1-m length of As2Se3 Chalcogenide glass fiber. This demonstrates that the nonlinear properties of this glass may well find application in future instrumentation. The third section investigates the development of an ultra-high resolution swept heterodyne spectrometer. This spectrometer was used to spectrally-distinguish repetitive 8-bit NRZ patterns at 2.5Gbit/s. It was also used to measure the chirp parameter of an X-cut LiNbO3 MZM, revealing a chirp parameter of &#945;&#960;/2 &lt; 0.1 across a modulation band- width of 250-2500MHz. Additionally, the distinctive CW spectrum of a DFB laser diode was measured. Analysis of the measured CW spectrum yielded a linewidth enhancement factor of &#945;&#8771; 1.8 and also the relative intensity noise of the DFB laser diode.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Optical Performance Monitoring</field><field name="subject">FROG</field><field name="subject">Linear Spectrogram</field><field name="subject">Two-Photon Absorption</field><field name="subject">Chalcogenide Glass</field><field name="subject">Heterodyne Spectrometer</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2860</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Applications of UV-visible spectral imaging in forensic science</field><field name="creator">Wagner, John Harry</field><field name="description">This study investigated the use of UV-visible spectral imaging for the location and enhancement of substances of forensic interest using targeted approaches based on the spectrum of the substance. Spectral enhancement procedures were developed for blood with and without chemical enhancement, and for latent fingermarks after chemical enhancement. Focus was on substances whose spectrum exhibited a steep change in absorbance or fluorescence over a small wavelength range. Substances with such spectral features were able to be enhanced using arithmetic combinations of two or three spectral images taken at wavelengths near the steep spectral feature. Some enhancement reagents do not react to produce a product with a steep spectral feature suitable for photographic enhancement. In such cases reagents that compliment spectral imaging can be developed. A tridentate ligand for iron(II), BBIDMAPP, which forms a complex with a narrow intense charge-transfer band, was synthesised and was used to visualise muddy shoemarks. UV-visible spectral imaging systems based on a liquid crystal filter or a filter wheel were constructed to facilitate the acquisition of the spectral images and to perform the enhancement operations. A thorough characterisation of the imaging systems determined their limitations and sources of artefacts which could lead to complications in interpreting the enhanced images. The spectral imaging procedure used to visualise blood was incorporated into a near-real-time, hand-held imaging system for the location of blood staining. This prototype imaging system is capable of acquiring two spectral images simultaneously, perform the enhancement procedure, and display the enhanced image within 5 s, which would make it suitable as a non-chemical presumptive screening test for blood at crime scenes.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Forensic</field><field name="subject">Spectral imaging</field><field name="subject">Blood enhancement</field><field name="subject">fingermarks</field><field name="subject">shoemarks</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2629</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding linear algebra concepts through the embodied, symbolic and formal worlds of mathematical thinking</field><field name="creator">Stewart, Sepideh</field><field name="description">Linear algebra is one of the first advanced mathematics courses that students encounter at university level. The transfer from a primarily procedural or algorithmic school approach to an abstract and formal presentation of concepts through concrete definitions, seems to be creating difficulty for many students who are barely coping with procedural aspects of the subject. This research proposes applying APOS theory, in conjunction with Tall&#8217;s three worlds of embodied, symbolic and formal mathematics, to create a framework in order to examine the learning of a variety of linear algebra concepts by groups of first and second year university students. The aim is to investigate the difficulties in understanding some linear algebra concepts and to propose potential paths for preventing them. As part of this research project several case studies were conducted where groups of first and second year students were exposed to teaching and learning some introductory linear algebra concepts based on the framework and expressed their thinking through their involvements in tests, interviews and concept maps. The results suggest that the students had limited understanding of the concepts, they struggled to recognise the concepts in different registers, and their lack of ability in linking the major concepts became apparent. However, they also revealed that those with more representational diversity had more overall understanding of the concepts. In particular the embodied introduction of the concept proved a valuable adjunct to their thinking. Since difficulties with learning linear algebra by average students are universally acknowledged, it is anticipated that this study may provide suggestions with the potential for widespread positive consequences for learning.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::230100 Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2912</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Study of the Dicke model: from phase space approach to quantum trajectories</field><field name="creator">de Oliveira, Felipe Dimer</field><field name="description">In this thesis we study the Dicke model outside the rotating wave approximation (RWA), by employing phase space techniques and the quantum trajectory theory.

In New Zealand about 70% of the original forest cover has been destroyed since human settlement, converting them to a rare and threatened resource. Part of the problem is because native forests are often immersed in a landscape where other land uses are competing for the same space. Effective conservation management of these indigenous forest remnants requires information about their vulnerability to threats, in space and time. Few studies provide an integrated assessment of the extent to which socio- economic effects are responsible for native vegetation vulnerability and how these relationships change through time. In this study socio-economic drivers at different scales are related to land cover changes. To analyse vulnerability of indigenous forests a temporal dataset was developed from aerial photography for the years 1942, 1961, 1984, and satellite images for the years 1999 and 2006. They were managed within a GIS, recording the extent and distribution of these forests and other principal land covers in a study area of ca. 80,000 ha in the Northland region. Information about incentives to land production and to conservation was compared to changes of composition, configuration and conversion of land cover. Spatial conditioners of change, such as elevation, land use capability and land legal protection, were also assessed as possible constrainers of indigenous forest loss. Results showed that the incentives to land production had changed their significance for vulnerability of indigenous forests through time. These became conditioned by other land covers and incentives to conservation, and besides, indigenous forest was a quite stable cover where the physical characteristics of their location were unsuitable for land production. I concluded that at scale of decades, changes in area of indigenous forest were reversible; non- linear; driven by political, institutional and economic changes but that, biophysical characteristics of the landscape can preclude conversion. Such conclusions may help to set priorities for the long term protection and management of indigenous forests.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300600 Forestry Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3370</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stochastic modelling of rat invasions among islands in the New Zealand archipelago</field><field name="creator">Miller, Steven Duncan</field><field name="description">This project was formulated with the purpose of advancing knowledge of the invasion dynamics of rats within archipelagos in New Zealand. The concentration on islands reflected the conservation focus of this project - islands are the last refuges for many native New Zealand species that cannot survive in the wild on the mainland. This project can be divided into four areas: 1. Data collection: There was no intent for innovation here, but a deeper understanding of the environments in which rats are born, breed, migrate, and die was developed. 2. Development of tools for data exploration: &#8226; A user-friendly point-and-click graphical interface for the R program was designed to allow any user to easily explore simple genetic characteristics of the data. &#8226; A novel method for exploring the genetic similarity between individuals was developed and showcased with real data, proving successful in cases of both high and low genetic differentiation, and in detecting likely individual migrants. 3. Improvement of a method for estimating migration: &#8226; An attempt was made to improve the Markov chain Monte Carlo procedure underlying this method. &#8226; The migration model used by the method was significantly improved, so that it could cope with any level of migration. Previously, results from situations where migration rates were high were invalid. 4. Investigated topics of ecological interest: &#8226; Field measurements of rats were used to show that Norway rats tend to have larger masses than ship rats, southern rats are generally larger than northern rats, but the effect on mass of living on an island as opposed to the mainland depends on the latitude. It was also shown that relative tail length is a good species discriminator. &#8226; Multiple paternity was confirmed for both Norway and ship rats. This breeding characteristic might form part of the explanation for why rats are such successful invaders. During the project, case studies involving rats on Big South Cape Island, Great Barrier Island and in the Bay of Islands were used to highlight the methods developed, and provided some unexpected and fascinating results.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rattus spp.</field><field name="subject">Island ecology</field><field name="subject">Population genetics</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::230200 Statistics</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3375</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis of mannosylated peptides as components for synthetic vaccines</field><field name="creator">Kowalczyk, Renata</field><field name="description">The immune system often recognises tumour cells and infectious agents from the unique peptides found on their surfaces therefore, synthetic peptides of similar structure can be used as vaccines to stimulate the immune system. Despite the problems associated with proteolysis and delivery to the immune system,  peptide-based vaccines have enormous potential due to their ease of synthesis and purification. The aim of this research was to synthesise ligands for mannose receptors (MRs) that are found on human Antigen Presenting Cells (APCs), for use in synthetic vaccines. Carbohydrate bearing antigens are recognised by MRs which play an important role in binding antigens, migration of dendritic cells (DCs) and interaction of DCs with lymphocytes.  Hence, incorporation of a sugar residue into a peptide chain can be used to enhance antigen presentation. This thesis describes the synthesis of fluorescein labelled O-mannosylated peptides using either manual or microwave assisted solid phase glycopeptide synthesis (SPGS) on pre-loaded WANG resin. The mannosylated peptides thus prepared can be tested for their ability to bind mannose receptors on human APCs in vitro. In order to prepare compounds that could be analysed in biological screens, a fluorescent label (5(6)-carboxyfluorescein) was introduced into the glycopeptides via the N&#945;- or the N&#949;-amino group of the lysine residue. It was found that preparation of the glycopeptide was more facile when the peptide chain was built onto the N&#949; of Lys (label into N&#945;) rather than onto the N&#945; of Lys (label into N&#949;). In order to overcome problems experienced when introducing more than one glycosylated building block into the peptide chain, a polyethylene glycol (PEG) linker was employed as a sugar carrier. It was found that mono- and dimannosylated building blocks attached to PEG carrier were incorporated more easily into the peptide chain compared to mono- and dimannosylated serine units. Importantly, microwave technology (CEM Liberty microwave peptide synthesiser) was used for SPGS which resulted in improved purity and yields of the glycopeptides thus prepared with a significant reduction in reaction times. The first fifteen glycopeptides prepared  in the present study were tested for binding to mannose receptors. Several compounds have shown improved binding to monocytes (bear MRs) in comparison to lymphocytes (do not bear MRs), in the presence of calcium ions. Calcium dependent binding is specific for C type lectin receptor family  that MRs belong to. Five remaining glycopeptides are currently undergoing biological evaluation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">glycopeptides</field><field name="subject">solid phase peptide synthesis</field><field name="subject">glycosylation</field><field name="subject">mannose</field><field name="subject">peptide vaccines</field><field name="subject">microwave</field><field name="subject">mannose receptor</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences::250300 Organic Chemistry::250301 Organic chemical synthesis</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences::250300 Organic Chemistry::250302 Biological and medical chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3341</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Water wave scattering by floating elastic plates with application to sea-ice</field><field name="creator">Kohout, Alison L.</field><field name="description">This thesis considers the scattering of small amplitude water waves, obliquely incident on a set of floating elastic plates occupying the entire water surface. The problem is twodimensional and assumes invariance in the width of the plates. All non-linear physical effects are neglected. The plates are floating on a body of water of finite depth and each plate has uniquely defined properties. The problem is formulated by imposing boundary conditions on the eigenfunction expansion of Laplace&#8217;s equation. A set of transmission and reflection coefficients is generated, which is solved by applying the edge conditions and matching at each plate boundary. We label this solution method the Matched Eigenfunction Expansion Method (MEEM). The problem is solved for a variety of edge conditions including free, clamped, sliding, springed and hinged. To verify the MEEM results, the problem is also solved using a Green Function Method. The convergence of the two methods is compared and found to be almost identical. The MEEM is used to simulate wave&#8211;ice interaction in the Marginal Ice Zone (MIZ). The model removes the resonance effects and predicts that the transmitted energy is independent of floe length, provided the wavelength is more than three times the floe length. The model predicts an exponential decay of wave energy with distance of propagation through the MIZ, which agrees with experimental findings. The results have been summarised in a graph with the attenuation coefficient expressed as a function of period for various floe thicknesses. We also provide an estimate of the attenuation coefficient using an approximation theory. The displacements of the MEEM are compared against a series of laboratory experiments performed in a two-dimensional wave-tank and show good agreement. The attenuation model results are compared against a series of field experiments carried out in the Arctic and off the West Antarctic Peninsula. Generally, the decay rates of the model agree well with the field experiments in diffuse ice. We suggest that factors other than wave scatter are relevant in models of wave-attenuation in non-diffuse ice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3374</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the GH/IGF axis in the infant rat brain following hypoxic ischemic injury</field><field name="creator">Scheepens, Arjan</field><field name="description">Brain injuries, be they hypoxic, ischemic, traumatic or neurodegenerative result in permanent neurological deficit and presently there are few or no therapeutic interventions available. Recent research into how and why brain cells die after an insult has elucidated that a significant number of cells die in an apoptotic manner. Following a transient brain injury cells continue to die for upto 5 days after the insult thereby giving a window of opportunity for treatment. In response to injury, the brain produces a range of neurotrophic hormones including insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-I), which are thought to act as endogenous neuroprotective agents. This response occurs earlier and to a greater extent in the young. Studies have shown that the exogenous administration of these neurotrophic hormones after brain injury can prevent some cell death, likely through an inhibition of apoptosis. In these studies a well characterised model of HI brain injury in the juvenile rat was used to investigate the response of the IGF-I and growth hormone (GH) axes to brain injury. The action and transport of IGF-I is partly regulated by six binding proteins (IGFBP1-6) for which the response of IGFBP 1-5 to neural injury has been shown. The starting point therefore is a description of the response of IGFBP-6 to HI brain injury. Although the GH receptor is widely expressed in the brain on both neurones and glia, no reports have definitively shown the existence of its ligand, GH within the brain. Here I show that the GH receptor is differentially regulated after neural injury and that its immunolocalisation suggests an importation mechanisms for peripheral GH into the injured CNS, via the choroid plexus. Furthermore I show that a GH-like substance is strongly upregulated after injury, specifically associated with stressed and dying neurones and glia. Subsequently, I show that intracerebral infusions of rat GH into the injured rat brain conveys significant protection exclusively to GH receptor bearing neurones. In summary, these data show a GH-like substance may be acting as a new neurotrophic factor which is upregulated after brain injury and may act as an endogenous neuroprotective agent.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3200</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Natural products from New Zealand Latrunculia species sponges</field><field name="creator">Grkovic, Tanja</field><field name="description">In a survey of the secondary metabolite chemistry profiles of ten New Zealand, one Antarctic and one South African-sourced collections of Latrunculia spp. sponges, eighteen discorhabdin alkaloids have been isolated. Four of those, namely discorhabdin K, 3-dihydro discorhabdin A, 1-thiomethyl discorhabdin G*/I, and 16a,17a-dehydro discorhabdin W were fully characterized as new natural products in the series. In addition, for the first time, five enantiomeric pairs and two sets of diastereomers of the naturallyoccurring discorhabdin alkaloids were identified. The absolute configuration of all of the chiral compounds isolated, including new natural products, has been established upon comparison of the observed experimental data with the results of time dependant density functional theory calculations of the electronic circular dichroism spectra. A structure activity relationship study on discorhabdin B, the main natural product of the Wellington-sourced sponges, has identified four reactive centres on the molecule and yielded nine novel semi-synthetic derivatives. Consequently, a new discorhabdin biosynthetic tree was proposed which highlighted discorhabdin B as a crucial precursor to a number of other naturally-occurring analogues. The importance of the iminoquinone moiety and the spirodienone ring with respect to the bioactivity of the compounds in a range of naturally-occurring discorhabdins was demonstrated. A new semi-synthetic derivative, 1-discorhabdyl discorhabdin D, was identified as a potent anti-malarial agent and has opened new possibilities for the therapeutic development of the discorhabdin alkaloids.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3376</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Significance testing in automatic interaction detection (A.I.D.)</field><field name="creator">Worsley, Keith John</field><field name="description">Automatic Interaction Detection (A.I.D.) is the name of a computer program, first used in the social sciences, to find the interaction between a set of predictor variables and a single dependent variable. The program proceeds in stages, and at each stage the categories of a predictor variable induce a split of the dependent variable into two groups, so that the between groups sum of squares ( BSS ) is a maximum. In this way, the optimum split defines the interaction between predictor and dependent variable, and the criterion BSS is taken as a measure of the explanatory power of the split. One of the strengths of A.I.D. is that this interaction is established without any reference to a specific model, and for this reason it is widely used in practice. However this strength is also its weakness; with no model there is no measure of its significance. Barnard (1974) has said: &#8220;&#8230; nowadays with more and more apparently sophisticated computer programs for social science, failure to take account of possible sampling fluctuations is leading to a glut of unsound analyses &#8230; I have in mind procedures such as A.I.D., the automatic interaction detector, which guarantees to get significance out of any data whatsoever. Methods of this kind require validation &#8230;&#8221; The aim of this thesis is to supply Part of that validation by investigating the null distribution of the optimum BSS for a single predictor at a single stage of A.I.D., so that the significance of any particular split can be judged. The problem of the overall significance of a complete A.I.D. analysis, combining many stages, still remains to be solved. In Chapter 1 the A.I.D. method is described in more detail and an example is presented to illustrate its use. A null hypothesis that the dependent variable observations have independent and identical normal distributions is proposed as a model for no interaction. In Chapters 2 and 3 the null distributions of the optimum BSS for a single predictor are derived and tables of percentage points are given. In Chapter 4 the normal assumption is dropped and non-parametric A.I.D. criteria, based on ranks, are proposed. Tables of percentage points, found by direct enumeration and by Monte Carlo methods, are given. In Chapter 5 the example presented in Chapter 1 is used to illustrate the application of the theory and tables in Chapters 2, 3 and 4 and some final conclusions are drawn.</field><field name="date">1978</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::230100 Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3311</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mesozoic geology of the Matawai district, Raukumara Peninsula</field><field name="creator">Isaac, Michael J.</field><field name="description">At Matawai, Raukumara Peninsula a high angle unconformity separates Cretaceous conglomerates, sandstones and siltstones from the underlying Urewera Greywacke, at least a part of which is upper Jurassic. This unconformity is believed to be of considerable significance. It represents a considerable time gap, a major deformation phase, and the initiation of a new regional sedimentation cycle. Mapping and sedimentological studies enable the recognition of two major lithostratigraphic units within Cretaceous strata at Matawai. The Aptian - Coniacian MATAWAI GROUP (new name) includes the Koranga, Te Wera and Karekare Formations. It is overlain unconformably by the Maastrichtian - ?Landenian WHAREKOPAE GROUP (new name), consisting of the Tahora (revived name) and Rakauroa Formations. The low angle unconformity between the Matawai and Wharekopae Groups is believed to represent only a minor phase of deformation and renewed marine transgression. It is local, not regional, and does not mark a significant time gap. A further unconformity separates Koranga Formation shallow marine coarse clastic sediments from texturally more mature sediments of the overlying Te Wera and Karekare Formations. It too is interpreted as being of only minor significance; it marks only a short period of non-deposition and not a major change in sedimentation pattern. Six biostratigraphic zones, all based on short-ranging species of either Inoceramus or Aucellina have been mapped in Matawai Group strata. Diverse shallow water faunas of the Koranga, Te Wera and lower Karekare Formations are succeeded by upper Karekare assemblages containing few fossils other than Inoceramus. Koranga Formation sandstones are texturally and compositionally immature. Like thick-bedded Urewera sandstones, they are of very mixed provenance, being derived from acid plutonic - high grade metamorphic, sedimentary and volcanic sources. Thus although the oldest Matawai Group strata are stratigraphically discrete from the Urewera Greywacke, they were derived largely from similar sources. Petrographic study of sandstones and X-ray study of siltstones suggest Karekare Formation sediments were derived largely from underlying Urewera and Matawai strata. Reworking of unlithified Matawai Group sediments provided much of the detritus for the glauconitic quartzose Tahora sandstone and the siliceous Rakauroa siltstones and shales. Distribution and composition of clays and feldspars in Matawai and Wharekopae rocks indicate a proportion of the sediment was derived from a granitic source to the south or southeast. Although zeolites and authigenic epidote are common in Urewera rocks at Matawai, extensive zeolitisation is virtually restricted to the sandstones and conglomerates overlying the Urewera Greywacke - Matawai Group unconformity. Development of zeolites is not, therefore, wholly a function of depth of burial. Volcanogenic Urewera and Koranga sandstones are both suitable hosts for zeolite formation, and restriction of extensive zeolitisation to the latter indicates the importance of permeability in controlling zeolite distribution. The relatively permeable Koranga Formation was a paleoaquifer because of its stratigraphic position between relatively impermeable Urewera and Karekare strata. From consideration of regional facies patterns, Wharekopae strata at Matawai and their coal measure and marginal marine equivalents in the South Island are believed to be the compositionally mature end products of a sedimentation cycle initiated in Aptian (Korangan) time. Matawai Group strata are considered to post-data the major deformation pulse known as the Rangitata Orogeny. Study of published and unpublished work on coeval rocks elsewhere in New Zealand suggest a fundamental and regional break between Aptian, Albian or even younger sediments, and older rocks. The Matawai Group and its coeval equivalents should, therefore, be included in the Kaikoura Sequence, and not, as has been proposed, in the underlying Rangitata Sequence.</field><field name="date">1977</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3328</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structure, metamorphism and mineral deposits in the Diahot region, northern New Caledonia</field><field name="creator">Briggs, Roger M.</field><field name="description">The area studied, covers about 150 square kilometers in the northern end of New Caledonia in the lower parts of the Diahot River near Ou&#233;goa. The rocks consist dominantly of a metamorphosed Cretaceous sedimentary-igneous sequence of carbonaceous pelites with intercalated basaltic rocks and rhyolitic tuffs. The Cretaceous sequence is flanked to the southwest by Eocene rocks consisting mainly of siliceous argillites, phtanites (massive cherts) and limestones. High-pressure metamorphism, radiometrically dated at 38-21 m.y. (Oligocene-lowermost Miocene) by Coleman (1967), increases progressively in grade towards the northeast in a continuous sequence from lawsonite-albite facies through glaucophanitic greenschists to eclogitic glaucophanitic albite-epidote amphibolites. Lowest, grade rocks occur in the southwest near the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary and the highest grade rocks are exposed along the east coast and as tectonically-emplaced blocks in fault zones around Ou&#233;goa. Regional metamorphic assemblages are defined with respect, to four zones in pelitic parents which in order of increasing metamorphic grade are:- (1) lowest grade rocks, (2) lawsonite zone, (3) transitional zone, (4) epidote zone. Metamorphic isograds are mapped for paraschist lawsonite, Na-amphibole, garnet and epidote; and for pumpellyite, Na-amphibole, lawsonite and omphacite in metabasalts. In the Cretaceous rocks the regional strike of the foliation is northwest-southeast with dips to the southwest, although small-scale steeply-plunging folds are abundant. On a regional scale the major structure is an open to isoclinal, asymmetric, reclined fold with a sinistral vergence, trending southwest, and it plunges steeply down the dip of the regional foliation. This folding occurred largely synchronously with high-pressure metamorphism. During retrogressive metamorphism, large-scale trans-current sinistral faulting occurred, striking northwest-southeast and dipping southwest. In the region north and east of Ou&#233;goa these faults characteristically occur as zones up to 2 km wide occupied by high-grade ortho- and paragneisses (glaucophanites) and serpentinites, and form a complex anastomosing network. This faulting, accompanied by broad flexuring, has removed some parts of the metamorphic sequence resulting in constrictions and broad, flexuring of the isograd patterns in certain areas of the field. Small-scale kink and chevron folding has occurred late in the tectonic history and post-date both the steeply-plunging folds and the metamorphism. Stratiform Cu-Pb-Zn mineralization with minor amounts of Au and Ag occur at five relatively major sites (Pilou, M&#233;r&#233;trice, Fern-Hill, Balade and Murat mines) and at numerous smaller localities throughout the field. The mineralization is restricted to definite stratigraphic horizons in the Cretaceous sequence where black carbonaceous phyllites are associated and interbedded with rhyolitic metatuffs. The sulphide ores are well laminated, show relict sedimentary textures, and occur as layers and lenses which are conformable with the host rocks. The deposits are thought to be sedimentary-volcanic in origin and derived from acid volcanic metalliferous exhalations which have undergone chemical precipitation and sedimentation in localized, black shale, euxinic environments on the sea floor. All of the deposits have been subjected to and variously modified by the metamorphism. An attempt is made to explain the large-scare structural features observed in the Diahot region in terms of plate tectonic theory.</field><field name="date">1975</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3331</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The structure and stereochemistry of the diterpenes and the glycoalkaloid from solanum nigrum</field><field name="creator">Davis, Brian Reeve</field><field name="description">The diterpenoids are fairly widely distributed in nature.

The sequence consists of an airfall deposit overlain in places by up to four ignimbrites erupted from the Okataina Volcanic Centre. The airfall consists, at its base, of crystal poor (&lt; 7%) pumice with a phenocryst assemblage of plagioclase, quartz, hypersthene, magnetite and ilmenite with rare zircon and apatite. Towards the top of the airfall unit crystal rich (&gt; 7%) pumice is present along with crystal poor pumice and thus forms a bimodal population. The crystal rich pumice has the same mineralogy as the crystal poor pumice plus hornblende. The pumice ranges from rhyolite to high-silica rhyolite with the rhyolite containing high TiO2, MgO, CaO, Zr and Sr and low K2O, Ba and Rb in comparison to the high silica rhyolite. The mixture of high silica rhyolite and rhyolite pumice is present throughout the remainder of the eruption with more high silica rhyolite than rhyolite erupted and with no significant change in proportions. The variation in chemistry and mineralogy indicates that the magma was compositionally zoned. Random and oscillatory zoning with evidence of resorption episodes in plagioclase and hypersthene suggest that the magma was turbulently convecting. Zoning in the magma was therefore probably characterised by fluid interfaces between fluid dynamically distinct layers. Stability relations of hornblende and pressure estimates suggest that the hornblende containing rhyolite lay above the high silica rhyolite. The variation is interpreted as having formed by rapid crystallisation and absorption of water on the margins of the intrusion. Least square calculations indicate that fractional crystallisation is a viable mechanism although diffusion through the fluid interface(s) must have occurred with redistribution of components by convection in each layer. The vent of the Matahina eruption tapped the side of the magma chamber close to the interface between the rhyolite and high silica rhyolite. Turbulence during the eruption lead to limited mixing of the zoned magma with the formation of pumice with overlapping mineral composition ranges and rare banded pumice. Indicators such as a lack of an associated veneer deposit, the multi-flow nature of the eruption sequence and strong welding suggest that the eruption was of moderate violence (for its type). Modelling of welding suggests depositional temperatures of between 650 and 700&#176;C in the Rangitaiki Valley. The presence of unexsolved titanomagnetites and osumilite support such high depositional temperatures. Almandine garnet of vapour phase origin indicates that little air was incorporated into the eruption column. Devitrification was characterised by the formation of axiolitic and spherulitic intergrowths of cristobalite and alkali feldspar. SEM observations suggest that the density of nucleating points determines the textures in the devitrifying ignimbrite. Degassing of the ignimbrite was characterised by corrosion of glass and subsequent deposition of minerals such as tridymite and alkali feldspar. Si and Zr were the least mobile elements. The Matahina eruption sequence is an example of a zoned pluton erupted early in its evolution.</field><field name="date">1984</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3345</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thermal evolution and fluid-rock interactions in the Orakeikorako- Te Kopia geothermal system, Taupo Volcanic Zone, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Bignall, Gregory, 1963-</field><field name="description">The active Orakeikorako-Te Kopia geothermal system was drilled in the mid-1960&#8217;s, down to 1405m, as part of a programme to investigate its electrical generation capability. Four wells were completed at Orakeikorako (23km NNE of Taupo) and two at Te Kopia, 9.5km further northeast. The exploration drilling provided information on the present day hydrological and thermal regime which is as hot as 265&#176;C (1137m drilled depth (-801m RL) in OK-2). Major flows into the wells occurred at depths down to 850m, although poor permeability and decline in mass output discouraged development. The waters discharged were of near neutral pH and had low salinities (highest Cl content from OK-2 &#8776;546mg/kg), low discharge enthalpies and indicated water temperatures (TSiO2 and TNaKCa) of 2l0&#176;C to 240&#176;C. A hydrologic model proposed here envisages a hot water reservoir in the OK-2 area (northeastern part of the Orakeikorako thermal area) with a lateral flow supplying water to the Red Hill (OK-4 area) in the southern part of the system and a concealed northeast flow which reaches the surface at Te Kopia. The Orakeikorako thermal area occupies a surface area of about 1.8km2, mainly on the east bank of the Waikato River, where dilute chloride-bicarbonate water discharges along faults and fractures in association with an extensive silica sinter sheet, boiling springs and geysers. The occurrence of a mordenite-smectite assemblage at shallow depths, plus the oxygen and hydrogen isotopic composition of surface discharge waters, indicate that the ascending chloride fluids are diluted by near surface (heated?) groundwaters. The &#948;D shift from local groundwater composition may be evidence for a magmatic component to the convecting hydrothermal system. Incursion of fluids from the relatively cool (&lt;l20&#176;C) steam-heated carapace into deep levels of the system and its mixing with the alkali-chloride fluids, produces argillic alteration, sealing and will eventually result in the demise of the system. Old silica sinter on the west bank, at the foot of the Tutukau Rhyolite Dome, is covered by Oruanui Ash (22,700 years B.P.) and demonstrates that the hydrologic character of this part of the system has changed due to a combination of fault movement, changes in the height of the watertable and sealing. The Te Kopia thermal area is located along 2.5km of the Paeroa Fault scarp, a major structural feature inferred to be controlling migration of deep hydrothermal fluids in the Orakeikorako-Te Kopia area. Surface activity at Te Kopia is characterised by acid alteration (including fumaroles, warm acid pools and steaming ground), although neutral pH alkali-chloride fluids discharged here within the last 3000 years and deposited silica sinter (C14 age on wood enveloped by sinter is 3026 +/- 43years B.P.). New thermal areas in the past --year have begun to develop in the northwestern part of Te Kopia, whilst cold hydrothermally altered ground (hosting a mordenite + clay assemblage) records a decline in activity in the southern part of the Te Kopia thermal area. The system is hosted by a generally SE dipping sequence of Pliocene to Quaternary ignimbrite, tuff and rhyolite lavas of the Taupo Volcanic Zone. Point counting, electron microprobe analyses of surviving primary phases (Fe, Mg, Al and Ti contents of hornblende and biotite), together with X-ray fluorescence and neutron activation analysis were used to distinguish three extensive ignimbrites encountered in the Orakeikorako-Te Kopia drillholes: (0.33Ma, sanidine-bearing) Paeroa, (0.35Ma) Te Kopia and (undated) Akatarewa Ignimbrites, despite their having been hydrothermally altered. Ignimbrite recognition is made on the basis of a combination of immobile trace and rare earth element abundances and ratios: Ta and Yb (ppm), P2O5(%) and the ratios Zr/Yb, Zr/Y, Yb/Hf, La/Lu, Nb/Hf, Zr/Nb, Zr/Lu, Yb/Ta, Ta/Lu, La/Tb and Nb/Ta. The Paeroa Ignimbrite is distinguished by is Eu anomaly ((Eu/Eu*)cn is 0.48 to 0.54), whereas the Te Kopia and Akatarewa Ignimbrites are characterised by their flatter REE Spidergrams ((Eu/Eu*)cn is ~1.0 and ~0.8 respectively). The correlation of the extensive ignimbrites was satisfactorily effected by a combination of their characteristic bulk rock and pumice chemistry, plus primary mineralogy, to enable the subsurface stratigraphy and structure of the Orakeikorako-Te Kopia geothermal system to be defined. The alteration assemblage below 500m consists of quartz, albite+adularia, with variable abundence and distribution of chlorite, pyrite, calcite, wairakite, epidote, pyrrhotite, titanite, leucoxene, siderite and clinozoisite; illite is a late overprint. Rare almandine occurs in rhyolite in OK-1: 1312.5m; this is the first known occurrence of garnet in an active geothermal system of the TVZ. The surficial alteration assemblage of kaolin, cristobalite, alunite, hematite and jarosite reflects alteration by acid sulphate-steam heated waters. The occurrence and textual relations exhibited by the hydrothermal mineral assemblage define the geochemical structure and thermal evolution of the Orakeikorako-Te Kopia system The activities of components of minerals, determined from electron microprobe analyses and composition-activity relationships (OK-2 discharge: log&#945;K+/&#945;H+=3.6, log&#945;Na+/&#945;H+=4.8) support the petrologic observation that illite is now the stable potassium phase (overprinting adularia), although a state of equilibrium between the sheet silicate and the fluids is clearly not fully reached. The Na/K ratio of the altering fluid is controlled by the albite-adularia reaction (dissolution of albite and replacement by adularia, after andesine), whilst the H2/H2S ratio is buffered by the virtually complete replacement of pyrrhotite by pyrite. The fluids are now slightly undersaturated with respect to calcite, this is shown by etched surfaces on some calcite grains. In the past the deep fluid boiled adiabatically from &gt;300&#176;C to ~250&#176;C as it ascended, resulting in the deposition of adularia, quartz and bladed calcite. The system has cooled, resulting in lower subsurface temperatures (as recorded by fluid inclusion geothermometry) suppressing boiling, and migrated northwards as a consequence of self sealing. The thermal decline and retention of CO2 in the deep alkali-chloride fluid shifted the alteration assemblage from one of albite-adularia stability to illite stability. The homogenisation (Th) temperatures of primary and secondary liquid-rich inclusions in 27 cores from different depths mostly match measured temperature profiles (e.g. OK-1 (shallow levels) and OK-2). Never-the-less, fluid inclusion data support mineral-inferred stability temperatures which indicate that parts of the Orakeikorako-Te Kopia system have cooled appreciably (e.g. OK-1, deep levels) and OK-4 (maximum Tbore=238&#176;C, maximum Th=312&#176;C; epidote abundant). In contrast, the northwestern margin (OK-6 area) has heated (OK-6:1113.4m; Tbore=261&#176;C, Th=210-221&#176;C). Some inclusions in the Te Kopia drillholes have Th values that exceed Tbore by as much as 50&#176;C, and are deduced to have been uplifted by movement on the Paeroa Fault. Freezing data indicate that the trapped fluid was dilute (~0.2 to 1.7 wt% NaCl equivalent) since most Tm values range from -0.1 to -0.5&#176;C. The outflow portion of the Orakeikorako-Te Kopia system has evolved recently, both chemically and physically. Movement on the Paeroa Fault, that uplifted pyroclastic rocks hosting a quartz-adularia-illite assemblage, combined with a lowering of the watertable has resulted in an overprinting of the neutral pH hydrothermal mineral assemblage by a kaolinite-alunite type assemblage which derives from an acid sulphate fluid. Quartz crystals found 150m above the base of the Paeroa Fault scarp host dilute (~1.5wt% NaCl equivalent) fluid inclusions with Th values that range from 180-206&#176;C (average 196&#176;C). Bladed quartz (after calcite) did not contain usable inclusions. It is deduced that the inclusions formed about 120-160m below the ground, which indicates uplift in the order of ~300m. Assuming a constant rate of uplift of 4m/ka (based on the offset of 330ka Paeroa Ignimbrite), the minimum duration of activity at Te Kopia is 75,000 years.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3360</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mathematical and numerical modelling of bacterial colony growth on high nutrient surfaces</field><field name="creator">Pipe, Leonie Zandra</field><field name="description">Traditionally, growth and morphology studies of bacteria have focused on individual cells. When microbiologists subsequently became interested in bacterial colony growth, they investigated the dynamics of its height as well as those of its diameter. The models they proposed, however, were little more than empirical. In recent decades there has been a shift in focus, as researchers became interested instead in the morphology changes that colonies undergo when exposed to stressful environments such as nutrient and moisture limitation. As a result of this shift, models of colony growth in three dimensions have remained underdeveloped and rudimentary. My first task in this thesis was to assemble a sufficiently comprehensive data set from which diameter, height and cell-number growth trends in colonies could be properly analysed. This was achieved by studying the growth of many colonies of two bacterial species, Serratia marcescens and Esherichia coli, on high-nutrient non-selective agar, over a range of incubation temperatures, over periods ranging from two hours to one week. When graphed and analysed, colony diameter and colony height growth turned out to be most economically described as power-law in time, with exponent &lt; 1. This contrasts with the claims of previous researchers, who had described both growth trends as linear, with diameter switching to a slower yet still linear growth after a certain time, and height growth ceasing altogether. From my results, I proposed a simple conceptual model, an extension of a model developed by Pirt in 1967. My hypothesis was that, in colonies growing on high-nutrient surfaces, diffusion was the dominant factor in colony growth. Ron Keam transformed my conceptual model into a mathematical one, from which I have developed one-dimensional and twodimensional numerical simulations. In all simulations to date, in both one and two dimensions, a power-law growth phase emerges as a consequence of nutrient-controlled growth, preceded by an &#8220;accelerating&#8221; phase during which colony growth overtakes diffusive processes, and succeeded by a slow transition towards growth cessation as nutrient becomes exhausted. In addition to successful demonstration of the power laws, the model in its final form yields realistic colony profiles and exhibits other features consistent with experimental results reported in the literature.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3445</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Crystallographic studies of interactions between ligands and DNA oligonucleotides</field><field name="creator">Pytel, Patrycja Dominika</field><field name="description">This thesis consists of two major chapters, each with its own introduction, experimental section and discussion. The TG4T/daunomycin and G4/daunomycin complexes described in Chapter One are two out of only five crystallographic quadruplex/ligand structures reported to date. In both structures daunomycin molecules stack onto a terminal G quartet preventing the G4 quadruplex from destacking and unwinding. The number of interacting ligand molecules depends on the quadruplex structure itself. The G4 quadruplex can accommodate four daunomycin molecules within one layer, while the TG4T tetraplex only accommodates three. In both structures daunosamine moieties form hydrogen bonds with the quadruplex but only daunosamine moieties from the TG4T/daunomycin structure make slight incursions into the quadruplex grooves.  Both structures are stabilised by &#960;-&#960; interactions, hydrogen bonds, Van der Waals contacts and electrostatic interactions. The daunomycin/TG4T complex is the first ever reported and the only structure where a ligand interacts directly with the quadruplex groove. Chapter Two describes nine crystal structures of Hoechst 33258 analogues with d(CGCAAATTTGCG)2 and d(CGCGAATTCGCG)2 oligonucleotides, and is divided into two sections. Section A includes seven structures with Halogenated Hoechst 33258 analogues that are potential agents in radiotherapy, phototherapy, radioimmunotherapy or photoimmunotherapy, and the structure of the precursor. In all of the examined complexes the ligand binds to the minor groove but not all halogen substituents refine to 100% occupancy.  The refined occupancies of the halogen atoms reveal that the degree of carbon-halogen cleavage is highest for ortho and lowest for para substitution. Among meta substituents pointing outside the minor groove, bromine atoms had a higher occupancy than the larger iodines. The position of the halogen atom in the minor groove is influenced by additional substituents on the phenyl ring. In most cases the bulky halogen atom is facing outside of the minor groove. Only in the 3-iodo-5-isopropylHoechst complex is iodine positioned towards the floor of the groove allowing the big isopropyl group to face outside. Section B describes the structure of a carborane-containing ligand (JW-B) bound to the minor groove of d(CGCAAATTTGCG)2. The analysis shows that is possible to position boron-rich moieties close to the cell nucleus, and JW-B may have potential in Boron Neutron Capture Therapy.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Quadruplex</field><field name="subject">DNA</field><field name="subject">X-ray</field><field name="subject">Structure</field><field name="subject">Crystal</field><field name="subject">Daunomycin</field><field name="subject">Anti-cancer drug</field><field name="subject">Hoechst 33258</field><field name="subject">Phototherapy</field><field name="subject">Dehalogenation</field><field name="subject">Ligand</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3431</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bonding of additives to functional polyolefins by reactive blending</field><field name="creator">Roberts, Ann Jennifer</field><field name="description">This study examined the concept of using a reactive blending process to develop new polymeric additive systems. The objective was to investigate the potential of using a reactive processing technique as a means to bond additives to functional polymers, to create &#8220;in situ&#8221; bonds between functional groups present on the polymers and those present on the additives. The work is reported in two parts; the first part studied the bonding of colorants to functional polyolefins and the second part investigated the bonding of UV stabilisers to functional polyolefins. The research was completed with the long term objective that the approach should offer alternative additives to conventional non-bonded systems for use in polypropylene. An ethylene ionomer was utilised for the bonding of dyes, this was chosen for its optical clarity and chemical functionality. Polyethylene methacrylic acid (EMAA) ionomers and methine dyes were blended in the melt phase using an internal mixer to produce bright intrinsically colored polymers. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) in transmission mode was used to assess the bonding of the dye to the ionomer. Bonding resulted through electrostatic interactions between carboxylate groups on the ionomer and cations on the dye molecules. The reactive blending process also resulted in a change in the chromophoric structure of the dye. The bonded system was compared to a system whereby no bonding between the methine dye and polymer was expected. In the later system the methine dye was blended with polyethylene using an internal mixer. From FTIR results no interaction was observed between the dye and polyethylene in this system. This was supported by microscopic analysis that showed that the dye was present in the polyethylene as a dispersion. The second stage of research focussed on the UV stabilisation of polyolefins. A melt reaction was explored between polypropylene functionalised with maleic anhydride (PP-g-MA) and an alkoxyamine hindered amine light stabiliser (NOR-HALS) with hydroxyl functionality. The technology proposed is based upon the reaction between the carboxylic acid groups of maleated polypropylene and hydroxyl groups of a specific NOR-HALS (Tinuvin 152). The efficiency of the modification was assessed using FTIR to verify the esterification reaction between the NOR-HALS and the maleated polypropylene. This reaction resulted in the grafting of a pendant UV stabiliser to the polypropylene through an ester linkage. A twin-screw extruder (TSE) was used to complete this study. A larger quantity of material could be produced using a TSE compared to the colorant system where an internal mixer was used. Samples of the reactively blended materials were exposed to UV radiation for a maximum time period of three hundred hours to assess the resulting stability of the materials. Diffuse reflectance FTIR (DRIFT) spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) provided an effective means to study oxidative degradation. IR spectroscopic measurements were used to determine the effectiveness of HALS in inhibiting the photo-oxidation of maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene. The inhibition was quantified by measuring the formation of carbonyl groups, with and without HALS bonded to the polymer, at fixed exposure times of UV radiation. DRIFT and XPS analysis confirmed that stabilised samples oxidised less, as indicated by the lower carbonyl index values and O1s / C1s ratios. These findings were complemented by results from Charpy impact tests. The mechanical property results indicated that the longevity of the materials with UV stabilisers grafted to them exceeded the PPg- MA system where there was no stabiliser present. Visible spectrophotometry was used to assess the colour of the polymeric samples and change in colour following exposure to UV radiation. Samples with bonded HALS demonstrated greater colour stability than control samples. The microstructure of the polymer surfaces was viewed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The polymeric samples demonstrated resistance to crazing when the NOR-HALS were bonded to the polymer. For both the colorant and UV stabiliser areas of research, thermal properties of the materials were assessed using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). It was found that increasing the additive concentration in the polymer resulted in an increase in the temperature of crystallisation (Tc). Melt flow index can indicate if any change in molar mass had occurred during processing. An increase in melt flow index values (MFI) was observed when additive loading increased which suggested that degradation of the polymer had occurred during processing. In summary, reactive processing showed considerable promise as a means to bond additives to a functional polypropylene.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">reactive blending</field><field name="subject">polyolefin</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3437</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Microarray-based gene set analysis in cancer studies</field><field name="creator">Song, Qin Sarah</field><field name="description">This work addresses the development and application of gene set analysis methods to problems in microarray-based data sets.

Geothermal systems are a potential source of Sb in the fresh waters of New Zealand&#8217;s North Island, but little is known about the element&#8217;s behaviour within geothermal fluids, and even less about the eventual fate of geothermally produced Sb.  The purpose of this thesis was to determine the factors controlling geothermal Sb behaviour in a range of environments, in order to begin to develop an understanding of the eventual fate of Sb produced from geothermal systems. Factors controlling Sb precipitation at two New Zealand geothermal power stations, were determined using field measurements and geochemical model predictions.  Approximately 75 % of the incoming Sb, which ranged from 960 &#8211; 1650 &#956;g/kg in the incoming fluids was removed from solution within the Ngawha and Rotokawa power stations.  It was found that changes in pH and temperature were the most important factors controlling stibnite (Sb2S3) precipitation.  Thermodynamic databases could be used to model this precipitation process, once updated with recent published Sb2S3 solubility data. The mobility of Sb from Sb2S3 precipitates in geothermal features at Wai-O-Tapu and Waimangu, two New Zealand geothermal fields, were investigated.  At Wai-O-Tapu, daytime variations in aqueous Sb concentrations from the discharge of Champagne Pool may be due to to changing sulfide-sulfate equilibria coupled with photosynthetic bacterial processes.  While daytime concentrations of Sb approached 200 &#956;g/kg, most of the Sb remobilised by such mechanisms appears to be removed by adsorption onto suspended particulate material (SPM) or reprecipitation (as Sb2S3) in an anoxic, low pH lake feature downstream. Concentrations of Sb in the discharge from Alum Lake were below the analytical detection limit (&lt;0.2 &#956;g/kg).  At Waimangu, these daytime fluctuations were not observed in the discharge of Frying Pan Lake, and concentrations of Sb were ~13 &#956;g/kg.  In the absence of any downstream acidic waters, no precipitation was observed and only minor adsorption onto SPM was observed.  Most of the Sb produced from Frying Pan Lake is therefore transported into Lake Rotomahana, the system&#8217;s receiving environment. Natural Sb removal processes in receiving (non-geothermal) environments were also assessed.  In the Waikato River, Sb concentrations were low (~1 &#956;g/kg), compared to those observed in geothermal environments studied.  The most important process was adsorption to SPM, which is enhanced at low (&lt; 5) pH conditions, or in the anoxic base of stratified lakes.  In Lake Ohakuri, which was stratified during the summer of 2007, there was also the potential for the removal of Sb as Sb2S3 in the presence of sulfide species that form in the anoxic layer.  There was evidence that the adsorption of Sb changes with changing Fe concentrations in suspended particulate material, and therefore Sb adsorption was higher in winter than in summer.  The behaviour of Sb was conservative in the Port Waikato estuary at the mouth of the river. Throughout the research, Sb was compared to arsenic (As), a metalloid previously thought to exhibit behaviour similar to Sb in aquatic environments.  It was found that while any removal processes shown to affect Sb will also affect As, the inverse did not necessarily apply.  Arsenic will adsorb more readily to SPM than Sb and, while there was evidence for bioaccumulation of As by geothermal algae and freshwater macrophytes, there was no such evidence for Sb.  Therefore, if geothermally-derived Sb and As did ever significantly contaminate a downstream environment, it should not be assumed that the processes mitigating As contamination will necessarily also apply to Sb.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">antimony</field><field name="subject">geothermal</field><field name="subject">environmental chemistry</field><field name="subject">arsenic</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260300 Geochemistry</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4230</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The evolution of coopeation: insights from experimental populations of Pseudomonas fluorescens</field><field name="creator">Meintjes, Peter L.</field><field name="description">The field of experimental evolution is burgeoning under the power of microbial systems. Our ability to manipulate experimental design for use with microbes is only limited by our imagination. This thesis is a study that uses Pseudomonas fluorescens, a soil dwelling bacterium, as an experimental tool for understanding evolutionary processes. The evolution of cooperation has been a thorny issue for many years, because it initially seems to contradict the intrinsically selfish concepts established in Darwin&#8217;s theory of evolution by natural selection. Advances in microbiology and the ability to test important evolutionary theories using microbes, provides an exciting opportunity for those working in the field of experimental evolution. This thesis uses P. fluorescens to investigate four aspects of the evolution of cooperative behaviour organised into four results chapters (Chapters 2-5). The first describes the genotypic and phenotypic diversity of 26 independently derived &#8216;wrinkly spreader&#8217; genotypes in order to analyse the genetic and phenotypic variation among morphotypes. Mutations were identified in 25 of the 26 wrinkly spreaders including a new locus mws and three new genes of known loci wspE, awsR and awsO. This new genetic information provided additional insight into the molecular causes of the wrinkly spreader phenotype. Multivariate analysis of the phenotypic traits revealed that wspF mutants were phenotypically distinct from other morphotypes at a level below the ecological niche. The second chapter extended existing studies on the evolution of wrinkly spreader genotypes within the well-known Haystack model for evolution in group-structured populations, by studying the population dynamics of cooperative genotypes with and without group structure, in a multi-level selection one framework. It was shown that the time spent in a haystack affects the fitness of cooperators, because the longer group-generation treatment conformed to the predictions of the Haystack model, while the shorter group-generation treatment did not. The third chapter was an investigation into how the fitness of the emergent group-level phenotype formed by cooperating wrinkly spreader cells was dependent on the density of wrinkly spreader cells. Contrary to prediction, no density dependence was observed when calculated in a multi-level selection one framework, but rather it was determined that the emergent fitness was dependent on time, implicating a role for a development-like process. The final results chapter of this thesis incorporated the hypothesised role for a development-like process into a novel theoretical model for the evolution of multicellularity in which fitness would be determined in a multi-level selection two framework. Novel apparatus and experimental design were developed to determine if it were possible to observe a response to a selective regime that selected simultaneously at the level of the individual cell and the level of the group of cells. A significant response was shown after only six group-generation cycles. In summary, this thesis exploits P. fluorescens as an experimental tool to gain insight into complex ecological and evolutionary phenomena such as cooperation, biofilm formation and the evolution of multicellularity, and provides insight into the molecular causes of the cooperation among wrinkly spreader genotypes.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biology</field><field name="subject">Evolution</field><field name="subject">Experimental evolution</field><field name="subject">Molecular Biology</field><field name="subject">Microbiology</field><field name="subject">Genetics</field><field name="subject">Microbial ecology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4229</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chemical and microbial transformations of some lanosterol derivatives</field><field name="creator">Bartley, John Peter</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">1969</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4233</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparative diversity at the major histocompatibility complex in two dolphin species</field><field name="creator">Heimeier, Dorothea</field><field name="description">This thesis presents investigations of diversity at three genes (class I, DQA and DQB) of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) in cetaceans. The MHC genes encode for proteins that are crucial for initiating an immune response by binding invading pathogens in vertebrates. It has been acknowledged that a high diversity at these genes results in the ability to recognise a wider range of pathogens, therefore functional diversity is important for the survival of a species. Furthermore this diversity has been created under the influence of selection, which can reveal interesting contrasts with neutral markers about the history of selection of populations and species. The diversity at two genes (DQA and DQB) in natural populations of two contrasting species of cetaceans has been investigated in more detail. The species selected included both sub-species of Hector&#8217;s dolphin, the Hector&#8217;s dolphin (Cephalorhynchus hectori hectori) and the Maui&#8217;s dolphin (Cephalorhynchus hectori maui), as well as the long-finned pilot whale (Globicephala melas). These species were chosen, because both Hector&#8217;s dolphin sub-species contrast with the pilot whale species in regards to their population size, abundance, population structure and life history. For example both sub-species of Hector&#8217;s dolphin have small population sizes and only inhabit coastal areas around New Zealand, whereas the pilot whale is an abundant, pelagic dolphin species. In Chapter 2 the expression of class II MHC genes (DQA and DQB) was demonstrated for the first time for a cetacean species, the Hector&#8217;s dolphin. Using available information from the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), I also designed primers to investigate class I MHC. Fragments of MHC genes were amplified from cDNA, which was derived from blood samples of two Hector&#8217;s dolphins. These dolphins were the subject of a temporary live capture, presenting a unique opportunity for blood collection. No evidence was found for duplication of both MHC class II loci, but cloning suggested a minimum of three copies of class I genes within the genomic DNA. However, the expression of all class I genes was uncertain, since only one allele could be isolated from cDNA. Functionality for all three genes (class I, DQA and DQB) was supported by the evidence for balancing selection having operated on these genes, indicated by a higher ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions. In Chapter 3, a combination of single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and direct sequencing was used to describe DQA and DQB diversity in the Hector&#8217;s and Maui&#8217;s dolphin. Genetic samples for the Hector&#8217;s dolphin were available from previously collected stranding and biopsy samples (n = 233), representing three populations from the South Coast of New Zealand and the sub-species on the West Coast of the North Island of New Zealand. For the Hector&#8217;s dolphin of the South Island, a surprisingly large number of alleles at both loci (DQA = 4, DQB = 6) were found, considering their small population size and compared to other cetacean populations with larger population sizes. The Maui&#8217;s dolphin has been classified as critically endangered with less than 100 dolphins, but showed a relatively high nucleotide diversity for DQB (&#61552; = 4.5%). This diversity was based on only three alleles that have been retained in the sub-species, representing the most divergent of all six alleles. All populations showed strong geographic differentiation at both loci (DQA: FST=0.252; DQB: FST=0.333), with the greatest differentiation between the South Island population and the North Island Maui&#8217;s dolphin. Comparison to mitochondrial and microsatellite diversity suggested influence of stochastic genetic drift, although the pressure of balancing selection acting on DQB over an evolutionary time period was also evident by a higher ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions (dN/dS=5.9) and by a pattern of trans-specific allele sharing within the family of Delphinidae. In Chapter 4 similar methods were used to describe DQA and DQB in pilot whales using genetic samples from the long-finned pilot whale that were available from five mass-strandings from around New Zealand (n = 237). A larger number of alleles than for the Hector&#8217;s dolphin were found at both loci (DQA= 8; DQB= 8), although their large population size and pelagic abundance raises the expectation of an even greater number of alleles. The overall differentiation between mass-strandings was low, but significant for both loci (DQA: FST =0.012, DQB: FST =0.014). The differentiation of all strandings was greatest for the Golden Bay mass-stranding at DQA, but deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium at DQB suggested either sub-structure within mass-strandings (Wahlund effect) or the presence of null alleles. As for the Hector&#8217;s dolphin and other mammalian species, the influence of balancing selection acting on DQB over a long evolutionary time period was evident by a higher ratio non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions (dN/dS=9.3) and by a pattern of trans-specific allele sharing within the family of Delphinidae.  Overall, diversity is surprisingly similar between these two cetacean species despite different life history characteristic, but low compared to domesticated ungulate species, such as the cow. If low MHC diversity is a general feature of cetaceans, due to the marine environment as suggested previously or rather a side effect of short-term demographic forces remains speculative. A standardised nomenclature for the increasing number of MHC alleles from cetacean is proposed in this thesis to assist with future development of this research.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">MHC</field><field name="subject">Maui's dolphin</field><field name="subject">Hector's dolphin</field><field name="subject">long-finned pilot whale</field><field name="subject">population genetics</field><field name="subject">expression of MHC genes</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4441</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ecstatic display call of the Ad&#233;lie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)</field><field name="creator">Marks, Emma Josephine</field><field name="description">The ability to understand the complex mechanisms by which species communicate has been the focus of study for many years. The Ad&#233;lie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) breeds in vocally challenging Antarctic colonies and has evolved a complex system of intra- and intersexual visual and vocal behaviours. Unique to the Ad&#233;lie penguin, is the presence of two distinct display calls, the Loud Mutual Display (LMD) call and male Ecstatic Display Call (EDC). The EDC is used for both mate choice and territory defence; but apart from general structure and function this call remains basically unstudied. Therefore, the aim of this study is to examine the EDC with regard to its function (during mate choice) and variability over time, with location and with changing conditions. It is predicted that the EDC will be an individual call that is distinct from the LMD call. Additionally, the effects of an inclement breeding season on factors that affect breeding success will be examined using a logistic regression approach. The study took place over two breeding seasons(2000/1 &amp; 2002/3) on Ross Island, Antarctica, with the majority of research being conducted at Cape Bird. Results of the study indicate that the EDC is an individual call that cannot reliably be described as a male display as females also give an EDC that is acoustically comparable. The similarities between the EDC and the LMD call seem to relate only to syllabic organisation (structure), as almost every call parameter was different between call types. Furthermore, several call parameters differed between Ross Island colonies. These parameters varied with both geographical location and colony size. In conjunction with variation in call parameters, the health and breeding success of the colonies was different. The stability of call parameters (from Cape Bird) indicated that parameters that separate colonies not only alter between breeding years, but also vary during a single breeding season. The function of the EDC as an honest signal during mate choice was supported by spectral analyses. These analyses found heavier males had significantly lower Frequency Modulation (FM) in the short repeated syllables of their calls than lighter males. Furthermore, a male&#8217;s breeding success could be predicted during the early breeding season by the FM. Logistic regression models showed that early male arrival, weight and good nest quality were most influential in predicting fledging success. The logistic regression method also showed that the parameters measured varied in their predictive ability as the season progressed. This study has not only enhanced the wealth of knowledge regarding Ad&#233;lie breeding behaviour and developed our understanding of the vocal repertoire of this species, but also has implications for honest signalling theory, and the evolution and stability of vocal variation at different spatial and temporal scales.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Adelie penguin</field><field name="subject">Ecstatic Display Call</field><field name="subject">mate choice</field><field name="subject">breeding success</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4241</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Species recognition in zebra finches: testing the effects of sex, sensory modalities, and social ontogeny</field><field name="creator">Campbell, Dana L.M.</field><field name="description">Species recognition is an integral component of mate selection and must occur in all sexually reproducing organisms to avoid costly hybridisation. Species recognition abilities may be comprised of both innate components and experience during ontogeny through the learning of visual, acoustic, and other sensory species-specific cues. But how greatly is the ability to recognise one&#8223;s own species (conspecifics) over others (heterospecifics) dependent on the phylogeographic relationship of the array of potential species as social partners and to what extent is the discriminatory behaviour modulated by subject ontogeny versus species identity? Using a model system, which is widely studied in all disciplines of avian research, the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata castanotis), I aimed to investigate the visual and acoustic cues involved in conspecific recognition by both female and male individuals of this species. I used an array of previously untested phylogeographically relevant estrildid heterospecifics as my stimuli and tested subjects of diverse experimental ontogenetic treatments. By scoring a wide-selection of measured behavioural responses my research indicates that female and male zebra finches prefer live conspecifics over live phylogeographically relevant heterospecific stimuli and this preference is more consistent by females than males. Female zebra finches rely on both visual and acoustic features of potential social partners for accurate species discrimination; in this regard video playbacks or the diverse colour morphs of domesticated zebra finches may be useful tools for further experimentation. Additionally, females display significant individuality in their behavioural responses which may be relevant for pair bonding decisions made by both sexes. I further documented that normally-reared zebra finches will prefer song playbacks of their own species but that both rearing in an indoor restricted acoustic environment of conspecifics or cross-fostering to another species will reduce discrimination preferences, although the results may depend on the behavioural metrics analysed.

This thesis investigates three situations when these two phenomena interact: Firstly we investigate the interplay of multiple four-wave mixing processes using coherent and incoherent pump waves in the presence of Raman scattering. We experimentally demonstrate that despite the requirements of phase-matching conditions it is possible to observe multiple phasematched and non-phasematched four-wave mixing processes. Furthermore we show that an incoherent light wave provided by amplified spontaneous emission noise can act as an effective pump wave for degenerate four-wave mixing. The main part of the thesis is occupied by the investigation of a mode-locked Raman fibre laser. The use of dissipative four-wave mixing for the passive mode-locking technique in combination with Raman scattering as the gain mechanism offers the possibility of achieving ultra-high repetition rates at very high average output powers. We experimentally demonstrate the mode-locked operation of the laser at 500 GHz and achieve an average output power of almost 1 W. Additionally we examine the key limitation of the laser which is supermode noise caused by mode-locking the laser at very high harmonics of the cavity resonance frequency. In order to gain qualitative insight into the influence of supermode noise on the laser dynamics we create a laser model which takes account of supermode noise. Furthermore we design a scheme to reduce supermode noise using additional subcavities, and evaluate the scheme using a lower repetition rate laser. We show that by including the subcavities into the setup the amount of supermode noise can be reduced by at least a factor 100. Lastly we introduce a novel method to measure the noise fluctuations of continuous wave lasers at timescales prohibiting the use of traditional noise measurement techniques. The noise is measured using a technique which transfers the fast noise from the continuous wave laser to a low repetition rate mode-locked laser which can be measured with traditional methods. We demonstrate that a continuous wave Raman fibre laser exhibits ultrafast, high contrast intensity fluctuations at timescales of tens of Gigahertz. This work has led to three publications and six conference presentations.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4269</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Degradation mechanisms and development of silicon carbide refractories</field><field name="creator">Etzion, Ron</field><field name="description">The lifetime of aluminium reduction cells is of considerable importance in the operating economics of an aluminium smelter. Not only are the cell materials costly, but cell life is also key in minimizing production downtime and the waste material generated in the cutting-out and relining of a reduction cell.  This lifetime is increasingly driven by two components of the cell lining: the carbon cathode and the sidewall refractories which are the primary containment of the metal and electrolyte.  Silicon nitride bonded silicon carbide (SNBSC) refractories are the current state-of-the-art sidewall materials. These materials are formed by encapsulation of SiC particles in a silicon nitride matrix, by nitridation of silicon at high temperatures under a nitrogen atmosphere.  In this study the mechanisms of the corrosion of silicon nitride bonded silicon carbide refractories in an aluminium reduction cell environment were examined.  Microstructural analysis of SNBSC materials by: X-ray diffraction, solid state NMR, Raman spectroscopy, XPS, and SEM, identified variations in &#945;/&#946; Si3N4 ratio and porosity in the binder phase, with higher porosity levels and &#946; Si3N4 content found in the interior part of the brick. Unreacted metallic silicon was observed only as a crystalline phase inside SiC grains and is not associated with the binder phase.  SNBSC samples from eight different commercial refractory manufacturers were tested in an industrial aluminium cell environment, both by immersion in industrial cells and in the laboratory.  The samples showed extensive attack and considerable differentiation between the samples.  The effects on the corrosion rate of porosity levels, amount of binder, &#945;/&#946; Si3N4 ratio, free Si content in the binder, and different factors in the environment were examined in the laboratory scale trials. A laboratory scale testing rig with some novel features, such as a rotating anode, was developed to examine corrosion resistance of samples under electrolysis conditions in molten cryolite at up to 1000oC.  Corrosion test results, supported by thermodynamic calculations, identified the Si3N4 binder as the reactive phase in SNBSC materials, especially in the gas phase above the bath level. High porosity levels and high &#946; Si3N4 fraction in the binder showed a statistically significant contribution to the corrosion rate in lab-scale corrosion trials. Commercial materials are also highly inhomogeneous in the distribution of the &#946; Si3N4 phase as mentioned above, which complicates sample selection and the interpretation of corrosion test results.   The crystal morphology of &#946; Si3N4 is suggested as the reason for the high reactivity of these materials. This morphology characterised by elongated rod-like shape crystals with hexagonal cross section, presents a higher surface area compared to &#945; Si3N4 crystals containing mainly flat matte crystals. In the light of this observation, the binder phase in selected samples was deliberately modified to convert a significant fraction of the &#945; Si3N4 to &#946; Si3N4. Corrosion rates measured from these modified samples in general support the argument that the crystallographic form of silicon nitride contributes to corrosion rate. The proposed corrosion mechanism for SNBSC materials in the aluminium reduction cell atmosphere is based on combination of oxidation of the binder followed by attack of corrosive gases to produce volatile SiF4.  Thus the binder phase is initially passivated below the electrolyte level on the sidewall, where exposure to corrosive gases is limited, but occurs more rapidly in the area above the electrolyte/air interface.  The intrusion of electrolyte into the refractory and capillary transport up the sidewall is a key in accelerating this reaction.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aluminium</field><field name="subject">SiC refractories, Corrosion</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4531</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Similariton compression in a comb-like dispersion decreasing fibre</field><field name="creator">Im, Sung-Hoon</field><field name="description">Optical pulse compression using similariton propagation in an optical fibre with decreasing dispersion has been demonstrated for the first time. This compression scheme is a practical application of the sech-similariton solution to the generalized nonlinear Schrodinger equation (NLSE) with distributed coefficients recently found using the self-similarity technique. The sech-similariton solution exhibits a characteristic positive linear frequency chirp, which increases in slope as the pulse compresses. The solution does not develop any side pedestals or deformation in pulse shape as it propagates, making it a promising candidate for a new compression technique. Unlike the adiabatic compression technique, rapid compression can be achieved in a fibre with a specifically designed decreasing group velocity dispersion profile since the sech-similariton is an exact solution to the NLSE. A cost-effective and efficient method of realising decreasing dispersion in a fibre has been developed using a comb-like dispersion profiling technique and its feasibility has been experimentally demonstrated. An optimised experimental similariton compressor system has been built using two industry standard fibres which compressed an 11 ps linearly chirped sech input pulse to 400 fs, yielding a compression factor of greater than 25.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences::240500 Classical Physics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4524</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Random effects models for ordinal data</field><field name="creator">Lee, Arier Chi-Lun</field><field name="description">One of the most frequently encountered types of data is where the response variables are measured on an ordinal scale. Although there have been substantial developments in the statistical techniques for the analysis of ordinal data, methods appropriate for repeatedly assessed ordinal data collected from field experiments are limited. A series of biennial field screening trials for evaluating cultivar resistance of potato to the disease, late blight, caused by the fungus Phytophthora infestans (Mont.) de Bary has been conducted by the New Zealand Institute of Crop and Food Research since 1983. In each trial, the progression of late blight was visually assessed several times during the planting season using a nine-point ordinal scale based on the percentage of necrotic tissues. As for many other agricultural field experiments, spatial differences between the experimental units is one of the major concerns in the analysis of data from the potato late blight trial. The aim of this thesis is to construct a statistical model which can be used to analyse the data collected from the series of potato late blight trials. We review existing methodologies for analysing ordinal data with mixed effects particularly those methods in the Bayesian framework. Using data collected from the potato late blight trials we develop a Bayesian hierarchical model for the analyses of repeatedly assessed ordinal scores with spatial effects, in particular the time dependence of the scores assessed on the same experimental units was modelled by a sigmoid logistic curve. Data collected from the potato late blight trials demonstrated the importance of spatial effects in agricultural field trials. These effects cannot be neglected when analysing such data. Although statistical methods can be refined to account for the complexity of the data, appropriate trial design still plays a central role in field experiments.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">statistics</field><field name="subject">Bayesian</field><field name="subject">random effect</field><field name="subject">ordinal data</field><field name="subject">late blight</field><field name="subject">repeated measures</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::230200 Statistics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4544</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Integrated technology in the undergraduate mathematics curriculum : a case study of computer algebra systems</field><field name="creator">Oates, Greg</field><field name="description">The effective integration of technology into the teaching and learning of mathematics remains one of the critical challenges facing tertiary mathematics, which has traditionally been slow to respond to technological innovation. This thesis reveals that the term integration is widely used in the literature with respect to technology and the curriculum, although its meaning can vary substantially, and furthermore, the term is seldom well defined. A review of the literature provides the basis for a survey of undergraduate mathematics educators, to determine their use of technology, their views of what an Integrated Technology Mathematics Curriculum (ITMC) may resemble, and how it may be achieved. Responses to this survey, and factors identified in the literature, are used to construct a taxonomy of integrated technology. The taxonomy identifies six defining characteristics of an ITMC, each with a number of associated elements. A visual model using radar diagrams is developed to compare courses against the taxonomy, and to identify aspects needing attention in individual courses. T Evidence from an observational study of initiatives to introduce Computer Algebra Systems into undergraduate mathematics courses at The University of Auckland, firstly using CAS-calculators and latterly computer software, is examined against the taxonomy. A number of critical issues influencing the integration of these technologies are identified. These include mandating technology use in official departmental policy, attention to congruency and fairness in assessment, re-evaluating the value of topics in the curriculum, re-establishing the goals of undergraduate courses, and developing the pedagogical technical knowledge of teaching staff. The thesis concludes that effective integration of technology in undergraduate mathematics requires a recognition of, and comprehensive attention to, the interdependence of the taxonomy components. An integrated, holistic approach, which aims for curricular congruency across all elements of the taxonomy, provides the basis for a more consistent, effective and sustainable ITMC.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mathematics</field><field name="subject">Technology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::230100 Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4533</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis of boron corrole complexes</field><field name="creator">Albrett, Amelia</field><field name="description">Boron complexes of porphyrin analogues are rare and typically difficult to prepare.  The possibility of extending this chemistry further to include corroles was intriguing and provided the main motivation for this work.  The coordination chemistry of boron with corroles was explored.  The aim was to see whether boron could be coordinated within the corrole N4 core and if so whether novel or similar structural types resulted, relative to the closely related porphyrin system.  Boron halides and aryl halides were reacted with free base corroles in the presence of diisopropylethylamine.  The methodology employed was similar to that used for boron porphyrin systems.  As well as free base corrole, an N-methyl corrole and trilithiated corrole were also used as starting materials.  Several boron corrole structural types were obtained.  The reaction of free base corrole with boron trifluoroetherate led to the first structurally characterised corrole with boron bound within the N4 core, B2OF2(corrole).  From this reagent a mono-boron species, BF2(corrole) was also obtained.  With dichlorophenylborane, several boron corrole complexes were prepared including PhB2O(corrole), PhB2(corrole) and B2Ph2H(corrole).  The latter species was structurally characterised and the bridging hydride is proposed to form through a reductive coupling process.  Use of N-methyl corrole effectively blocked one boron binding site and subsequently mono-boron corroles BF2(N-methyl- corrole), BPh(OH)(N-methyl corrole) and BPhF(N-methyl corrole) were prepared in good yields.  The reaction of lithiated corrole and dichloroplenylborane afforded B2Ph2Cl(corrole).  Overall, several new boron corrole species were prepared, significantly extending the library of known boron complexes with ligands related to the porphyrin system.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">corrole</field><field name="subject">boron</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5172</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The management of children's asthma in primary care : Are there ethnic differences in care?</field><field name="creator">Crengle, Suzanne Marie</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted until August 2010, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ethnic disparities</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Pacific</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Asthma</field><field name="subject">Primary care</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Health services research</field><field name="subject">Kaupapa Maori Research</field><field name="subject">Quality of care</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321019 Paediatrics</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321208 Primary health care</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321207 Indigenous health</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321210 Community child health</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321202 Epidemiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4957</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of chemical gradients across porous silicon sensors</field><field name="creator">Thompson, Corrina</field><field name="description">This thesis investigated the formation of compositional gradients across 0.5 &#8211; 1 cm of porous silicon layers which had thicknesses of 2 &#8211; 10 &#956;m. These compositional gradients were then characterised, and their potential use as vapour sensors was probed. Surface composition gradients have been reported on flat surfaces, but this is the first time that they have been reported on a three-dimensional material with controlled pore geometry. Chemical gradients have been generated across the surface of porous silicon by performing electrochemical attachment of organohalides with an asymmetric electrode arrangement, and by chemical hydrosilylation of alkenes in the presence of a diffusion gradient of diazonium salts across the porous silicon surface. Samples with electrochemical gradients of methyl, pentyl acetate, and decyl and using chemical hydrosilylation with gradients of undecanoic acid and decyl groups. The latter four gradient-modified porous silicon types have been &#8216;endcapped&#8217; with methyl groups to give improved stability and greater hydrophobicity. The pentyl acetate and undecanoic groups have been converted into pentanol and undecanoate groups respectively to increase the hydrophilicity of these porous silicon surfaces. The gradients have been characterised using two-dimensional FTIR microspectrophotometry and water contact angle measurements. The interaction of these gradient porous silicon samples with ethanol, heptane, toluene and 2-hexanol vapours have been monitored either by UV-Vis reflectance spectroscopy at selected points across the surface or more globally using a digital camera. The undecanoate gradient porous silicon sample showed a large difference in optical response between the undecanoate end and the methyl end of the gradient when exposed to water vapour, showing that imposition of a chemical gradient can alter the sensing character of porous silicon in a controllable manner.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5167</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evolution of the brain and sensory systems of the kiwi</field><field name="creator">Corfield, Jeremy R.</field><field name="description">Kiwi (Apteryx spp.) have evolved under unique evolutionary pressures and uniquely occupy a nocturnal, ground-dwelling niche. They share few traits with other birds: they have small eyes, an elongated bill, and several features more characteristic of mammals. Early anatomical studies described a number of unique features in the kiwi brain, but their relevance to the behaviour and ecology of the species was not clearly established. This study aims to describe the structure of the primary cranial sensory systems of kiwi and comment on the evolutionary pressures that may have shaped their current form. The external morphology and relatively large size of the brain of kiwi, in particular those of the telencephalon, contrast with those of other Palaeognaths. The relative size of the cerebral hemispheres is rivalled only by a handful of parrots and songbirds. This enlargement results from a differential enlargement of the nidopallium, mesopallium and, to a lesser extent, of the basal ganglia. In other birds these regions are associated with the integration of information, cognition and learning. Kiwi brain centres processing visual information were small, although the retina structure showed an adaptation to dim light. The olfactory and trigeminal systems associated with the bill were hypertrophied. The auditory system shows specialisations associated with an overrepresentation of high frequency coding areas that originates in the cochlea and is preserved throughout the auditory brainstem. In absolute terms, the upper frequency response limit, based on hair cell morphology, is estimated to be about 5 kHz, the lower limit to be about 500 Hz, with a slightly higher frequency range predicted from the morphology of central auditory structures. The organisation of both nucleus angularis (NA) and nucleus laminaris (NL) in kiwi suggest that the central auditory system has retained the ancestral organisation except for the morphological features associated with the overrepresentation of high frequencies. Overall, the brain and sensory structures of kiwi have evolved neural adaptations that accompany the very different behavioural strategies associated with the unique niche the birds occupy. A large telencephalic size and shift away from vision towards an increased reliance on olfactory, tactile and auditory cues constitute a collection of features that make kiwi unique among birds. These findings provide a unique glimpse of the evolutionary history that has led to this unusual design, in particular, and challenge many of our current views about the evolution of brains and encephalisation, in general.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Kiwi, brain.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5317</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Broadband teleportation and entanglement in cascaded open quantum systems</field><field name="creator">Noh, Changsuk</field><field name="description">Quantum optics provides powerful means to probe quantum mechanics. In this thesis, we study various aspects of quantum phenomena arising in quantum optical systems. Part I studies broadband quantum teleportation. After presenting three different methods of analyzing the standard teleportation protocol, we study the interplay between various bandwidths in determining the fidelity of a broadband quantum field teleportation. Explicit formulae for the degrees of first- and secondorder coherence for the teleportation of resonance fluorescence are derived for this purpose. Part II studies entanglement arising in cascaded open quantum (optical) systems. First, a detailed laser model is produced within quantum trajectory theory to study the total decoherence rate of a laser-driven qubit. Second, using this model, we address the issue of laser quantum state, viewed in connection with separability of the laser-driven-qubit system. Third, a measure of entanglement within quantum trajectory theory called &#8216;Contextual Entanglement&#8217; is calculated for a few simple systems and compared with the &#8216;Entanglement of Formation&#8217;. Lastly, we introduce a method to quantify entanglement (based on the contextual entanglement) between a source and the field it emits, which we call the &#8216;Entanglement Spectrum&#8217;. It is applied to study the entanglement between a laser-driven qubit and the field the qubit scatters.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Quantum optics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5316</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Knots and quandles</field><field name="creator">Budden, Stephen Mark</field><field name="description">Quandles were introduced to Knot Theory in the 1980s as an almost complete algebraic invariant for knots and links. Like their more basic siblings, groups, they are difficult to distinguish so a major challenge is to devise means for determining when two quandles having different presentations are really different. This thesis addresses this point by studying algebraic aspects of quandles.  Following what is mainly a recapitulation of existing work on quandles, we firstly investigate how a link quandle is related to the quandles of the individual components of the link. Next we investigate coset quandles. These are motivated by the transitive action of the operator, associated and automorphism group actions on a given quandle, allowing techniques of permutation group theory to be used. We will show that the class of all coset quandles includes the class of all Alexander quandles; indeed all group quandles.  Coset quandles are used in two ways: to give representations of connected quandles, which include knot quandles; and to provide target quandles for homomorphism invariants which may be useful in enabling one to distinguish quandles by counting homomorphisms onto target quandles.  Following an investigation of the information loss in going from the fundamental quandle of a link to the fundamental group, we apply our techniques to calculations for the figure eight knot and braid index two knots and involving lower triangular matrix groups.  The thesis is rounded out by two appendices, one giving a short table of  knot quandles for knots up to six crossings and the other a computer program for computing the homomorphism invariants.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">knot theory</field><field name="subject">quandles</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::230100 Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5292</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of New Zealand nephrite for forensic purposes</field><field name="creator">Campbell, Gareth Peter</field><field name="description">This study investigated the discrimination between sources of the semi-precious mineral, nephrite, by a targeted microanalytical determination of the elemental composition, including the trace elements. Nephrite specimens were collected from two significant nephrite sources in New Zealand, namely the Westland and Wakatipu fields, and combined with donated specimens from the Southland field to complete a representative collection of New Zealand nephrite.  A small number of nephrite specimens were donated from the South Westland nephrite field and from foreign sources.  Representative fragments of these specimens were analysed by electron microprobe analysis (EMPA) for major elements and by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) for trace elements. The data obtained by the analytical procedure were treated within a compositional data (CoDa) framework of statistical analysis that focuses on the relative sizes of the components in the data set.  The data were transformed under the guidelines of the CoDa framework, where appropriate, and the transformed data were treated with standard statistical methods for exploratory data analysis, dimension reduction and discriminant analysis.  Advances were made to the Hotelling&#8217;s   method for comparison of multivariate means by incorporating a permutation evaluation step.  This permutation method removes the requirement for multivariate normality, and it also allows comparisons to be made when there are many more variables than observations, as is often the case when objects are being characterized using elemental data. The strategy used in this study showed that it is possible to discriminate between sources of nephrite at both an intra- and inter-source level within New Zealand.  In addition, an exploratory investigation showed that New Zealand nephrite could be differentiated from the few nephrite specimens from foreign sources that were available for comparison. Recommendations are made for the protection of the New Zealand nephrite resource and for casework, based on the results obtained in this study.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">forensic science</field><field name="subject">statistics</field><field name="subject">compositional data analysis</field><field name="subject">nephrite</field><field name="subject">geology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5567</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Feasibility investigation of cognitive radio systems</field><field name="creator">Chiang, Robin I-Chun</field><field name="description">Efficient use of the scarce radio spectrum is important for accommodating the rapid growth of wireless communications. This thesis investigates the feasibility of Cognitive Radio (CR) to exploit unoccupied frequencies for an enhanced spectral utilisation. CR refers to a wireless architecture that enables dynamic spectrum access, where unlicensed devices are allowed to operate in temporally/spatially unused licensed channels. Extensive spectral opportunities have been identified from an intensive measurement study, indicating that a significant gain in spectral utilisation may be brought by a CR technology. The main challenge for CR is a robust protection mechanism to guarantee an adequate Licensed Users (LU) system performance at all times. This requires a reliable spectrum sensing technique to accurately identify frequency opportunities; and an autonomous transmit power control algorithm that remains effective in severe fading environments. Cooperation among CR devices to assist the LU identification process is shown to be an imperative CR attribute for maximising the CR performance and the overall spectral utilisation. Cooperation is particularly important for a CR coexisting with a small-coverage LU system, in which an accurate LU detection mechanism is the predominant limiting factor of CR system performance. The consequences of insufficient CR collaborations are an expensive individual CR detector and a large CR-LU separation requirement, yielding a suboptimal gain in spectral utilisation. The effectiveness of cooperative detection largely depends on system application, channel characteristics, and CR detector sensitivity. The feasibility of CR is evaluated via a simulated CR model using the achievable CR system performance and the corresponding operational requirements as performance metrics. The fundamental limit of permissible CR transmit power has been derived from an interference constraint imposed on the CR operation. Assuming the LU accepts a minor performance degradation (an outage probability &lt; 5%), it has been shown that a low CR system outage (&lt; 5%) may be achieved while simultaneously providing a reliable LU identification rate (&gt; 99%) with the modest detector specifications commercially available. Above all the CR feasibility is strongly subject to the signal characteristics and the heterogeneous propagation conditions in the CR deployment scenario. An algorithmic approach is developed which demonstrates that a practical CR system independent of LU cooperation may be feasible.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5618</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthetic studies towards polyketide derived biologically active natural products</field><field name="creator">Heapy, Amanda</field><field name="description">The first part of this thesis describes the successful synthesis of the FG ring fragment 178 of the structurally complex marine toxins, the pectenotoxins. The synthesis hinges on functional group manipulations of the advanced olefin-(Z) 179 to install the tetrahydrofuran and tetrahydropyran ring systems. Olefin-(Z) 179 is itself obtained by the cis selective Wittig olefination of aldehyde 180 and the phosphorus ylide derived from phosphonium salt 181. Key stereocentres of these two fragments are installed using a Katsuki-Sharpless asymmetric epoxidation and a Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation reaction, respectively.

These compounds contain the small but interesting &#946;,&#947;-fused-[4.4]-spiroacetal-&#947;-lactone moiety which is a functional group found in seven known natural products, and has until recently eluded the synthetic chemist. A Fukuyama coupling reaction was initially proposed to prepare advanced precursor ketone 474 but proved to be unsuccessful in our hands. A variant of the original Fukuyama reaction was successfully employed to obtain the same advanced ketone 474 but low yielding reactions combined with the delicate nature of this structure posed an insurmountable bottleneck in the planned synthetic strategy.

However their use is dependent on surface oxides and hydroxides which are critical in protecting the highly reactive underlying metal. The stability and integrity of the oxides and hydroxides are also crucial in finishing and bonding applications. Better understanding of these surfaces has significant implications in enhancing their application. LM6 and LM25 aluminium-silicon casting alloys were studied as these materials show a particularly inhomogeneous phase structure and complex surface behaviour. This complexity is of fundamental interest and leads to considerable practical difficulties, especially in surface finishing. The surfaces were characterised, subjected to thermal treatments and modified with Ion Assisted Deposition coatings of TiN. A characterisation method for these surfaces was also developed based around the layered structure of aluminium hydroxides. It was observed that the thermally induced surface segregation of minor elements, such as Mg and Na, is availability-limited. Surface concentrations of these elements are determined by the net effect of enriching via surface segregation and depleting through surface evaporation. The inhomogeneous phase structure of the alloys used in this study enables the observation of two migration processes driven by different forces. Below the oxide dominated surface layer, the migration of Mg is driven by chemical potential gradient and is primarily perpendicular to the surface. Closer to the surface, concentration driven horizontal diffusion of the element occurs. The deposition of a thin TiN layer has been used to probe the interface. While the deposition conditions of TiN coatings affect the chemistry of the coatings, substrate surface conditions determine how well bonding is achieved between the film and substrate. The height difference between silicon particles in the eutectic phase and the primary aluminium phase of the casting alloys provides surface roughening and optimal adhesion through mechanical interlocking with the coating. This height difference is achieved by preferentially removing the surface exposed primary aluminium phases with ion bombardment.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5633</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Totara Valley micro-hydro development : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Applied Science in Renewable Energy Engineering, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Donnelly, David Ronald</field><field name="description">This study focuses on the design, construction and operation of a distributed generation system based on micro-hydro technology. The project is sited in the Totara Valley, a small rural community approximately 70km from the Massey University, Turitea campus, Palmerston North. The Massey University Centre for Energy Research (MUCER) has a long history of renewable energy research within the Totara Valley community. This project complements these existing schemes and provides a foundation for future research into distributed generation technologies. The project encompasses the following objectives: - to gain practical experience in the design, engineering and implementation of a distributed generation system in rural New Zealand; - to evaluate contemporary micro-hydro technology and compare the performance of this equipment in a theoretical and practical context; - to identify barriers that hinder the widespread adoption of micro-hydro systems in rural New Zealand; - to develop a spreadsheet based life cycle costing tool. The results from this study demonstrate that economic considerations are the fundamental aspect to be considered when assessing the long-term viability of these projects. The viability of micro-hydro projects are primarily determined by four factors: - the volume and head (height) of water available above the turbine site; - the length and therefore the cost of the pipeline required for transporting water to the turbine; - the legal and administrative costs involved in obtaining a resource consent to maintain access to the water resources; - the prices received and paid for electricity. Considerable charges were payable to the local authority to secure and maintain the right to harness the water resources at this site. This cost contributed considerable risk to the project and creates a significant barrier to establishing similar systems at other sites. The reduction of resource consent charges to levels that fairly reflect the negligible environmental impacts of these projects would encourage the adoption of this technology and deliver benefits to rural New Zealand communities.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">micro-hydro technology</field><field name="subject">distributed generation system</field><field name="subject">renewable energy</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">construction</field><field name="subject">viability</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291100 Environmental Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/695</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Polymerisation and export of alginate in Pseudomanas aeruginosa : functional assignment and catalytic mechanism of Alg8/44 : a thesis presented to Massey University in partial fulfilment of the requirement for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Microbiology</field><field name="creator">Remminghorst, Uwe</field><field name="description">Alginate biosynthesis is not only a major contributor to pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa but also an important factor in colonization of adverse environmental habitats by biofilm formation. The requirement of proteins Alg8 and Alg44, encoded by their respective genes in the alginate biosynthesis gene cluster, for alginate biosynthesis of P. aeruginosa was demonstrated, since deletion mutants were unable to produce or polymerise alginate. AlgX deletion mutants failed to produce the alginate characteristic mucoid phenotype, but showed low concentrations of uronic acid monomers in the culture supernatants. Complementation experiments using PCR based approaches were used to determine the complementing ORF and all deletion mutants could be complemented to at least wildtype levels by introducing a plasmid harbouring the respective gene. Increased copy numbers of Alg44 did not impact on the amount of alginate produced, whereas increased copy numbers of the alg8 gene led to an at least 10 fold stronger alginate production impacting on biofilm structure and stability. Topological analysis using reporter protein fusions and subsequent subcellular fractionation experiments revealed that Alg8 is located in the cytoplasmic membrane and contains at least 4 transmembrane helices, 3 of them at its C terminus. Its large cytosolic loop showed similarities to inverting glycosyltransferases and the similarities were used to generate a threading model using SpsA, a glycosyltransferase involved in spore coat formation of B. subtilis, as a template. Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed the importance of identified motifs commonly detected in glycosyltransferases. Inactivation of the DXD motif, which has been shown to be involved in nucleotide sugar binding, led to loss-offunction mutants of Alg8 and further replacements revealed putative candidates for the catalytic residue(s). Contradicting the commonly reported prediction of being a transmembrane protein, Alg44 was shown to be a periplasmic protein. The highest specific alkaline phosphatase activity of its fusion protein could be detected in the periplasmic fraction and not in the insoluble membrane fraction. Bioinformatical analysis of Alg44 revealed structural similarities of its N terminus to PilZ domains, shown to bind cyclic-di-GMP, and of its C terminus to MexA, a membrane fusion protein involved in multi-drug efflux systems. Thus, it was suggested that Alg44 has a regulatory role for alginate biosynthesis in bridging the periplasm and connecting outer and cytoplasmic membrane components. AlgX was shown to interact with MucD, a periplasmic serine protease or chaperone homologue, and is suggested to exert its impact on alginate production via MucD interaction. In vitro alginate polymerisation assays revealed that alginate production requires protein components of the outer and cytoplasmic membrane as well as the periplasm, and these data were used to construct a model describing a multi-enzyme, membrane and periplasm spanning complex for alginate polymerisation, modification and export.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pseudomonas aeruginosa</field><field name="subject">alginates</field><field name="subject">biosynthesis</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270300 Microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/735</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal : self-care processes among Thai people suffering from AIDS : a thesis presented in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Siriwatanamethanon, Jirapa</field><field name="description">AIDS is a chronic disease that seriously affects health, emotions, social relations and household economy. People living with HIV/AIDS experience great suffering, stigmatisation and discrimination from other people around them because they know that it is incurable, contagious, evokes social disgust and is a complex disease requiring life-long self-care. This researcher explored ways people with HIV/AIDS take care of their health and manage their lives in the context of stigma and discrimination. A grounded theory study was conducted with 30 participants with HIV/AIDS, in Mahasarakham Province, Thailand. Participants were recruited from an HIV/AIDS day care clinic and by snowball sampling. Data were gathered through in-depth interviews, participant observations and field notes made during home visits. Interviews were tape recorded, then transcribed verbatim. &#8220;From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal&#8221; was generated inductively from the data as the basic social psychological process of Thai people living with HIV/AIDS. From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal comprised four categories: being HIV/AIDS, making choices, keeping well and feeling empowered. The category &#8220;being HIV/AIDS&#8221;- discovering the meaning of having HIV/AIDS, comprises four concepts: being diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, being stigmatised, suffering, and learning about HIV/AIDS. The category &#8220;making choices&#8221;- to live a normal life, involves three concepts: avoiding unhappy situations, getting remarried and seeking support. The category &#8220;keeping well&#8221;- maintaining emotional and physical health, includes eight concepts: religious practices, keeping a cheerful mind, self-treatment, taking care of the body, keeping the environment clean to prevent getting germs, healthy behaviours, getting healthcare services, and attention to, and concern about, medication. The last category &#8220;feeling empowered&#8221;- personal and social acceptance of illness, includes eight concepts: being encouraged, acknowledging the disease, social acceptance, tamjai, feeling proud of self, feeling good about life, feeling lucky and having hope. In the context of northeastern Thailand, successful management of HIV/AIDS was underpinned by participants making a transition from &#8220;experiencing social disgust&#8221; to &#8220;passing as normal&#8221; within their communities. The desire to live a normal life despite having HIV/AIDS motivated participants to undertake effective self-care in order to remain symptom free (thus avoiding visible signs of the disease), and to selectively disclose their illness to avoid the ongoing risk of stigma and discrimination. The findings of this study are useful in that they will provide Thai health professionals with a clearer conceptualisation of self-care among the Thai population. An inductively derived theory of self-care among Thai with HIV/AIDS can be applied and integrated by health professionals into the self-care models for people living with HIV/AIDS including models used in nursing education, research and practice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">AIDS</field><field name="subject">Self-care</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">Stigma</field><field name="subject">Discrimination</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321100 Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/739</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of milk protein ingredients on physico-chemical properties of rice starch : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Food Technology at Massey University Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Noisuwan, Angkana</field><field name="description">The overall aim of this thesis is to determine if the interactions between normal and waxy rice starch and milk proteins from four milk protein ingredients, namely skim milk powder (SMP), milk protein concentrate (MPC), sodium caseinate (NaCAS) and whey protein isolate (WPI) do occur, and to identify the mechanisms underlying these interactions. Different milk protein ingredients at various concentrations (0 to 10%, w/w) affected markedly and differently the pasting behaviour of 10% (w/w) rice starches. SMP delayed the pasting of both rice starches by increasing the onset temperature (Tonset) and the peak viscosity temperature (Tpeak) of pasting. This was mainly due to the presence of lactose and ions, which was further supported by the investigation of the effects of UFSMP (a solution of salts and lactose present in SMP at their proper concentration) and lactose. The addition of NaCAS also delayed the pasting of rice starch; Tpeak in the case of both starches was increased. For normal rice starch paste, MPC and WPI decreased the Tpeak. MPC had no affect on Tpeak of waxy rice starch paste. The qualitative viscoelastic behaviour of rice starch/milk protein ingredient gels obtained from the above pastes was dominated by the continuous phase made of the starch molecules. There was evidence, as indicated by confocal microscopy, of phase separation between the milk proteins of SMP and MPC and the two starches. The phase separation was not observed in the addition of either NaCAS or WPI. Studies on the thermal behaviour of rice starch/milk protein ingredient mixtures by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed that SMP, similarly to UFSMP, delayed the gelatinization of both starches. NaCAS also delayed the gelatinisation of both starches but had a greater effect on waxy than normal rice starch. The addition of NaCAS did not affect Tonset but increased Tpeak for normal rice starch, whereas the gelatinisation temperature of waxy rice starch was highly affected by the addition of NaCAS with both Tonset and Tpeak shifted to higher temperatures. MPC had no affect on the gelatinization temperature of normal rice starch, whereas the gelatinization temperature of waxy rice starch was increased by the addition of MPC. The addition of WPI to both rice starches showed two thermal transitions. The first of these was due to the gelatinisation of the starches and the second to the denaturation of &#223;-lactoglobulin (&#223;-lg). The addition of WPI to normal rice starch showed that the thermal behaviour of normal starch and protein were independent from each other. In contrast, the thermal behaviour of waxy rice starch was modified by the addition of WPI; both Tonset and Tpeak were increased. SMP decreased the Tonset of swelling, swelling ratio and the amount of starch leaching from both starches. These observed changes were due to the presence of lactose and ions in SMP. NaCAS slightly increased Tonset of swelling but the amount of starch leaching was reduced for both rice starches. The rigidity of both starches tended to increase in the presence of NaCAS. MPC and WPI affected the swelling behaviour of normal and waxy rice starch differently. A dramatic increase in the swelling of normal rice starch/MPC or WPI mixtures was observed, whereas this trend was not evident for waxy rice starch/ MPC or WPI mixtures. The difference in the water holding ability and gelatinization peak temperatures of the two starches over the temperature range at which whey proteins denature and form gels are believed to be responsible for the observed differences. The results from confocal microscopy showed that milk proteins, such as a-casein, &#223;- casein, &#223;-lg and a-lactalbumin (a-la), were adsorbed onto the granule surface of both normal and waxy rice starch. The mechanism for this adsorption is the hydrophilic interactions; hydrogen bonds between hydroxyl group from terminated glucan molecule that protrude around starch granule surface-hydroxyl; amino, or other electron-donation or electron-accepting groups of the added proteins. Using sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) it was found that for SMP and MPC the adsorbed as- to &#223;-casein ratio on both starches was similar to the as-casein to &#223;- casein ratio in the casein micelle at low SMP and MPC concentrations. But at high concentrations of SMP or MPC, this ratio decreased indicating that more &#223;-casein was adsorbed preferentially to as-casein. In the case of NaCAS, as-casein was adsorbed preferentially to &#223;-casein. Moreover, there was evidence of multilayer adsorption of ascasein into the surface of rice starch granules. Compared to the other milk protein ingredients, very small amounts of the &#223;-lg and a-la from WPI were adsorbed onto starch granules. However, the adsorbed amounts of &#223;-lg and a-la from WPI continuously increased with increasing WPI concentration, suggesting that these two proteins, particularly &#223;-lg, adsorbed in multilayers too.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">waxy rice starch</field><field name="subject">lactoglobulin</field><field name="subject">gelatinazation</field><field name="subject">adsorption</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290104 Other food sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/905</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The tensions facing a board of trustee model within the cultural framework of kura kaupapa Maaori : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of Arts in Social Policy at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Stokes, Kanewa</field><field name="description">This study originated from personal experience, as a member of a Board of Trustee (BOT) within Kura Kaupapa Maaori (KKM). The workload required for Kura compliance with government regulation and legislation, was phenomenal. The BOT model seemed to be structured on a corporate model of governance with accountability to the Ministry of Education. This contradicted with the needs of Kura whaanau to be involved in Kura decisionmaking. The BOT model unintentionally created a separation and tension between whaanau and BOT members. This research set out to explore the BOT model of governance within our Kura, from a cultural perspective, rather, than researching problems identified by ERa. The research undertook a review of the literature that placed the BOT model within the 1984 -1990 Economic Reforms. It highlighted the impact of past government policies, and administration, on the Maaori language and culture to illuminate the cultural, economic, political and social context of the establishment of Kura Kaupapa Maaori and the doctrine of Te Aho Matua (TAM). The BOT model, and KKM/TAM, are founded on differing values. The study was approached from a Kaupapa Maaori perspective; not wishing to reaffirm the negative stigma of past research undertaken of Maaori. The objectives of the study were to gain an understanding of whaanau cultural capacity, perceptions and understanding of KKM and TAM; and also, whaanau understanding of the BOT model. The research design consisted of a case study. This involved a questionnaire to all whaanau; and in-depth discussions with a sample of twelve whaanau. Appropriate ethical considerations were given to the process, which addressed both academic and cultural needs. Findings clearly identify the structure, and nature of the BOT model, being problematic within the cultural framework of a KKM underpinned by Te Aho Matua. The values and principles between the model and TAM fundamentally conflict. Findings also identify key factors, that both government and Kura whaanau can utilise, in advancing whaanau governance.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">kura kaupapa Maori</field><field name="subject">school administration</field><field name="subject">school boards</field><field name="subject">boards of trustees</field><field name="subject">ethnic schools</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330104 Educational policy, administration and management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/910</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Who talks, what they talk about, and how much they say : a study of bulletin structure and source use in New Zealand free-to-air television news programmes : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Management in Communication Management, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Macdonald, Julie Susan</field><field name="description">Free-to-air television news is an accessible and popular means through which audiences can gain knowledge and understanding about the world. Therefore, the nature of the news provided has important implications for the opportunities audiences have to become informed about events and issues, and to use this knowledge to participate in social decision-making. The structure and content of news bulletins reflect the decisions made by broadcasters about the topics that are considered to be important, and which sources should have the opportunity to be represented. Thus, the goal of this research was to compare the structure and content of the news provided by New Zealand&#8217;s national free-to-air news programmes; ONE News (TVNZ), 3 News (TV3), Prime News (Prime Television), and Te K ea (M ori Television). A content analysis of one constructed week of the four news programmes was undertaken, focusing on four general areas of interest. First, the profile of the news bulletins was examined (i.e., the proportion of the bulletin allocated to different segments of the news, the duration of main news stories, the origin of production of main news stories, the proportion of New Zealand and international news, and the topics included in the news). Second, the research investigated the identity of the types of sources selected by the broadcasters for inclusion in locally produced main news stories. Third, the frequency and duration of &#233;lite and non-&#233;lite source speech was examined. Finally, the extent to which journalists speak on camera in news stories was also investigated. The study showed that the four programmes generally conformed to the &#8216;standard profile&#8217; of modern television news bulletins; the programmes included considerable amounts of non-news content and the news topics often reflected entertainment values, rather than focusing on serious issues. A further significant characteristic of the bulletins was that &#233;lite sources were more likely to be included in news stories on all programmes and generally had greater opportunities to speak. However, in many respects it appears that Te K ea provides an alternative news bulletin compared to the other three channels, by focusing on a wider range of news topics, including more non-&#233;lite sources in stories, and giving all sources considerably more time to share their views. Te K ea seems to broadcast a news programme that makes a compromise between the entertainment values which are entrenched in contemporary television news, and the broader M ori Television mandate to inform and educate the public. This contrasts with the more homogenous (in terms of the characteristics examined in this research) news programmes offered by the ONE News, 3 News, and Prime News. This study concludes that the nationally available free-to-air news programmes currently broadcast on New Zealand television fulfil the traditional news functions of informing and educating the public in only a very narrow sense. The deregulated news environment is poised to undergo further transformation with an anticipated increase in convergence among news media and the emergence of more television news providers. The challenge within this commercial environment is for ONE News, 3 News, Prime News, and Te K ea to deliver on their stated commitments to provide information and promote debate on the important issues of the day.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">news bulletins</field><field name="subject">journalism</field><field name="subject">public broadcasting</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/922</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rheo-NMR studies of macromolecules : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Physics at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Kakubayashi, Motoko</field><field name="description">In this thesis, the effects of simple shear flow on macromolecular structure and interactions are investigated in detail via a combination of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and rheology, namely Rheo-NMR. A specially designed NMR couette shear cell and benchtop shear cell, developed in-house, demonstrated that the direct measurement of the above phenomena is possible. First, to determine whether the shear cells were creating simple shear flow, results were reproduced from literature studies of liquid crystal systems which report shear effects on: Cetyl Trimethyl Ammonium Bromide (CTAB) in deuterium oxide, and Poly(gamma-benzyl-L-glutamate) (PBLG) in m-cresol. Next, the possible conformational changes to protein structure brought about by shear were investigated by applying shear to Bovine  -lactogobulin ( -Lg). As the protein was sheared, a small, irreversible conformational change was observed by means of one-dimensional and two-dimensional 1H NMR with reasonable reproducibility. However, no observable change was detected by means of light scattering. A large conformational change was observed after shearing a destabilized  -Lg sample containing 10% Trifluoroethanol (TFE) (v/v). From an NMR point of view, the sheared state was similar to the structure of  -Lg containing large amounts of  -helices and, interestingly, similar to the structure of  -Lg containing  -sheet amyloid fibrils. Gel electrophoresis tests suggested that the changes were caused by hydrophobic interactions. Unfortunately, this proved to be difficult to reproduce. The effect of shear on an inter-macromolecular interaction was investigated by applying shear during an enzyme reaction of pectin methylesterase (PME) on pectin. Experimental method and analysis developments are described in detail. It was observed that under the conditions studied, shear does not interfere with the de-esterification of pectin with two types of PME, which have different action mechanisms at average shear rates up to 1570 s-1.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">macromolecular structure</field><field name="subject">shear</field><field name="subject">pectin</field><field name="subject">protein interactions</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences::240300 Atomic and Molecular Physics; Nuclear and Particle Physics, Plasma Physics::240301 Atomic and molecular physics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/976</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Accelerating classifier training using AdaBoost within cascades of boosted ensembles : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Computer Sciences at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Susnjak, Teo</field><field name="description">This thesis seeks to address current problems encountered when training classifiers within the framework of cascades of boosted ensembles (CoBE). At present, a signifi- cant challenge facing this framework are inordinate classifier training runtimes. In some cases, it can take days or weeks (Viola and Jones, 2004; Verschae et al., 2008) to train a classifier. The protracted training runtimes are an obstacle to the wider use of this framework (Brubaker et al., 2006). They also hinder the process of producing effective object detection applications and make the testing of new theories and algorithms, as well as verifications of others research, a considerable challenge (McCane and Novins, 2003). An additional shortcoming of the CoBE framework is its limited ability to train clas- sifiers incrementally. Presently, the most reliable method of integrating new dataset in- formation into an existing classifier, is to re-train a classifier from beginning using the combined new and old datasets. This process is inefficient. It lacks scalability and dis- cards valuable information learned in previous training. To deal with these challenges, this thesis extends on the research by Barczak et al. (2008), and presents alternative CoBE frameworks for training classifiers. The alterna- tive frameworks reduce training runtimes by an order of magnitude over common CoBE frameworks and introduce additional tractability to the process. They achieve this, while preserving the generalization ability of their classifiers. This research also introduces a new framework for incrementally training CoBE clas- sifiers and shows how this can be done without re-training classifiers from beginning. However, the incremental framework for CoBEs has some limitations. Although it is able to improve the positive detection rates of existing classifiers, currently it is unable to lower their false detection rates.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">CoBE framework</field><field name="subject">classifiers</field><field name="subject">classification algorithms</field><field name="subject">machine learning</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280200 Artificial Intelligence and Signal and Image Processing::280212 Neural networks, genetic algorithms and fuzzy logic</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1002</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Personality assessment and ethnicity : a New Zealand study : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Psychology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand.

To date there has only been two published studies that have used New Zealand relevant ethnic groups when analysing whether personality measures used in pre-employment settings exhibit different mean scores. The present thesis performed a systematic evaluation on the impact of ethnicity on personality traits. The study examined the impact of ethnicity on NZ Army Officer applicant personality assessment scores measured by the EPQ-R and GPP-I. Four ethnic groups (NZ Europeans, M&#226;ori, Pasifika, and Asian) were analysed for mean trait score differences among ethnic groups, the stability of these differences across different personality inventories and models, the variance of personality traits, the impact of ethnicity on age and gender relationships with personality traits, and how these differences were related to employment selection outcomes. The analyses revealed that ethnicity did have some impact on mean personality assessment scores used in the study. However, these were mostly small differences among ethnic groups. In addition, most of these differences found on the EPQ-R and the GPP-I were not consistent across inventories and models. There were no significant variance differences found on personality traits among ethnic groups. While initial analysis suggested that ethnicity did not influence the relationship between age and gender on personality assessment, further examination suggested that the relationship between gender and personality was impacted on by ethnicity. There were reassuring results found for New Zealand psychologists and HR specialists, as only two of the twelve traits analysed showed moderate differences on traits that were related to selection outcomes. However, for the NZ Army OSB selection process the findings in the present study indicate that the Lie scale on the EPQ-R and the Vigor trait on the GPP-I may need to be interpreted with caution for Asian and Pasifika groups. These results are discussed in terms of implications for personality theory, measurement, and the direction of future research.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">personality assessment</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised</field><field name="subject">EPQ-R</field><field name="subject">Gordon Personal Profile - Inventory</field><field name="subject">GPP-I</field><field name="subject">ethnic status</field><field name="subject">ethnicity</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380104 Personality, abilities and assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1188</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Networking for gold : a multi-level analysis to explain network organising dynamics : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Marketing at Massey University, Albany Campus, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Martin, Simon Geoffrey</field><field name="description">The primary aim of this research is to understand how the multiple levels within networks influence the organising dynamics in an intentionally formed network through the measurement of tie strength. This is a significant contribution because previous research is based on network studies in which only one level is considered, most of the research is conceptually undeveloped in the area. The research also addresses the measurement of the strength of relationships rather than just their existence or non-existence. Furthermore, this study examines intentionally created networks &#8211; an area where there is currently very little research. Thus the study is significant because the new data contributes to the marketing research environment and can be presented to examine findings in other research contexts, including the social policy and not-for-profit sectors. To address the aim and context of the study it was necessary to understand a national programme which had global objectives. The research involved a multi-method approach that utilised a single case-study strategy with multiple embedded cases consisting of three interdependent, intentionally formed networks, each with a central broker, in the elite and high-performance sport sector in New Zealand. The overall contributions of the research were: (1) The identification of a new network type, termed here as a structured network. (2) The finding that networks that are intentionally created and managed can be durable and effective, and this is dependent on the role of the central broker. This finding has obvious implications for practitioners involved in such networks and for governments that are interested in creating them. (3) The finding that cross-level pressures influence network effectiveness. (4) The finding that relationships developed at the pre-network formation stage contribute to network effectiveness. (5) And finally, the identification of a new stage of intentional network formation. This stage was taken by the New Zealand government issuing a tender in order to gauge the level of interest and the resources available to provide a network of services before establishing it.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">networking</field><field name="subject">organisational behaviour</field><field name="subject">sport sector</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1249</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Protein interactions at the human topoisomerase II[alpha] promoter : a thesis presented to Massey University in partial fulfilment of the requirement for the degree Doctor of Philosophy in Biochemistry</field><field name="creator">Magan, Natisha</field><field name="description">Among women in the 45 to 64 age group, over half of the recorded deaths are from cancer, breast cancer being the most common. Just over 30% off all deaths in New Zealand women is caused by breast cancer. Treatment of cancer is difficult, not only due to the physiological and immunological similarities between a cancer cell and a normal cell, but also due to the high cardiotoxicity of many treatments, and also the problems related with the development of resistance. Approximately 40% of the cancer cells treated with the chemotherapy drug doxorubicin will become resistant to treatment. Drug efficacy is strongly associated with the proliferation status of a cell, as cancer cells divide rapidly, this can often be the defining factor between effective treatments or the development of resistance. Central to this proliferation status is an enzyme known as topoisomerase IIa. This essential enzyme is expressed in all cells and is required to relieve the torsional stress in DNA that is created during normal cellular processes. A number of commonly used anti-cancer drugs have been found to target topoisomerase IIa in cancer cells and significantly, during the development of drug resistance levels of topoisomerase IIa enzyme have been found to be reduced in some cell lines and tumours. There are a number of factors that can modulate the amount of topoisomerase IIa enzyme found in a cell, and one of the ways to understand this is to examine the regulation of the topoisomerase IIa gene, most importantly the proteins that interact with the promoter region to direct transcription. The human topoisomerase IIa promoter has been found to be regulated by a number of transcription factors that can bind to their cognate sequences. The introduction of mutations within specific sequences of the topoisomerase IIa promoter has enabled the identification of a key regulatory region within the promoter, a sequence of DNA that encompasses both the ICB1 and GC1 regulatory elements. Transcription factor NF-Y is found to bind to ICB1 element, whereas transcription factors Sp1 and Sp3 have been found to associate with the GC element. However this region of the promoter was also found to bind a fourth uncharacterised component. This research aims to further define the protein components that are found to bind to this important ICB1/GC1 regulatory region and distinguish the protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions that are important for the regulation of the human topoisomerase IIa promoter.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Human topoisomerase II&#945; promoter</field><field name="subject">Human topoisomerase IIalpha promotoer</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1292</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Acoustic wave and bond rupture based biosensor-- principle and development : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Hirst, Evan</field><field name="description">Bond rupture is an experimental methodology that is used to augment a conventional mass balance biosensor. A good point-of-care biosensor is fast, reliable, simple, cost-effective, and detects low concentrations of the target analyte. Biosensor development is a multidisciplinary field and bond rupture testing is of technical interest to many groups. The Bond rupture methodology endows a mass probe with the ability to discern bond strength. The recognition of specific bonds by mass loading is separated from erroneous non-specific binding by a probe of the force between the analyte and the transducer. Bond rupture is achieved by acoustic excitation of the point of attachment. The force is incremented gradually until rupture occurs. The advancement of bond rupture biosensors beyond the lab requires improved understanding of the mechanisms of bond rupture by base excitation, the transducers, and the supporting hardware. Bond rupture has traditionally been used in conjunction with the Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM). There exists, however, a variety of sensors and transducers to which the bond rupture methodology could be applied. The time, cost and experience required for comprehensive investigation of all avenues is prohibitive. To further the development of bond rupture characteristic experiments are designed and carried out on the QCM platform. Numerical simulations are constructed which model the current bond rupture approach. This work is limited to the simulation of bond rupture by base excitation. From the results of the experimental investigation a number of improvements to the bond rupture technique are proposed. Improvements are tested by simulation and the Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) device is selected to advance the bond rupture craft. A prototype SAW bond rupture device is designed. The prototype device is manufactured and tested, confirming the principle of SAW bond rupture. Future work is required to progress the SAW bond rupture methodology before possible integration with other sensor systems. Because of this work, and the evaluation of the SAW bond rupture prototype, much is learned about the advancement of SAW device bond rupture.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Surface acoustic wave (SAW)</field><field name="subject">Bond rupture biosensors</field><field name="subject">Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM)</field><field name="subject">Simulation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291500 Biomedical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1291</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An application of Malmquist productivity index to compare technological and growth differences between traditional and non-traditional dairy regions in New Zealand : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of PhD in Agribusiness at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Laca-Vina, Hector</field><field name="description">The NZ dairy industry has adopted an encompassing measure of performance, total factor productivity (TFP), as a target measure to guide on-farm improvements. Dairy farmers pay a levy in order to fund agricultural research and extension. Extension services and R&amp;D will continue to be of critical importance to maintain and improve productivity at the farm level. Consequently, it is in the best interest of the dairy industry to adequately target R&amp;D and extension funds and make the best use of resources. To date, the methodology employed to estimate productivity growth has some shortcomings that seriously hamper the ability of potential users to extract useful information from it. First, productivity growth has been reported as an aggregate for the entire dairy industry. Second, it makes no assumption about the efficiency with which resources are being used. Third, it implicitly assumes that all farms face the same technology. Productivity growth can be achieved either through better (more efficient) use of the technology applied, through the adoption of a new technology (technical progress) or a combination of both. Given that the sources of productivity change&#8212;technical progress and technical efficiency change&#8212;are fundamentally different phenomena, they are, in turn, influenced by different factors. This distinction is important for policy orientation because different instruments/tools may be required to address them. Furthermore, empirical evidence suggests that a variety of farming systems have emerged as a result of dairy farming geographical expansion. Farm-level panel data were used to estimate the Malmquist productivity change index. This index can provide additional insights since it can be decomposed into two additional components, one that measures changes in technical efficiency (i.e., whether firms are getting closer to the production frontier over time), and one that measures changes in technology (i.e., whether the production frontier is moving outwards over time). Hence, it provides individual (farm) estimates of TFP. Moreover, the methodology applied allows to test whether farms in the two regions considered in this study are operating under the sametechnology. These two regions were the long-established dairy areas of Waikato-Taranaki and the newly developed dairy areas of Canterbury-Southland. Results for farms in Waikato-Taranaki indicate that annual TFP change is modest, ranging from 0.29% per annum to 0.59% per annum. Most importantly, technical progress is the only source of TFP change in all four models. Therefore, it is necessary to encourage investments in new R&amp;D targeted to remove the technological constraints that impede the realisation of further productivity gains in the regions. However, important differences in the estimates of TFP, technical progress and change in technical efficiency between models were found for farms in Canterbury-Southland. Estimates of TFP change ranged from 0.7% per annum to 2.8% per annum. Even though technical progress and change in technical efficiency contributed to total factor productivity growth (TFPG), the latter component was the most important contributor in three of the four models. Moreover, in two models the rate of technical progress was negative (i.e., technical regress). The analyses indicate that dairy farms in Canterbury-Southland were on average 10% more productive than farms in Waikato-Taranaki when farms in both regions faced the frontier. These results were consistent for all the input/output set chosen. Furthermore, the null hypothesis that the two regions do not face the same production technology (i.e., each region has it own production frontier) was accepted irrespective of the input/output set chosen. The rejection of the null hypothesis, that farms in traditional and non-traditional dairy regions were operating under the same underlying technology (and hence face the same production frontier), called for a review of the traditional approach to R&amp;D in one central experimental station, strengthening the need for a local approach through the promotion of networks and synergies with universities and other research institutions.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand dairy industry productivity</field><field name="subject">Malmquist productivity index</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300400 Animal Production</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1290</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ecological modernisation of industry : developing multi-disciplinary research in organization &amp; environment.</field><field name="creator">Orssato, Renato J.</field><field name="description">This thesis develops suitable approaches to conduct environment-related research in organisations, as well as systematic means for understanding the emergent phenomenon of ecological modernisation in industrialised societies. The study is organised in two distinct parts: While Part I deals with environment-related theories and practices in (and around) modern organisations, Part II situates such theories and practices in an analysis of the context of the European automobile industry. The research problem is defined through several stages. The research questions driving Part I are premised on the exploratory nature of the study, developed in an unfolding interplay between the review of the literature, the collection of secondary and (exploratory) primary data, and the analysis and interpretation of the data. As the initial question is answered by reviewing the literature and interpreting the primary and secondary data, another question arises from the process, which then requires further research. Part II of the study departs from a proposition based on ecological modernisation theory, that pro-active environmental practices in corporations are part of a broader emergent sociological phenomenon, typical of modern industrialised societies. It analyses a specific socio-technical context that, hypothetically, is undergoing such process - that of the European automobile industry. Hence, the development of Part II aims at answering the following principal research question: Why is the European automobile industry undergoing ecological modernisation? Analytically, the concept of automobile field is proposed to establish a link between the product (automobile) and the context embedding its systems of production and consumption (field). The exploratory character of the study implied that the most adequate research procedures were of a qualitative nature. A combination of grounded theory and reflexive methodology is used to orientate the overall research process, which introduces a novel approach for the triangulation of qualitative data. Together, the chapters forming Part II of the thesis answer the principal research question. The fundamental technologies of the current technological regime of the automobile, as well as the economic and environmental implications of this regime are analysed. Then, an analysis of selected pilot programs to develop and commercialise electric vehicles, as well as schemes for the management of end-of-life vehicles in the Western European context is developed. Through the interplay between data collection and analysis, the thesis designs an analytical framework, built upon contingent factors, as well as circuits of political ecology, that foster or inhibit ecological modernisation in the automobile field. The study showed that the auto industry has developed incremental technological innovations and practices that resemble the pre-requisites for ecological modernisation. Radical innovations, however, are more likely to be initiated by outsiders. The concepts inherited from the past and reproduced in the present practice of car design explains such a situation as one that imposes a specific set of technologies on car manufacturing that require high levels of investment in systems of production. Such design paradigm not only imposes high break-even points for most car models; they also result in vehicles with extremely low environmental performance and entail serious limitations for increasing recycling rates of non-metallic parts. The characteristics of ecological modernisation in the European automobile industry are used to evaluate whether this phenomenon is conducive to sustainable industrial development. As an implication of this analysis, the concluding chapter presents suggestions for the enhancement of ecological modernisation theory. Fallibility is proposed as both a source of reflection about the appropriation of knowledge and a principle that can be used for the definition of eco-modernising strategies and actions. The acceptance of fallibility as an immanent characteristic of human action is critical for the approximation of the countervailing theories of ecological modernisation and risk society. Finally, if ecological modernisation is expected to facilitate sustainable industrial development, radical technological innovations may be necessary. Such radicalism in technology may need, however, an incremental institutional reform of modern societies. Together, radical technological innovations and incremental institutional reform constitute the concept of radical reformism, which is suggested for enhancement of the ecological modernisation theory, as well as for the development of its normative programmes.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Automotive industry.</field><field name="subject">Sustainability.</field><field name="subject">Industrial ecology.</field><field name="subject">Electric vehicles.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The anisminic revolution in Australia : the reception of the doctrine of extended jurisdictional error in Australia.</field><field name="creator">Ellis-Jones, Ian</field><field name="description">University of Technology, Sydney.

D.</field><field name="description">The wide, unstable, braided riverbeds of the eastern South Island, New Zealand, have been inhabited by a diverse avifauna. Several species including the wrybill breed only on these rivers. Use is restricted mainly to the breeding season from September to December, so this was the critical study period. Previous, behaviourally oriented studies have occurred mainly in the high country catchments where habitat modification is slight. However, substantial bird numbers also occur on lowland riverbeds. These areas are subject to existing or planned water developments which may have negative impacts on the conservation of these habitats and bird species. The principal goal of this study was to add to the information necessary to conserve lowland riverbed habitat within multiple use planning strategies. Specific objectives associated with assessing breeding and feeding requirements were therefore hydrologically oriented.  Study areas were chosen on the lower Rakaia and lower Ashley rivers. Both are braided but have markedly different flow regimes. The Rakaia is snowfed and has peak flows occurring during the breeding season. The Ashley is primarily rainfed and has a declining breeding season flow regime. Wrybills, black-fronted terns, banded dotterels, South Island pied oystercatchers, and pied stilts breed in these areas. The first two of these were selected as indicator species. It was assumed that because of their restricted habitat needs, flow requirements recommended to meet their needs would also meet those of most other species. Banded dotterels were also studied because of their close taxonomic relationship and overlapping distribution with wrybills. South Island pied oystercatchers and pied stilts were chosen to check the validity of the approach.  Breeding, nest site requirements, microhabitat preferences for foraging, diets, home ranges and food supply were studied. Wrybill time-budgets were examined, and the incremental approach to impact assessment was applied to wrybill foraging needs.  Breeding success for all species was dependent on the flow regime. In 1982 wrybill fledging success was moderate on the Rakaia, whereas in 1983 it was very low. Conversely, in both years fledging success was very high on the Ashley. This variability resulted from serious flooding on the Rakaia in 1983 which effected all species. Wrybills have nest site characteristics most closely approximating a habitat specialist, while the other species should be considered habitat generalists. Nests are generally close to water, near minor braids, and on non-vegetated shingle substrates. On average there is a higher chance of nests being flooded on the Rakaia than on the Ashley where predation is more likely to reduce nesting success. Vegetation encroachment threatens nest site provision and floods are presently the only natural regular of exotic plants such as lupin.  Banded dotterel home ranges were significantly smaller than wrybills, and on an intra-specific basis were smaller on the Ashley. A correlation existed between home range size and habitat quality, so that small wrybill home ranges were dominated by the occurrence of productive minor braids, and larger ones by less productive major channels.  Time-budgets provided further insights into the influence of hydrological factors on wrybill ecology. Wrybill time-budgets appear to be inflexible because a high proportion of time is devoted to foraging, with relatively little time available for other activities. Resource depression on the Rakaia in 1983 lessened the chances for wrybills to breed successfully because sufficient food could not be gathered to provide for breeding energy needs. This did not occur on the Ashley River where flows were generally more stable. From a management viewpoint, development strategies which lead to greater flow fluctuations will have a detrimental impact on wrybills.  The foraging patterns for all species except black-fronted terns were examined. There was a general preference for aquatic habitats, particularly those associated with minor braids and disconnected pools. Depth and substrate use were studied in detail for wrybills and banded dotterels. Wrybills displayed consistent use patterns between rivers, which reflected specialisation in habitat use. Banded dotterel habitat use varied considerably. Diet was studied by faecal analysis. Both wrybills and banded dotterels fed on invertebrates of aquatic and terrestrial origin. For wrybills it was noticeable that Ephemeroptera larvae did not dominate the diet as had previously been reported for high country catchments. Coleoptera, Hemiptera, and Ephemeroptera were important on the Rakaia with Trichoptera replacing Ephemeroptera larvae on the Ashley. Banded dotterels were more reliant on Coleoptera and Hemiptera on both rivers. Pitfall trapping results showed that terrestrial invertebrate availability was dependent on the proximity of water. Fewer floods on the Ashley led to a more consistent food supply on that river. This helps explain the greater bird density on this river. Severe flooding in 1983 appeared to seriously depress aquatic invertebrate densities on the Rakaia.  The incremental approach to impact assessment was applied to wrybill foraging requirements. Depth, substrate, and water velocity preferences were included within a weighted usable area model already developed for fisheries use on the Rakaia River. Over the range of median to low flows studied, weighted usable area increased with declining discharge. A simplified usable width approach was applied to a highly braided section of the Ashley River. Here, usable width declined with falling discharges. This inter-basin difference could be explained with reference to the braiding pattern of each river. The main study objectives were achieved, but the indicator species management approach was of limited value in areas other than nest site requirements. Pied stilts and South Island pied oystercatchers fed at greater depths than wrybills, and often used different microhabitats. However, for foraging, wrybills need appeared adequate indicators of banded dotterel requirements.</field><field name="date">1985</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Canterbury</field><field name="subject">braided riverbeds</field><field name="subject">birds</field><field name="subject">hydrology</field><field name="subject">breeding</field><field name="subject">feeding</field><field name="subject">home ranges</field><field name="subject">time-budgets</field><field name="subject">habitat requirements</field><field name="subject">impact assessment</field><field name="subject">management</field><field name="subject">Ashley River</field><field name="subject">Rakaia River</field><field name="subject">Wrybill</field><field name="subject">riverbeds</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270703 Terrestrial ecology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1639</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A social history of women and cycling in late-nineteenth century New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Simpson, Clare S.</field><field name="description">In the final decade of the nineteenth-century, when New Zealand women began riding the bicycle, they excited intense public debate about contemporary middle-class ideals of femininity. The research question posed is: "why did women's cycling provoke such a strong outcry?"  Three nineteenth-century cycling magazines, the New Zealand Wheelman, the New Zealand Cyclist, and the New Zealand Cyclists' Touring Club Gazette, were examined, along with numerous New Zealand and British contemporary sources on women's sport and recreation, etiquette, femininity, and gender roles. The context of the late-nineteenth century signifies a high point in the modernisation of Western capitalist societies, which is characterised in part by significant and widespread change in the roles of middle-class women. The bicycle was a product of modern ideas, designs, and technology, and eventually came to symbolise freedom in diverse ways. The dual-purpose nature of the bicycle (i.e., as a mode of transport and as a recreational tool) enabled women to become more physically and geographically mobile, as well as to pursue new directions in leisure. It afforded, moreover, increasing opportunities to meet and socialise with a wider range of male acquaintances, free from the restrictions of etiquette and the requirements of chaperonage. As a symbol of the 'New Woman', the bicycle graphically represented a threat to the proprieties governing the behaviour and movements of respectable middle-class women in public. The debates which arose in response to women's cycling focused on their conduct, their appearance, and the effects of cycling on their physical and moral well-being. Ultimately, these debates highlighted competing definitions of nineteenth-century middle-class femininity. Cycling presented two dilemmas for respectable women: how could they cycle and retain their respectability? and, should a respectable woman risk damaging herself, physically and morally, for such a capricious activity as cycling? Cyclists aspired to reconcile the ignominy of their conspicuousness on the bicycle with the social imperative to maintain an impression of middleclass respectability in public.  The conceptual framework of Erving Goffman's dramaturgical perspective is used to interpret the nature of heterosocial interactions between cyclists and their audiences. Nineteenth-century feminine propriety involved a set of performances, with both performers (cyclists) and audiences (onlookers) possessing shared understandings of how signals (impressions) ought to be given and received. Women on bicycles endeavoured to manage the impressions they gave off by carefully attending to their appearances and their behaviour, so that the audience would be persuaded to view them as respectable, despite the perception that riding a bicycle in public was risqu&#233;. In this way, women on bicycles attempted to redefine middle-class femininity. Women on bicycles became a highly visible, everyday symbol of the realities of modem life that challenged traditional gender roles and nineteenth-century formality. Cycling for New Zealand women in the 1890s thus played a key part in the transformation of nineteenth-century gender roles.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bicycle</field><field name="subject">conspicuousness</field><field name="subject">etiquette</field><field name="subject">femininity</field><field name="subject">gender</field><field name="subject">Goffman</field><field name="subject">heterosociability</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">modernisation</field><field name="subject">New Woman</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">performance</field><field name="subject">propriety</field><field name="subject">public</field><field name="subject">recreation</field><field name="subject">role</field><field name="subject">sport</field><field name="subject">transport</field><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370100 Sociology::370104 Urban sociology and community studies</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::430000 History and Archaeology::430100 Historical Studies::430101 History: New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350400 Transportation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1693</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Shadows of another dimension: a bridge between mathematician and artist</field><field name="creator">Humphreys, Janelle Robyn</field><field name="description">The fundamental idea that provides a pathway through this exegesis is the M&#246;bius strip.  It is examined in relation to the mathematical influences on my art practice and consequently identified in the work of the Australian Modernists.  The other key link is the &#8220;bridge.&#8221;  The aim is to &#8220;bridge the gap&#8221; between my roles as artist and mathematician through an analysis of the making process of my painting and sculptures.  Further, I establish a visual link between the Sydney Harbour Bridge, the M&#246;bius strip and Australian modernist paintings.The M&#246;bius strip is introduced as a model for the paintings of William Robinson, contemporary Australian landscape painter.  The M&#246;bius strip is further established as a three-dimensional cross-section of the four-dimensional Klein bottle.  It is the discussion of the similarities between shadows, cross-sections, and projections in relation to my practice which facilitates the understanding of the link between the M&#246;bius strip and the fourth dimension. My art practice is examined in relation to several mathematical properties including space-time sequences, systems of rules, non-Euclidean grids, transformations and the topology of the M&#246;bius strip.  Of particular importance in this analysis is the idea of the projection from one dimension to another and the associated connection to the properties of the M&#246;bius strip.  The relationship between the Sydney Harbour Bridge imagery and the M&#246;bius imagery is the final link forging the connection between the Australian Modernists and the M&#246;bius strip.  The M&#246;bius strip trope is identified in several modernist Australian paintings including paintings of the Sydney Harbour Bridge.  Subsequently, the influence of the fourth dimension and non-Euclidean geometry on Australian Modernism filtering through from the northern hemisphere is established.  The understanding of the relationship between the M&#246;bius strip and the fourth dimension gleaned from my art practice was instrumental in detecting this mathematical influence on the Australian Modernists.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3079</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of antipsychotic drugs on the expression of neurotransmitter receptors in the rat brain</field><field name="creator">Han, Mei</field><field name="description">Currently, the control of schizophrenia symptoms is primarily through pharmacological intervention. However, antipsychotics can cause several side effects, such as extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and body weight gain/obesity, which severely affect patient compliance to continue with medication. In addition, due to the effects of antipsychotics on neurotransmission, it is unclear whether central pathological changes observed in post-mortem tissue in schizophrenia are the real pathology of the disease or are a result of the effects of antipsychotic drugs. The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms of the pharmacological efficacy and side-effects of antipsychotic drugs. To achieve this aim, this study examined the expression of dopamine D2, histamine H1, serotonin 5HT1A and muscarinic M1 receptors in the rat brain following short-term (1 week) and long-term (12 weeks) treatment with aripiprazole, olanzapine and haloperidol.Aripiprazole and haloperidol both have a high affinity for dopamine D2 receptors, however aripiprazole has a lower risk of EPS than haloperidol. The aim of Chapter 2 was to understand the mechanism underlying why aripiprazole, unlike haloperidol, has a therapeutic effect but does not induce significant EPS. Results showed that aripiprazole selectively increased D2 receptor mRNA expression and decreased tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA expression (TH; a rate-limiting enzyme for the synthesis of dopamine) in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), but not the substantia nigra (SN). Aripiprazole also decreased dopamine transporter (DAT) binding density in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and VTA. Consistent with previous findings, haloperidol significantly increased D2 receptor binding density, but decreased DAT binding density in the NAc, CPu and VTA. Olanzapine had less widespread effects on D2 receptor expression and DAT binding density. These results suggest that aripiprazole may control schizophrenia symptoms through a novel mechanism: that is, by selectively reducing dopamine synthesis in the VTA but not SN. This may contribute to the long-term efficacy of aripiprazole in controlling schizophrenia symptoms with reduced EPS.It has been previously reported that aripiprazole and olanzapine increased dopamine release in the prefrontal cortex via the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor, which may partially explain why these drugs can improve the negative symptoms and cognitive functional deficits associated with schizophrenia. It is interesting that aripiprazole has a high affinity for 5-HT1A receptors, but olanzapine has not. Therefore, the aim of Chapter 3 was to examine whether these antipsychotics affect 5-HT1A receptor expression. The results showed that aripiprazole increased 5-HT1A binding density in the CA1 region of the hippocampus and medial posterodorsal nuclei of the posterior amygdala (MeP), while olanzapine down- regulated the binding density of 5-HT1A receptors in the cingulate cortex. However, these changes were not apparent after 12 weeks of drug treatment. This study suggests that aripiprazole and olanzapine have different effects on the binding density of 5-HT1A receptors. The results indicate that aripiprazole and olanzapine have differential effects on 5-HT1A protein expression, which may contribute to their distinct profiles in improving negative symptoms and cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. However, they may induce adaptation and desensitisation in serotonin 5-HT1A receptor expression after long-term treatment.Schizophrenia patients exhibit a decrease, or no change, in muscarinc M1 receptor expression in certain brain regions. Olanzapine has a high affinity for the M1 receptor, while aripiprazole and haloperidol have low affinities. The aim of Chapter 4 was to investigate how these antipsychotics affect M1 receptor mRNA expression in regions of the brain that are implicated in the pathology of schizophrenia. This study showed that the three antipsychotics increased M1 receptor mRNA expression in the hippocampus. In addition, increases in M1 receptor mRNA expression were also observed in the SN following treatment with haloperidol and olanzapine, and in the NAc following treatment with aripiprazole. These results suggest that alterations of M1 receptor mRNA expression in schizophrenia are unlikely to be a consequence of drug treatment, and implicate the muscarinic M1 receptor as a contributor to the therapeutic effects of schizophrenia treatments.The aim of Chapter 5 was to investigate whether the body weight gain/obesity side-effect of olanzapine was produced by regulating histamine H1 receptor expression. To the best of this author&#8217;s knowledge, this study is the first to compare H1 receptor expression in the rat brain following short and long-term administration of olanzapine, aripiprazole and haloperidol. Results showed that olanzapine significantly down-regulated H1 receptor mRNA expression and binding density in the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH), and H1 receptor mRNA expression in the arcuate hypothalamic nucleus (Arc). Consistent with their low risk of weight gain/obesity side-effect, aripiprazole and haloperidol had no effect on H1 receptor expression in the VMH or Arc. Histamine H1 receptor mRNA expression in the VMH and Arc were negatively correlated to body weight gain and energy efficiency, while H1 receptor mRNA expression in the Arc showed negative correlations to food intake and total fat mass. In addition, there was a negative relationship between H1 receptor binding densities in the VMH and total fat mass and body weight gain. This study suggests that an olanzapine-induced down-regulation of histamine H1 receptor expression in regions of hypothalamus involved in the regulation of food intake (the Arc and VMH) may be a key factor contributing to olanzapine-induced body weight gain/obesity.In conclusion, this study revealed that the effects of antipsychotics on specific neurotransmitter receptors contribute to the mechanisms of their pharmacological efficacy and side-effects. The binding profiles of antipsychotics for specific receptors cannot completely predict the level of their therapeutic efficacies and side-effects. Furthermore, the changes in expression of some receptors (such as 5- HT1A) by antipsychotic treatment may produce the adaptation and desensitisation after long-term use. These results have also provided significant information which may assist with the development of new antipsychotic drugs.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3078</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modeling and characterization of multipath fading channels in cellular mobile communication systems</field><field name="creator">Khan, Noor Muhammad, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Due to the enormous capacity and performance gains associated with the use of antenna arrays in wireless multi-input multi-output (MIMO) communication links, it is inevitable that these technologies will become an integral part of future systems. In order to assess the potential of such beam-oriented technologies, direct representation of the dispersion of multipath fading channel in angular and temporal domains is required. This representation can only be achieved with the use of spatial channel models. This thesis thus focuses on the issue of spatial channel modeling for cellular systems and on its use in the characteri- zation of multipath fading channels. The results of this thesis are presented mainly in five parts: a) modeling of scattering mechanisms, b) derivation of the closed-form expressions for the spatio-temporal characteristics, c) generalization of the quantitative measure of angular spread, d) investigation of the effect of mobile motion on the spatio-temporal characteris- tics, and e) characterization of fast fading channel and its use in the signature sequence adaptation for direct sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) system. The thesis begins with an overview of the fundamentals of spatial channel modeling with regards to the specifics of cellular environments. Previous modeling approaches are dis- cussed intensively and a generalized spatial channel model, the 'Eccentro-Scattering Model' is proposed. Using this model, closed-form mathematical expressions for the distributions of angle and time of multipath arrival are derived. These theoretical results for the picocell, microcell and macrocell environments, when compared with previous models and available measurements, are found to be realistic and generic. In macrocell environment, the model incorporates the effect of distant scattering structures in addition to the local ones. Since the angular spread is a key factor of the second order statistics of fading processes in wireless communications, the thesis proposes a novel generalized method of quantifying the angular spread of the multipath power distribution. The proposed method provides almost all parameters about the angular spread, which can be further used for calculating more accurate spatial correlations and other statistics of multipath fading channels. The degree of accuracy in such correlation calculations can lead to the computation of exact separation distances among array elements required for maximizing capacity in MIMO systems or diversity antennas. The proposed method is also helpful in finding the exact standard deviation of the truncated angular distributions and angular data acquired in measurement campaigns. This thesis also indicates the significance of the effects of angular distribution truncation on the angular spread. Due to the importance of angular spread in the fading statistics, it is proposed as the goodness-of-fit measure in measurement campaigns. In this regard, comparisons of some notable azimuthal models with the measurement results are shown. The effect of mobile motion on the spatial and temporal characteristics of the channel is also discussed. Three mobile motion scenarios are presented, which can be considered to be responsible for the variations of the spatio-temporal statistical parameters of the multipath signals. Two different cases are also identified, when the terrain and clutter of the mobile surroundings have an additional effect on the temporal spread of the channel during mobile motion. The effect of increasing mobile-base separation on the angular and temporal spreads is elaborated in detail. The proposed theoretical results in spatial characteristics can be extended to characterizing and tracking transient behavior of Doppler spread in time-varying fast fading channels; likewise the proposed theoretical results in temporal characteristics can be utilized in designing efficient equalizers for combating inter-symbol interference (ISI) in time-varying frequency-selective fading channels. In the last part of the thesis, a linear state-space model is developed for signature sequence adaptation over time-varying fast fading channels in DS-CDMA systems. A decision directed adaptive algorithm, based on the proposed state-space model and Kalman filter, is presented. The algorithm outperforms the gradient-based algorithms in tracking the received distorted signature sequence over time-varying fast fading channels. Simulation results are presented which show that the performance of a linear adaptive receiver can be improved significantly with signature tracking on high Doppler spreads in DS-CDMA systems.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mobile communication systems</field><field name="subject">Wireless communication systems</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26999</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Engineering geology of the Patonga Claystone, Central Coast, New South Wales, with particular reference to slaking behaviour</field><field name="creator">Nunt-jaruwong, Sorawit, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">The Patonga Claystone, a red bed facies in the Narrabeen Group of the Sydney Basin, is one of the most unfavorable rock units in the basin from a geotechnical point of view. This rock unit is composed of sandstone, siltstone, mudstone and claystone. One of the unfavorable characteristics is the low shear strength, which causes instability of cut slopes; another is its slaking-prone behaviour. Numerous measurements of geotechnical properties, along with extensive mineralogical and geochemical determinations, were carried out to identify cause of this slaking behaviour. Key techniques were the use of quantitative X-ray diffractometry for mineralogical analysis, and the determination of slake durability index and related properties to evaluate the slaking behaviour under both standard and more extended conditions. Standard (two cycle) slake durability test results indicate a range from low to high slake durability index values, with some mudstone samples having very low durability and some sandstones having very high slake durability indices. Jar slake test results indicate that the rock samples break rapidly and/or develop several fractures (Ij = 4) in an as-received state, but degrade to a pile of flakes or mud (Ij = 1) if the samples are oven dried before testing. The results for jar slake testing of oven-dried material are comparable, for individual samples, to those obtained from the more comprehensive slake durability tests. The mineralogy of the samples was evaluated by quantitative X-ray diffraction techniques using the Rietveld-based Siroquant processing system. Comparison to independent chemical data show a generally good level of agreement, suggesting that the mineralogical analysis  results are consistent with the chemical composition of the individual rock samples. Good correlations were also obtained between clay mineralogy determined from orientedaggregate XRD analysis of the &amp;lt2 micron fraction and the results from powder diffractometry and Siroquant analysis of the whole-rock samples. Evaluation of the slake durability characteristics and other geotechnical properties in relation to the quantitative mineralogy suggests that quartz and feldspar form a rigid framework in the rocks that resists the disruptive pressures that cause slaking. Expansion of the clay minerals by various processes, including the incorporation of water into the interlayer spaces of illite/smectite as well as changes in pore pressures associated with entry of water into micro-fractures in the clay matrix, are thought to produce the disruptions that cause slaking and degradation. An abundant clay matrix also reduces the strength of the rock materials, probably because of the less rigid nature of the clay minerals relative to the quartz and feldspar particles. As well as the mineralogy, the loss on ignition (LOI) and water absorption percentage were found to provide good indicators of longer-term slaking behaviour. Both properties are also related to the overall clay content. Rock samples with water absorption values of &amp;lt10, 10-15 and &amp;gt15% behave as highly durable, intermediate and less durable materials respectively. Rocks with LOI values of greater than 5% by weight behave as less durable rock materials, at least for the strata encompassed by the present study. The water absorption and LOI values were also used to develop a predictive model of slake durability characteristics for the different rock materials in the Patonga Claystone, providing a relatively simple basis for predicting longer-term stability in a range of geotechnical studies.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Engineering geology -- New South Wales -- Sydney Basin</field><field name="subject">Tonsteins</field><field name="subject">Sandstone -- New South Wales -- Sydney Basin</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27335</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of a validated falls risk assessment for use in clinical practice</field><field name="creator">Tiedemann, Anne, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Falls risk factor assessment is the first step in the development of appropriate intervention strategies for the prevention of falls. However, few multifactorial, validated falls risk assessments exist which are suitable for use in busy clinical settings. This project aimed to develop a reliable and valid falls risk assessment that was feasible for use in various clinical settings. The QuickScreen Clinical Falls Risk Assessment was developed and evaluated via four methods; a) the test-retest reliability of the measures was assessed with 30 community-dwelling older people, b) the concurrent validity of the measures was assessed by comparison with performance in the Physiological Profile Assessment, c) the predictive validity of the measures was assessed by comparison of performance with prospective falls in two studies involving large samples of community dwelling older people and d) the feasibility of the assessment was evaluated with 40 clinicians who trialled the assessment with their patients. The QuickScreen clinical falls risk assessment consists of eight measures, including previous falls, total medications, psychoactive medications, visual acuity, touch sensation, the sit to stand test, the near tandem stand test and the alternate step test. The test-retest reliability of the assessment measures was acceptable (intraclass correlation coefficients ranged from 0.56 to 0.89) and the assessment measures discriminated between multiple fallers and non-multiple fallers with relative risk values ranging from 1.4 to 2.5. The clinicians that trialled the assessment reported that it was quick and easy to administer and that it assisted in the management of their elderly patients. These results show that the QuickScreen Clinical Falls Risk Assessment has proven validity, test-retest reliability and is practical for use in a variety of clinical settings.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Falls (Accidents) in old age</field><field name="subject">Prevention</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27255</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Telepathy in contemporary, conceptual and performance art</field><field name="creator">Drinkall, Jacquelene Ashley, School of Art History &amp; Theory, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the impact of telepathy and psi on conceptual and performance art from 1968. Emerging from the author???s art practice, the thesis argues telepathy is a key leitmotif and creative concern within much post 60s art, and has become central to the practice of a number of contemporary video, performance and new media artists. This thesis is composed of two interrelated parts: an exhibition of the artwork by the author concerning telepathic processes, and a written project which uses the major themes of the exhibition to frame an historical study of a number of key contemporary artists whom, it is argued, work with telepathy. These artists, Jane and Louise Wilson, Suzanne Treister and Susan Hiller are discussed under the themes of ???twinning and doubling,??? ???technological mediums??? and ???telepathy experiments???. These themes also overlap in the authors artwork, are introduced through an overarching analysis of the work of performance artist Marina Abramovi?? and philosopher Jacques Derrida who, it is argued, provide a new model of telepathy as an art practice. In addition, the thesis argues that telepathy is an often suppressed thematic in art which may not appear to directly address it, and uses the work on the Wilsons, Treister and Hiller to re-look at other 20th Century artists and artistic themes in the light of the conclusions it draws on telepathy and art. Walter Benjamin greatly admired the Surrealists, but had virtually no time for their interest in telepathy, hypnosis and psi. Together with positive materialist misappropriations of Adorno???s Thesis Against Occultism, artistic and theoretical work with telepathy and psi has been sidelined from other important themes in art and critical theory, all of which telepathy and psi illuminate, energise and empower. The art of the author and other more recognised and established artists can be seen to work with telepathy in ways that flow into and reinforce the grain of progressive leftist practice and aesthetics. Women???s work with telepathy should be considered as important as women???s work with sexuality. Women, sexuality, Otherness, liminality, spirituality, telepathy, trauma, healing, radical politics, and other taboo areas of patriachal codes, were adandoned by macho participants of fluxus and Conceptual art. The recent conceptual and performance tilt in contemporary art sheds new light on the problem of working within and developing an effective and dynamic lineage of telepathy in post 60s art as well as early modern art movements. Contemporary developments in science, engineering, biology, psychoanalysis, warfare, popular culture and sociology show the wider relevance of discourse on telepathy. There is much at stake for visual art, aesthetics and visuality in representing, celebrating and interrogating the theme of psi and telepathy in current practice and art history. Artists??? work with telepathy and psi, although not always explicitly psychological, political or aesthetic, is often very psychologically, politically and aesthetically effective.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">telepathy</field><field name="subject">modern art</field><field name="subject">performance art</field><field name="subject">conceptual art</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31097</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating factors that influence carbon dissolution from Coke into Molten iron.</field><field name="creator">Cham, S. Tsuey, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The need for more efficient blast furnaces is even greater now that there are stricter environmental regulations on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Coke within the blast furnace not only supports the furnace bed and allows gas flow, it also carburises liquid iron. The carburisation of iron is one of the most important reactions and must be better understood if the ironmaking process in the blast furnace is to be made more sustainable. By understanding what coke properties influence the rate at which coke dissolves in iron we can predict a coke?s performance and use it to determine its quality.  As carbon dissolution rates have only been determined for a few cokes, a systematic and comprehensive study was conducted on the dissolution of carbon from nine Australian cokes into liquid iron. The kinetics of carbon dissolution from Cokes A to I was measured and a range of experimental techniques were used to elucidate the dominant rate influencing factors. The role of coke structure, coke inorganic matter composition and yield and temperature were investigated. Furthermore, the influence of interfacial products and dynamic wettability studies were also conducted.  The carburiser cover method was used to measure carbon pick-up as a function of time over the temperature range of 1450-1550 ??C. Fundamental data on the apparent carbon dissolution rate constant (K) in molten iron at 1550 ??C for Cokes A to I were obtained and ranged from K (x 103 s-1) = 0.47 to K (x 103 s-1) = 14.7. The wide variation in K showed that not all cokes dissolve at similar rates. In fact one of the nine cokes in this investigation dissolved at a rate comparable to graphite dissolution rates.  The apparent carbon dissolution activation energy, Ea, for two of the nine cokes plus synthetic graphite (SG) was also determined. The Ea obtained for SG (Ea = 54 kJ / mol) was in agreement with literature values and was consistent with a diffusion controlled mechanism. The observed Ea values for Cokes D and F (313 kJ / mol and 479 kJ / mol respectively) are an order of magnitude larger than the Ea obtained for SG. The difference in Ea between cokes and SG does not appear to be solely due to differences in the structure of the carbon source. The difference in Ea between the cokes was attributed to differences in their inorganic matter composition. The interfacial contact area is a function of inorganic matter yield and composition, which in turn is a function of temperature. Therefore, as temperature decreases the slag / ash layer produced at the carbon / iron interface can increase in area and viscosity and thus hinder carbon dissolution and transfer, and increasing the apparent activation energy for carbon dissolution. Thus, the differences in viscosity and melting temperature of the interfacial product play a key role.  Wettability experiments were carried out using the sessile drop technique. The wettability of Cokes D, F and G with liquid iron at 1550 ??C was measured as a function of time. All three coke samples showed non-wetting behaviour with contact angles ranging between 123-129?? in the initial stages and between 109-114?? after two hours of contact. The differences in the wettability of the three coke samples could not explain the large differences in dissolution rates observed between these cokes. Thus, the wettability of these coke samples was not considered a dominant factor in influencing the rate of carbon dissolution.  The sessile drop technique was also used to study the interfacial products formed at the coke / iron interface. The interfacial products formed on the underside of the iron droplet after contact with Cokes F and G were initially different in regards to the morphology and chemical composition. The interfacial product formed with Coke G had a network or mesh like structure that seemed to wet the iron droplet much better than the interfacial product formed with Coke F. In contrast, Fe globules and discrete interfacial products were observed in Coke F. It was suggested that this was due to differences in inorganic matter content, especially in calcium (Ca) and sulfur (S) content in the coke.  Formation of interfacial products containing sulfides, such as calcium sulfide (CaS) and manganese sulfide (MnS), were observed on the iron side of the interface of both Cokes F and G. As a result, the interfacial products can act as a physical barrier blocking iron and coke contact, thus reducing the contact area for carbon dissolution and decreasing the rate of carbon dissolution. The presence of MnS may act to lower the liquidus temperature of the interfacial product, which in turn can affect the overall viscosity of the interfacial layer. Thus, the deposition of reaction products at the interfacial region can have a significant effect on carbon dissolution rates.  The mineral pyrrhotite was also identified as a significant factor in influencing the rate of carbon dissolution. Electron dispersive X-ray analyses of Coke F identified iron to be in close association with sulfur. These Fe / S species have atomic ratio similar to pyrrhotite (Fe1-xS) or troilite (FeS). Pyrrhotite in coke can decompose to release gaseous sulfur and metallic iron, which can be carburised by carbon in the surrounding area to form Fe-C particles. Thus, carburisation of liquid iron can occur via Fe-C particles.  There was little difference in structure between the nine coke samples and therefore the high dissolution rates of Coke F, cannot be explained on the basis of crystallite size or anisotropic carbon content. Inorganic matter yield and composition were identified as the dominant rate influencing factors on carbon dissolution. More specifically: - High content of iron phases, such as iron oxides and pyrrhotite, can lead to an increase in carbon dissolution rates. This maybe due to increased amounts of Fe-C particles that are formed upon the reduction of magnetite and decomposition of pyrrhotite, and carried through the slag layer to carburise the bulk liquid iron. - High aluminium oxide content can lead to a decrease in carbon dissolution rates. This maybe due to higher ash fusion / melting temperature or decrease in wettability, both of which lead to a decrease in carbon / iron contact area. - Formation of interfacial products, such as CaS and MnS, can lead to a decrease in carbon dissolution rates. Such products can act as a physical barrier blocking iron and coke contact, thus reducing the contact area for carbon dissolution. However, the presence of MnS may act to lower the liquidus temperature of the interfacial product. - An increase in temperature increases the rate of carbon dissolution. This dependence is predominantly due to the composition of the inorganic matter present in cokes, which influences the viscosity and melting point of the interfacial product formed and hence contact area between coke and iron.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Liquid iron.</field><field name="subject">Coke -- Carbonization.</field><field name="subject">Carbon.</field><field name="subject">Wetting.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40685</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Equivocal empire: British community development in Central Africa, 1945-55</field><field name="creator">Kark, Daniel, History &amp; Philosophy, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis resituates the Community Development programme as the key social intervention attempted by the British Colonial Office in Africa in the late 1940s and early 1950s. A preference for planning, growing confidence in metropolitan intervention, and the gradualist determination of Fabian socialist politicians and experts resulted in a programme that stressed modernity, progressive individualism, initiative, cooperative communities and a new type of responsible citizenship. Eventual self-rule would be well-served by this new contract between colonial administrations and African citizens.  The thesis focuses on the implementation of the Mass Education programme in Nyasaland, and, more specifically, on a small but significant Mass Education scheme at Domasi, that operated between 1949 and 1954 in Nyasaland??s south. The political and social context in which the Mass Education scheme was implemented in Nyasaland is important. The approach taken by the government of the Protectorate before the mid-1940s is discussed, and previous welfare interventions described and critically assessed. The initial approach to Mass Education in Nyasaland is also dwelt upon in some detail. The narrative concentrates upon the scheme itself. Three themes emerge and are discussed successively ?? the provision of social services adapted to the perceived needs of Africans, the enforcement of environmental restrictions and inappropriate social and agricultural models, and the attempted introduction of representative local government. All three interventions were intended to promote the precepts of Mass Education, but instead resulted in the extension of state administrative power. The manner in which this occurred is explored throughout the thesis.  Mass Education at Domasi did not result in the creation of a new form of citizenship in Nyasaland. It contributed instead to a breakdown in the narrative of social development and eventual self-rule that had legitimised British rule. The riots that occurred in 1953 tore at the precepts that underpinned the Mass Education programme. The immediacy of self-rule and independence resulted in a shift in emphasis within the Colonial Office and the colonial government in Nyasaland from social intervention and to constitutional reform and political development. There simultaneously emerged a new rural transcript, one that privileged open opposition to the colonial social prescription over subtle and hidden rural resistance. At a time when nationalist politics was in disarray in Nyasaland, rural Africans spoke back to colonial power.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">British Africa</field><field name="subject">Mass Education</field><field name="subject">Community Development</field><field name="subject">colonial</field><field name="subject">malawi</field><field name="subject">Community development -- Africa</field><field name="subject">Great Britain -- Social policy</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41225</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of systematic increase in pozzolanic materials on the mechanical, durability, and microstructural characteristics of concrete</field><field name="creator">Ahmed, Mohammad Sharfuddin, Aerospace, Civil &amp; Mechanical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">The use of high performance concrete in construction has been enhanced by the use of pozzolanic materials. However, the use of these materials has not been optimized. Such optimization may be achieved by a systematic increase in the amount and combination of pozzolanic material additions, with accompanying studies of their effects on the mechanical, durability and microstructural characteristics of blended concrete. This work evaluated various concrete durability issues by studying systematic increases of pozzolanic materials such as fly ash and blast furnace slag (BFS) in the range of 25, 50 and 70%, and silica fume at 10% of total cementitious materials, forming various binary and ternary concrete blends. The concrete specimens were cured for a period of seven days after demoulding in line with widely practiced commercial curing procedures. The research explored the role and effectiveness of various binary and ternary blends of pozzolanic materials on the mechanical, durability and microstructural characteristics of concrete. Durability was evaluated by two independent rapid chloride permeability tests measured as charge passed and chloride conductivity from the RCPT and UCT tests respectively. These two rapid tests were coupled with long-term ponding tests to evaluate chloride ingress and the extent of corrosion for a period of two years. Further durability tests such as carbonation, drying shrinkage and porosity of these blends were also undertaken. This study also utilized micro-analytical techniques such as X-ray diffraction and Scanning Electron Microscopy to follow the hydration mechanism in various binary and ternary blends. Statistical significance testing was used to analyse and confirm all experimental results and conclusions. It is well known that a level of caution is exercised in the construction industry in the use of ternary blends. This study aims to evaluate the durability aspects of ternary concrete blends, in addition to binary blends, for resistance to chloride, corrosion, carbonation attacks and provide recommendations relating to the limits of blending level, as well as exposure conditions for blended concretes, based on the results of this study. It is expected that this will fill a major knowledge gap observed in the concrete industry. A comparison of two rapid chloride permeability tests such as UCT and RCPT indicates that the UCT test is easy and practicable, and does not contradict results obtained in the standard RCPT. However, the statistical significance of results obtained for some blends was only able to be established by using the RCPT. This effect can be attributed to the larger size specimens compared to UCT. The recommended blend to acquire both early-age and long-term strength development in fly ash is the ternary blends comprising 10% silica fume and 25% fly ash cast using lower w/b ratio. In addition, the same blend exhibited lower carbonation depth, lower charge passed from RCPT, lower chloride ingress and higher corrosion resistance characteristics from long-term ponding test compared to other blends of fly ash. In BFS blends, an increase in compressive strength was observed only in the specimens of 25% BFS compared to other higher percentage blends, while the higher addition of 50 and 70% replacement showed no significant difference in compressive strength between them and their corresponding ternary blends with addition of silica fume. The results of this study indicate that control (OPC) specimens cast with increased w/b ratio of 0.48 showed higher chloride ingress compared to both binary blends of 70% fly ash and 70% BFS specimens. This indicates that (OPC) cast using higher w/b ratio is to be avoided in chloride environments. On the other hand, though, the ternary blends of 10% silica fume and up to 50% fly ash exhibited lower chloride ingress compared to their respective binary blends of fly ash. However, these ternary blends exhibited lower compressive strength, more negative corrosion potential and higher corrosion rate, compared to the respective binary blends of 25% fly ash and its ternary blends. Therefore, the recommended blend observed in the long-term ponding test is the ternary blend of 25% fly ash and 10% silica fume. The recommended level of corrosion resistance in slag specimens is achieved by the use of ternary blends comprising silica fume at 10% added to the blend that contains up to 70% slag. However, the recommended level of slag for a lower carbonation effect is the use of a ternary blend comprising 50% slag and 10% silica fume (3B5S1) which showed a carbonation depth of 10.8 mm and a compressive strength of 53.2 MPa after 365 days of exposure. The drying shrinkage of concrete increased with the increase in fly ash and the same trend was observed in BFS specimens. However, the results were not significantly different between their respective blends. The extent of carbonation in fly ash specimens was higher compared to BFS blends specimens. This can be attributed to the formation of dusty and weak surfaces on the outer surface in addition to the excessive leaching of sodium chloride solution from the long-term ponding test in the former specimens compared to later. The high volume pozzolanic materials, irrespective of fly ash or BFS and addition of silica fume (70% fly ash and 10% silica fume, and 70% BFS and 10% silica fume), showed higher cumulative pore volume indicating that these blends with seven days of curing were not beneficial. These high volume ternary blends required prolonged curing to release portlandite from the hydration of cement to continue the pozzolanic reaction. This study has shown that 7-days curing of the pozzolanic concrete is inadequate if pozzolanic activity is to be invoked. This is particularly the case when it is expected that the concrete is likely to be subjected to a harsher than usual environment characterised by a dry atmosphere.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">concert</field><field name="subject">durability</field><field name="subject">additives</field><field name="subject">pozzolanic</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38645</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Unnatural production of natural products: Heterologous expression and combinatorial biosynthesis of cyanobacterial-derived compounds</field><field name="creator">Roberts, Alexandra Anne, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Cyanobacteria produce a myriad of structurally unique secondary metabolites with useful bioactive properties. Heterologous expression of a variety of microbial natural compounds has been used to harness their diversity and facilitate their combinatorial biosynthesis. However, these genetic techniques have not been developed for secondary metabolite-producing cyanobacteria. Therefore the genetically manipulable Escherichia coli and Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 were engineered in order to develop effective heterologous hosts and promoters for the expression of cyanobacterial-derived compounds. The phosphopanthetheinyl transferase (PPT), Sppt, from Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 was characterised to determine its ability to activate carrier proteins from secondary metabolite pathways. Despite in silico evidence which suggested Sppt was able to activate a wide range of carrier proteins, biochemical analysis revealed that it is dedicated for fatty acid synthesis. Consequently, E. coli and Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 were engineered to encode a broad-range PPT, from the filamentous cyanobacteria Nodularia spumigena NSOR10, for the activation of carrier proteins from nonribosomal peptide synthesis. Cyanobacterial natural product engineering was also explored with the characterisation of two relaxed specificity adenylation domains (A-domains) from the biosynthetic pathway of the toxin microcystin. The wide variety of microcystin compounds produced by cyanobacterial species suggests that multiple amino acids can be activated by the same A-domain. This was supported by preliminary ATP-[32P]PPi exchange assays and was subsequently harnessed in the production of a variety of dipeptides using two reconstituted modules in vitro. Transposition was investigated as a potential mechanism for the transfer of nonribosomal peptide synthetase gene clusters to heterologous hosts. This was performed via the characterisation of the putative transposase, Mat, physically linked with the microcystin synthetase gene cluster (mcyS). PCR screening, in silico analysis and nitrocellulose filter binding assays indicated that this transposase may have mediated mcyS gene cluster rearrangements but not entire gene cluster mobilisation between species. The potential role of transposases in the natural combinatorial biosynthesis of microcystin has evolutionary implications for the dynamic nature of cyanobacterial genomes and applications for use in the engineering of novel bioactive compounds. Therefore, the results from this study may provide a biotechnological platform for the transfer, expression and combinatorial biosynthesis of novel cyanobacterial-derived natural products.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Phosphopantetheinyl transferase</field><field name="subject">Cyanobacteria</field><field name="subject">Transposase</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41533</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Markers of nutritional assessment in children with gastrointestinal illnesses</field><field name="creator">Aurangzeb, Brekhna, Women's &amp; Children's Health, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Abstract  Nutritional status affects every aspect of a child?s health. Thorough nutritional assessment is hampered by the lack of a single comprehensive tool, which can cover all aspects of nutritional assessment. In three distinct studies, this thesis investigated the nutritional status of hospitalised children, children with coeliac disease and children with inflammatory bowel disease. Study 1 The objectives of this study were to assess prevalence of malnutrition and nutritional risk, and define demographic and anthropometric factors associated with nutritional risk among hospitalized children. In this cross sectional study, 157 hospitalised children were assessed for nutritional status using nutritional risk score (NRS) and anthropometric measurements. We found that 4.5%, 8.9%, 15.1% and 10.4% children were wasted, stunted, overweight and obese respectively. However, with the NRS, 47.8% of the children were at high nutritional risk. These children at high risk had lower weight for age (p=0.02), lower BMI percentiles for age (p=0.001) and longer hospitalization (p=0.001) than children at no risk. Study 2 The objectives of this study were to determine nutritional parameters in children with coeliac disease. Twenty-five children with coeliac disease and an equal number of age and gender matched controls were enrolled and anthropometric measurements, BIA and leptin levels were analysed in all. No significant differences were found between the children with coeliac disease and controls in these parameters. BMI percentile correlated with leptin levels in children with coeliac disease. Study 3 The objectives of this study were to determine anthropometric parameters and leptin levels in children with IBD and ascertain if BMI correlates with leptin levels in these children. Thirty children with IBD and 60 age and gender matched controls were enrolled. Anthropometric measurements and leptin levels were analysed and compared with controls. IBD children had significantly low weight for age (p=0.002), BMI percentiles (p=0.001) and leptin levels (p=0.009) compared to controls. There was a correlation between BMI and leptin levels in IBD children. In conclusion, this thesis has shown that one quarter of hospitalized children were overweight or obese, and further, that half of the hospitalised children were at high risk of nutritional deterioration and these children had longer hospital stay than children at no risk. Children with coeliac disease had similar anthropometric measurements, body compartments and leptin levels to controls. However, children with IBD had lower anthropometric measurements and leptin levels, indicating under-nutrition. Nutritional assessment should be a mandatory part of clinical management with nutritional status assessed by various tools including NRS, anthropometry, BIA and leptin levels.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nutritional assessment.</field><field name="subject">Nutritional risk scores.</field><field name="subject">Bioelectrical impedance analysis.</field><field name="subject">Serum leptin.</field><field name="subject">Anthropometry.</field><field name="subject">Coeliac disease.</field><field name="subject">Inflammatory bowel disease.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41109</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ecology of the quokka (Setonix brachyurus) (Macropodidae: Marsupialia) in the Northern Jarrah Forest of Australia</field><field name="creator">Hayward, Matt, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The quokka (Setonix brachyurus Quoy &amp; Gaimard 1830) is a medium-sized, macropodid marsupial that is endemic to the mesic, south-western corner of Australia.  While being a tourist icon on Rottnest Island, the species is threatened with extinction.  It has been intensively studied on Rottnest Island in the 1960s and 1970s, however very little is known of its ecology on the mainland.  Additionally the insular and mainland environments are extremely different suggesting that ecological differences between the two populations are likely.  Consequently, this study sought to determine the basic autecology of the quokka and identify what factors have attributed to its threatened conservation status.  The northern jarrah forest of Western Australia was selected as the study region due to it being at the northern limit of extant quokka distribution and because it was thought that the factors threatening the quokka would be exacerbated there. Fossil deposits suggest that the quokka originally occupied an area of approximately 49,000 km2 in the south-western corner of Australia.  Historical literature show that they were widespread and abundant when Europeans colonised the region in 1829 but a noticeable and dramatic decline occurred a century later.  The arrival of the red fox to the region coincided almost exactly with this decline and so it was probably ultimately responsible.  Continued predation by both it and the feral cat are likely to have continued the decline, along with habitat destruction and modification through altered fire regimes.  Specific surveys and literature searches show that since the 1950s, the area occupied by the quokka has declined by 45% and since 1990 by 29%.  Based on the criteria of the IUCN (Hilton-Taylor 2000), the conservation status of the quokka should remain as vulnerable.  An endangered status may be more applicable if the quokkas restriction to patches through its existence as a metapopulation is considered. Trapping of eight sites supporting quokka populations in the mid-1990s revealed three sites now locally extinct despite the ongoing, six year old, fox control programme.  Another three are at serious risk of extinction.  Extant population sizes ranged from one to 36 and population density ranged from 0.07 to 4.3 individuals per hectare.  This is considered to be below the carrying capacity of each site. The overall quokka population size in the northern jarrah forest may be as low as 150 adult individuals, of which half are likely to be female.  Even the largest extant populations are highly susceptible to stochastic extinction events.  This small size was surprising considering the six year old, introduced predator control programme. Historically, the restriction to discrete habitat patches, the occasional inter-patch movement, the lack of correlation between the dynamics of each population and reports of frequent localised extinctions and colonisations suggest that the quokka population once existed as part of a classic metapopulation.  The massive decline of the quokka in the 1930s pushed the metapopulation structure into a non-equilibrium state such that today, the extant populations are the terminal remnants of the original classic metapopulation. Wild mainland quokkas breed throughout the year.  A significant reduction in the number of births occurs over summer and this coincides with a decline in female body weight.  Despite this, the mainland quokka is relatively fecund and is able to wean two offspring per year.  The level of recruitment from pouch young to independence was low and this may explain the apparent lack of population increase following the initiation of fox control.  A total of 56 trapped quokkas were fitted with a radio collar.  Mean home range size for quokkas was 6.39 ha with a core range of 1.21 ha and this was negatively related to population density.  Male home ranges were larger than females but not significantly when the sexual size dimorphism was considered.  Nocturnal ranges were larger than diurnal ranges reflecting nocturnal departures from the swamp refugia.  Home range sizes varied seasonally, probably due to changes in the distance required to move to obtain sufficient nutrients and water over the dry summer compared to the wet winter and spring.  Telemetry confirmed trapping results that showed no movement between swamps or populations.  Home range centres shifted to the periphery of the swamp following the winter inundation and this may increase the species susceptibility to predation.  The lack of dispersal is probably caused by quokka populations existing below carrying capacity and following selection for philopatry under the threat of predation for dispersing individuals.  Without dispersal to recolonise or rescue unpopulated patches, the collapse of the original quokka metapopulation appears to have occurred.  On a macrohabitat scale, the quokka in the northern jarrah forest is restricted to Agonis swamp shrubland habitats that form in the open, upper reaches of creek systems on the western side of the forest.  This restriction was probably initially due to the high water requirements of the quokka but is likely to have been exacerbated by increased predation pressure since the arrival of the fox.  On a microhabitat scale, the quokka is a habitat specialist, preferring early seral stage swamp habitats, probably for foraging, as part of a mosaic of old age swamp that provides refuge. Despite the six year old, introduced predator control programme, foxes and cats are still the major cause of mortality to quokkas.  Road kills was the other identifiable cause.  Individuals alive at the start of the study had an 81% chance of staying alive until the end.  The likelihood of dying was minimised by grouping together with conspecifics, maximising home range size and maximising the time spent within the swampy refuge.  Current rates of adult and juvenile survivorship should allow population recovery and so it seems pouch young mortality, reflected by low recruitment, has inhibited the anticipated population increase following predator control. The confounding effect of inadequate unbaited controls meant that little statistical evidence was available on the impact of introduced predators on the quokka, however the models provided support for earlier hypotheses of these.  The presence of a quokka population at a site was related to the amount of poison baits delivered ??? reflecting predation pressure, the average age of the swamp and a mosaic of early and late seral stages within the swamp habitat.  Recently burnt habitat is thought to provide food for quokkas and long unburnt habitat provides refuge from predation.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ecology</field><field name="subject">Northern Jarrah Forest Reserve</field><field name="subject">quokka</field><field name="subject">Setonix brachyurus</field><field name="subject">Macropodidae</field><field name="subject">Marsupialia</field><field name="subject">Western Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/18768</field></doc><doc><field name="title">States of unrest: photography and trauma</field><field name="creator">Peterson, Tanya, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">States of Unrest: Photography and Trauma is an interdisciplinary study of the dialectic between photography and trauma.

The study explores trauma??s mnemonic processes and symptoms and their structural similarities to photography??s modes of registration and representation. The framework of the study is developed through a close reading of three different manifestations of war-related images as a way of considering the language, circulation, and impact of traumatic images. It considers this field, firstly, in terms of the function of domestic photography produced during the time of World War II; secondly, in relation to photographic documentation of the Vietnam War; and thirdly, through imagery made in response to the ongoing war in Afghanistan. It examines the relationship between photography and trauma in terms of theories of absence and presence, ultimately arguing in favour of a model of understanding based on a surplus economy of meaning, as opposed to a framing of absence.

The geoid can be computed from gravity values measured over the surface of the earth, and considerable effort continues to achieve a global coverage of gravity values. One technique that has been very successful in recent years in providing gravity coverage in areas which previously have been too difficult to access is airborne gravimetry. This technique has proved very useful in covering near offshore regions, for example. The coastal regions of Australia are recognised as locations where airborne gravimetry has the potential to fill in missing gravity data. A pilot survey using an airborne gravity meter was undertaken off the north east coast of Australia. In areas that remain unsurveyed it is sometimes useful to fill in the missing gravity data values with predicted gravity values. Previous research has examined the possibility of predicting gravity values from other observed quantities. The best success has been achieved by using the gravity effect calculated from bathymetric information. Often the corresponding isostatic compensation is computed, and the combined bathymetric-isostatic gravity effect is used. However, the type and extent of compensation that exists in any particular region mostly remains unknown. Theoretical considerations indicate that the short wavelength part of the gravity field may be adequately modelled by the gravity effect of the bathymetry alone, without reference to an assumed compensation mechanism. With this in mind, a prediction scheme has been developed which utilises the short wavelength gravity field information implied by the bathymetry, combined with the long wavelength gravity field information from existing observed gravity. This scheme allows the prediction of ???fill-in??? gravity values in areas with limited observed gravity. The prediction technique was used on a test set of data off the east coast of Greenland. The prediction technique was seen to outperform a simple interpolation of gravity values by approximately ten percent. Geoid computations performed with the predicted gravity values indicate that the prediction technique can provide significant improvements in computed geoids.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gravity</field><field name="subject">measurement</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22481</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating the effectiveness of Australian aid to Samoa</field><field name="creator">Hamblin, William John, School of Sociology, UNSW</field><field name="description">On a global basis over A$450 billion is invested each year in foreign direct investment and aid with a view to supporting development. Developing countries themselves allocate significant sums out of their own budgets in order to stimulate development. Development is concomitantly a major goal and enterprise of the global economy. Developed countries through aid (Official Development Assistance) spend large sums purportedly to improve the development status of developing countries. Recently voices from within the developed world???s establishment have derided the performance of aid and by default the performance of state organisations charged with managing aid delivery. Australia has not been immune from this criticism. Its aid program while modest by global standards still consumes A$1.5 billion in taxpayers money each year. Australian aid is delivered primarily by the Australian International Aid Agency (AusAID) with smaller contributions through the Department of Foreign Affairs, Department of Defence and Australian Federal Police. AusAID has recently faced severe criticism over failure of the aid investment in the South Pacific to engender development. Most South Pacific countries (excluding Fiji and Samoa) have failed to show desired development. A number have faced bankruptcy (Naru, Solomon Islands), while others have increasing lawlessness (Papua New Guinea). It is important in the above milieu to examine the delivery mechanisms of Australian aid through its chosen vehicle (AusAID) and determine whether aid has really been effective or not. This thesis reviews the development effectiveness of Australian aid in one Pacific island nation ??? Samoa. In this context, the effectiveness of Australian development assistance is reviewed in terms of the results of four case studies of project aid to Samoa. The four case studies cover a range of project activity in differing sectors and offer specific insights into aid policy and delivery and the effects other variables such as culture, history and development status have on development outcomes. The thesis tests the hypothesis that Australian aid to Samoa has resulted in only limited development success and then in ways that are not generally sustainable. In confirming the hypothesis, this thesis identifies that while variables such as the procedural and policy underpinnings of the Australian aid program, aid design/delivery and management, and the history, culture and development status of Samoa impact on the development outcomes, they do not prohibit development. This thesis concludes that development outcomes will be maximised when there are good macro policies present, sound sector policies and real commitments of the government and people to development. Moreover, this thesis finds that while development theories inform the debate over aid none successfully encapsulates  the actual development process.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Please verify keywords.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22896</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transformations of the oriental in the architectural work of Juraj Neidhardt and Dusan Grabrijan</field><field name="creator">Alic, Dijana, Built Environment, Faculty of Built Environment, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the correlation between architectural expression and political ideology in the work of two prominent post-World War Two Yugoslav architects, Dusan Grabrijan and Juraj Neidhardt. It focuses on their collaborative architectural writings, namely 'Sarajevo and Its Satellites' (1942), published during the pro-Nazi government of the Independent State of Croatia, and Architecture of Bosnia and the Way Towards Modernity (1957), produced at the peak of Yugoslav socialism. Both publications explored the relevance of the Ottoman/Islamic built heritage to the creation of a modern city but only in the latter did the authors identify this legacy as a suitable catalyst for the creation of a Bosnian modern architectural expression. This change in position, the thesis argues, developed in relation to the 1950s nationalist discourse in Yugoslavia and, more specifically, the socialist led validation of the Bosnian Muslim community through the latter's official re-presentation from a religious to a national group. Grabrijan and Neidhardt's conception of the Bosnian Oriental expression as a 'synthesis of old experiences and new ways', similarly offered to resolve the long-standing problematic relationship between the architecture of Ottoman origin and an architecture deemed appropriate for a socialist society. Architectural historians of Yugoslav modernism have recognised Grabrijan and Neidhardt's contribution to modernity and praised their capacity to connect Yugoslav modernism with the international agenda. However, the specifics of Grabrijan and Neidhardt's vision and the ideological connotations embedded in it have not been acknowledged. This thesis addresses that omission and shows that while there had been earlier attempts to integrate the Bosnian Islamic past into architectural debates, Grabrijan and Neidhardt's model of Bosnian Oriental offered a place for the Ottoman fabric within the new socialist architectural aspirations. The thesis foregrounds the important role that architecture plays in the process of construction, as well as destruction, of national identities.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Socialism</field><field name="subject">Architecture</field><field name="subject">Ideology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44794</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into the ignition and deflagration mechanisms relating to the testing of permitted explosives with reference to British health and safety executive???s TM2</field><field name="creator">Freeman, Alison , Mining Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">In an effort to provide the underground coal mining industry with an understanding of what governs if an explosive is classed as permitted, a preliminary research project was undertaken to investigate the scientific basis of the British Health and Safety Executives Testing Memorandum#2 (TM2).

This thesis evaluates the service demand, accessibility, utilisation, and coverage of Australia???s first DCR, the Sydney Medically Supervised Injecting Centre (MSIC), located in an area with a history of illegal shooting gallery operation. MSIC impact on injecting practices and injecting related health, and referral to drug treatment were also examined. Methods included cross-sectional IDU surveys, key informant interviews, staff focus groups, analysis of client registration and surveillance data and routinely collected data on needles and syringes - including multiple indirect prevalence estimation, and prospective follow-up of MSIC referrals. Shooting gallery users expressed demand for and willingness to use the MSIC. Injecting episodes previously occurring in shooting galleries appear to have been transferred to the MSIC, although shooting galleries continued to operate at a reduced level. The MSIC service model was accessible, with few refusals of entry, high levels of client satisfaction and limited non-use for reasons relating to the model. MSIC engaged high risk IDUs - regular injectors, sex workers, and those injecting in public places and shooting galleries - who were also more likely to be frequent attendees. MSIC clients were more likely than other IDUs to inject in public places and shooting galleries, be HCV seropositive, have riskier injecting practices and more severe injecting related health problems. MSIC achieved good coverage of the local IDU population (70.7%, range 59.1%-86.7%) and modest coverage of their estimated total injecting episodes during its operating hours (8.8%, range 7.3%-10.8%). MSIC use was associated with improvements in injecting practices and health. Frequent MSIC use was also associated with higher rates of referral to drug treatment than less frequent use. Drug treatment referral uptake was positively associated with a recent history of daily injection and sex work and negatively associated with a lifetime history of psychiatric treatment and/or self harm. This research was confounded by substantial changes in heroin availability during the study period but provides new evidence on DCR coverage, impact on injecting practices and health, and referral to drug treatment.

An integrated approach to field investigation was utilised in this study, including sample collection from a network of standard and bundled piezometers, surface and borehole geophysical investigation techniques, and a manometer board for the measurement of hydraulic head in bundled piezometers. Nine groundwater sampling events were conducted over a 12 month period, with sample analyses comprising field measurement of water quality parameters and redox sensitive elements, and laboratory analysis for major and trace elements and stable isotopes (??18O, ??2H, ??13C-DIC, ??15N). The vertical position of the centre of mass of the leachate plume was observed to vary up to 2 metres between monitoring events, and concentrations of key indicator parameters were observed to fluctuate by as much as 160%. The electrical images created by surface resistivity transects along a groundwater flow path between the landfill and a groundwater-fed pond a short distance downgradient suggest a plume configuration characterised by discrete pulses of concentrated leachate migrating in a conservative manner between the landfill and the pond. It is hypothesized that these leachate slugs are flushed into the aquifer during sustained periods of rainfall, presumed to be a significant driver of leachate mobilisation into the underlying aquifer. The most significant hydrogeochemical processes affecting contaminant mobilisation, transport and attenuation in the leachate-impacted shallow aquifer included microbial degradation of organic waste, dissolution of inorganic waste, ion exchange, precipitation of sulfide and carbonate minerals, mixing with rainfall recharge along flow path, and redox transformations along the plume fringe. These processes are supported by hydrogeochemical data analysis, and generally agree with the results of inverse geochemical modelling. While analysis of detailed groundwater monitoring appears to provide a plausible description of the plume dynamics, the results of the electrical resistivity transects indicates a more varied and complex plume configuration than is suggested by the borehole data alone. This integration of investigation techniques underscores the inherent inadequacy of even a high-resolution monitoring well network to accurately describe the full extent of variation in time and space within a contaminant plume, even in a relatively simple aquifer environment, and accentuates the potentially significant limitations of site-scale hydrogeochemical interpretation based solely on borehole monitoring data.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sanitary landfills</field><field name="subject">leachate</field><field name="subject">plumes (Fluid dynamics).</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23427</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Heidegger and the problem of individuation: Mitsein (being-with), ethics and responsibility</field><field name="creator">Sorial, Sarah, School of Philosophy, UNSW</field><field name="description">The argument of this thesis is that Heideggerian individuation does not constitute another form of solipsism and is not incongruent with Heidegger???s account of Mitsein (beingwith). By demonstrating how individuation is bound up with Mitsein I will also argue that this concept of individuation contains an ethics, conceived here as responsibility for one???s Being/existence that nevertheless implicates others. By tracing the trajectory of Heidegger???s thinking from Being and Time to the later text, Time and Being, I want to suggest that the meditation on Being and its relation to Dasein as an individual contains an ethical moment. Ethics, not conceived of as a series of proscriptions, in terms of the Kantian Categorical Imperative for example. Nor ethics conceived in terms of an obligation to and responsibility for another, as in Levinasian ethics, but an ethics in terms of responsibility for existence, and more specifically, for one???s own existence. The ethical moment in Heidegger, I argue, is not one as ambitious as changing the world or assuming infinite and numerous obligations on behalf of others. It is, rather, a question of changing oneself. It is a question of assuming responsibility in response to the call of Being. I will show how, given that Dasein is always Mitsein, others are situated in such an ethics. Central to the thesis is an examination of the relation between indivduation and Mitsein. While Heidegger is always careful to distinguish his form of individuation from other accounts of individuation or solipsism, such as those of Rene Descartes, Immanuel Kant or Edmund Husserl???s, Heidegger???s conception of solipsism and its relation to his account  of Mitsein remains somewhat obscure. As a consequence, there are several problems that this concept raises, all of which have been the subject of much debate. At the centre of this debate is the apparent tension between the concept of individuation and the notion that ontologically, Dasein is also a Mitsein. This tension has led to a number of interpretations, which either argue that the concept of individuation is inconsistent with the notion of Mitsein, or that it constitutes yet another instance of Cartesian subjectivity and that as a consequence, it is inherently unethical. This thesis contributes to this debate by submitting that the concept of individuation, while primary or central to Heidegger???s ontology, is not in tension with his account of Mitsein. I use Jean-Luc Nancy???s paradoxical logic of the singular to argue for this claim. I suggest that it is precisely this concept of individuation that can inform an ethics and theory of political action on account of the emphasis on individual responsibility. The second part of my argument, also made with the aid of Nancy, is that this can inform an ethics and a theory of political action, not at level of making moral judgements, or yielding standards of right and wrong, but at the level of individual and by implication, collective responsibility for one???s own existence. Given that there is no real separation between the ontic and ontological levels in Heidegger???s work, a taking responsibility at the level of one???s own Being will invariably play itself out ontically in factical life in terms of moral responsibility and judgement. I explore the concrete political implications of this through an examination of Heidegger???s account of freedom. I argue that Heidegger???s removal of freedom from the  ontology of self-presence and his alternative conception of it provides us with a way of thinking freedom not in terms of a specific set of rights, but as a mode of being-in-theworld and as the basis for collective political action. I use the work of Hannah Arendt to develop a theory of political action, freedom and judgment from this revisionary conception of freedom.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Heidegger, Martin, 1889-1976</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23966</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Silica-on-silicon lightwave circuits based on multimode interference for optical communications</field><field name="creator">Jin, Zhe, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommuncations, UNSW</field><field name="description">The thesis focuses the design and fabrication of silica-on-silicon multimode interference (MMI) devices for optical communications. Firstly, the relationship between different kinds of multimode interference was established for the first time. This gives a clearer understanding of the multimode interference and helps to design better performance optical MMI devices With the consideration of weak lateral light confinement, different kinds of novel approaches to designing high performance MMI devices are developed. The first new approach is for optimization of   silica-on-silicon MMI couplers. It is shown that the length of the multimode section can be varied in a well-defined range to find optimal device performance. The range is linked to the propagation constant spacing of fundamental and higher order modes of the multimode waveguide. The second approach is to introduce a new criterion for designing a   MMI coupler with central input. According to overlapping interference analysis, one image space should be left for the adjacent output waveguides because of the lateral distribution of alternatively vanishing and non-vanishing images.  This consideration is neglected in previous work and is shown to be important for achieving good uniformity MMI power splitters.  Thirdly, a new design of silica-on-silicon multimode interference (MMI) device is proposed. Deeply etched air trenches define the boundaries of the multimode section to achieve strong lateral confinement, resulting in lower loss and imbalance. The access waveguides, however, are buried channel and square core, giving low fibre insertion loss and low polarization dependence. The novel design balanced requirement of the strong lateral confinement of the field in the multimode waveguides and the matching between the fiber and the access waveguides.  Then a new approach of designing silica-on-silicon optical switches based on cascaded MMI couplers is presented. The approach combines the transfer matrix method, optimisation of the MMI dimensions, and mode propagation analysis (MPA) for calculation of phase shifts. The feasibility of the large port count switches is also discussed. It is shown that the good performance devices can be realized with a large port count of 32.

Therefore, Chinese investors&#8217; investment motivations, preferences and behaviours have a significant impact on the New Zealand economy. The objectives of this research are: to investigate the preferences (what kind of investment assets they prefer) and the motivations (why they chose New Zealand as their investment destination) of Chinese migrant investors. The findings will be a useful element in explaining New Zealand&#8217;s economic development, and in making financial decisions. It also will be important for the development of New Zealand&#8217;s growing finance industry and equity market. The researcher collected data from 20 respondents who are Chinese migrant investors who have made New Zealand their home. The collected data examines investors&#8217; preferences and motivations, such as what kind of investment assets they prefer and the motivations which drive them to invest in New Zealand or elsewhere. Using a grounded theory methodology, the researcher draws some findings from the data analysis. Furthermore, using a constant comparative method, the researcher develops some preferred choices which explain Chinese migrant investors&#8217; investment preferences and motivations. The core findings (called phenomena or categories) of Chinese migrant investors&#8217; preferences and motivations in this study are listed below: &#61656; Home-bias investment behaviour &#8211; that is mainly China and New Zealand &#61656; Following past performance / herding behaviour &#61656; Seeking speculative opportunities &#8211; high return, high risk &#61656; Over confidence &#61656; Taxation evasion &#61656; Financial privacy Considering these core categories, the researcher re-tested and re-analysed all interview data. Two refined themes are drawn: 1. Chinese investors don&#8217;t understand investment; they seek speculative investment opportunities exemplifying non-professional opportunistic behaviours. 2. Chinese investors don&#8217;t take New Zealand as their preferred investment destination until they arrive in New Zealand. Finally, the researcher reconsiders both themes and other inferences, to develop a theory from the ground &#8211; exaggerated Chinese financial investment experiences are relayed to other Chinese, and influence investment preferences and motivations.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chinese investors</field><field name="subject">Motivations</field><field name="subject">Preferences</field><field name="subject">Investment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/869</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of English subtitles produced for the Taiwanese movie Cape No.7</field><field name="creator">Lu, Ching-Ting</field><field name="description">The purpose of this thesis is to explore how the approaches identified for the translation of Taiwanese Mandarin dialogues into English subtitles is different from those described in research studies which examined the translation of English film dialogues into Mandarin subtitles using data gathered from a Taiwanese movie entitled Cape No. 7. Taiwanese Mandarin is significantly influenced by the Tai-yu dialect, and in order to carry out the translation of Taiwanese Mandarin, it is important to deal with the functions of the dialect and related culture-specific items (CSIs). Therefore, the researcher of this thesis has investigated whether the translator of Cape No. 7 successfully applied a variety of translation strategies and prioritized the translation criteria well, to enable the target audience to receive the same message of the film as the source audience, especially when subtitling is constrained by time and space. There are two research areas which have been examined: slang and humour. The data analysis of slang scenes included Tai-yu slang and swearing, while humorous scenes were divided into three areas: puns, irony and metaphor. The research data have been analysed by means of analysis diagrams, which were trialled in a pilot study, described in Chapter Three. The pilot study lead to a new categorization based on previous researchers&#8217; taxonomies (Aixel&#225;, 1996; Davies, 2003; Tveit and Fong 2005, as cited in Yang, 2006), and this was applied to the analysis diagrams. According to the findings from the analysis chapters (Chapter Four &amp; Five), the translator of Cape No. 7 preferred to use mostly the paraphrasing strategy in translating Tai-yu slang and humour, and the synonymy strategy in conveying swearing. In addition, the translator often strengthened swear words rather than toning them down in the English subtitles. However, when subtitling humorous scenes, the translator preferred to incorporate two strategies to deal with the cultural barriers when conveying the humorous effect. The compensation strategy was not used often in slang translation. In regard to the translation criteria, pragmatics and accuracy appeared to have been deemed more important by the translator than other criteria. Surprisingly functional equivalence did not seem to have been the translator&#8217;s first priority, as suggested by earlier research. Overall, this research study appeared to show that the translator of Cape No. 7 considered the paraphrase strategy to be the most efficient strategy for maintaining CSIs, and that pragmatics and accuracy were the translator&#8217;s most important criteria, which differs from the findings of previous research studies.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Translation</field><field name="subject">Slang</field><field name="subject">Subtitling</field><field name="subject">Taiwanese Mandarin</field><field name="subject">English subtitles</field><field name="subject">Humour</field><field name="subject">Tai-yu slang</field><field name="subject">Swearing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/870</field></doc><doc><field name="title">IQM-CMM : information quality management capability maturity model</field><field name="creator">Baskarada, Sasa</field><field name="description">This research makes a significant contribution to existing information quality management theory by identifying a large number of relevant maturity indicators and mapping them to a staged evolutionary capability maturity model.

These conclusions, however, were based on data from few studies in the western GAB which were assumed to reflect conditions throughout the entire GAB. More recent studies have reported the occurrence of coastal upwelling in the eastern GAB (EGAB) during summer/autumn (November-April), characterized by low sea surface temperatures and elevated concentrations of chlorophyll &#945;, which suggests that certain areas of the GAB may be highly productive during certain times of the year. The eastern Great Australian Bight (EGAB) forms part of the Southern and Indian Oceans and is an area of high ecological and economic importance. Although it supports the largest fishery in Australia (the South Australian Sardine fishery, annual catches since 2004 ~ 25,000 to 42,500 t), quantitative estimates of the primary productivity underlying this industry are open to debate. Estimates range from &lt; 100 mg C m&#8315;&#178; day&#8315;&#185; to &gt; 500 mg C m&#8315;&#178; day&#8315;&#185;. Part of this variation may be due to the unique upwelling circulation of shelf waters in summer/autumn (November-April), which shares some similarities with highly productive eastern boundary current upwelling systems, but differs due to the influence of a northern boundary current, the Flinders current, and a wide continental shelf. Shelf waters encompass an area of ~115,000 km&#178;, and the diverse coastal topography forms part of one of the longest stretches of southward facing coastline in the world. In summer-autumn, winds are upwelling favourable, and the Flinders current running along the continental slope causes the upwelling of the deep permanent thermocline from around 600 m depth (dynamic uplift), allowing nutrient rich cold water to entrain onto the shelf. In winterspring, the EGAB is dominated by westerly downwelling-favourable winds, and upwelling via the Flinders current is suppressed. Thus, the area is highly dynamic, with significant spatial and temporal variations in meteorology and oceanography which may drive variations in nutrient enrichment and productivity. This study represents the first intensive investigation of the primary and secondary productivity of the EGAB, and was designed to evaluate the general hypothesis that spatial and temporal variations in meteorology and oceanography in the EGAB will drive spatial and temporal variations in phytoplankton size structure, and primary and secondary productivity. It examines variations in primary and secondary productivity in the EGAB during the upwelling and downwelling seasons of 2004, and the upwelling seasons of 2005 and 2006. Daily integral productivity calculated using the vertically generalised production model (VGPM) showed a high degree of spatial variation. Productivity was low (&lt;800 mg C m&#8315;&#178; day&#8315;&#185;) in offshore central and western regions of the EGAB. High productivities (1600-3900 mg C m&#8315;&#178; day&#8315;&#185;) were restricted to hotspots in the east that were influenced by the upwelled water mass. There was a strong correlation between the depth of the euphotic zone and the depth of the mixed layer that suggested that ~50% of the euphotic zone lay below the mixed layer depth. As a result, high rates of primary productivity did not require upwelled water to reach the surface. A significant proportion of total productivity in the euphotic zone (57% in 2005 and 65% in 2006) occurred in the upwelled water mass below the surface mixed layer. This result has implications for daily integral productivities modelled with the VGPM, which uses surface measures of phytoplankton biomass to calculate productivity. Macro nutrient concentrations could not be used to explain the difference in the low and high productivities (silica &gt;1 &#956;mol L&#8315;&#185;, nitrate/nitrite &gt;0.4 &#956;mol L&#8315;&#185;, phosphate &gt;0.1 &#956;mol L&#8315;&#185;). Mixing patterns or micro-nutrient concentrations are possible explanations for spatial variations in primary productivity in the EGAB. On a global scale, daily rates of primary productivity of the EGAB lie between the highly productive eastern boundary current upwelling systems, and less productive coastal regions of western and south eastern Australia, and the oligotrophic ocean. However, daily productivity rates in the upwelling hotspots of the EGAB rival productivities in Benguela and Humbolt currents. Temporal variation in mixing and primary productivity was examined in upwelling influenced nearshore waters off south western Eyre Peninsula (SWEP) in the EGAB. Mixing/stratification in the region was highly temporally variable due to the unique upwelling circulation in summer/autumn, and downwelling through winter/spring. Highest productivity was associated with pwelled/stratified water (up to 2958 mg C m&#8315;&#178; d&#8315;&#185;), with low productivity during periods of downwelling and mixing (~300-550 mg C m&#8315;&#178; d&#8315;&#185;), yet no major variations in macro-nutrient concentrations were detected between upwelling and downwelling events (silica &gt;1 &#956;mol L&#8315;&#185;, nitrate/nitrite &gt;0.4 &#956;mol L&#8315;&#185;, phosphate &gt;0.1 &#956;mol L&#8315;&#185;). We hypothesise that upwelling enriches the region with micro-nutrients. High productivity off SWEP appears to be driven by a shallowing of mixed layer depth due to the injection of upwelled waters above Z[subscript]cr. Low productivity follows the suppression of enrichment during downwelling/mixing events, and is exacerbated in winter/spring by low irradiances and short daylengths. Phytoplankton abundance and community composition was also examined in the shelf waters of the EGAB. Phytoplankton abundances were generally higher in near shore waters compared with offshore waters, and during the summer/autumn upwelling season compared with the winter/spring downwelling season. Three distinctly different phytoplankton communities were present in the region during the upwelling and downwelling seasons of 2004, and the upwelling season of 2005, with distinctions manifest in variations in the abundance of dominant types of phytoplankton, and differences in average cell sizes. In summer/autumn, waters influenced by upwelling were characterised by high phytoplankton abundances (particularly diatoms) and larger average cell sizes, while the warmer high-nutrientlow- chlorophyll (HNLC) waters in the region had lower phytoplankton abundances and smaller average cell sizes. The winter/spring community was made up of low abundances of relatively large cells. Diatoms always dominated, but evidence of Si limitation of further diatom growth suggests there may be an upper limit to diatom productivity in the region. The maximum observed diatom concentration of ~164,000 cells L&#8315;&#185; occurred in February/March 2004, in an area influenced by the upwelled water mass. Variations in phytoplankton biodiversity in the shelf waters of southern Australia appear to be related to variations in the influence of upwelling in the region. Meso-zooplankton abundance and community composition was examined in the coastal upwelling system of the EGAB. Spatial and temporal variations were influenced by variations in primary productivity and phytoplankton abundance and community composition, which were driven by variations in the influence of upwelling in the region. Peak meso-zooplankton abundances and biomass occurred in the highly productive upwelling influenced nearshore waters of the EGAB. However, abundances were highly variable between regions and years, reflecting the high spatial and temporal variations in primary productivity and phytoplankton abundance that characterise the shelf waters of the region. Spatial and temporal variations in community composition were driven by changes in the abundance of classes of meso zooplankton common to all regions in both years of this study. Meroplanktonic larvae and opportunistic colonizers dominated the community through the upwelling season, in response to increased primary productivity and phytoplankton blooms. Differences in community composition between upwelling influenced waters and the more HNLC regions appear to be reflected in the relative abundances of cladocera and appendicularia, with cladocera more abundant in productive upwelling influenced areas, and appendicularia thriving in the more HNLC regions of the EGAB. Highest potential grazing rates in the EGAB occurred in nearshore regions with highest mesozooplankton biomass, most likely in response to the high phytoplankton biomass that occurs in the same regions. Peak meso-zooplankton grazing rates in the EGAB were ~80% less than those measured in south west Spencer Gulf in March 2007, and ~35% greater than grazing rates in the Huon Estuary in February 2005. Productivity in the EGAB shows significant spatial and temporal variation, with changes reflecting regional and seasonal variation in meteorology and oceanography, and the water masses present in the region. The overall productivity of a summer/autumn upwelling season was highly dependent on within-season variations in wind strength and direction, which dictate the number, intensity, and duration of upwelling events. Rates of primary productivity measured in the EGAB at a given time depended on the meteorological and oceanographic conditions in the region in the lead up to, and during, the sampling event. We hypothesise that during upwelling events, high productivity in the EGAB is driven by the enrichment of waters above Z[subscript]cr, but below the surface mixed layer, with micro-nutrients. Low productivity within summer/autumn upwelling seasons follows the suppression of this enrichment during downwelling/mixing events, and the overall productivity of the upwelling season will depend on the number, duration and intensity of these downwelling/mixing events. Low productivity during winter/spring is driven by the absence of upwelling, low irradiances and short daylengths.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">primary productivity; coastal upwelling; secondary productivity; mixing; critical depth; phytoplankton; meso-zooplankton</field><field name="subject">Marine plankton Great Australian Bight (W.A. and S.

Acute infection in adults is common, albeit usually self-limiting. Importantly, infection in infants typically results in chronic infection and increased incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Furthermore, the infectious carrier state is perpetuated in chronically infected individuals. Successful immuno-therapeutic vaccination would reduce the incidence of chronic infection and of HCC as well as reduce transmission of the disease. Recovery from acute and chronic HBV infection typically occurs in the presence of robust antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses (CMI), whereas these responses are low or absent in chronically HBV-infected individuals. Therefore, it was hypothesised that effective stimulation of both humoral and CMI responses, in conjunction with currently available antiviral therapies, may contribute significantly to development of vaccines for treatment of chronic HBV infection. The duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) model of HBV infection was used to test novel vaccine strategies that could complement existing antiviral therapeutic approaches to treat chronically HBV-infected humans. To this end, three separate vaccine studies were conducted to investigate potential therapeutic regimes. Methods to assess the efficacies of the vaccine strategies included immunoperoxidase detection of viral antigen and immune cell markers within the liver and development of sensitive assays to monitor levels of DHBV DNA, duck hepatitis B virus surface antigen (DHBsAg), antibodies to duck hepatitis B core (anti-DHBc) and surface antigens (anti-DHBs) in serum were developed and validated which allowed monitoring of the kinetics of the humoral immune response following vaccination and the course and outcome of experimental DHBV infection. The first vaccine study tested the protective efficacy of DNA vaccines encoding either the small form of DHBsAg (DHBs) protein or the larger antigen (DHBpre-S/S), These were administered to ducks at day 4 and 14 of age. On the same day as the second vaccination, ducks were challenged intravenously with DHBV. Immunoperoxidase staining of biopsy tissue collected at day 4 p.i. showed significant decreases in the number of DHBV infected hepatocytes in ducks receiving the DNA vaccines compared to the mock-vaccinated control ducks. Significant protection against development of chronic DHBV infection was observed in ducks vaccinated with DNA vaccines expressing either pre-S/S or S protein. Although anti-DHBs antibodies were not detected prior to DHBV challenge, the decrease in the percentages of DHBV-infected hepatocytes at day 4 p.i is suggestive that neutralisation of the inoculum by low-level anti-DHBs antibodies in cohort with CMI responses induced by vaccination were the most probable mechanisms of action. The second vaccine study examined the protective efficacy of a novel whole-cell vaccine that expressed the DHBV core antigen (DHBcAg). Ducks were vaccinated on day 4 and 14 of age and DHBV challenge was administered 4 days later. Detectable anti-DHBc antibodies were generated as soon as 4 days after the initial vaccination suggesting that this regimen elicited increased immunogenicity than vaccination with DNA vaccines alone. In contrast to the first vaccine study with DNA vaccines expressing DHBsAg, no significant differences in the percentage of DHBV-infected hepatocytes were observed in biopsy tissue collected at day 4 p.i.This finding is confirmation that anti-DHBc antibodies were not neutralising to the initial DHBV inoculum. However, significant protection against development of chronic DHBV infection was observed in the whole-cell vaccinated ducks suggesting that the mechanism of protection was consistent immune-mediated killing of DHBV-infected hepatocytes following CMI responses to determinants of DHBcAg. The final vaccine study involved a combination strategy of antiviral drug Entecavir (ETV) and prime-boost vaccination with DNA vaccines and recombinant fowlpoxvirus (rFPV) expressing DHBV antigens. Immediately following DHBV infection, ducks were dosed by oral gavage with the antiviral drug Entecavir (ETV) and at the same time received the priming DNA vaccines encoding DHBV antigens. Seven days later the boosting vaccination consisting of recombinant fowlpox viruses (rFPV) also expressing DHBV antigens was administered. Extraordinary protection was observed, with 100% of ducks given combination therapy rapidly resolved their DHBV infection while 100% of non-treated ducks developed chronic infection. It was concluded that protection resulted from a combination of at least three factors. First, reduction and control of DHBV levels with the aid of ETV; secondly, stimulation of surface antigen-specific humoral immune responses resulting in neutralisation of newly produced virions; and finally, the combined up-regulation of CMI responses against DHBV core and surface antigens, resulting in elimination of infected hepatocytes. The four manuscripts that comprise this thesis provide insights into the viral kinetics and immune responses that follow DHBV infection and/or vaccination of ducks. The results provide new directions for future vaccine studies aimed at developing effective treatments for chronic HBV infection.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hepatitis B; duck; vaccines</field><field name="subject">Hepatitis B virus</field><field name="subject">Hepatitis, Viral Immunological aspects.</field><field name="subject">Vaccines.</field><field name="identifier">http://proxy.library.adelaide.edu.au/login?url= http://library.adelaide.edu.au/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?BBID=1318773</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57512</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The interaction between dietary proteins and resistant starch on large bowel health.</field><field name="creator">Toden, Shusuke.</field><field name="description">A review of the literature revealed that diet plays an important role in serious human noninfectious large bowel diseases including cancer and inflammatory bowel diseases. Dietary protein (especially as red and processed meats) has been implicated as a positive risk factor for colorectal cancer while starch which is not digested in the small intestine (resistant starch, RS) appears to be protective. The series of experiments described in this thesis were aimed to determine the effects of dietary proteins and RS on indices of colon health in an animal model, the laboratory rat. Genetic damage is a prerequisite for carcinogenesis and this was assessed by a specific assay (the comet assay) which gives a measure of DNA strand breaks. Loss of mucus barrier function is thought to contribute to inflammatory bowel disease by permitting bacterial translocation and this was measured optically using a microscope micrometer. Other biomarkers were measured as described below. There were four major experiments. 1. Effects of dietary red meat and casein on colonic DNA damage and interaction with resistant starch Previous studies had shown that higher dietary protein (as casein) induced genetic damage in rat colonocytes and that RS (fed as a high amylose maize starch) was protective. This study was aimed at establishing whether a high protein diet fed as cooked red meat had similar effects and whether RS was protective. Rats were fed diets containing either 15 % or 25% casein or 25% barbecued lean red beef, each with or without 48% high amylose maize starch (as a source of RS) for 4 weeks. As expected, high dietary casein caused a 2-fold increase in colonic single-strand DNA breaks compared with a low casein diet and reduced the thickness of the colonic mucus layer by 41%. High levels of cooked meat caused 26% more DNA damage than the high casein diet but reduced mucus thickness to a similar degree as casein. Addition of RS to the diet abolished the increase in DNA damage and the loss of colonic mucus thickness induced by either high protein diet. It is thought that RS promotes large bowel health through the SCFA produced by the large bowel bacteria. One acid in particular (butyrate) has been associated particularly with promotion of normal large bowel function and protection against disease. In keeping with this hypothesis, caecal and faecal short chain fatty acid pools (including those of butyrate) were increased by inclusion of RS in the diet. DNA damage is an early step in the initiation of cancer and these findings agree with the population data which suggest that total dietary protein and red meat promote risk of colorectal cancer. However, inclusion of resistant starch in the diet could significantly reduce that risk. 2. Differential effects of dietary whey, soy and casein on colonic DNA damage and interaction with resistant starch The preceding experiments showed that high levels of animal-derived proteins increased colonocyte genetic damage and loss of the mucus barrier in rats. This second experiment was designed to determine whether diets high in different types of dairy protein (casein or whey) or a plant protein isolate (soy) had similar adverse effects on colonic DNA and mucus barrier function and whether inclusion of RS in the diet was protective. Adult male Sprague Dawley rats were fed a diet containing 15 % or 25 % casein, whey or soy protein, each with or without 48 % high amylose maize starch for 4 weeks. In confirmation of the earlier studies, higher levels of dietary casein increased colonocyte DNA damage significantly. However, whey did not increase genetic damage. Colonic DNA damage was highest for soy when fed at both 15% and 25% protein in the absence of RS. Inclusion of RS in the diet attenuated colonocyte DNA damage due to higher dietary protein in all three groups. The colonic mucus barrier was thinner in rats fed higher dietary protein but the effect was reversed by feeding RS. Caecal total SCFA and butyrate pools were low in rats fed the digestible starch and were higher in rats fed RS. However, there was no relationship between caecal or faecal SCFA and genetic damage or mucus thickness. Caecal and colonic tissue weight and colon length were higher in rats fed RS, consistent with greater SCFA supply. These data confirm that higher dietary protein of animal (casein) or plant (soy) origin increases genetic damage and loss of the mucus barrier indicating that this is an effect of protein and not its source. These findings accord with the epidemiological data which link dietary protein to greater risk of colorectal cancer and inflammatory bowel disease. However, the data show also that dietary proteins differ in their specific actions on genetic damage and mucus thickness. Further, the data from the feeding of whey suggest that not all proteins are equivalent in their capacity to provoke adverse changes in colonic integrity. While the data show that RS raised large bowel and faecal SCFA, they indicate their levels were not related directly to these biomarkers. 3. Dose response effects of resistant starch on protein induced colonic DNA damage The accumulated data linking greater protein intakes to adverse changes in the colon were obtained at dietary levels which were not unreasonable in terms of animal or human consumption. However, the dietary level of RS which were fed were relatively high (48% by weight) so this study was conducted to determine its effectiveness at lower levels of dietary inclusion. It was also important to ascertain whether there was a dose-response relationship between RS intake and the observed effects. One of the mechanisms proposed for the induction of colorectal cancer by high dietary protein intakes is oxidative damage to DNA. In this experiment, this was done by assaying with endonuclease III. Adult male rats were fed a diet containing 25% casein with 0%, 10%, 20%, 30% or 40% high amylose maize starch for 4 weeks. As in the preceding studies comet tail moment was greatest and the mucus barrier thinnest in rats fed 0% RS. DNA damage was reduced and the mucus barrier thickened in a logarithmic dose-dependent manner by RS. There was no significant difference between dietary groups associated with oxidative DNA damage as measured by endonuclease III. Caecal and faecal short chain fatty acid (SCFA) pools rose with the increased level of dietary RS. DNA damage of colonocytes correlated negatively with caecal SCFA but the strongest correlation was with caecal butyrate, which is consistent with the proposed role of this SCFA in promoting a normal cell phenotype. The data show that RS prevents protein induced colonic DNA damage in a dose-dependent manner. Inclusion of 10% high amylose maize starch was found to be sufficient to oppose colonocyte DNA damage, and to increase caecal and faecal SCFA pools. Intakes of this order are not unreasonable in terms of human consumption of RS. 4. Dose response effects of red and white meat on colonic DNA damage and interaction with resistant starch The accumulated evidence from large prospective human studies links diet to colorectal cancer risk strongly. The evidence from the animal studies described in this thesis that dietary protein induces colonocyte genetic damage supports a role for high protein intakes in increasing risk. Recently, several large epidemiological studies and a meta-analysis of prospective studies have found that consumption of dietary red or processed meats, but not white (poultry) meat, is associated with increased risk of colorectal cancer. This is consistent with the data from the preceding studies that specific proteins affected colonic integrity differentially. A large prospective European study (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition) has reported that dietary fibre was protective. The findings reported in this thesis that RS opposes the effects of high dietary protein accord with that conclusion. This study aimed to compare the effects of cooked red (beef) or white (chicken) meat on DNA damage and mucus barrier thickness in rats. The study was designed to determine whether the relationship between the intakes of these meats was dose-dependent. Double-strand DNA breaks are thought to relate more closely to carcinogenesis than single-strand breaks so both were measured. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a diet containing 15%, 25% or 35% cooked beef or cooked chicken each with or without 20% high amylose maize starch for four weeks. Both red and white meat increased colonic DNA damage dose-dependently. However, both single and double strand breaks were significantly greater when the rats were fed the red meat diets compared to those fed the white meat. Colonocyte DNA damage was reduced by the consumption of RS while large bowel SCFA were increased. The findings of this study are consistent with the epidemiological data which show that red meat consumption is associated with greater risk of colorectal cancer but that white meat is not. Summary The data reported in this thesis support the findings of prospective population studies that high dietary protein, red meat in particular, appears to be harmful to the health of the large bowel. However, the data demonstrate also that different protein types have differential effects on the integrity of the colonocyte DNA. Furthermore, the addition of RS to the diet protects against protein-induced colonic DNA damage and maintenance of the colonic mucus barrier, apparently through increased SCFA production by colonic fermentation. The results of these experiments indicate a strong potential for RS to be effective in maintenance of large bowel integrity in the face of high dietary protein.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dietary protein; resistant starch; bowel health; DNA damage</field><field name="subject">Gastrointestinal system Diseases</field><field name="subject">Intestinal absorption.</field><field name="subject">Diet in disease.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57517</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Replica placement algorithms for efficient internet content delivery.</field><field name="creator">Xu, Shihong</field><field name="description">This thesis covers three main issues in content delivery with a focus on placement algorithms of replica servers and replica contents. In a content delivery system, the location of replicas is very important as perceived by a quotation: Closer is better. However, considering the costs incurred by replication, it is a challenge to deploy replicas in a cost-effective manner. The objective of our work is to optimally select the location of replicas which includes sites for replica server deployment, servers for replica contents hosting, and en-route caches for object caching. Our solutions for corresponding applications are presented in three parts of the work, which makes significant contributions for designing scalable, reliable, and efficient systems for Internet content delivery. In the first part, we define the Fault-Tolerant Facility Allocation (FTFA) problem for the placement of replica servers, which relaxes the well known Fault-Tolerant Facility Location (FTFL) problem by allowing an integer (instead of binary) number of facilities per site. We show that the problem is NP-hard even for the metric version, where connection costs satisfy the triangle inequality. We propose two efficient algorithms for the metric FTFA problem with approximation factors 1.81 and 1.61 respectively, where the second algorithm is also shown to be (1.11,1.78)- and (1,2)-approximation through the proposed inverse dual fitting technique. The first bi-factor approximation result is further used to achieve a 1.52-approximation algorithm and the second one a 4-approximation algorithm for the metric Fault-Tolerant k-Facility Allocation problem, where an upper bound of facility number (i. e. k) applies. In the second part, we formulate the problem of QoS-aware content replication for parallel access in terms of combined download speed maximization, where each client has a given degree of parallel connections determined by its QoS requirement. The problem is further converted into the metric FTFL problem and we propose an approximation algorithm which is implemented in a distributed and asynchronous manner of communication. We show theoretically that the cost of our solution is no more than 2F* + RC*, where F* and C* are two components of any optimal solution while R is the maximum number of parallel connections. Numerical experiments show that the cost of our solutions is comparable (within 4% error) to the optimal solutions. In the third part, we establish mathematical formulation for the en-route web caching problem in a multi-server network that takes into account all requests (to any server) passing through the intermediate nodes on a request/response path. The problem is to cache the requested object optimally on the path so that the total system gain is maximized. We consider the unconstrained case and two QoS-constrained cases respectively, using efficient dynamic programming based methods. Simulation experiments show that our methods either yield a steady performance improvement (in the unconstrained case) or provide required QoS guarantees.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fault tolerance; Facility location problem; Content distribution; Linear programming; Dynamic programming; Web caching</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/58083</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Habits, hassle, and health: how do blood donors respond to a temporary deferral due to low haemoglobin?</field><field name="creator">Hillgrove, Tessa</field><field name="description">This thesis explored the impact on whole blood donors of a six month deferral from giving blood due to a low haemoglobin (Hb) concentration. The aims were two-fold: first, to quantify the effect of a temporary deferral on donation patterns once eligible to return, and second, to identify the processes contributing to the effect. The mixed methods design utilised four distinct research phases: statistical analysis of donation patterns over a three year period, surveys of whole blood donors three and twelve months after deferral, and semi-structured interviews with 25 blood donors in the weeks immediately following deferral. Deferral for a low Hb increased the likelihood of non-return in both new and repeat donors, and, amongst those who did return, delayed first return, reduced donation frequency and increased the likelihood of drop-out in later years. Qualitative interviews suggested that, predominantly, individuals give blood because it represents an easy and convenient way to help others, and provides additional rewards, such as enhancing positive self-concepts and a free health check. Returning promptly after deferral appears to be related to three aspects of a person and his/her context: an individual&#8217;s other obligations, especially parenting; the extent to which donation is considered personally rewarding; and whether donation arrangements were facilitated by a range of supports prior to deferral. Over three quarters of surveyed deferred donors seek further advice and investigations from their medical practitioner and nearly half of those are encouraged to change their donation patterns. With the exception of having a low haemoglobin level confirmed at follow-up testing, experiences seeking further investigations were not associated with either intentions or return. Triangulation of findings suggests that deferral disrupts the habit of regular donation, and that this disruption makes donors more vulnerable to changes to their personal circumstances or collection practices. Deferral may also increase the perceived inconvenience of the activity, decrease self-perceptions of competence and good health, and diminish the &#8220;blood donor&#8221; identity. Practical implications of these findings are recommendations that may increase retention of deferred donors, including encouraging donors to return promptly once eligible, enhancing the convenience of blood donation, and improving aspects of the deferral event.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Blood donation; Blood donor; Mix method; Deferral; Role identity</field><field name="subject">Blood donors.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/58084</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Selected resonant converters for IPT power supplies</field><field name="creator">Hu, Aiguo Patrick</field><field name="description">For more than a century it has been known that signals and power can be transferred electromagnetically. This knowledge has motivated substantial research and development into wireless signal transmission which today is competitive with traditional conductive cabling systems. Power transfer across air gaps, however, has seen more modest development and has tended to be restricted to electric machines that have tight magnetic couplings. It is only very recently that a novel technique termed IPT (Inductive Power Transfer) has made power delivery to movable objects across large air gaps a practical reality. A typical IPT system comprises a primary power converter supplying high frequency alternating current to a conductive track loop with multiple secondary power pick-up circuits loosely coupled to it. IPT employs modern power conversion, control, and magnetic coupling techniques to achieve clean and reliable power transfer without direct electrical contact. Many practical applications have been found for IPT in materials handing, lighting, and transportation systems. One of the major constraints, however, is the primary power supply, particularly at high power levels and when power transfer over large distances is required. In this thesis selected resonant converters suitable for IPT power supplies are investigated using mathematical analysis, computer simulations and practical experiments. The basic characteristics and underlying principles of the converters are studied in order to determine their dynamic performance and power transfer capability. Special attention is given to improving existing IPT power supplies while investigating new power converters in order to achieve high efficiency and reliable operation at reduced cost. The current-fed parallel resonant converter power supply has been the basis of most commercial applications to date. It has a high efficiency and produces good voltage and current waveforms. However, both the track length that it can drive and the power level it can operate at are limited and the system may vary in frequency if the track resonant circuit and the pick-up load are not carefully designed. As a result, this supply, in its simple form, is only suitable for short track lengths and low power applications. The voltage-fed series ii quasi-resonant converter power supply controls the frequency directly and is capable of driving longer track lengths as a result of series compensation employed in the track loop. However, its voltage and current waveforms contain more harmonics, and while high efficiency may be achieved with soft switching, the condition is very dependent on the track compensation and is difficult to meet during start-up and shut down transients. In consequence, this supply is suitable for medium track lengths and medium power level applications. Improved current-fed and voltage-fed IPT power supplies are proposed in this thesis. They have the most preferred track current properties, including constant magnitude and nearly pure sine wave characteristics. Despite the circuit complexity and high system cost involved, these supplies are ideally suitable for long track lengths and high power applications. A novel converter based on free oscillation and energy injection control is also presented and shown to be capable of achieving high frequency AC power generation at very low switching frequencies while reducing the system cost. As such it is appealing for long track length, high track current, high frequency, and low voltage source applications. Finally, a very simple converter based on self-sustained oscillation without an external controller is demonstrated at low operating voltages, and a cost-effective option to overcome the start-up problems exhibited by most IPT power supplies at high voltages is shown with excellent dynamic zero voltage switching performance.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Engineering, Electronics and Electrical (0544)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Narratives of otherness: Masculinity and identity in contemporary Spanish literature for children and adolescents</field><field name="creator">Davies, Faye Margarita</field><field name="description">While members of any group of men may appear to be ordinary gendered examples of humanity, behind their physical similarities lie many socio-political and familial differences; thus it is only by knowing such men as individuals that their identities are revealed. Such is the aim of this thesis: to discover the 'real man' behind the statistics about sex-roles and the predominance of male characters in children's and adolescents' literature. From within a selection of Spanish texts a variety of male characters are analysed, focusing on six major roles: father, grandfather, imaginary friend, detective, outlaw or similar marginalised man, and foreign other, with particular attention paid to the Gypsy.    All the chapters are linked by the Bakhtinian theory that dialogue with the other leads to the development of a character's or potential reader's sense of identity. The first chapter, concerning fatherhood, is related to a person's sense of intrinsic identity, given with their name and genetic heritage. The grandfather represents a similar sense of family continuity, as well as enabling the young reader to understand Spain's recent historical and rural past. An imaginary friend may symbolise an aspect of identity concerned with a child's ability to achieve a goal or to occupy a special place within the family. Detective stories are analogous to the young person's developing identity as a reader able to decipher the mysteries of texts, whilst marginalised men typify children themselves: persons who have neither status nor money, but who are able to indulge in carnivalistic behaviour which adults call 'play.' The development of one's sense of national identity is fomented through interaction with texts about foreigners who have contributed to Spain's growth as a nation from pre-historic times to the present.    A brief critical evaluation of the role of women in detective fiction and as marginalised figures is offered by way of contrast in the appropriate chapters. The thesis concludes that, when analysed as individuals, many male characters demonstrate traits not traditionally considered masculine, and that it is necessary to look beyond mere representations of gender in judging the value of characters in literature for children and adolescents.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">LITERATURE, ROMANCE (0313)</field><field name="subject">EDUCATION, READING (0535)</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420303 Culture, gender, sexuality</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pier scour countermeasures</field><field name="creator">Lauchlan, Christine Sandra</field><field name="description">Riprap is the most commonly employed countermeasure where bridge piers need to be protected against possible undermining by scour. An extensive review of available design techniques revealed a wide range of equations and proposed design procedures but no generally accepted method for riprap sizing and implementation. The aim of this study was to develop a design procedure for riprap protection at piers which can be used in most river environments.    The failure mechanisms and stability of riprap layers around cylindrical and rectangular shaped piers were examined in a comprehensive experimental study. The study assessed the importance of various riprap, flow, sediment, and pier parameters. Parameters for investigation were determined by dimensional analysis and included riprap placement and arrangement.    A riprap size prediction formula was developed based on an allowable maximum local scour depth of up to 20%. This equation has been incorporated in a design approach which was tested through a model study of the Hutt Estuary Bridge. The influence of various parameters on riprap stability are incorporated in the equation by way of adjustment factors.    The adjustment factors, KY and KD, represent the effects of riprap placement and pier/sediment size ratio effects respectively. They were deemed the most important parameters in riprap layer performance and are therefore included in the riprap size prediction formula. Additional experiments using synthetic filters have shown their ability to eliminate local scour, however they are susceptible to failure under degrading bed conditions.    Degrading bed conditions cause the riprap to subside as a layer with the downward movement of the surrounding bed. Subsidence allows the layer to withstand rapid short term degradation. However long term degradation will ultimately result in failure of the stone protection.    A preliminary experimental study of the use of submerged vanes as a scour countermeasure was performed. Submerged vanes have been used previously in channel protection with much success. Results indicate that vanes with a length to height ratio greater than one can reduce the maximum local scour depth in live bed conditions by as much as 34%. Further testing is required to develop a complete design procedure.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ENGINEERING, CIVIL (0543)</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290800 Civil Engineering::290801 Structural engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The transformation of Mangere Hospital: A case study in deinstitutionalisation</field><field name="creator">Levien, Janett</field><field name="description">This thesis is an analysis and evaluation of a case study in deinstitutionalisation of people with intellectual disabilities. The process has been viewed as an example of organisational change and the focus is on the relationship between formal and informal caregivers and the notion of care. Three key groups were included in the study, families of residents, the residents and staff.    A qualitative approach was taken. The theoretical perspective that was developed attempted to account for links between social movements, organisations and individual experience in the arena of intellectual disability. This was based on the approach of New Institutionalism in organisational theory. The focus was primarily on the process--of change, and in caregiving.    Three models of intellectual disability, which have informed policy and the recent changes to a preference for community care, have been identified and the links between these and the elements of organisations developed for providing care explored. The experience of families and residents within the hospital setting and then the community care setting has been examined in relation to the nature of the organisation.    Outcomes for the three groups have been examined in terms of their needs and the extent to which these needs were met by the arrangements over a given time. It is concluded that community care has the potential to better meet the needs of those involved, than has hospital based care. A number of factors in the process of change and in the delivery of care have been identified as impacting on outcomes for those involved. Consideration is given to the practical implications of these findings.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">HEALTH SCIENCES, HEALTH CARE MANAGEMENT (0769)</field><field name="subject">HEALTH SCIENCES, PUBLIC HEALTH (0573)</field><field name="subject">SOCIOLOGY, INDIVIDUAL AND FAMILY STUDIES (0628)</field><field name="subject">HEALTH SCIENCES, MENTAL HEALTH (0347)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/6</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Systematic opportunistic screening for type 2 diabetes in general practice</field><field name="creator">Kenealy, Timothy William</field><field name="description">Some 70,000 people in New Zealand may have undiagnosed diabetes. This study aims to develop &#8216;systematic opportunistic screening&#8217; for diabetes, testing people attending a general practitioner (GP) for some other reason, and to trial this process with Auckland GPs. The literature on how to change doctor behaviour is reviewed for both theoretical perspectives and empirical evidence. Two of the most promising strategies are computer reminders within a medical consultation and having patients influence doctors. Literature reviews cover GP attitudes to diabetes, guidelines and preventive care and the role of a computer in a GP consultation.    The Mail Survey (response rate 154/212, 72.6%) reports GP attitudes to guidelines and preventive care. Factor analysis showed five &#8216;guidelines&#8217; factors and two &#8216;preventive care&#8217; factors that might indicate differential motivations to screening for diabetes.    The Focus Group Study, of 35 GPs in 5 groups, discussed guidelines, diabetes and computer reminders in a consultation. The analysis suggested that GPs would respond to a patient reminder and may respond to a computer reminder to screen for diabetes.    The Screening Reminder Trial involved 107 GPs randomly allocated across four interventions: Computer reminders, Patient reminders, Both and Usual care. The main outcome measures were whether a patient who was eligible for diabetes screening and who visited a GP during the trial had a glucose test done within the trial. The trial ran for two months. Analysis was by intention-to-treat and allowed for clustering by GP. Compared with the Usual care group (screening rate 15.5%), the Odds Ratio of eligible patients being screened were; Computer group OR 2.55 (1.68-3.88), Patient group OR 1.72 (1.21-2.43) and Both group OR 1.69 (1.11-2.59). The Computer reminders were more acceptable to GPs than were the Patient intervention. The findings suggest that a simple computer reminder can implement systematic opportunistic screening for diabetes in New Zealand. If all GPs in New Zealand used the computer reminders for one year, some 8000 patients might benefit from having their diabetes treated for five years longer than they would have under &#8216;usual care&#8217;.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">HEALTH SCIENCES, MEDICINE AND SURGERY (0564)</field><field name="subject">HEALTH SCIENCES, HEALTH CARE MANAGEMENT (0769)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/7</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Language learning strategy use and proficiency: The relationship between patterns of reported language learning strategy (LLS) use by speakers of other languages (SOL) and proficiency with implications for the teaching/learning situation</field><field name="creator">Griffiths, Carol</field><field name="description">This thesis begins with the premise that strategies are important if students are to learn effectively, and that this applies no less to language than to any other field of learning. After issues of terminology and definition are addressed, there is a discussion of the theoretical underpinnings of the language learning strategy concept. Since the concept of proficiency is also central to the thesis, issues relating to the definition and assessment of proficiency are considered before previous research in the language learning strategy field is reviewed. This research was carried out in three stages in a private language school in Auckland, New Zealand. Part A, Section 1 used the Strategy Inventory for Language Learning (SILL) (Oxford, 1990) as the basic instrument to investigate the relationship between language learning strategies and proficiency and to examine the strategy patterns used by more proficient students. Part A, Section 2 used the same data to investigate language learning strategy use according to learner variables (nationality, gender, age). Part B used interviews to investigate language learning strategy use by individuals and Part C used a classroom based programme to explore means of instructing students in language learning strategy use and also to construct an original questionnaire using student input (the English Language Learning Strategy Inventory or ELLSI). This questionnaire was used to further investigate the relationship between language learning strategy use and proficiency and also changes in strategy use over time as well as teachers&#8217; perspectives on language learning strategy use. The results of the SILL phase of the study revealed a significant relationship between language learning strategies and proficiency (a finding supported by the results of the ELLSI study) and also significant differences in strategy use according to nationality, while the interviews revealed some useful insights regarding the use of language learning strategies by individuals. From the longitudinal section of the study it was found that those students who made the most progress were the ones who most increased the frequency of their language learning strategy use. The results of the teachers&#8217; survey indicated that teachers regarded language learning strategies as highly important, an encouraging result in terms of positive implications for a good accord between teachers and students in the teaching/learning situation. The classroom programme, however, aimed at exploring ways to promote language learning strategy use among students, was only a lukewarm success and much work remains to be done to find ways of making insights regarding language learning strategies available to students. The thesis concludes by bringing together the key findings and suggesting areas for further research.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">LANGUAGE, LINGUISTICS (0290)</field><field name="subject">EDUCATION, LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE (0279)</field><field name="subject">EDUCATION, BILINGUAL AND MULTICULTURAL (0282)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/9</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification and characterisation of a novel integrin beta subunit: Beta 7</field><field name="creator">Yuan, Qian</field><field name="description">The identification of a novel human integrin $/beta$ subunit, $/beta/sb7$, has been reported in this dissertation. The full-length human $/beta/sb7$ cDNA contains 2798 nucleotides encoding a single long open reading frame of 798 amino acid residues of which 708 are extracellular and 52 are cytoplasmic. The human $/beta/sb7$ sequence displays strong homology with other integrin $/beta$ subunits, being most related to $/beta/sb2$. Cell distribution studies suggest that the expression of transcripts encoding the human $/beta/sb7$ subunit is restricted to leukocytes. This study was the first to show that the cysteine-rich repeats of the human integrin $/beta/sb7$ subunit and other integrin $/beta$ subunits are related to domain III of the laminin B chains. Furthermore, the integrin $/beta$ subunit and laminin cysteine-rich repeats are each related to the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats found in a growing number of adhesion molecules and regulatory proteins.    The mouse homologue of the human $/beta/sb7$ subunit has also been cloned in this study, and it shares 87% amino acid identity with the human $/beta/sb7$ sequence. The mouse $/beta/sb7$ mRNA transcripts, like that of the human $/beta/sb7$, have a predominantly leukocyte-restricted expression, but in some haematopoietic lineage cell lines, in addition to the predominant 3 kb transcript, a less abundant 2 kb transcript is also detectable. Cultured mouse skin epithelial cells contain only the 2 kb transcript.    The genes encoding the human and mouse $/beta/sb7$ subunits were mapped to human chromosome 12 (ITGB7) and mouse chromosome 15 (Itgb-7). The Itgb-7 gene was localised to the distal part of mouse chromosome 15, and exists in the gene order: Myc-Wnt-1-Itgb-1.    The N-terminal 13 amino acids of the mature mouse $/beta/sb7$ subunit was shown to be identical to a 13 amino acid N-terminal sequence reported for the Mr 120,000 $/beta$ subunit of the M290 antigen, which is found highly expressed on mouse intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL). This finding suggests that the integrin $/beta/sb7$ subunit may play important roles in IEL migration, and immunosurveillance in the gut mucosa.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">HEALTH SCIENCES, IMMUNOLOGY (0982)</field><field name="subject">BIOLOGY, MOLECULAR (0307)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/10</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A conceptual model for sustainability (John Berger)</field><field name="creator">Wanden-Hannay (nee Witten-Hannah), Shalema</field><field name="description">The ideas of Berger are used in this thesis to explore humankind's struggle to achieve greater sustainability. In his descriptions of the peasantry and modern high-energy cultures of progress Berger insightfully crystallises and represents graphically the observation made by many authors writing in different contexts and from within various disciplines that there have been two fundamentally different systems of beliefs and values in history. His conception of &#8216; cultures of survival&#8217; and &#8216;cultures of progress &#8217; is used in this thesis to develop a conceptual model for sustainability.    The basic idea underlying the conceptual model for sustainability is that cultural systems self-regulate or self-correct as they strive to achieve balance in their relationship to higher systems levels of the biosphere, while improving quality of life. Over large time scales self-regulation takes the form of quite radical transformations in cultural system's key defining beliefs and values. The model holds that the process of self-regulation results in societies moving back and forth along a cultural continuum of beliefs and values, represented at one end by Berger's cultures of survival and at the other by his cultures of progress. This system of self-regulation is fraught with risks arising from factors like the inherently conservative nature of cultural systems, which reduce the fit or alignment between systems of beliefs and values and their context and in doing so generate un-sustainability. The model suggests that over large spans of time movement back and forth along the cultural continuum creates the dynamic balance needed to achieve greater sustainability, at least if irreversible degradation of the biosphere's life-supporting systems and extinction can be avoided. This conceptual model for sustainability demonstrates the validity of the central hypothesis of the thesis, which is that Berger's ideas in the &#8216;Historical Afterword&#8217; to &#8216;Pig Earth&#8217; are important and have a valuable contribution to make to the discourse on sustainability.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES (0768)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/11</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The coexistence of DS-CDMA mobile radio systems and fixed services</field><field name="creator">Marshall, Philip John</field><field name="description">Analytical techniques are developed for predicting the performance of outdoor and in-building DS-CDMA mobile radio systems and fixed services sharing the same spectrum. The mobile radio and inter-system propagation characteristics are represented by a log-normally distributed distance dependent path-loss. For simplicity, the received signal variability attributable to multi-path fading is ignored.    The mobile radio system performance is estimated using outage probability expressions, where an outage is defined to occur when the momentary BER exceeds a specified threshold rate. The in-building and outdoor mobile radio systems are assumed to use power control and the composite interference is assumed to be Gaussian distributed at the mobile radio receivers.    Outage probability expressions which predict the performance of a fixed service sharing spectrum with a mobile radio system are developed. The fixed service is assumed to experience occasional multi-path fading attributable to unusual tropospheric conditions. The maximum tolerable mobile radio interference at a fixed service receiver depends on the performance requirements of the service. However a commonly used Standard which requires that the INR is less than -16dB has been adopted in this Thesis, and therefore an outage is defined to occur when the CNR ratio is less than the minimum required for reliable reception, or when the INR exceeds -16dB.    Sufficient electromagnetic isolation between fixed and mobile systems sharing the same spectrum may be achieved using excision suppression techniques or by geographically separating the two systems. Excision suppression techniques will have a detrimental effect on the performance of a mobile radio system unless the fixed service signal is sufficiently narrow-band. The geographical separation distances required for spectrum sharing between fixed services, and outdoor and in-building DS-CDMA mobile radio systems are presented. The fixed services are assumed to be similar to those operating in New Zealand in the 1.7-2.3 GHz frequency bands. Mobile radio systems with 5, 10, 15 and 48 MHz channels are considered. It is shown that, for the systems considered, the geographical separation required between the two systems depends largely on the mobile radio and inter-system propagation characteristics, and the mobile radio and fixed service transmission powers.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ENGINEERING, ELECTRONICS AND ELECTRICAL (0544)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/12</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lines in space:  Freedom and the search for truth in the novels of Alfred Andersch</field><field name="creator">Purdie, Catherine Marie</field><field name="description">Through an analysis of the four novels Sansibar  (1957), Die Rote (196 1), Efraim (1967) and Winterspelt (1974), this thesis explores the development of the principles of freedom and truth upheld by the characters in Sansibar into the concept of the artistic outline found in the later novels. Crucial to an understanding of this is the Sartre quotation in Winterspelt . According to Sartre's &#8216;original project&#8217;, the individual human being starts off life as a rough outline, which lives itself subjectively, filtering objective reality through its own preconceptions and thus experiencing nothing which is not part of these preconceptions. As a painter creates an outline on a blank canvas, so we create the outline of our own lives and determin our destiny.    In Andersch's novels, which are set against the existential void, the fate of the characters is never predetermined; rather, it is the individual's line of thinking which determines his or her course of action, and determines the nature of his or her relationships with others. As Andersch's characters become more aware of their freedom as human beings, they are able to develop conscious artistic outlines and so turn the existential void into a place of freedom. This thesis looks at four closely interrelated aspects of the artistic outline: &#8216;Lines of Thought&#8217;, &#8216;The Development of Outlines&#8217;, &#8216;New Directions&#8217; and &#8216;Co-existence and convergence: the individual artistic outline as part of a whole&#8217;. By showing the development of these aspects across the four novels, it draws conclusions not only about Alfred Andersch's development as a writer but also about his vision of humanity.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">LITERATURE, GERMANIC (0311)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/13</field></doc><doc><field name="title">General equilibrium analysis of Sri Lanka's trade liberalization policy options</field><field name="creator">Tennakoon, Kadupitige Upalinie Ajitha</field><field name="description">Sri Lanka's trade regime has been gradually liberalized over the last two decades with the aim of deeper integration into the global economy. The purpose of this study is to present a quantitative assessment of the impacts of major unilateral, regional and multilateral trade liberalization on Sri Lanka, and rank the trade policy options in terms of their welfare effects. This study contributes to the empirical literature on trade liberalization. The Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) model is used to analyze the welfare effects of trade liberalization in a multi-country, multi-sector general equilibrium framework. The results show that if Sri Lanka implements the South Asian Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA), while maintaining 15 percent external tariffs for the rest of the world, this combined policy would provide the highest welfare gain to Sri Lanka. The SAFTA by its own would provide the second-highest ranked gain from the trade reforms due to the benefits of preferential access to the large SAARC market. The third-highest ranked policy option comes under the unilateral reduction of import tariffs to 15 percent scenario. As results indicate, the Indo-Lanka Free Trade Agreement (ILFTA) offers the fourth-highest policy option for Sri Lanka. Finally, the phasing-out of MFA on Textiles and Clothing under the Uruguay Round Agreement, rank as the fifth-highest policy option for Sri Lanka. Thus, regional trade liberalization is far more preferable to unilateral and multilateral liberalization. However, as the GTAP model permits, these rankings based on only to the static welfare gains, ignoring the dynamic effect of trade liberalization.    In addition, the gravity model has been employed to examine the determinants of Sri Lanka's bilateral trade flows with her selected trading partners, in order to sort out the influence of geographical proximity versus preferential trading policies in creating a regional concentration in trade. Our results confirm the validity of geographical factors such as proximity and cultural familiarity, as determinants of Sri Lanka's trade with neighbouring countries. They suggest that the selected trading partners are &#8220;natural trading partners&#8221; of Sri Lanka.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">POLITICAL SCIENCE, INTERNATIONAL LAW AND RELATIONS (0616)</field><field name="subject">ECONOMICS, GENERAL (0501)</field><field name="subject">ECONOMICS, COMMERCE-BUSINESS (0505)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/14</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of 'spiritual meaning-making' on career choice, transition and experience</field><field name="creator">Lips-Wiersma, Marjolein Silvia</field><field name="description">The focus of this inquiry is &#8220;The influence of &#8216;spiritual meaning-making&#8217; on career choice, transition and experience&#8221;. Over the past decade there has been an increase in interest in the expression of spiritual belief in work. Most of the writing on the topic is based on the premise that individuals and organisations have lost meaning, and that the problem of meaning in work needs to addressed to enhance the ways in which we organise, and to enhance organisational output and personal wellbeing. Whereas the current writing on spirituality and work often suggests that organisations should provide more meaning, this research took a more humble starting point by asking what meanings individuals with spiritual belief are currently attributing to, and discovering in, their work, and by asking how and whether these meanings determine work behaviour.    I argue in this thesis that the concept of meaning-making is central to spirituality. I reviewed the psychological literature on meaning and as a result decided to focus the inquiry on three core elements of meaning; purpose, sense-making and coherence. In order to step back from the organisational agenda, and give voice to the authenticity of diverse spiritual beliefs, I chose to use career, rather than organisational theory, as framework for this inquiry. An additional theoretical framework of &#8216;agency and communion&#8217; was introduced to conceptualise human motivation beyond its current narrow &#8216;self&#8217; and &#8216;doing&#8217; oriented definitions. A combination of &#8216;collaborative human inquiry&#8217; and &#8216;narrative&#8217; methodology was chosen to elicit subjective career meanings. Fifteen individuals with diverse spiritual beliefs participated in this research. These included a Buddhist, a Quaker, a Catholic, a Bah&#225;'&#237;, and a Mormon, as well as those not currently affiliated with an organized religion.    The findings show that spiritual belief strongly determines career choice, transition and experience. It was found that research participants, in spite of their diverse beliefs, shared four purposes: &#8216;developing and becoming self&#8217;, &#8216;union with others&#8217;, &#8216;expressing self&#8217; and &#8216;serving others&#8217;. When these purposes can be expressed fully, the workplace is experienced to be aligned with spiritual belief, and individuals are contributing fully, especially when diversity of spiritual expressions is acknowledged at the same time. Career transitions are made through an ongoing sense-making process as a result of which the individual may decide that the four purposes are no longer in balance and action is required in order to continue to live meaningfully. This sensemaking is a result of ongoing interaction between the individual and his or her work environment. Coherence is a result of the transrational element of spirituality, when the individual feels his or her work is still aligned with a bigger (divine) plan. This is assessed on an ongoing basis through prayer, asking &#8216;was this meant to be&#8217; and reframing difficulties and setbacks as opportunities for learning and development.    I suggest that it may not be wise to seek collective enactment of the trans-rational as it has no firm basis for collective organisational decision-making. It cannot seek collective expression due to the diversity of beliefs of organisational members. However I strongly suggest that an organisation that wants to align itself with the spiritual beliefs of its members, ensures that the four purposes of &#8216;developing and becoming self&#8217;, &#8216;union with others&#8217;, &#8216;expressing self&#8217; and &#8216;serving others&#8217; can be fully enacted in the organisation, keeping in mind that spirituality expresses itself in process as well as outcome.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">EDUCATION, VOCATIONAL (0747)</field><field name="subject">BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION, MANAGEMENT (0454)</field><field name="subject">PSYCHOLOGY, INDUSTRIAL (0624)</field><field name="subject">RELIGION, GENERAL (0318)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/18</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Education reforms:  The marketisation of education in New Zealand. Human capital theory and student investment decisions</field><field name="creator">Eagle, Lynne Carol</field><field name="description">This thesis traces the development of the New Zealand education reforms which began in the late 1980s from their ideological and theoretical foundations, especially those of human capital theory, through policy development and implementation. Polytechnic business programmes are used as a case study to illustrate the impact of the reforms and of one of the principal mechanisms by which the reforms were expected to be implemented-the National Framework.    Evidence is provided that leads to policy questions regarding the implementation of the Framework under the aegis of the New Zealand Qualifications Authority. These concerns include competency based learning and administration and delivery complexities. The links between the reform intentions and the actuality of implementation are also examined. The assumption that the education reforms are expected to have significant impact on the country's economic performance is examined and factors which impact on workplace organisation and productivity and which may constrain the effects of improved worker education and training are discussed. The instrument of &#8216;the market&#8217; as a means of achieving both efficiencies and effectiveness in tertiary education is also reviewed. There appears to be an absence of a common understanding of the nature, composition and behaviour of education markets.    Indicative evidence is also provided regarding the complexity of student investment decisions with regard to tertiary education decisions. This study provides evidence to support human capital theory as a force influencing the decision to undertaken tertiary education, but as part of a much more complex model of the tertiary education decision making process than it would appear that policy makers have considered.    Evidence is presented that leads to questions regarding the assumption that industry will take ownership of the reform processes. Evidence is presented of industry indifference and inertia to the reforms.    Recommendations for the re-examination of developments to date are made, together with research programmes to provide a sound empirical base for future policy making. Without a structured critical review of the reform intentions versus the emerging actuality, there is a danger that the reforms may, in part at least, prove to be both inefficient and ineffectual.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">EDUCATION, HIGHER (0745)</field><field name="subject">EDUCATION, BUSINESS (0688)</field><field name="subject">EDUCATION, FINANCE (0277)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/19</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation and comparison of the French and Austro-German schools of violoncello bowing techniques: 1785-1839</field><field name="creator">Walden, Valerie Elizabeth</field><field name="description">This study traces the development of violoncello bowing technique in France, Austria and Germany between the years 1785-1839. Using evidence obtained from contemporary violoncello methods, periodical reviews, iconographic materials, diaries, letters, musical manuscripts, first-edition performance repertoire, and first-hand research at the Library of Congress, Smithsonian Institute and University of California at Berkeley, the technical methodology of each school is examined. By this process, diverse qualities in the playing manner of J. P. Duport, J. L. Duport, Janson, Tricklir, Breval, J. H. Levasseur, Lamare, Hus-Desforges, Baudiot, Norblin, Vaslin and Franchomme, and that of A. Kraft, Ritter, Romberg, N. Kraft, Dotzauer, Lincke, Bohrer, Merk and Kummer are discernible.    Such divergences in bowing technique form the basis of dissimilarities present in French and Austro-German violoncello performance of 1785-1839, a circumstance occasioned by a variety of contributing factors. These issues are segregated for investigation. Following the Introduction, Chapters 1 and 2 provide background information regarding the development of the instrument, bow, and bowing techniques before 1785. Chapter 3 discusses design modifications that occurred to the instrument and bow between 1785 and 1839. Chapters 4 and 5 present the biographies of each of the violoncellists examined, while Chapter 6 discusses the influence of performers from the French violin school and the musician interaction brought about by the French Revolution and subsequent wars.    Analysis of the varying performance characteristics of the French and Austro-German schools begins with Chapter 7, this chapter and Chapter 8 surveying the performance methodology of each of the violoncellists included in this study. Chapters 9 and 10 assess the consequential relationship of performance technique to performance repertoire and Chapter 11 summarizes the findings of the accomplished research.    These findings detail differences in the performance methodology of the French, Austrian and German violoncello schools in the period 1785-1839. The variants evinced include the manner in which the bow and instrument were held, the type of bowing techniques incorporated into the performance repertoire of each nationality and the method of their execution, the way in which the violoncello's varying sonorities were exploited, and the regard for sound quality and volume by performers of each school.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">MUSIC (0413)</field><field name="subject">EDUCATION, MUSIC (0522)</field><field name="subject">HISTORY, EUROPEAN (0335)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/20</field></doc><doc><field name="title">O le poutu: Women's roles and Samoan language nests</field><field name="creator">Utumapu, Tafili Leahnora Peseta</field><field name="description">Samoan language nests have become well established in New Zealand due to the commitment, support and contribution of the Samoan community, the church, Samoan families, parents and most importantly the efforts of mothers. Their advent has created new settings within which or through which women's roles may become redefined. This thesis explores the questions of how relationships between Samoan language nests and family systems have developed, and how these relationships may have affected the development of roles within Samoan families, especially women's roles.    To obtain answers to these questions three theoretical frameworks were utilised. Bronfenbrenner's (1979) ecological model provided concepts for understanding the developmental changes occurring in the transitional relationships between families and language nests. The second theoretical perspective employed was Vygotsky's (1978) sociocultural framework to analyse the cultural processes developing between Samoan families and language nests. The final framework was provided by Goodnow and Collins's (1990) concept of 'parents ideas'. Their argument is that parents' ideas and style of parenting has been influenced by their own ontogenic development, and by society's expectations.    The answers to the research questions were obtained by interviewing 21 Samoan language nest supervisors in the Auckland area and 100 caregivers or parents. Samoan language nests influenced parents, mothers and their families in their awareness and affirmation of Samoan language and culture, helping with parenting skills, provided support groups and served as an opportunity to gain knowledge and skills about preschool operation and educational processes. Language nests reinforced women's maternal roles, it changed the way they related to their children and the women's support groups encouraged women to assert their rights as women. The level of commitment by women is illustrated in the ways mothers and parents contributed at the language nests. Overall 92 percent of the mothers and parents helped at the nests.    The significant contribution of women in Samoan language nests serve to affirm her as a 'poutu', the 'superwoman', the strength of her family, of the church and her community.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">EDUCATION, EARLY CHILDHOOD (0518)</field><field name="subject">WOMEN'S STUDIES (0453)</field><field name="subject">SOCIOLOGY, INDIVIDUAL AND FAMILY STUDIES (0628)</field><field name="subject">SOCIOLOGY, ETHNIC AND RACIAL STUDIES (0631)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/22</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Happily ever after:  Discourses of emotion, love and health in the intimate relationships of young adult New Zealanders</field><field name="creator">McKenzie, Donna Margaret</field><field name="description">Young people are often constructed in academic and lay explanations as an inherently risky population. They are the age group most likely to feature in public health statistics, especially those of intentional and unintentional injury. A common risk factor cited in these statistics is conflict within or breakdown of an inter-personal relationship, in particular intimate heterosexual relationships. Intimate relationships serve as markers of normal adulthood in New Zealand society, and many young people invest significantly in them for their emotional and material rewards. This study investigated the social processes and experiences that influence young adult New Zealanders' perceptions of their own and others' intimate relationships. It employed an inter-disciplinary framework of critical interpretive medical anthropology and a public health approach with a lifecourse perspective. A multi-interview method was used involving more than 90 people interviewed either in focus groups, as couples, or as individuals. Interviews focused on young people's ideas and experiences of healthy and unhealthy relationships, as well as the influence of families, friends, and popular culture on relationships.    Intimate relationships are based on naturalised gender differences that work to construct men as masculine/active and women as feminine/passive and hide disparities based on gender within a discourse of equality. The ideal healthy relationship is based on ideas of individualism, emotional and material inter-dependence, and the addition of other social networks into a partner relationship. Families are primary sources of information about and models for relationships. Friends are significant in establishing an adult identity separate to one's parents. Both families and friends are emotional safety nets in times of relationship difficulties. Understandings of popular culture and its products are most commonly experienced through gendered romantic narratives. Because of their ubiquity and popularity, information produced by mass media is particularly influential for young people.    Overall, young people reported that relationships are a considerable source of joy to them. However, when problems occur, they tend to revert to stereotypical and gendered cultural scripts rather than relying on individual knowledge. To mitigate the possible negative effects of these scripts, knowledge of the skills required to overcome relationships difficulties need to be made explicit and fostered by relevant public health and education policy and promotion activities.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ANTHROPOLOGY, CULTURAL (0326)</field><field name="subject">HEALTH SCIENCES, PUBLIC HEALTH (0573)</field><field name="subject">SOCIOLOGY, INDIVIDUAL AND FAMILY STUDIES (0628)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/24</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of different task types on L2 learners' intake and acquisition of two grammatical structures</field><field name="creator">Reinders, Hayo</field><field name="description">Recent years have seen a growing interest in the role of tasks in second language acquisition. A substantial body of research now exists investigating the effects of different task types and their accompanying instructions on learning. Less is known about how tasks affect intake and the relationship between intake and acquisition. This study investigated the effects of 1) implicit and explicit inductive instructions and 2) various task types on both intake and acquisition of two English grammatical structures. Fifty adult ESL learners enrolled in private language schools in New Zealand were pretested with the help of a timed and an untimed grammaticality judgement test for prior knowledge of negative adverbs and adverb placement and were randomly assigned to either a dictation, an individual reconstruction, or a collaborative reconstruction treatment. Treatments were accompanied by either implicit instructions (containing only practical instructions on how to perform the task) or explicit instructions (drawing participants' attention to the target structures and giving an example of them). Performance on the treatments was taken as a measure of intake, and talk-aloud reports were obtained to gauge participants' awareness during task completion. Gain scores from pretest to posttest and to delayed posttest were taken as an indication of learning effects. The results show that the explicit instructions of the inductive type used in this study were unable to affect participants' intake and acquisition in comparison with the implicit instructions. Also, the three types of treatments did not have an effect on acquisition in many cases. Where there was an effect, the treatments differentially affected intake and acquisition. Dictation led to high intake, but less acquisition, and the individual reconstruction treatment led to low intake, but greater acquisition. The collaborative reconstruction treatment was the most consistent of the three. The cognitively more demanding reconstruction treatments (i.e. those involving the retention of larger amounts of texts over longer periods of time) resulted in greater acquisition than the dictation treatment. The main theoretical implications of the results are that the type of inductive and low-level explicit instructions used in this study were not sufficient to differentially affect intake and acquisition. Other, more explicit types of treatments may be necessary. The results also indicate that task types that are relatively easy, affect intake to a greater extent than more demanding tasks, but that more demanding tasks are more likely to affect acquisition. On a methodological level, the concept of intake was found to be very difficult to operationalise, and it is suggested that additional measures be developed. Finally, the implications for teaching practice are that for relatively complex structures such as negative adverbs and adverb placement exposure to the input with minimal pedagogic intervention may not be sufficient. Teachers may also want to consider the effects of different task types on both intake and acquisition and both teachers and researchers need to be careful in drawing conclusionson the basis of immediate task performance.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Language, Linguistics (0290)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/25</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The function, design and distribution of New Zealand adzes</field><field name="creator">Turner, Marianne</field><field name="description">The main objective of this thesis was to understand the function, design and distribution of New Zealand adzes, aspects little studied in Polynesia as a whole. Methodology involved functional and manufacturing replication experiments and comparisons of these results with statistics derived from the analysis of almost 12,000 archaeological adzes. Methodology was guided by technological organization theory which states that technological strategies reflect human behaviours and that artefacts like adzes are physical manifestations of the strategies employed by people to overcome problems posed by environmental and resource conditions. Variability in adze morphology was discovered to be the outcome of ongoing technological adjustments to a range of conditions that were constrained by a set of functionally defined parameters. The nature of the raw material, both for the adzes themselves and to make them, had a major influence on adze technology and morphology within these functional parameters. Four basic functional adze types were identified fi-om distinct and consistent combinations of design attributes not previously recognized explicitly in previous adze typologies. It was found that design attributes previously considered significant like crosssection shape and butt reduction were more heavily influenced by raw material quality than functional specifications. It was also important to recognize that form and function changed over time with use, and because adzes were so valuable due to manufacturing costs, they were intensively curated. The majority of archaeological specimens studied for this thesis had seen major morphological and functional change. This dynamic was included ,in a typology based on 'adze state7 as findings suggested (1) that extending adze use-life and optimizing reworking potential was incorporated in initial design strategies, (2) that intensive curation may have played a major role in changes in adze morphology over time, and (3). that it had a major influence on distribution and discard patterns in the archaeological record. Having identified these influences on adze discard and distribution, two complex production and distribution networks were observed for the North Island based around Tahanga basalt and Nelson~Marlborough argillite. Each was complimentary to the other and involved other major and minor products and materials. Influential factors in the roles different settlements played in distribution included where people and raw materials were in relation to one another and the mode of transportation. The coastal location of early period settlements and important stone sources was an important aspect of these networks.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Anthropology, Archaeology (0324)</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420305 New Zealand cultural studies</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/26</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The vegetation pattern of Rangitoto</field><field name="creator">Julian, Andrea</field><field name="description">The vegetation of the island of Rangitoto was examined in order to determine the current vegetation pattern and to identify the factors which have influenced the development of this pattern. Information about the order and dates of eruptive events was reviewed to gauge the length of time that the various surfaces of the island have been available as a substrate for the development of a vegetation covering. Available geological information, dating evidence, historical accounts, tree ages, and Maori evidence all point to a single period of eruptive activity, probably only several years in duration, around the mid- to late-1300's (A.D.). The order of eruption was probably production of the ash that covers neighbouring islands, followed by cinder cone building, followed by eruption of the lava flows. The lava flows were found to consist of clinkery aa flows, blocky aa flows, and a flow type referred to as Rangitoto slab flows. These flow types could be partially distinguished from one another, using discriminant analysis, on the basis of the length of the longest fragment on a 5x5m plot and the number of fragments on a lxlm subplot. A new transition sequence of flow types from pahoehoe to aa lavas is proposed for viscous lavas undergoing low rates of shear strain. The vegetation pattern of the lava fields was examine using TWINSPAN and CANOCO analysis of foliage cover percentage information gathered from 125 5x5m plots. It was found to consist of a successional sequence of vegetation arranged in a mosaic. The mosaic was found to relate strictly to the underlying lava flow surface. Large Metrosideros grow in crevices on slab flows and next to large boulders on aa flows. Smaller Metrosideros grow on small slabs on slab flows. Mixed species scrub is found growing on unbroken slab surfaces. The relative rate of colonisation of different types of flows under different climatic conditions was considered. The Metrosideros hybrid swarm was studied using morphometric information. The putative parent species of the swarm were found, using Principal Components Analysis, to be Metrosideros excelsa and Metrosideros robusta. The Rangitoto Metrosideros population was found, using Canonical Variates Analysis, to be the result of hybridisation, followed by introgression towards M. excelsa . The probable F1 hybrids grow in early successional stage vegetation. The major geographical trend is the tendency for backcrossed hybrids to grow on the eastern side of the island, suggesting eastern origins of M. robusta seeds. The impact of browsing animals on the vegetation was studied over five years in exclosures and corresponding control sites. Metrosideros foliage recovered slightly. Griselinia lucida and Cyathodes juniperina seedlings were recruited into the shrub layers in exclosures, but not in control sites. Astelia seedlings also benefitted from the absence of browsing pressure, as did Thelymitra longifolia. The distribution of browsing animal populations in relation to the vegetation pattern was studied using faecal pellet recruitment data gathered by the New Zealand Forest Service in 1984. Both wallabies (Petrogale penicillata penicillata) and possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) were found to be distributed principally according to the amount of palatable foliage available to each species in each vegetation type.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Botany</field><field name="subject">BIOSC104: New Zealand Ecology and Conservation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany::270401 Plant systematics, taxonomy and phylogeny</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/27</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Expecting the best : instructional practices, teacher beliefs and student outcomes</field><field name="creator">Rubie, Christine Margaret</field><field name="description">The current study explored whether there are more pervasive teacher-centred expectations than the typical studies that find specific teacher-student expectation effects. Groups of teachers who had uniformly high or low expectations for their students were identified, and their instructional practices, beliefs and effects on the academic and social outcomes for their students were explored in four studies. Study One explored the academic outcomes for students in the high and low expectation teachers' classrooms over a year. Students in the classes of teachers with uniformly high expectations for their students made significantly greater progress in reading than their counterparts in the classes of teachers who had low expectations for their students. Study Two involved observations of the instructional and interactional practices of the different groups of teachers. Those with high expectations for all their students spent more time instructing their students, more frequently provided their students with a framework for their learning, questioned their students more and provided them with more feedback on their learning than the teachers who had uniformly low expectations. It also appeared from the observational data that the teachers who had uniformly high expectations for their students' learning provided a more positive socioemotional climate in which instruction took place. In Study Three the different groups of teachers were interviewed regarding their beliefs about how learning should be provided to students with high or low ability. It was found that the high expectation teachers believed there should be less differentiation in the learning opportunities provided to their low and high ability students than did the low expectation teachers. The former group of teachers also reported providing their students with more choice in their learning than did the latter group of teachers. Study Four focused on the academic and social self-perceptions of the students. The academic self-perceptions of the students who were in the classes with teachers who had high iii expectations for their learning increased across the school year while those in classrooms with teachers who had low expectations for their learning decreased. A model is built whereby it is suggested that teachers' expectations for their classes can have major effects on opportunities to learn, instructional practices, interactional patterns, student self-perceptions and academic outcomes.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Education, Educational Psychology (0525)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/28</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Examining 'globalisation' and 'convergence': A comparative study of university systems in Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand, 1946--1996 (China)</field><field name="creator">Li, Lucinda Kit Ching</field><field name="description">Globalisation has been a subject of intense debate and continual investigation in academic circles for almost 20 years. However, the opinions on what it is and what impact it makes on national systems are still as diverse and divided as ever. This research is an endeavour to contribute further to the understanding of the processes and outcomes of globalisation by undertaking a cross-national historical study of four university systems and four elite universities over an extended period of time. By comparing and juxtaposing the changes in university objectives, provision, funding and regulation between 1946 and 1996, it seeks to establish whether globalisation has reduced national variations and led to convergence in university policies and practices.    This research is structured in three parts. Part I incorporates three chapters: one on the analysis of globalisation and its driving forces; one on the concept of convergence and its manifestations in higher education; and one on the methodology of research. These three chapters together advance an understanding of the mechanisms constituting the convergence hypothesis and its investigation. Part II is comprised of four case studies which provide empirical evidence on the impact of globalisation and the investigation of the hypothesis. Part III provides an integrated analysis of the outcomes as well as a final appraisal of the study itself.    Findings show that global forces do have a strong homogenising tendency causing a high level of convergence across cultures and nations. But convergence is not an inevitable outcome of globalisation. A complicated picture of convergence and divergence is found. It is shown to be possible to have convergence in one aspect of the same policy and divergence in another, as in the examples of female participation and medium of instruction. It is also possible to have convergence among some countries but not others, as in the case of university regulation. The actual result depends on, one, the aspect of policy selected for study; and, two, the dynamic interactions of the following factors: the driving impetus of economic globalisation, the powerful influence of hegemonic states and mighty economic and trade supranational organisations, and the willingness and ability of the nation-states to make the changes. That is to say, the impact of global forces is context-bound. The evidence of both convergence and divergence present at the same time vindicates the complexity and contingent nature of the globalisation process. A more accurate assessment of global effects requires a proper conceptualisation of convergence, the necessary investigation of the global-national-institutional interfaces, and longitudinal comparative studies of different cultures and nations, as illustrated by this study.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Business Administration, Marketing (0338)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/29</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Creating New Zealanders:  Education and the formation of the state and the building of the nation</field><field name="creator">Stephenson, Maxine Sylvia</field><field name="description">Educational activity preceded official British presence in New Zealand. The development of the New Zealand state from crown colony, to a system of relatively autonomous provincial councils, to a centralized administration took place within a period of four decades. Co-terminous with and essential to the state's progressive securing of its authority was the institutionalization of separate national systems of education for Maori and Pakeha.    Whilst the ascendancy of the state and the securing of education as a central state concern proceeded ultimately with the sanction of the state and in accordance with its objectives it was not a straight forward process in a young nation which was born democratic, but was struggling to consolidate political and cultural unity. The various stages and the ultimate form that education in New Zealand took were closely linked to shifts in the nature and role of the state in its formative years, in the nature of its relationship with civil society, and in its official relationship with Maori. This provided the context and dynamic of the shift to state control as public schooling came to dominate over private or voluntary efforts, and as the particularism of isolated provincial settlements was replaced by a system designed to serve the nation as a whole.    Positing conceptual links between the development of national education and the processes of state formation and nation building in a colonizing context, this thesis argues that the institutionally differentiated form that universal education took in New Zealand produced a site through which socially, culturally and ideologically determined conceptions of &#8220;normality&#8221; would be legitimated and become hegemonic. By nationalizing education to legitimate a culture of uniformity based on a specific set of norms, individual New Zealanders were differentially created according to class, gender and ethnicity, and to physical, intellectual, behavioural and sensory functioning.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">EDUCATION, HISTORY OF (0520)</field><field name="subject">EDUCATION, SOCIOLOGY OF (0340)</field><field name="subject">HISTORY, ASIA, AUSTRALIA AND OCEANIA (0332)</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/30</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An assessment of EEG biofeedback for the remediation of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder</field><field name="creator">Heywood, Charles Edward</field><field name="description">Seven boys between the ages of 7 and 12 with Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), some also with Specific Learning Disabilities (LD) and/or elevated aggression scales on the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL), were involved in this study of the effectiveness of EEG Biofeedback for the remediation of ADHD. A multiple-baseline design with an embedded ABAB component was used to compare baseline, 12-15 Hz Sensorimotor Rhythm (SMR) EEG Biofeedback (&#8220;active&#8221;) and single-blind sham feedback (&#8220;placebo&#8221;) conditions. Seven dependent variables including the ADHD Rating Scale, Child Attention Profile, Children's Checking Task, Controlled Oral Word Fluency Test, paired associate learning and continuous performance tasks were combined as z-scores into a single composite repeated measure. Visual and multiple baseline analyses were inconclusive. The primary analysis was by randomisation test with statistical control for overall trend. Randomisation test results were combined across five subjects (two subjects having failed to complete the study) using techniques for combining independent probabilities; for the combined group the placebo vs. active contrast was significant (p &lt; 0.02) with the active conditions displaying the more improved scores. An examination of effect sizes by subject and condition showed that the placebo vs. active contrast was significant (p &lt; 0.05, based on the confidence intervals for effect estimates) with a large effect size if trend was ignored and the two &#8220;drop-outs&#8221; were excluded but non-significant with a small effect size if overall trend was controlled, and the two drop-outs included. Effect sizes calculated pre-post were medium on average, and Reliable Change Indices for CBCL parent rated attention were significant for five subjects (p &lt; 0.001). There was no improvement in academic performance as assessed by pre-post Wide Range Achievement Test-Revised. There was no significant effect of condition on EEG Theta/SMR ratio, although there were some significant correlations with individual dependent variables. Four of six children continued to improve on the composite score from the end of the study to six-month follow-up. Results were discussed in light of non-specific treatment effects such as tacit behavioural training, Fried's respiration hypothesis, the cognitive energetic model of attention and confounds due to trend and subject mortality. It was concluded that EEG biofeedback appears to have beneficial effects on ADHD symptoms but these are due largely to non-specific treatment factors and confounds such as regression to the mean.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">PSYCHOLOGY, PHYSIOLOGICAL (0989)</field><field name="subject">PSYCHOLOGY, CLINICAL (0622)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/33</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Parent-child relationships, peer functioning, and preschool hyperactivity</field><field name="creator">Keown, Louise June</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis was to examine the parent-child relationships and peer functioning of community-identified, 4-year-old boys with hyperactive behaviour problems. The sample consisted of 33 pervasively hyperactive boys and 34 control children. Parenting and child behaviours, and family life factors were assessed at home using a range of measures including the Parental Account of Children's Symptoms Interview (PACS), the Parenting Scale, the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), and the Life Events Questionnaire. In addition, maternal directiveness and synchrony were coded from videotaped parent-child interaction during free play. Children's peer relations were assessed with teacher ratings on the Child Behavior Scale (CBS) and observer ratings of peer interactions at kindergarten.    Results showed that parents of hyperactive boys used less effective parenting skills in disciplinary situations and in coping with child behaviour problems, and spent less time in positive parent-child interaction than comparison group parents. Mothers of hyperactive boys also engaged in fewer synchronous play interactions with their sons and gave more negative ratings on indices of life stress. Poor parent coping, father-child communication, maternal synchrony, negative disciplinary practices, and life stress were significantly associated with hyperactivity after adjusting for the effects of conduct problems. The best parenting predictor of hyperactivity was maternal coping.    Compared with control children, the hyperactive boys received significantly higher ratings on exclusion by peers, aggressive, noncompliant, and non-social behaviours, as well as significantly lower ratings of prosocial behaviour and peer acceptance. These between-group differences in social functioning remained significant after statistical control for the effects of conduct problems. Further analysis suggested that the associations between hyperactivity and child social behaviours were partly or wholly explained by group differences in exposure to parenting behaviours that are important for children's social development.    These findings highlight the need to examine more closely the role of parenting behaviours in shaping the course, prognosis and treatment outcomes in relation to the behavioural and social adjustment of preschool hyperactive children. The implications of these findings for early childhood intervention in hyperactive behaviour problems are discussed.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">PSYCHOLOGY, DEVELOPMENTAL (0620)</field><field name="subject">PSYCHOLOGY, CLINICAL (0622)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/34</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Phenotypic characterisation of the tremor mutant and AAV mediated aspartoacylase gene transfer in the rat model of Canavan disease</field><field name="creator">McPhee, Scott William John</field><field name="description">The doctoral studies described in this thesis involve the phenotypic characterization of the tremor rat, an animal model of Canavan disease, and a proof of principle gene transfer study in this model. The phenotype of the tremor rat is examined at the genetic, molecular, cellular, neurochemical, physical and behavioural levels, and tremor mutants are described within the context of Canavan disease. Tremor mutants appear to share many phenotypes with both human patients and to the knock-out mouse model. The deletion of aspartoacylase results in a total loss of the capacity to metabolize N-acetyl-aspartate to acetate and aspartate in brain, leading to elevations in brain N-acetyl-aspartate levels, changes in cell and tissue morphology, and physical and behavioural deficits including mild akinesia and loss of normal motor coordination and balance. Parallel to this work was the development of a gene transfer approach to treat Canavan disease, involving Adeno-associated virus mediated delivery of aspartoacylase to the mammalian central nervous system. Gene transfer was undertaken in tremor rat mutants, and analysis was made of gene expression and function as well as the effect of aspartoacylase expression on improving the phenotypic deficits observed in mutant animals. Gene expression was observed at the RNA and protein level, with recombinant protein observed in cell soma and processes. Although not significant the data suggested a trend of decreased NAA levels after aspartoacylase transfer in comparison to animals injected with a vector encoding green fluorescent protein. Improvement was noted in the rotorod phenotype with mutant animals receiving aspartoacylase gene transfer performing better at tests of balance and coordinated locomotion than animals receiving a control vector. The study provided evidence that Adeno-associated virus mediated aspartoacylase gene transfer to the brain improves some of the deficits in tremor mutants, and supports the rationale of human gene transfer for Canavan disease.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">BIOLOGY, NEUROSCIENCE (0317)</field><field name="subject">BIOLOGY, MOLECULAR (0307)</field><field name="subject">BIOLOGY, GENETICS (0369)</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/35</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Criticizing and responding to criticism in a foreign language: A study of Vietnamese learners of English</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Minh Thi Thuy</field><field name="description">Interlanguage pragmatics research has contributed a great deal to our understanding of L2 pragmatic use but less to our understanding of L2 pragmatic development, although developmental issues are also its primary research goal. Additionally, previous studies have been confined to a rather small set of speech acts, under-researching such face-damaging acts as criticizing and responding to criticism even though these may be more challenging for L2 learners.    The present study examines pragmatic development in the use of criticizing and responding to criticism by a group of Vietnamese EFL learners with a view to shedding light on the pragmatic properties of these speech acts. IL data were collected from 12 high beginners, 12 intermediate learners, and 12 advanced learners, via a written questionnaire and role play, and analyzed with reference to L1 and L2 baseline data collected from 12 Vietnamese and 12 Australian NSs via the same methods. Metapragmatic data were collected via retrospective interview.    Four main findings are discussed. Firstly, the learners criticized and responded to criticism very differently from the NSs. This difference might have adversely affected how the learners negotiated their intentions expressed via speech act realizations. Secondly, there was little evidence of any proficiency effect on the learners' use of these two speech acts. This was probably because pragmatic development was limited by the EFL context, as the learners had had insufficient exposure to the target norms. Thirdly, there was evidence of pragmatic transfer in the learners' production. This transfer was affected by the learners' perception of L1-L2 proximity and assumption of L2 reasonableness. Finally, the retrospective interviews with learners suggested four main sources of influence on their pragmatic decision-making: insufficient L2 pragmatic knowledge, transfer of communication and learning, processing difficulty, and learning experience.    The present study lends support to a number of SLA theories, including Bialystoks' processing model and Meisel et al.'s complexification hypothesis. It found that the major challenge for learners in L2 pragmatic acquisition is to gain control over processing. It also found an acquisitional order of modality markers which was dependent upon their structural complexity and the processing demands involved in producing them.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">LANGUAGE, LINGUISTICS (0290)</field><field name="subject">EDUCATION, LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE (0279)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/36</field></doc><doc><field name="title">When worlds collide: ICTs, English teachers and high-stakes assessment (New Zealand)</field><field name="creator">Coogan, Phil</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is to ascertain the degree to which high-stakes assessment for qualifications, such as New Zealand's National Certificate of Educational Achievement (NCEA), act as a barrier to secondary English teachers' use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) with their students. Although the focus is on high-stakes assessment for qualifications, other factors, which might also facilitate or hinder English teachers' use of ICTs, such as professional development and infrastructural, technical and access issues, are also considered.    The literature review summarises the factors which tend to constrain or encourage teachers' use of ICTs, with a special focus on the considerable constraint placed on secondary teachers by their role in preparing and assessing students for high-stakes qualifications. The literature review also highlights the lack of convincing research into the impact on learning of ICTs but reveals that, in the subject English, there is some evidence of a positive impact when appropriate ICTs are used by well trained teachers in appropriate contexts.    Key NCEA foundation and implementation documents and publicity, achievement standards and assessment activities were analysed to ascertain the degree of official endorsement for the use of ICTs in secondary schools and English programmes in particular. To gauge the perceptions of New Zealand English teachers about the constraints and encouragers of ICTs in their teaching, all NCEA level one English teachers were surveyed. This was followed by face-to-face and online focus groups in which trends revealed in the survey were explored.    Document analysis revealed considerable official optimism that the flexibility and internal assessment of the NCEA would enable teachers to make greater use of ICTs. The achievement standards and supporting assessment activities however, tend to situate ICTs at the margins of English programmes as optional extras which, if used at all, tend to support current practice. The focus groups confirmed survey findings that, although English teachers are significant users of ICTs in their personal and professional lives, although they believe in the educational advantages of ICTs and although they work in schools and departments which support the classroom use of ICTs, they face significant constraints which prevent them making as much use of ICTs as they would like in their teaching. Most significant among these constraints is pressure of course coverage and lack of class time (largely attributable to the need to prepare students for high-stakes assessments). Other constraints include lack of adequate access to ICTs and technical support, and lack of appropriate professional development and time to learn about ICTs.    Based on the literature review and research findings, recommendations are provided for schools, policy makers and researchers. Key among these is the need to acknowledge the profound influence of high-stakes qualifications on secondary schools and teachers and evolve such qualifications to encourage and enable desired innovations. It is recommended that ICTs could be infused into English and eventually, inter-disciplinary programmes, through the creation of innovative, ICT infused achievement standards which could be combined into flexibly structured courses which better meet the needs of twenty first century students. Also recommended are approaches which enable greater access to ICTs for English teachers and methods of professional development which have proved effective with adult learners.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">EDUCATION, TECHNOLOGY (0710)</field><field name="subject">EDUCATION, LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE (0279)</field><field name="subject">EDUCATION, TESTS AND MEASUREMENTS (0288)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/37</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Computing exact approximations of a Chaitin omega number</field><field name="creator">Shu, Chi-Kou</field><field name="description">A Chaitin Omega number, &#937;, is the halting probability of a universal Chaitin (self-delimiting Turing) machine. Every &#937; number is both  computably enumerable and random. In particular, every &#937; number is non-computable. In this thesis, we describe a method to compute the exact values of the first 64 successive bits of a natural  Chaitin Omega number.    We first describe a model of computation which has been defined and proved to be a universal Chaitin machine U. We then propose a method (procedure) which combines iterative executions of an algorithm with mathematical analysis to get the exact values of the first successive 64 bits of the corresponding Chaitin &#937;U number of U.    This particular defined Chaitin machine U is essentially a register machine and has been implemented in Java. We call it the canonical compressed model (or compressed model) as it allows only &#8216;canonical&#8217; program strings to be processed in U. Thus, many input strings which are illegal, hence useless, are ignored and never involved in the computational process. In addition, the compressed design shortens the length of all instructions so that relatively short strings now contain somewhat complex programs.    A simulator for U, written in Java, is a primary part of the project. The algorithm is executed iteratively, computing step by step an increasing sequence of rational numbers (in binary) to approximate &#937; U. In the n-th step, the algorithm produces four main output files: all halting strings, looping strings, run-time errors, and prefix strings (incomplete programs). In each step, all prefix strings (of the previous step) are read and processed one by one. Each string is extended by 7 bits (ASCII code representations for symbols) to generate new strings that are examined one by one to detect any lexical, syntactic, semantic, or run-time error in each of them. Any of those strings with an error detected is discarded to save storage space and execution time.    We solve the Halting Problem for all programs for U of length less than or equal to 84 bits so we can calculate an increasing sequence of exact approximations converging to &#937;U. By means of a mathematical analysis the first successive 64 bits, 0000001000000100000110001000011010001111110010111011101000010000 of the 84 bits are proved to be the exact first bits of &#937;U. Actually, more bits can be obtained by this procedure if the disk space is sufficient for it to go on, but this procedure cannot be extended indefinitely.    In order to assure that our computing result is correct, we have proved that all input strings of length less than or equal to 84 executed in  U over 100 steps are not halting programs.*   *This dissertation is a compound document (contains both a paper copy and a CD as part of the dissertation).

Erosion-corrosion is a generalised wear phenomenon where the combined effect of each degradation mechanism generates more extensive mass loss than the sum of each mechanism acting independently. Previous research has highlighted several theoretical mechanisms under this generalized process, ranging from the erosion induced breakdown of oxide scales in corrosive environments, through to the development of oxide layers in highly erosive environments. Prior to this current work experimental simulation of these mechanisms has focused on bulk alloy materials with well characterised oxidation responses, under conditions of low temperature, low erodent impact velocity and high erodent flux, conditions which are readily generated within laboratory scale rigs and which tend towards the low impact energy conditions encountered within fluidised bed combustors. Few works have addressed erosion-corrosion under simulated turbine conditions of high temperature, high erodent impact velocity and low erodent flux. While comparative trials have been run under such conditions on a purely mass loss basis, little has been presented regarding the microstructural analysis of such degradation, particularly for materials that rely on the industrially relevant, slow growing oxide scales Cr2O3 and Al2O3.  Thermally sprayed Cr3C2-NiCr coatings are routinely applied to combat wear at high temperature due to the high wear resistance imparted by the hard carbide particles and the high temperature oxidation resistant nature of the Cr2O3 oxide formed over both phases. However, most published work characterising the erosion-corrosion response of these coatings has been conducted on a comparative basis by contrasting coatings of various composition ratios, deposited by various techniques, with the response of well characterised bulk materials. Little has been presented on the microstructural mechanism of erosioncorrosion of Cr3C2-NiCr coatings, a point highlighted by the limited understanding of the oxidation mechanism of the Cr3C2 phase, the oxidation mechanisms of the combined composite Cr3C2-NiCr and the influence of the coating splat structure on the oxidation response. While the erosion response of thermal spray coatings and bulk cermets is more widely understood, most works have been conducted under milder conditions than used in the current work. In addition previous works have been conducted primarily on assprayed coatings with few works taking into account the effect of heat treatment induced changes in the coating composition and microstructure that occur with extended in-service exposure at elevated temperature.  In addressing the short comings in the current state of knowledge, the aim of this work was to characterise the mechanism of erosion-corrosion of high velocity sprayed Cr3C2-NiCr thermal spray coatings under turbine conditions, incorporating the effect of variation in the composition and carbide distribution with inflight degradation, variations in starting powder morphology, heat treatment, erosion conditions and exposure temperature.  75 Cr3C2-25(Ni20Cr) coatings were deposited by Aerospray HVAF, GMA Microjet HVOF, Stellite Jet Kote HVOF and TAFA JP-5000 HVOF spraying under optimised conditions using agglomerated/sintered and blended powders. The prealloyed powder based coatings, characterised in terms of microhardness, porosity content and phase degradation, were found to exceed the average values of coating quality presented in the literature. The blended powder based coating of this work was comparable with the coating attributes presented in the literature for plasma and HVOF coatings based on this powder morphology. Based on these results the coatings were considered representative of those sprayed industrially and therefore the responses of the samples in this work to oxidation and erosion were considered indicative of the response of industrially applied coatings of this composition in service.  Heat treatment trials were conducted on the Aerospray HVAF and Microjet HVOF coatings at 900&#186;C in air and argon for up to 60 days to simulate the compositional and microstructural development of these coatings under elevated temperature conditions in service. In the prealloyed powder based coatings, rapid carbide precipitation occurred within the first two days in both coatings to reach the steady state composition of 75-80vol%. Minimal in-flight carbide dissolution in the HVAF coating led to preferential carbide precipitation on the retained carbide grains. In the Microjet HVOF coatings, which suffered extensive inflight carbide dissolution, carbide precipitation occurred as fine precipitates in the carbide-free zones, forming large sponge-like agglomerates. With extended exposure Ostwald ripening led to coarsening of the individual carbide grain size and widespread agglomeration of the carbide grains into an extensive three dimensional network after 30 days exposure, with minimal development out to 60 days. Compositionally, heat treatment led to a dramatic reduction in the supersaturated matrix phase Cr content, with the steady state Cr composition of the Microjet HVOF coating exceeding that of the Aerospray HVAF coating based on XRD analysis. Cr3C2 was the only carbide detected with heat treatment. Heat treatment of the blended powder based coating led to sintering of the single phase splats. Diffusion of the carbide elements into the matrix phase splats occurred, allowing fingers and nodules of the carbide to develop into this phase as well as increasing the matrix phase Cr concentration.  Oxidation of Cr3C2 by hot stage XRD analysis at 600&#186;C, combined with TGA analysis at 600-850&#186;C, supported the mechanism of stepwise decarburisation prior to Cr2O3 formation, presented as one possible mechanism in the literature. Oxidation of the Cr3C2-NiCr coatings over the range 700-850&#186;C was dependent on the starting powder morphology and the extent of dissolved carbide in the matrix phase. Oxidation of the as-sprayed prealloyed powder based coatings was dictated by the matrix phase, the high Cr concentration resulting from carbide dissolution leading to rapid growth of the Cr2O3 phase over the oxidising carbide grains. Growth stresses induced by such overgrowth lead to the formation of interfacial voids over the carbide grains at high temperature. Heat treatment reduced the matrix phase Cr concentration, resulting in the coating phases oxidising independently with a reduced magnitude of lateral matrix based scale growth over the carbide phase. In the blended powder based coating, bulbous Ni oxides dominated the scale topography. With extended exposure a continuous Cr2O3 scale formed below the faster growing Ni oxides, which enabled lateral growth of the scale over the carbide based Cr2O3 scales. Following heat treatment the matrix phase Cr concentration increased, minimising the development of Ni oxides on this phase.  Erosion studies were carried out in a custom built high temperature erosion apparatus. Ambient temperature trials were conducted using Al2O3 erodent at velocities of 150m/s. The as-sprayed prealloyed powder based coatings exhibited a brittle impact response, which was accentuated in the Microjet HVOF coating by the increased extent of in-flight carbide dissolution and the splat structure which made this sample more susceptible to brittle erosion mechanisms. Heat treatment of these coatings led to sintering of the splats and a more ductile impact response due to the increased ductility of the matrix phase. The as-sprayed blended powder based coatings exhibited a range of impact responses from brittle erosion of the carbide through to ductile erosion of the matrix based splats. Mass loss was accentuated by the poor intersplat adhesive strength. Heat treatment led to sintering of the splats, resulting in a more microstructural based erosion response.  The two prealloyed powder based coatings generated similar erosion rates under the aggressive conditions, distinctly more erosion resistant than the blended powder based coatings. Heat treatment improved the erosion resistance of all the coatings, however, the duration of heat treatment had a negligible effect on the magnitude of erosive mass loss.  Erosion at 800&#186;C, with an impact velocity of 235m/s, lead to significantly deeper erodent penetration into the coating than noted at ambient temperature. The significant increase in the matrix phase ductility at elevated temperature minimized the impact of carbide dissolution on the matrix impact response in the prealloyed powder based coatings. The primary effect of carbide dissolution was to reduce the carbide concentration, allowing deformation of the matrix to dictate the coating response. Carbide development with heat treatment significantly reduced the ability of the matrix to deform in this manner. The increased matrix phase ductility in the blended powder based coating reduced the concentration of impact energy on the splat boundaries, leading to a more microstructural based erosion response. Heat treatment had a negligible effect on the coating response, given the reduced significance of the splat boundary adhesion.  Erosion at 700&#186;C generated similar erosion responses in the prealloyed powder based coatings to those noted at 800&#186;C, the lower matrix phase ductility reflected in the more brittle response evident as brittle cracking and fracture. The effect of carbide development with heat treatment was not as dramatic as at 800&#186;C due to the reduced matrix phase ductility at this temperature. Erosion of the blended powder based coating at 700&#186;C generated the same spectrum of erosion response as noted at 800&#186;C in both the as-sprayed and heat treated states, with the variation in matrix phase ductility with temperature overshadowed by the heterogeneous coating impact response resulting from the heterogeneous phase distribution.  The steady state erosion rate at 700&#186;C was comparable across all of the coatings in both the as-sprayed and heat treated conditions. At 800&#186;C, heat treatment had a negative impact on the prealloyed powder based coatings, but no definitive effect on the blended powder based coatings. The Microjet HVOF coatings were more erosion resistant than the Aerospray HVAF coatings under these conditions. These results pointed to a reduction in the significance of the coating splat structure on the magnitude of erosion, in favour of a more microstructural based response at high temperature.  In both the ambient and elevated temperature trials the coating microhardness values proved to be a poor indicator in predicting the magnitude or relative ranking of the erosion response of the different coatings under these aggressive erosion conditions.  Erosion-corrosion under turbine conditions of high temperature, high erodent velocity and low erodent flux, was simulated by oxidizing samples at 900&#186;C and subjecting them to one second of erosion every 48 hours over a period of 60 days. The degradation testing was assessed in accelerated testing in additional trials by polishing the oxide scale formed at 900&#186;C from the sample surface every 48 hours over the same time period. Under these conditions the coatings formed thick oxide scales that penetrated into the coating. Preferential internal oxidation of the Cr3C2 phase occurred in the coating, consuming the grains in the near surface zone through the formation of Cr2O3 to a depth dependent upon the test temperature. Oxygen ingress occurred along the carbide-matrix interface and was accentuated in the regions of impact damage surrounding the erodent indentations. Internal oxidation of the carbide phase sealed off the pockets of matrix phase which were eventually consumed by oxidation once they were no longer able to maintain a protective Cr2O3 oxide. The extent of internal attack was consistent in the 20, 40 and 60 day samples, suggesting that the internal oxidation front proceeded at a constant rate in front of the erosion front into the coating. The prealloyed powder based coatings were more resistant to such internal degradation relative to the blended powder based coatings, with an internally oxidised zone of 6&#236;m relative to the 10&#236;m thick internally oxidized band in the blended powder based coating. While each erodent impact event may be classified as oxidation affected erosion, the low erodent flux effectively led to a long-term response more accurately described as erosion affected oxidation.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Engineering, General (0537)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/39</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Technological law :  societal control of technology and the potential of the world standards movement</field><field name="creator">Hitchcock, Edward</field><field name="description">Over the last three centuries the rapidly increasing influence of technology has come to dominate every aspect of human life. Progressive realization of adverse effects has led to increasing demand for and imposition of control measures. The concept of common law embodied in legal tradition have been found inadequate, and forced a change to "enacted law". The regulatory explosion necessitated delegation from legislative to executive agencies.The resulting techniques of control developed in the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia, Canada and the United States are examined. One common factor stands out, the extensive dependence of law-making bodies on independent technical specification material from non-government sources, and the confused, conflicting, and inconsistent methods of utilizing those specifications in law-making. Most of this independent material comes from Standards bodies. Their basic concept, the establishing of acceptable practice by prior agreement, is outlined, and the growth of the movement traced from the original development in Britain to a World-wide movement. Their processes of consultation and consensus represent a practical democratic system of self regulation. Studies of these aspects are rare, but a number of those relevant are reviewed, ranging from the Robens committee in Britain, through Building Code Reform in New Zealand, to a whole series of very recent reports from the United States, including a Presidential Task Force, an attempt to establish a National Standards Policy, a Federally commissioned study by a Professor of Law, and a Presidential Executive Order.From these emerge the pattern of complaint: Regulatory control is excessive, rigid, and liable to cause economic waste. It tends to be ineffective, and fails to achieve primary aims. As technology development exposes society to greater risks, efficiency becomes more vital, and failure to achieve control a serious danger. Problems arise from the failure of traditional legal approaches to adapt to the newer challenge of technology, particularly the legal acceptance of law "as it is" without recognition that the task calls for developing the law-making process to meet the needs of the changed situation. It is contended that many of the problems in regulatory control of technology come from the practice of making technical specification material direct legal command. The various reports reviewed comment on the limitations inherent in negative legislative control, the irrelevance of litigation, Court action and punishment, to the fundamental problem of achieving successful control. There is need for the encouragement of self regulation, and establishment of appropriate links with law.The special characteristics and responsibilities of law controlling technology are brought out, and call for identification as a separate branch of law: "Technological Law". Such law, it is contended, needs to make optimum usage of (a) the factors that have contributed to the dominance of technology, including the scientific approach, and the practice of prior agreement and (b) the essential components of democratic society, including participation, consensus, decentralized control, and self regulation associated with a formal method of determining acceptability.Practical proposals are developed involving the recognition of the practice of legislating by reference to independent technical specifications the encouragement of self-regulation processes through statutory backing, and their linking by recognition of the dyad in law, a separation of fundamental aims and principles appropriate to law from the means of meeting these aims.There is detailed examination of the three themes of reform. Techniques of the reference process, the legal objections, and the range of practices are examined, and acceptable technique suggested. The significance and importance of self-regulation is examined, and the contribution of "Standards" developed. A detailed examination is made of the various examples of two part law found in legislation, or in the studies reviewed. The framing of law in terms of general requirements is considered in relation to the problem of certainty and the idealization of the performance concept. The prerogative of the law-maker to designate certain practices as complying with general requirements is established as fundamental. The objection that this is a function of interpretation which lies exclusively with the Courts is discussed and the principle advanced that the vital Court function should never be called into the routine observance area.Technological law has as its essential aim the achievement of observance. Punishment, and court action is indication of failure. The emphasis must be on understanding and facilitating compliance. The second part of the dyad calls for sets of interrelated, interdependent specifications of acceptable practice, serving equally differing specialized laws, technical practices, commercial practices and education, and clarifying in positive fashion that which complies with law. The existing, established mechanisms of the world Standards movement are seen as providing the sets of technical specifications to fulfill this second function. This industry-developed process of self regulation utilises the techniques of prior agreement and in practical form, the elusive concept of consensus.Studies have emphasised the superior ability of the system to call in technical resources and voluntary effort to the service of law-making, in comparison with the resources of a governmental agency. The desirable aim is partnership, and the utilization of substantial measures of voluntary compliance.The question of recognition and authority for Standards and their producing organizations is seen as essential, and criteria are developed from the examples reviewed, notably from the pioneer New Zealand Act of 1941.The study emphasizes the little recognised function of Standards organizations of identifying acceptable practice, providing what has become an essential component of the machinery of government of a modern state.The mechanism provides a basis of certainty for commercial operations, and, through the strength of consumer or purchaser choice, an effective method of control as an alternative to yet more complex regulatory activity.</field><field name="date">1978</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Engineering, Mechanical (0548)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/40</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Spirit of Christ and the postmodern city: Transformative revival among Auckland's Evangelicals and Pentecostals (New Zealand)</field><field name="creator">Grigg, Vivian Lawrence</field><field name="description">This study develops a missional theology for both process and goals of 'Citywide Transformative Revival.' This has been grounded in the local realities of Auckland as a representative modern/postmodern city.    Global discussion among urban missions strategists and theologians have provoked the question: 'What is the relationship of the Spirit of Christ to the transformation of a postmodern city?' This has been examined in a limited manner, using two local indicators: the New Zealand revival (for the work of the Holy Spirit) and Auckland city (for emergent modern/postmodern megacities). This has resulted in an exploration of  revival theology and its limitations among Auckland's Pentecostals and Evangelicals and a proposal for a theology of transformative revival that engages the postmodern city.    To accomplish this, a research framework is proposed within an evangelical perspective, a postmodern hermeneutic of 'transformational conversations ', an interfacing of faith community conversations and urban conversations.    This is used to develop a new theory of 'citywide transformative revival' as an expansion of revival theories, a field within pneumatology. Citywide transformative revival is a concept of synergistic revivals in multiple sectors of a mega-city. This results in long-term change of urban vision and values towards the principles of the Kingdom of God.    A theology of transformative process is developed from apostolic and prophetic themes. These are outcomes of gifts released in revival. Transformative revival results in new transformative apostolic and prophetic structures that engage the postmodern city soul.    Transformation implies goals. The results of revival, the transformative visions for the city, are developed from themes of the City of God and the Kingdom of God. I expand largely 'spiritual' Western formulations of the Kingdom to a holistic Kingdom vision of the spiritual, communal and material aspects of the postmodern city. These enable conversation spaces with modern urbanism and postmodernism.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">THEOLOGY (0469)</field><field name="subject">SOCIOLOGY, PUBLIC AND SOCIAL WELFARE (0630)</field><field name="subject">RELIGION, GENERAL (0318)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/41</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Clarifying leadership:  The role of the school principal as an educational leader</field><field name="creator">Thew, Laurie</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the role of primary school principals as they undertake their role as educational leaders. Part One summarises theories about leadership and places principals' educational leadership in context. Leadership is defined as a social process whereby principals blend biography and context to reconcile positivist, systemic requirements and recommendations with appropriate localised, and individualised, expectations and aspirations.    Part Two outlines an ethnographic methodology that justifies a process to gather and analyse data on the work of three principal subjects. This material is presented in cameo form and supported by questionnaire data from a further group of principal colleagues. Principals' leadership is identified as the interpretation of expectations and resources that results in particular actions. This interpretation is sourced in both context and personal biography.    Part Three consists of data analysis and findings. The influence and interplay of context and personal biography are outlined. Conclusions are drawn as to the differences between leadership and management practices, and specific leadership activities performed by principals are identified. This leads to a clarification of leadership as a process of control (as opposed to power) that defines, rather than accommodates, the rules of realisation as to appropriate action. Recommendations are made regarding further study into the issues of personal identity, leadership style and the urgent need for principal pre-service and in-service professional development.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/43</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Mr Jones' wives':  World War II war brides of New Zealand servicemen</field><field name="creator">Fortune, Gabrielle Ann</field><field name="description">Frederick Jones, Minister of Defence during World War II, was responsible for the transportation to New Zealand of the foreign-born wives and fianc&#233;es of New Zealand servicemen. Between 1942 and 1948 servicemen returning from theatres of war in Europe, the Middle East and the Pacific brought over 3000 wives and 700 fianc&#233;es to New Zealand. Portrayed as homogeneous, young, working-class British housewives who made hasty ill-considered marriages, war brides, in fact, proved to be varied in origin, age, occupation and education. Whirlwind romances and short courtships were not the norm. This thesis examines the consequences of the decision to marry a New Zealander and migrate and the impact of the journey and settlement. The full glare of publicity that greeted war brides on arrival focused attention on their compatibility with, and adaptability to, the receiving society. Adjustment was however fraught with difficulties.    Memory and loss are implicit in the experience of migration. War brides expressed this in terms of the rift with their pasts and a lack of shared memories. On arrival in New Zealand war brides dispersed around the country in an extreme 'pepper-potting' pattern. When their only connection with New Zealand was their locally-born husband they suffered social isolation and sometimes a devastating sense of loneliness. The resulting marginalisation they experienced was evident in their oral history narratives. Ambivalence and recourse to serendipity as an explanation for past actions were elements of the dis-composure discernable in narratives.    In spite of their varied religious, social and class backgrounds, this diverse cohort formed a war bride identity based on shared experience rather than national or ethnic origin. Far from dissipating, their war-bride identity has been consolidated into an enduring image most tangibly expressed in the extant war brides' clubs, although club attendance is not a prerequisite of war bride identity.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">HISTORY, MODERN (0582)</field><field name="subject">ANTHROPOLOGY, CULTURAL (0326)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/44</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intercountry adoption of Eastern European children in New Zealand: Issues of culture</field><field name="creator">Scherman, Rhoda M</field><field name="description">Virtually all of the research on the ethnic identity development of children in intercountry adoption (ICA) has been on transracial adoptions (TRA). Little is known about the ethnic socialisation of internationally adopted children, raised in racially similar adoptive homes. Within the TRA literature, it has been found that transracially adopted children tend to ethnically identify with the white majority culture. That tendency has also been linked to adoptive parents' attitudes about the birth culture, and speculation that most parents are assimilating their children to the dominant culture. Research on TRA has also revealed that despite low ethnic identification, most adoptees score highly on indices of self-concept.    In the present study, 162 New Zealand adoptive families of European descent, with children adopted predominately from Eastern Europe, were surveyed concerning their experiences and attitudes about the importance of their children's birth culture. Results from the surveys showed that the majority of families engaged in a range of cultural activities, and made efforts to socialise with people of their child's birth ethnicity. In addition, most of the adoptive parents expressed a desire that their children ethnically identify with the birth culture, as well as with the New Zealand culture. Almost all of the families researched the birth country before travelling to collect their children, and most parents kept part or all of their child's original name.    A sub-sample of 52 of the adopted children was also interviewed in a second phase of the study. Measures of ethnic identity were obtained, using the Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure (Phinney, 1992), as were adjustment scores, using the Piers-Harris Children's Self-Concept Scale (Piers, 1984). Findings revealed that overall, the children had moderate identification with the birth culture, and moderate to high self-concept scores, which were not correlated with one another other.    From the parent surveys, a scale was derived to assess the parent's sensitivity to culture. Known as the 'Cultural Sensitivity Measure' (CSM), this score was statistically compared to the children's ethnic identity scores, to test the assumption that the parents' attitudes about the birth culture would influence the children's ethnic identification with the birth culture. While the parents had moderate sensitivity scores, no relationship was found between the parents CSM scores and the children's MEIM scores.    Overall, these findings suggest that the internationally adopted children in New Zealand are well adjusted, interested in their ethnic origins, and being parented by New Zealanders who support the children's interest in their birth culture. Future areas of research were identified, and recommendations to families, professionals and policymakers were offered.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">PSYCHOLOGY, SOCIAL (0451)</field><field name="subject">PSYCHOLOGY, DEVELOPMENTAL (0620)</field><field name="subject">SOCIAL WORK (0452)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/45</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The investment risk of institutional-grade commercial real estate in Australia</field><field name="creator">Schuck, Edward John</field><field name="description">Knowledge of the investment risk of investment-grade commercial real estate (&#8216;ICRE&#8217;) is important because it determines the approaches which should be taken to portfolio management. However, relatively little is known about this risk.    This research expands the body of knowledge of ICRE investment risk by producing conclusions about the information content of prices and the distribution of returns in the ICRE context. It is broken into three main parts.    First, the ICRE returns-generating process is characterised to form a basis for deducing theoretical conclusions about the information content of prices and the stochastic attributes of returns. The rationale for this approach lies in capital markets literature, which demonstrates that the characteristics of the information structure of markets, the decision-making processes of investors and the market trading mechanism determine the main attributes of the process of price evolution (which is assumed to be the main driver of returns). The analysis concludes that ICRE prices are partially informed, and changes in prices are described by a &#8216;jump&#8217; process.    Second, analysis of a database of &#8216;large&#8217; price changes supplied by the Property Council of Australia is undertaken to empirically test the jump process hypothesis. This analysis provides evidence that natural events associated with changes in the leasing structure of properties are a primary driver of relatively large, infrequent dislocations in valuation-based prices.    With parts one and two as a backdrop, the third part of this research empirically tests a discrete mixture of normals (&#8216;DMON&#8217;) model of investment risk. Capital markets research shows that a DMON model flows naturally from jump price processes. DMON models fitted to cross-sectional returns on individual properties supplied by the PCA are found to be superior to the normal and stable Paretian models previously proposed by other researchers.    In aggregate these conclusions have serious implications for the management of ICRE portfolios, and suggest a need for additional research. Some implications include: (1) Mean-lower partial variance is superior to mean-variance optimisation. (2) Forecasting the distribution of ICRE returns forms a new tool for active management. (3) Passive portfolio management is inappropriate. (4) Comparables-based valuations may be unreliable for investment decisions.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ECONOMICS, FINANCE (0508)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/46</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Language matters:  The politics of teaching immigrant adolescents school English (New Zealand)</field><field name="creator">Kepa, Tangiwai Mere Appleton</field><field name="description">The purpose of this thesis is to reflect upon the complex process of educating the sons and daughters of immigrant parents from diverse cultural communities. The study stresses the importance of valuing the language and culture of students in Aotearoa-New Zealand for whom English is another language. It is argued that the discourse of what shall be called &#8216;technocratic pedagogy&#8217; falls short of meeting this goal. What is needed is more expansive and inclusive programmes that apprehend the social, economic, and political contexts of learning. This is necessary if the students are to continue their education not simply to absorb prescribed information and ideas but to actively understand, question, challenge, and change the school and the classroom.    The thesis is written from the perspective of an indigenous Maori teacher trained in technocratic approaches of practice looking to aspects of her intimate culture, Tongan and Samoan ways of representing the world, and Paulo Freire's critical pedagogy to transform contemporary education that tends to exclude the adolescents from learning in school. This thesis is not simply another contribution to the ways in which teachers of school English in general think about methodologies and approaches to learning; rather, it is addressed more specifically to those Maori, Tongan, and Samoan teachers in this country who work with and alongside communities who are from the Kingdom of Tonga and the islands of Samoa. Thus, there is great value placed on educational experience with indigenous Tongan and Samoan teachers and students in an educational project referred to in the thesis as a &#8216;School-within-a-school&#8217;. The School-within-a-school refers to a site of education for teaching school English to immigrant adolescents within a large, state, secondary school in the city of Auckland. Particular attention is also paid to educational experience with indigenous teachers in a Curriculum Committee and Maori and Tongan grassroots organisations located within the same school.    A fresh approach to teaching English accepts culture as the ground on which to begin to reflect on a practice within a specific context. The teachers who have a dynamic relationship with students argue that culture is a primary site for contradictions and that a revolutionary challenge to technocratic pedagogy is necessary, but not sufficient, to value and actively include the students in school. Since the English language and its attendant practices, values, traditions, and aspirations are the grounds for the students' marginalisation, immediate, consciously organised changes in the teaching beliefs, contents of education, and society at large in Aotearoa are necessary parts of any reintegrative pedagogy.    On this account, the belief is that pedagogy is vitally important since it can enable the students to understand the technocratic discourse and draw upon the personal and collective experiences to counter the tendency that denies them full participation in school and the classroom.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">EDUCATION, BILINGUAL AND MULTICULTURAL (0282)</field><field name="subject">EDUCATION, PHILOSOPHY OF (0998)</field><field name="subject">EDUCATION, SECONDARY (0533)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/47</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Myth, symbol, ornament: The loss of meaning in transition</field><field name="creator">Engels-Schwarzpaul, Anna-Christina</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">DESIGN AND DECORATIVE ARTS (0389)</field><field name="subject">ARCHITECTURE (0729)</field><field name="subject">PHILOSOPHY (0422)</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/48</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of some external factors on root hair demography in Trifolium repens L. and Lolium perenne L.</field><field name="creator">Care, Debbie Anne</field><field name="description">Light microscopy, low ionic strength solution culture and image analysis methods were used to make detailed measurements on root hair populations of different genotypes of white clover (Trifolium repens L.) and ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.). A model of root hair population structure was developed and validated that will facilitate research on root hairs of these species.    Diagrams were drawn of the root hair length and frequency on entire root systems. The distributions of root hairs on these diagrams often differed from textbook diagrams of root hairs because root hair length and frequency varied considerably along the root axis.    The key issue examined was the response at species, population and genotype levels of root hair populations perturbed by aluminium and phosphate, and the implications of these responses for our understanding of the strategies adopted by plants growing in stressful environments.    Demographic growth analysis gave the best understanding of the mechanisms of root hair population response to genetic variability, resource depletion and environmental perturbation. Root hair length seemed to be controlled by the individual root hair. However the number of root hairs appeared to be controlled by the root. Therefore it is the root that controls the distribution of the hairs on the root, and how this distribution is modified by perturbation.    Root hair populations were shown to have strategies that were similar to their shoot system growth strategies-guerrilla for clover, phalangeal for ryegrass. The root and root hair systems, and shoot systems also demonstrated similar characteristics when the r and K strategy model was applied. At an ecosystem level, clover and ryegrass occupied the same orthogonal in the CSR (competitive-stress-ruderal) model. Therefore at a larger scale, these plants are able to coexist, but they do this by having different strategies at a species level.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">BIOLOGY, BOTANY (0309)</field><field name="subject">BIOLOGY, ECOLOGY (0329)</field><field name="subject">BIOLOGY, PLANT PHYSIOLOGY (0817)</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/50</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantitative genetics of anthropometric variation in the Solomon Islands</field><field name="creator">Black, Stephen James</field><field name="description">This work follows the direction set by Sewall Wright in applying path analysis, and other multivariate statistical techniques, to the study of anthropometric variation. Data on anthropometric variation of six Solomon Island populations is analyzed using statistical models which can distinguish between within-group and between-group genetic variation.    The correlation structure of 27 anthropometric measurements is examined by cluster analysis and principal components analysis. The six populations show a common pattern (in both males and females) which echoes earlier studies. The correlation matrix of measurements is then partitioned into genetic and environmental components and the genetic correlation matrix is examined, once again by cluster analysis and principal components analysis. There is a fairly close agreement between the genetic correlation structure and the phenotypic correlation structure. The environmental correlation matrix is not examined further because it is very poorly estimated.    The partitioning of phenotypic correlations into genetic and environmental components is based on a multivariate generalization of a path model for the heritability of a continuous trait proposed by C. C. Li. The parameters estimated in the single trait model include additive genetic heritability, common home environment, and genetic correlation between spouses. In order to fit this model observations are required on parent-offspring, spouse-spouse, and sib-sib correlations. Heritability values for the Solomons are markedly lower than those reported elsewhere. However, when total heritability (ignoring subpopulation structure) is estimated for the six Solomons populations, the values are higher and form a more familiar pattern. The striking differences between the two kinds of heritability in the Solomon Islands emphasizes the danger of using total heritability estimates obtained from several subpopulations or a national sample.    The between-group component of heritability for each measurement is compared to the within-group heritability and to levels of between-group phenotypic variation. The results demonstrate that high within-group heritability for a given trait does not imply that between-group variation in that trait is genetic in origin.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ANTHROPOLOGY, PHYSICAL (0327)</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370300 Anthropology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/51</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Writing ourselves 'home' : biographical texts : a method for contextualizing the lives of wahine Maori : locating the story of Betty Wark</field><field name="creator">Connor, D Helene</field><field name="description">This thesis consists of two sections. The intention of Section One, 'Biographical Texts: Theoretical Underpinning', is to explore and discuss the theoretical underpinnings of Maori feminism and Kaupapa Maori as they relate to biography as a research method into the lives of Maori women. Biography, as a literary genre is also examined with particular reference to feminist, women of colour and Maori biography. Section One is a wideranging section, encompassing a broad sweep of the literature in these areas. It both draws from existing literature and contributes to the discourse regarding Maori feminism, Maori biography and Maori research. It is relevant to but unconstrained by the content of Section Two. The intention of Section Two, 'Locating the Story of Betty Wark; A Biographical Narrative with Reflective Annotations', is to provide an example of the biographical method and what might constitute Maori biography. The subject of the biographical narrative, Betty Wark, was a Maori woman who was actively involved with community-based organisations from the 1950s until her death in May 2001. Several major themes which emerged from Betty's biographical history occur throughout her narrative and provide a framework in which her story is located. One of the most significant themes was the notion of 'home'; both literal and metaphorical. This theme is reflected in the title of the thesis, Writing Ourselves 'Home'.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wark</field><field name="subject">Betty; Women</field><field name="subject">Maori Biography;Women</field><field name="subject">Maori Ethnic identity; Biography as a literary form</field><field name="subject">Women's Studies (0453)</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/53</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A comparison of the effect of implicit/explicit and immediate/delayed corrective feedback on learners' performance in tailor-made test</field><field name="creator">Varnosfadrani, Azizollah Dabaghi</field><field name="description">The study investigated the effects of correction of learners' grammatical errors on acquisition. Specifically, it compared the effects of timing of correction (immediate versus delayed correction) and manner of correction (explicit versus implicit correction). It also investigated the relative effects of correction of morphological versus syntactic features and correction of developmental early versus developmental late features. Data for the study were collected from 56 intermediate level students of English as a Foreign Language in Iranian university and private language school settings. Each participant was required to read and then retell a written text in their own words during an oral interview with the researcher. During or following the interview the researcher corrected the participants on their grammatical errors implicitly (using recasts) or explicitly (providing metalinguistic information). Individualised tests focusing on the errors that had been corrected were constructed for each participant and administered. Statistical analyses were conducted on the scores the participants received on their individualised tests. Results showed no significant differences for timing of correction. However, significant differences were found for manner of correction. Participants who received explicit correction gained significantly higher scores than those who received implicit correction. This finding lends support to the argument of Schmidt (1994) concerning the role of metalinguistic awareness in language acquisition. Correction of morphological features was found to be more effective than that of syntactic features. It is argued that morphological features are generally learnt as items whereas syntactic features involve system learning. Correction of developmental early features was found to be more effective than correction of developmental late features. This finding lends support to suggestions that corrective feedback (like other types of form-focused instruction) needs to take into account learners' cognitive readiness to acquire features (Pienemann 1984; Mackey 1999). iii Analyses of the interactions between independent variables were also conducted. It was found that explicit correction was more effective for the acquisition of developmental early features and implicit correction was more effective for the acquisition of developmental late features The implications of these results for both second language acquisition and language pedagogy are considered.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Language, General (0679)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/55</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring notions of national style : New Zealand orchestral music in the late twentieth century</field><field name="creator">Keam, Glenda Ruth</field><field name="description">The question of cultural identity in New Zealand literature, visual art and music has been an important one for many decades. New Zealand's relative isolation, sparse population, short history and colonial past have all contributed to a heightened national awareness of, and sensitivity to, its cultural condition. This study aims to explore, with an analyst's eye and ear, notions of national style through a group of orchestral works. Contemporary critical musicology, which flourished in the 1990s, typically integrates various frames of reference and suggests that analysis be framed in the broader cultural context of a work's genesis and performance. Examining the ways in which New Zealand's notions of national identity have affected its artistic production, this study considers claims that the particular environmental conditions of the land have imprinted themselves onto the nation's music. Furthermore, it investigates claims that New Zealand's remote and open spaces have generated perceptible effects in the nation's musical style, while also asking whether the purported importance of the landscape is not actually a myth which sits alongside the nation's other myths of identity. The literature regarding notions of 'musical space' is surveyed, bringing to light a number of musical elements which may connote space. Seven New Zealand orchestral works, composed between 1976 and 1995 and signalled by the composers as having some connection with the land, are found to share musical features, thus suggesting a national style insofar as 'landscape' works from this period are concerned. I then examine the works for 'space' elements, to investigate whether there are identifiable elements which connote a 'sense of space' in New Zealand music. A corollary of this belief in a national style is that any influences at work from New Zealand land(scapes) on New Zealand music will produce different musical results from those at work from other land(scapes) on music in other countries. After noting the most prevalent musical elements in the New Zealand works, four comparable 'landscape' orchestral works from other countries are also discussed, in order to offset and contextualize the New Zealand findings. This is the first detailed study of New Zealand music that has investigated national style, concepts of landscape-in-music, and musical space through analytical examination. It thus contributes to the small but growing body of New Zealand musical studies, and to an overall picture of New Zealand cultural identity.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Music (0413)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/56</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using context to enhance students' understanding of decimal fractions</field><field name="creator">Irwin, Kathryn Cressey</field><field name="description">A total of 84 students from a lower economic area, aged 8 to 14, were interviewed about their understanding of decimal fractions. Results showed that most students could give a context in which they saw decimal fractions outside of school. The vast majority could draw a diagram of how a cake or field could be divided equally among 10 or 100 people. However, few students under 14 could give either decimal fraction symbols or common fraction symbols to represent these divisions. Less than half of the students at ages 10, 11 and 12 could visualize what might come between 0 and 1. About half of the students aged 11 and 12 could indicate what 0.1 or 0.01 meant. It was inferred that difficulty in relating these symbols to referents might be an important source of difficulty in understanding decimal fractions. Therefore, these interviews were followed by an intervention study that examined if working with contextualized decimal fractions aided understanding of these numbers when they were presented without context. Half of a group of 16 similar students, aged 11 and 12, were asked to solve problems in which numbers that incorporated decimal fractions were contextualized, and the other half were asked to solve similar problems given in purely numerical form. Students worked in pairs, on problems which incorporated common misconceptions. The group who worked on contextualized problems gained significantly more understanding than did the group that worked on purely numerical problems, as measured by the difference between pretest and posttest scores. Transcripts of the students' discussions were analysed for the effect of prior learning, aspects of peer collaboration that appeared to be beneficial to learning, and the effect of cognitive conflict. The students who gained most from collaboration were not too distant in initial expertise, showed a degree of social equity, and worked on contextualized problems. Much of students' learning appeared to result from needing to reconsider their views following a conflict between their expectations and the results of operating on a calculator or in writing, or hearing an alternative view.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">EDUCATION, MATHEMATICS (0280)</field><field name="subject">EDUCATION, ELEMENTARY (0524)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/57</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'The London Prodigal': A critical edition in modern spelling</field><field name="creator">Arulanandam, Santha Devi</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a critical edition in modern spelling of The London Prodigal, a comedy played by the King's Men and printed in 1605 by Thomas Creede for the publisher Nathaniel Butter. The title-page (photographically reproduced) attributes the play to William Shakespeare. This claim is assessed and judged to be mistaken. Both external and internal evidence have been examined in relation to eight possible authorship candidates; Thomas Dekker emerges as the strongest. The present text of the play is based on the 1605 Quarto. Collation of twelve copies revealed several press variants.    The introduction treats the play's publication and stage-history and takes a critical look at its background and sources, plot and structure, setting, characters, style, themes, and role in the development of Elizabethan-Jacobean drama. An attempt is made to determine the date of composition, as well as the author. A short section is devoted to conjecture about the manuscript copy used for the Quarto and to bibliographical deductions about its treatment in the printing-house.    A full commentary glosses obscurities and enlarges on the play's literary, social, and historical allusions. There are textual notes on variants, emendations, and lineation.

The results of the literary analysis indicated that the texts displayed different textual tendencies and also represented God, the four main characters, and some minor characters, differently. The texts were then presented to real readers for an empirical study of their perceptions of the characters. The empirical data indicate some support for the difference in perception expected from the literary analysis.    Readers of the AT considered the king to be more just, Mordecai to be more just and moral, and less dominant, and Esther to be more moral, than in the other two texts. Readers of the BT considered Mordecai more dominant than in the other two texts. For the justice of the king and the justice and morality of Mordecai they rated the BT between the AT and the MT. Readers of the MT considered the king to be less just and Mordecai to be less just and moral than in the other texts. However, for the dominance trait they rated Mordecai between the AT and BT. They also rated Esther between the AT and BT on the morality trait. Some of these effects, however, were modified by the factors of gender and religious affiliation.    The literary analysis also suggested that there is a difference in the moral reasoning level between the three texts. This was indirectly supported by the empirical study. The fact that all except one of the differences in perception were related to the character traits of justice and morality indicates that the character traits which are most obviously related to the ethics involved in the text were the ones for which real readers perceived differences.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">THEOLOGY (0469)</field><field name="subject">RELIGION, BIBLICAL STUDIES (0321)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/59</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of brands in manufacturer-reseller relationships</field><field name="creator">Glynn, Mark Selwyn</field><field name="description">The focus of this research is on the role of manufacturer brands for resellers within retail channels. This topic is important because of the strategic value of manufacturer brands and the increasing influence of resellers within channels of distribution. Much of the branding research has emphasised a customer brand knowledge perspective, however emerging perspectives suggest that brands are also relevant to other stakeholders including resellers. In contrast channels research has recognised the manufacturer sources of market power, but has not considered the impact of manufacturer 'push and pull' strategies within channels. A comprehensive theoretical framework therefore did not exist that addressed the reseller perspective of the brand. As a result, a multi-method research design was adopted and consisted of two phases. The first phase involved in-depth interviews, from which a conceptual framework was developed. In the second phase this framework was tested by means of a survey of supermarket buyers on major and minor brands in several product categories. Structural equation modelling was used to analyse the survey responses. The structural model showed very good fit to the data and good construct validity, reliability and stability. Brands have several sources of value to resellers including manufacturer support, brand preference and customer demand which influence the reseller satisfaction with the brand. Reseller satisfaction in turn influences other channel outcomes such as trust, commitment and performance. Minor brands are better able to influence trust and commitment than major brands. A key contribution of this research is the development of a validated conceptual framework on the value of the brand in inter-organisational relationships from the point of view of a reseller. This research shows that it is the resources associated with the brand, not just the brand itself that creates value for resellers in channel relationships.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Business Administration, Marketing (0338)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/60</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of contemporary echocardiography in the management of heart failure</field><field name="creator">Whalley, Gillian Amanda</field><field name="description">Heart failure (HF) is an increasing and leading cause of cardiovascular morbidity, hospitalisation and death. Echocardiography is often used in HF patients because it provides important aetiological, diagnostic and prognostic information to assist physician management at moderate cost. This thesis has explored contemporary echocardiographic techniques for assessment of both diastolic and systolic function to ascertain their effectiveness and optimal utility. Assessment of systolic function in HF patients is optimised by the use of harmonic imaging and not enhanced with the use of transpulmonary contrast agents, whilst diastolic filling is optimised by the use of preload manipulation. When optimised in this way, echocardiography can be used to stratify HF patients in terms of risk of death and/or hospitalisation after discharge from hospital. This was confirmed in a meta-analysis of more than 6000 patients (1000 deaths) with HF or after acute myocardial infarction (AMI), where the presence of restrictive filling pattern (the most severe form of diastolic dysfunction) was associated with a four-fold increase in mortality in both patient groups. In addition, restrictive filling pattern also predicted development of HF post AMI and hospitalisation in patients with HF. This meta-analysis also evaluated the intermediate stages of diastolic dysfunction and found a stepped relationship between each grade and prognosis. The last part of this thesis explored the role of contemporary echocardiography for management of symptomatic patients in the community and found that the diagnosis of HF in the community may be optimised by using brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) as a first test to "rule-out" heart failure and then echocardiography, which was superior to BNP in patients with intermediate BNP levels to diagnose HF. Furthermore, the systolic echocardiographic parameters were important for diagnosis, whilst the diastolic parameters predicted future hospitalisation. In summary, contemporary echocardiography in HF patients should include comprehensive assessment of systolic function (using tissue harmonics imaging) and diastolic filling (utilising preload manipulation). This approach will optimise both diagnosis and prognosis and in turn may aid physician management.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery (0564)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/61</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Beyond responsiveness to community:  Democratic voice and the creation of an&gt;education alternative (New Zealand)</field><field name="creator">Carpenter, Vicki Marie</field><field name="description">This thesis examines how, in a rural New Zealand &#8216;area school&#8217;, successful democratic parental and community voice was able to bring about the creation of an education alternative. While the parental initiative was in line with the rhetoric of Tomorrow' s Schools (1988) the contention in this thesis is that initiatives such as this were not intended by the legislation. Despite the fact that the initiative was stimulated by and explicitly invoked the rhetoric, the spirit of the legislation was philosophically opposed to this particular kind of innovation.    The &#8216;Kiwi&#8217; initiative emerged in 1993, five years after the legislation. The initiative centred around a request for an alternative education programme to be set up within &#8216;Takiwa School&#8217;. This alternative was modelled on Playcentre, a New Zealand Early Childhood Education model, which encompasses aspects of progressivism. Kiwi parents and Takiwa School personnel achieved a &#8216;school within the school&#8217; for a segment of Takiwa community. Parents became fully involved in all aspects of their children's curriculum, from planning, through to delivery and assessment. This thesis examines the politics of the change process within Takiwa School.    Three questions are central to this case study examination of change. These are: What were the parents asking for? How were the parents able to achieve what they were asking for? and What were the effects of the process on what it was that the initiative ultimately became? These three questions are examined in a sociological manner, from a critical realist approach. A range of theoretical tools are utilised; the central theoretical windows are a combination of Exit, Voice and Loyalty-which is provided by Hirschman (1970)-and the theories which are encompassed in the New Institutionalist approach. The central argument of the thesis is that it was a particular combination of conditions and motivations which made the Kiwi innovation possible. The possible replicability of the initiative is discussed. A key concern of the thesis as a whole is whether the set of circumstances in which the innovation transpired was unique.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">EDUCATION, SOCIOLOGY OF (0340)</field><field name="subject">SOCIOLOGY, SOCIAL STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT (0700)</field><field name="subject">EDUCATION, ADMINISTRATION (0514)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/62</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teachers' conceptions of assessment</field><field name="creator">Brown, Gavin Thomas Lumsden</field><field name="description">Teachers' conceptions are powerful in shaping the quality of their instructional practice. The purpose of this thesis is to defend a four-facet model of teachers' conceptions of assessment, which revolves around emphasising improvement or school accountability, or student accountability purposes or treating assessment as irrelevant. Further, it explores how those conceptions relate to teachers' conceptions of learning, teaching, curriculum, and teacher efficacy.    A literature review is used to identify the major conceptions. Multiple studies led to a 50-item Teachers' Conceptions of Assessment (COA-III) questionnaire based on the four main conceptions of assessment. Structural equation modelling showed a close fit of a hierarchical, multi-dimensional model to the data. Teachers moderately agreed with the improvement conceptions and the system accountability conception. Teachers disagreed that assessment was irrelevant. However, teachers had little agreement that assessment was for student accountability. Improvement, school, and student accountability conceptions were positively correlated. The irrelevance conception was inversely related to the improvement conception and not related to the system accountability conception.    A four-factor structure of teachers' beliefs about assessment, curriculum, teaching, learning, and teacher efficacy, was found. Teachers agreed that assessment influences and improves their teaching and student learning. They agreed less strongly that assessment, measuring surface learning only, makes schools, teachers, and students accountable and that teachers are able to conduct assessment through a systematic technological approach. They agreed at a similar level with student centred learning that involves deep approaches to learning, divorced from assessment. They disagreed with a telling type of teaching that focuses only on intellectual development of students or on reconstruction or reform of society.    Use of the CoA-III makes teachers' conceptions of assessment more explicit and will assist in the development of teacher training programs, the design of assessment policy, and enhance further research into educational assessment practices. Furthermore, explicit attention to teachers' conceptions of assessment is expected to be a precursor to teachers' self-regulation of their assessment beliefs and practices.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">EDUCATION, EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY (0525)</field><field name="subject">EDUCATION, TESTS AND MEASUREMENTS (0288)</field><field name="subject">EDUCATION, ELEMENTARY (0524)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/63</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A history of the action of deceit on the case and related developments in contract law</field><field name="creator">Bunbury, John C</field><field name="description">My thesis traces the common law&#8217;s initial inability to provide a remedy for fraudulent contract-making other than that provided in the action of deceit on the case for a breach of warranty. By and large this was the result of an evidential rule in covenant that a contract had to be evidenced in a sealed instrument (ie. a specialty). This test for an assumption of contractual obligation prevented the courts from receiving inferior oral evidence of fraud in defence to the contract. A limited remedy for fraud was provided in the form of the action of deceit on the case where liability was based on tricking another person into contracting on the basis of a false warranty. Evidence of fraud in the action of deceit on the case was reduced to proving a breach of warranty. Any injustice created by the common law&#8217;s inability to provide a defence or remedy for other types of fraudulent contract-making was either relieved in equity, or through the passage of time and gradual common law development, by new common law actions, rules of evidence and methods of trial. By far the most significant development in this regard was the establishment of a remedy for fraud in money had and received in the late seventeenth century, which led to the common law rule allowing for rescission of a contract for fraud. Any money passed under the fraudulently induced contract could be recovered in money had and received following rescission. Likewise, the value of any personal property transferred under the fraudulently induced contract could be recovered in trover following a rescission. Related developments saw warranties become actionable in special assumpsit (ie. contract), and a generic remedy for actual fraud develop in the modern tort of deceit.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/64</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fofoa-i-vao-'ese : the identity journeys of NZ-born Samoans</field><field name="creator">Anae, Melani</field><field name="description">This thesis constitutes a site for New Zealand-born Samoans to explore issues of ethnic identity. The emphasis is on the process of the Samoanising of christianity, and hegemonic identity discourses of not only the dominant society but of island-born Samoans and elders, and how this contributes to New Zealand-born Samoan self perceptions. A socio-historical overview provides an understanding of the process in which New Zealand born Samoans have been positioned. The stories and narratives of a group of New Zealandborn Samoans concerning their life experiences provide valuable insights into their 'identity journeys'--the construction of ethnic identity through experimenting with subject positions over time, as a result of challenges to their percieved self-identities. For some, this journey ends with a secured identity--a self-satisfying ethnic identity as a New Zealand-born Samoan--others remain in a perpetual state of conscious or subconscious identity confusion. More specifically the thesis seeks to provide an understanding and an interpretation of the way fa'aSamoa, church, and life in New Zealand impacts on life choices and on the construction of the self, and secured identities. The identity journey is analysed as a ritual and a series of rites of passage in order to expose the structure of identity confusion, and to examine the dichotomy of chaos and conflict within an apparently ordered society, experienced by New Zealand-born Samoans during their identity journeys.The thesis is therefore underpinned by Samoan conceptual frameworks involved in this identity journey, and aims to consciousness-raise and emancipate by exposing, understanding and reclaiming the links between fa'aSamoa, church, and a New Zealand born Samoan identity.The thesis represents an 'ie toga,  because like a fine mat being woven, the strands of Samoan history, fa'aSamoa and Samoan contemporary lifeways, and their interaction with 'others' interconnect to inform Samoan identity. It is thus presented with respect, gratitude, deference, recognition and obligation, a tangible symbol of an alliance and an exchange with all Samoans and others. As the wellspring of my Samoan identity, in its creativity in design and fineness of weave, I hope that this 'ie toga will be received as a source of identity, history and wealth.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Anthropology, Cultural (0326)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/66</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling of bath/ledge  heat transfer in Hall-Heroult cells</field><field name="creator">Wei, Chuck Chenchi</field><field name="description">Heat transfer through the sidewall accounts for a significant proportion of the energy loss from an aluminium reduction cell. At the same time, the ledge formed on the sidewall has important consequences with regards to the cell service life and the dynamic heat balance during various disturbances associated with the smelting operation such as alumina feeding, anode changing, metal tapping and anode effect. Several studies have been carried out to investigate the ledge heat transfer. However, the reported heat transfer coefficients in the literature not only vary over a wide range of values but provide insufficient information on the ledge heat transfer.    A heat transfer probe and measurement techniques were developed for studying the ledge heat transfer in a full-scale 3-D air-water model. Quantitative measurements were conducted to determine the bath/ledge heat transfer characteristics at various positions, and under different operating conditions such as anode-ledge distance, current density and bath depth. Variation of the heat transfer were also examined as a function of the anode bottom inclination, the anode slot width and the position on the side ledge relative to the anode slot. The results illustrate that the ledge profile in an operating cell will take on a different shape in compliance with the heat transfer variation.    A similitude analysis was carried out to interpret the measured results in a meaningful manner for use in a reduction cell. As a result, the heat transfer coefficient in industrial cells under various operating parameters, and at different positions on the side ledge, can be estimated using the empirical correlations presented.    Gas bubble behaviour and bubble impingement on the side ledge were observed in the water model. Observations made on the 2-D and 3-D water models indicate that anode gas evolution in the 3-D model cell will reflect more closely the flow pattern in actual cells and hence provide more reliable quantitative results.    A simple 2-D thermal model for the prediction of ledge thickness and profile as a moving boundary was developed and solved simply and efficiently with a commercial spreadsheet software using the finite difference method. The ledge profile was predicted using the ledge heat transfer coefficients measured extensively from the full-scale 3-D physical model. The results show that the ledge shape is highly sensitive to the positional variation of the heat transfer coefficient. It is also shown that the ledge heat transfer coefficients obtained from industrial measurements assuming 1-D heat flow are much lower than the actual values in a Hall-Heroult cell.    A transient thermal model derived by considering the Stefan problem$/sp[*]$ for the sidewall/ledge region was developed. A fixed-grid and deforming-grid spacing were respectively superimposed on the sidewall and the ledge region in order to track the moving front of the phase change zone. Various aspects of the process dynamics with respect to the variation of ledge thickness and sidewall shell temperature were presented. The model considered dynamic heat loss through the sidewall which results in a closer approximation to the real situation. ftn$/sp[*]$N.B.: In the strict sense the problem of the ledge is not a classical Stefan problem. The classical Stefan problem involves conduction on both sides of the interface. The ledge problem involves conduction on the side and convection on the other.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ENGINEERING, CHEMICAL (0542)</field><field name="subject">ENGINEERING, METALLURGY (0743)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/67</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Unfinished: The Seventh-day Adventist mission in the South Pacific, excluding Papua New Guinea, 1886-1986.

When that mission was finished the second coming would occur.    In 1886 following a visit by an elderly layman, John I Tay, the whole population of Pitcairn Island desired to join the SDA church. As a result in 1890 Adventist mission work began in the South Pacific Islands. By 1895 missions had been founded in six island groups. However difficulties, both within and without the mission's control, ensured that membership gains were painfully slow in the first decades of Adventist mission in Polynesia. However before World War II the Solomons became one of the most successful Adventist mission areas in the world. After 1945 Adventism also prospered in such places as Fiji, Samoa and Tonga.    Education provided the key to the gaining of accessions in a number of countries, while in others a health-medical emphasis proved important in attracting converts. Since World War II public evangelism and the use of various programmes such as welfare, radio evangelism, and the efforts of lay members contributed to sharp membership gains in most countries of the region. Of no small consequence in hindering Adventist growth was the opposition of other churches who regarded them as pariahs because of their theology and 'proselytizing'.    Adventist communities tended to be introverted, esoteric and isolationist. Nevertheless Pacific islanders adapted aspects of the usually uncompromising Adventist culture. Unity of faith, practice and procedure was a valuable Adventist asset which was promoted by a centralized administration.    After a century in the Pacific region its membership there has a reputation among other Adventists for its continued numeric growth and for the ferver its committment to Adventism. Nevertheless Adventism in the region faces a number of problems and its aim of finishing the Lord's work remains unfinished.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">HISTORY, ASIA, AUSTRALIA AND OCEANIA (0332)</field><field name="subject">RELIGION, HISTORY OF (0320)</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::440000 Philosophy and Religion::440200 Religion and Religious Traditions::440204 Christian theology (incl.

Flow is modelled through these networks enabling structure-function simulations to be conducted to increase our understanding of this complex system.Voronoi meshing is applied in a novel technique to represent the three-dimensional structure of the alveoli, and the corresponding capillary plexus intimately wrapped over the alveolar surface. This technique is used to create the alveolar-capillary structure of a single alveolar sac,  closely representing the geometry measured in anatomical studies.A Poiseuille type flow solution technique is implemented within the capillary geometry. The solution procedure incorporates calculations of red and white blood cell transit time frequencies. Novel predictions of regional microcirculatory blood cell transit in the anatomically-realistic alveolar-capillary model compare well with experimental measures.An anatomically-based finite element model of the arterial and venous vessels, down to the level of their accompanying respiratory bronchioles, is created using a combination of imaging and computational algorithms, which includes generation of supernumerary vessels. Large arterial and venous vessels and lobar geometries are derived from multi-detector row x-ray computed tomography (MDCT) scans. From these MDCT vessel end points a volume-filling branching algorithm is used to generate the remaining blood vessels that accompany the airways into the MDCT-derived host volume. An  empirically-based algorithm generates supernumerary blood vessels - unaccompanied by airways that branch to supply the closest parenchymal tissue. This new approach produces a model of pulmonary vascular geometry that is far more anatomically-realistic than previous models in the literature.A reduced form of the Navier-Stokes equations are solved within the vascular geometries to yield pressure, radius, and velocity distributions. Inclusion of a gravitational term in the governing equations allows application of the model in investigating the relative effects of gravity, structure, and posture on regional perfusion.Gravity is shown to have a lesser influence on blood flow distribution than suggested by earlier experimental studies, and by comparison between different model solutions the magnitude of the gravitational flow gradient is predicted. This study clearly demonstrates the significant role that  symmetric vascular branching has in determining the distribution of blood  flow. The influence of branching geometry is revealed by solution in symmetric, human, and ovine vascular models.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pulmonary Alveoli physiology;Lung Physiology;Models</field><field name="subject">Biological</field><field name="subject">Engineering, Biomedical (0541)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/70</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teacher Appraisal: Missed Opportunities for Learning</field><field name="creator">Sinnema, Claire</field><field name="description">The improvement of teaching is now recognised to be a key to the sustained improvement of student achievement. Teacher appraisal, a central element of performance management, is intended to improve the quality of teaching (and therefore learning). This thesis examines whether teacher appraisal is achieving this purpose, through three empirical studies. This thesis begins with a discussion of the context of teacher appraisal in relation to education reform of the last two decades. A normative model of teacher appraisal, one that focuses on data-based inquiry into student learning, is outlined, and the emerging education context in relation to that model is examined. Three studies, which explored schools' appraisal documents, appraisal discussions and teachers' appraisal goals, are presented. The first study, a document analysis, investigated the emphasis on student learning in the statements of purpose in 17 primary schools' appraisal policies, and the emphasis on student learning in the performance indicators developed to assess teachers against the professional standards. Results showed that while improved student learning was an intended purpose of schools' appraisal policies, the indicators that were used to evaluate teachers seldom focused directly on student learning.The second study examined whether data-based inquiry into student learning occurs in appraisal discussions, and the reasons for the level of reported inquiry. Eleven practitioners (four appraisers and seven appraisees from three schools) were interviewed about their most recent appraisal discussion to investigate whether student learning was a focus of the appraisal discussions and whether student achievement data were referred to in those discussions. Findings showed that appraisal discussions typically focused on teacher practices without exploring connections between those practices and the impact they have on student learning.Only one of the eleven teachers described a discussion that included talk specifically about student learning. Furthermore, there were no reports of reference to student learning data in appraisal discussions. There was, however, a particularly positive response to the suggestion that appraisal should, and could, focus on student learning and on data relating to this learning. This study also highlighted the considerable influence of appraisal goals in determining the content and scope of appraisals. In the third study, 68 teachers from eight schools responded to a questionnaire about their appraisal goals to establish the extent to which teachers' appraisal goals focus on data-based inquiry into student learning. Less than five per cent of goals were found to refer to student outcomes. The vast majority focused on teacher processes and behaviours. Goals also tended to be vague, rather than specific, and were not explicitly challenging. Findings across the studies suggest that only limited attention is given, in critical elements of teacher appraisal, to student learning. The final chapter of the thesis explores two key strategies for closing the gap between current appraisal practices and the 'appraisal for learning' approach argued for here - an approach that focuses on teacher learning about student learning and that is based on evidence. The first strategy involves alignment within appraisal elements, and to initiatives beyond appraisal. The second strategy is capacity building to ensure that personal, interpersonal and organisational capacities necessary for 'appraisal for learning' are developed. This research shows how teacher appraisal policy and practice has been a missed opportunity to improve teaching effectiveness and how it could be reshaped in ways that maximise student learning.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/71</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of Neumann-Kelvin ship wave theory and its application to yacht design</field><field name="creator">Marr, Gregory Paul</field><field name="description">Wave drag significantly affects ship powering and speed prediction calculations, and the performance of sailing yachts. Linear Neumann-Kelvin ship wave theory is taken as a starting point for the development of a computational approach for predicting water flow about yacht hulls. Previous work by Baar and Price, Newman, and Doctors and Beck for the calculation of the Kelvin source and its derivatives and their use with panel methods is repeated, refined and extended.    Consistent and accurate results are obtained for numerical tests and Farell's submerged spheroid test cases.    Baar and Price's results for the Wigley hullform (which compare well with experiments) were not able to be duplicated in the present study, despite significant tests of both local and integrated solution values. The tests did indicate that the current implementation was behaving correctly, and gave wave resistance results equivalent to those from Doctors and Beck's study, to a level of agreement which contrasted sharply with the wide scatter in Chen and Noblesse's survey. These results remove to some extent numerical inaccuracies as a postulated source of the theory's difficulties, leaving the conclusion that Neuman-Kelvin theory, as it is currently understood, does not give satisfactory wave resistance results for realistic ship hullforms.    These and further results lead to, and reinforce, the suggestion that the problem lies with the waterline integral term; a new treatment of this term may substantially increase the applicability of Neumann-Kelvin theory.    The extensions required for modelling sailing yachts are considered. Investigation of three yacht design problems show that the developed model can predict, and partly explain, previously observed free surface effects. These 'relative' effects may be adequately predicted even though the absolute results appear less reliable.    For the simplified parabolic yacht hullform tested, the sideforce is relatively constant over the speed range generally relevant to upwind sailing, and well modelled by the (zero Froude number) cosine squared (heel angle) relationship. The effects of a bulb, and heel (for the Wigley hullform), on wave resistance are shown.    Suggestions for further work, calculation details, and tables of wave resistance and Kelvin source (and gradient) values are given.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ENGINEERING, MARINE AND OCEAN (0547)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/72</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Primary and secondary log breakdown simulation</field><field name="creator">Todoroki, Christine Louisa</field><field name="description">Log breakdown by sawing can be viewed as a multi-phase process that converts logs into boards by a series of cutting operations. In the primary phase, logs are sawn into s labs of wood known as flitches or cants. These are further processed by secondary operations, that resaw, edge (cut lengthwise) and trim (cut widthwise) the raw material, resulting in the manufacture of the board product whose value is influenced by its composite dimensions and quality (as indicated by a grade). Board grade is in turn determined by the number, type, size, and location of defects.    Owing to its biological origins, each log, and subsequent board, is unique. Furthermore, as each sawmill, and processing centre within the mill, has a unique configuration, the problem of determining how each log entering a mill should be sawn is very complex. Effective computer simulation of log breakdown processes must therefore entail detailed descriptions of both geometry and quality of individual logs. Appropriate strategies at each breakdown phase are also required.    In this thesis models for emulating log breakdown are developed in conjunction with an existing sawing simulation system which requires, as input, detailed three-dimensional descriptions of both internal and external log characteristics. Models based on heuristic and enumerative procedures, and those based upon the principles of dynamic programming (DP) are formulated, encoded, and compared. Log breakdown phases are considered both independently and in a combined integrated approach-working backwards from the board product through to the primary log breakdown phase. This approach permits methodology developed for the later processes to be embedded within the primary phase thus permitting the determination of a global rather than local solution to the log breakdown problem whose objective is to seek the highest possible solution quality within the minimum possible time.    Simulation results indicate that solution quality and processing speeds are influenced by both solution methodology and degree of data complexity. When the structure of either factor is simplified, solutions are generated more rapidly-but with an accompanying reduction in solution quality. A promising compromise that combines DP techniques with mathematical functions based on a subset of the original data is presented.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">OPERATIONS RESEARCH (0796)</field><field name="subject">AGRICULTURE, WOOD TECHNOLOGY (0746)</field><field name="subject">ENGINEERING, SYSTEM SCIENCE (0790)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/73</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The enhancement of intra-operative diagnostics and decision-making using computational methods</field><field name="creator">Harrison, Michael J</field><field name="description">The data presented and views expressed in this document are the result of multiple published and unpublished studies over the last 25 years. My over-arching goal in this research was to use modern computing power to create functionally useful diagnoses, in real time, from the monitoring systems used during routine anaesthesia and to present these diagnoses in an ergonomic manner. In addition it was intended to incorporate into the anaesthetic monitor, expert systems that help with the management of uncommon situations. The Australian and New Zealand College guidelines on monitoring during anaesthesia dictate those measurements that should be made during every anaesthetic; from these data evidence can be gathered, integrated, and presented to the clinician. Constraints in this field of research include the inability of the monitors to see, hear or understand the context of operating theatre activities, and computer processing time. Because many studies are involved the methods are detailed in the main text, and are not summarized here. Physiological 'envelopes' have been developed, in which the 'normal' variation in physiological variables, during anaesthesia, are enclosed. They have enabled the creation of intelligent alarm systems that can suggest diagnoses. A retrospective off-line study showed that it was possible to diagnose the onset of malignant hyperpyrexia, using fuzzy logic templates, about 10minutes earlier than the clinician. Some variables may be more important than others in making a diagnosis, and the strength of a diagnosis depends on the amount of supporting evidence, the amount of evidence not against the diagnosis and the amount of missing data. Decision-making (for example to transfuse or not transfuse blood) can also be mathematically modelled so that decision making is more consistent. Finally, investigation of the ways of displaying data indicates that the output can be very explicit. My overall conclusion is that real time decision support systems for the management of clinical dilemmas are possible. They can be instantly and easily accessible and can sit discretely in the background of anaesthetic monitors to be activated at will by the anaesthetist.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery (0564)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/74</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Finding the relationship that justifies egoistic concern</field><field name="creator">Weideli, Wendy Anne</field><field name="description">This thesis is a quest to find the relationship that justifies egoistic concern. I point out that what we are inclined to believe about the justification of egoistic concern, let's call it the Old Theory, is that personal identity is the relationship that justifies egoistic concern, that personal identity involves a deep further fact, and that physical and psychological continuity are good evidence for personal identity.    I argue that, if personal identity involves the deep further fact, then physical and psychological continuity are not good evidence for personal identity and thus the Old Theory is mistaken. Furthermore, if the everyday egoistic concern that we have for a person who is physically and psychologically continuous with us is clearly rational, then physical and psychological continuity must be good evidence for the relationship that justifies egoistic concern, and thus either personal identity is not the relationship that justifies egoistic concern, or personal identity does not involve the deep further fact. Therefore, I suggest that a new theory about the justification of egoistic concern should have the following structure; some relationship, let's call it E, is the relationship that justifies egoistic concern, E does not involve the deep further fact, and physical and psychological continuity are good evidence for E.    I then point out that a new theory about the justification of egoistic concern should take into account the dominant intuitions that the Old Theory was based on, but should ignore intuitions that are based solely on mistaken beliefs flowing from the Old Theory. I argue that it is not easy to separate these two types of intuitions, but, nevertheless, in trying to find E I attempt to capture the intuitions that underlie the Old Theory, while avoiding the use of methods that might capture intuitions that are based solely on mistaken beliefs involved in the Old Theory.

Each of the two studies incorporated in the thesis is primarily concerned with t&#363;pulaga &#8216;the younger generation&#8217; in the New Zealand Tokelau population. One is community-based and focused on the social interactions of generation cohorts of t&#363;pulaga  and tupuna &#8216;elders&#8217;, the formal community associations and the national association of affiliated t&#363;pulaga  groups. The other is concerned with bunches of &#8220;detached&#8221; t&#363;pulaga geographically scattered throughout the country, the people without voices when research includes only the migrants in urban enclaves. Background considerations include overviews of theoretical approaches to studying the population phenomenon of migration; relevant aspects of Tokelau history and the movement of Pacific peoples; New Zealand as the receiving country and continuously changing social context for Tokelau communities, and a conceptual framework derived from features of complex adaptive systems theories that was helpful in considering aspects of the contemporary migration and its outcomes. T&#363;pulaga leaders, through the association of affiliated groups known as the Mafutaga, revived the pre-eminent cultural principle  maopoopo &#8216;gathered together and unified&#8217;, promoted a vision of &#8216;Tokelau ways in New Zealand&#8217; and supported t&#363;pulaga &#8220;becoming Tokelau in New Zealand&#8221; as residents of urban communities. Over a number of years, Mafutaga officials led the expansion of t&#363;pulaga inter-community sports meetings into a four-day national gathering of Tokelauans now celebrated as an unequivocal expression of Tokelau culture in New Zealand, and guided the established urban communities through a transition from migrant to cultural communities without usurping the political roles of esteemed elders.    The second study shows that intergenerational issues were pivotal or contributory in most t&#363;pulaga decisions to &#8220;detach&#8221; from community networks and activities. &#8220;Detachment&#8221; is categorised as transient (a provisional, not necessarily long-term status), tacit (a restorative withdrawal, with subsequent reattachment) or diuternal (a considered choice and enduring status).</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ANTHROPOLOGY, CULTURAL (0326)</field><field name="subject">SOCIOLOGY, ETHNIC AND RACIAL STUDIES (0631)</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420307 Pacific cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/76</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Non-invasive electrical imaging of the heart</field><field name="creator">Cheng, Leo K</field><field name="description">Non-invasive electrical imaging of the heart aims to quantitatively reconstruct information about the electrical activity of the heart from multiple thoracic ECG signals. The computational framework required to produce such electrical images of the heart from non-invasive torso surface signals is presented. It is shown reliable electrical images of the heart can be obtained under a controlled environment. This has been demonstrated using an anatomically realistic boundary element porcine torso model. The procedures required to create a subject specific model using a small number of control points and to create a specific heart model from three-dimensional ultrasound images using a linear fitting procedure are presented. From discrete ECG electrodes a continuous representation of the potential field over the entire torso surface can also be produced using this linear fitting procedure. The construction of the transfer matrices for the two predominant electrocardiographic sources (epicardial potentials and myocardial activation times) are described in detail. The transfer matrices are used to compute activation times within the heart and epicardial potentials on the heart surface. Myocardial activation times are computed using an algorithm based on the Critical Point Theorem while epicardial potentials are computed using standard Tikhonov and Truncated SVD spatially regularised methods as well as Greensite's spatial and temporal regularisation method. The regularisation parameters for the epicardial potentials are determined using a variety of methods (e.g., CRESO criterion, L-curve, zero-crossing). The potential and activation based formulations are compared in a comprehensive inverse simulation study. To try and capture the dynamic and variable nature of cardiac electrical activity, the study is performed with three different types of cardiac sources with a realistic porcine model. These simulations investigate the effect on the computed solutions of individual and combinations of modelling errors. These errors include corruption in the torso surface signals, changes in material properties and geometric distortion. In general, the activation based formulation is preferred over the epicardial potential formulations, with Greensite's method found to be the best method for reconstructing epicardial potentials. Under optimal conditions, the activation approach could reconstruct the activation times to within RMS. Both potential and activation based formulations were found to be relatively insensitive to changes in material properties such as lung conductivities and activation function shapes. When examining individual errors, the geometry and positions of the torso and heart had the greatest effects on the inverse solutions. The relative heart position needed to be determined to within to obtain results within of the solutions obtained under control conditions. When the modelling errors are combined to produce errors which can be expected in a clinical or experimental situation the activation based solutions were consistently more accurate than potential based solutions. The next necessary step in this project is the detailed validation of the results against in-vivo data. This step is necessary before such algorithms can be reliably used to aid in the assessment of heart function in a clinical environment.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Heart imaging;Electrocardiography;Heart Electric properties</field><field name="subject">Engineering, Biomedical (0541)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/77</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interest-based planning: The concept of interest and public urban land use system planning</field><field name="creator">Hall, Derek Rotherham</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the possibility of applying the concept of interest to public urban land use system planning, although it is not intended that the idea should be limited to urban planning.    The concept is considered in detail, as is the question of who can have interests. The conclusion on that is that individuals and the public are the only true categories of interest holders, although interest groups need to be recognised for practical reasons. Corporations and governments cannot be true interest holders.    The application of the concept was assessed in relation to the subject-matter of urban land use planning, and a typical land use planning process. The possibility of applying it to a hypothetical system of planning using the pragmatic method was also considered.    The final part looked at the &#8216;institutions&#8217; of planning, that is, law, politics, professional planning, administration, and administrative tribunals, to see how they would likely relate to a planning system based on the use of the concept of interest. The conclusion was that there would be no insurmountable difficulties even If not all of these institutions would readily embrace the concept.    The idea was found to be plausible in so far as a comprehensive theory of interest-based urban land use planning was able to be worked out. By considering practical issues throughout, a strong presumption was raised that it would be feasible, although testing and further development of the idea would be necessary.    Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed method were reviewed. The expected benefits were ensuring that public urban land use system planning was humanistic, and providing a concept, or theme, around which a comprehensive theory of such planning could be constructed. Likely areas of difficulty were misunderstanding due to the lack of agreement on the meaning of the concept, although the meaning that should be adopted for the proposed purpose was spelt out. Secondly, a conservative attitude towards the use of concepts other than interest in planning and related disciplines could cause resistance to the adoption of the proposed method.    It was shown how the idea is largely novel, but that recently there has been increasing use of the concept of interest in the land use planning literature.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">URBAN AND REGIONAL PLANNING (0999)</field><field name="subject">PHILOSOPHY (0422)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/78</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Globalisation and translation:  Towards a paradigm shift in translation studies</field><field name="creator">Ho, George</field><field name="description">Guided by Thomas Kuhn's theory about paradigm shift advanced in  The Structure of Scientific Revolutions and Mao Tsetung's theory of &#8220;the new superseding the old&#8221;, this thesis briefly examines the history of translation both in the West and in China and observes three paradigm shifts in each territory. The analyses reveal that paradigm shifts in translation theory occur when the changes in the social, economic, cultural and religious environments lead to significant changes in the practice of translation and that these changes then can no longer be adequately theorised by the old paradigms of translation. This study then critically reviews current literature on globalisation and translation and attributes its lack of depth in theorisation or some of its misleading predictions to certain scholars' inadequate investigation of the phenomenon of globalisation.    In order to provide an adequate interpretation, description, explanation and prediction of the impact of globalisation on the theory and practice of translation, I investigate five aspects of globalisation and their respective impact on translation practice and find that globalisation has changed the mainstream of translation practice from canonical translation to professional (i.e., non-canonical) translation. The findings of the research demonstrate that traditional translation theories based on comparative literary study or on linguistics fail to provide an objective and comprehensive theoretical framework for the mainstream practice of translation. Therefore, it is justifiable to posit a paradigm shift in Translation Studies from canonical translation to professional translation so as to meet the demand of and challenges for the translation profession and business under the impact of globalisation. As an initiation towards the establishment of a new paradigm, I posit a &#8220;value-driven&#8221; theory based on recent developments in researches on the global economy to distinguish between canonical and professional translations. Influenced by theories of the knowledge-driven economy, I further propose to establish a force of translators as knowledge workers to better serve the demand of the global economy and the global community. To follow the principle of empiricism, I use several case studies from the real world of commercial translation to support my &#8220;value-driven&#8221; theory for Translation Studies.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">LANGUAGE, GENERAL (0679)</field><field name="subject">BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION, MARKETING (0338)</field><field name="subject">LANGUAGE, RHETORIC AND COMPOSITION (0681)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/80</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Private speech : a window in the self-talk of kindergarten children from diverse language background</field><field name="creator">Clark, Beverley</field><field name="description">The immense potential of language, for learning, building relationships, as the embodiment of culture, for an understanding of the world and for expressing 'self', is the underlying theme of this thesis. One less apparent aspect of the language of children is their private speech. In this thesis the research questions focus on whether children from diverse language backgrounds attending English-speaking kindergartens use private speech. Further, if so, what is the context, who is present when it is used and is there a response from the person or people? These questions are primarily addressed through observations of eight children as well as recordings of their private speech. An understanding of the context is supported through interviews with the parents and teachers in the kindergartens. The expectations for this research were largely based on the work of Vygotsky, and adapted to the natural, 'free play' environments of the kindergartens. It was expected that children from diverse language backgrounds in English medium kindergartens would use private speech in their own language. While the children did use private speech (unlike the results from Vygotsky's research) they talked to themselves in English using the language that they had acquired from the community, from the media, from their experiences at kindergarten and in some cases from their families. Based on Krafft &amp; Berk's categories of private speech, a significant focus of this research is the categories of private speech that were used by individual children. These findings pose interesting insight into the experiences of the children. This research has shown the child's remarkable ability to tune into the language and culture of context and to do so not only in relation to the socio-cultural context but also through thinking and acting. This study has also provided insight into the early childhood environments and the experiences of the teachers. As the first known research into private speech/self-talk in early childhood in Aotearoa New Zealand it can serve as a spring-board for further research to enhance our understanding of the child's thinking and learning through private speech.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/81</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The religious mind:  An evolutionary argument for theological non-realism</field><field name="creator">Walker, Ruth Marianne Donovan</field><field name="description">The debate between theological realists and non-realists has so far resisted resolution. In this thesis I apply the insights of current best theory in evolutionary psychology to the problem of deciding between theological realism, which holds that religious beliefs are about some aspect of mind-independent reality, and theological non-realism, which holds that religious beliefs are mind-dependent only. The most well-known exponent of theological non-realism is Don Cupitt who bases his approach to the problem on a combination of biological naturalism and culturalism. In the first part of this thesis I show that biological naturalism and culturalism are incompatible and that culturalism should be rejected in favor of biological naturalism. Cupitt's biological naturalism is the forerunner of an evolutionary psychological approach to religious beliefs that holds great promise for determining their correct interpretation. In the second part of this thesis I critically examine the foundations of evolutionary psychology and its subsequent development into an approach to religious belief in particular.    Current evolutionary theories of culture, including religious belief, use Meme theory, which seems, on the face of it, to be a theory analogous to that of natural selection. I show that the memetic approach to religious belief is mistaken but that there is a sound alternative in the work of Pascal Boyer. Boyer draws on evolutionary psychology, anthropology and cognitive science to develop an account of the origin in the mind of religious beliefs and their spread through the population.    My evolutionary argument is that religious beliefs are the result of the current but not proper function of cognitive modules. Only if beliefs are the result of the proper function of cognitive modules are we justified in holding them to be about some aspect of mind-independent reality. Theological realism is blocked because all versions of realism in the literature depend to some degree on the fact of religious experience, which is covered by the evolutionary argument. Theological non-realism is supported, in principle, by the evolutionary argument but, in practice, is not a genuine alternative to realism because religious beliefs are automatically given a realist interpretation that competes with explicit nonrealist interpretations.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">PHILOSOPHY (0422)</field><field name="subject">RELIGION, PHILOSOPHY OF (0322)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/82</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of individualist and collectivist attributes on responses to Likert-type scales</field><field name="creator">Shulruf, Boaz</field><field name="description">Collectivism and individualism are culturally-related psychological structures which have been used to distinguish people within and across various societies. From a review of the literature, it is argued that the most salient feature of individualism is valuing personal independence, which includes self-knowledge, uniqueness, privacy, clear communication, and competitiveness. Collectivism is associated with a strong sense of duty to group, relatedness to others, seeking others' advice, harmony, and working with the group. The purpose of the thesis is to explore how collectivist and individualist attributes affect the way people respond to Likert-type questionnaires.    In the first study, a new measurement tool for individualism and collectivism was developed to address critical methodological issues in this field of cross-cultural psychology. This new measure the &#8220;Auckland Individualism and Collectivism Scale&#8221; defined three dimensions of individualism: (a) Responsibility (acknowledging one's responsibility for one's actions), (b) Uniqueness (distinction of the self from the other) and (c) Compete (striving for personal goals is one's prime interest); and two dimensions of collectivism: (d) Advice (seeking advice from people close to one, before taking decisions), and (e) Harmony (seeking to avoid conflict). The AICS avoids the need for measuring horizontal and vertical dimensions of collectivism and individualism, and the confounding effect of familialism on the collectivism-individualism constructs.    The second study investigated the relationship between collectivism and individualism and various response sets that have been reported relating to the way in which individuals respond to Likert-type scales. Using structural equation modelling, the Collectivism-Individualism Model of Response Bias was developed. This model suggests two types of response sets: (a) the Impression-Response Bias which includes response sets such as social desirability and context, that affect the first four stages of responding to questions, namely receiving and retrieving data and making decisions; and (b) the Expression-Response Bias which includes response sets such as the extreme response set and the neutral response set that relate to the application of the responses, namely the actual answer chosen by the respondent. Collectivism is negatively correlated with context and with self deception enhancement whereas individualism is positively correlated with context and self deception enhancement and impression management. Context is positively correlated with extreme response set and negatively correlated with neutral response set. The Collectivism-Individualism Model of Response Bias suggests that collectivist and individualist attributes directly affect the Impression-Response Bias response sets and indirectly affect the Expression-Response Bias response sets. It was concluded that attributes of collectivism and individualism affect the decision made by the respondents and therefore lead to different responses to Likert-type questionnaires. Nevertheless, the effect of collectivism and individualism on the magnitude of the responses would be limited as it is mediated by the Impression-Response Bias response set.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">PSYCHOLOGY, SOCIAL (0451)</field><field name="subject">PSYCHOLOGY, PSYCHOMETRICS (0632)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/83</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanics and material properties of the heart using an anatomically accurate mathematical model</field><field name="creator">Nash, Martyn</field><field name="description">Global and regional mechanics of the cardiac ventricles were investigated using an anatomicallyaccurate computational model formulated from concise mathematical descriptions ofthe left and right ventricular wall geometries and the non-homogeneous laminar microstructureof cardiac muscle. The finite element method for finite deformation elasticity was developedfor the analysis and included specialised coordinate systems, interpolation schemesand parallel processing techniques for greater computational efficiency.The ventricular mechanics model incorporated the fully orthotropic pole-zero constitutivelaw, based on the three-dimensional architecture of myocardium, to account for the nonlinearmaterial response of resting cardiac muscle, relative to the three anatomically relevant axes.A fibre distribution model was introduced to reconcile some of the pole-zero constitutiveparameters with direct mechanical properties of the tissue (such as the limiting strainsestimated from detailed physiological observations of the collagen helices that surroundmyofibres), whilst other parameters were estimated from in-vitro biaxial tension tests onthin sections of myocardium. A non-invasive approach to in-vivo myocardial materialparameter estimation was also developed, based on a magnetic resonance imaging techniqueto effectively tag ventricular wall tissue.The spatially non-homogeneous distribution of myocardial residual strain was accounted forin the ventricular mechanics model using a specialised growth tensor. A simple model of fluidshift was formulated to account for the changes in local tissue volume due to movement ofintramyocardial blood. Contractile properties of ventricular myofibres were approximatedusing a quasi-static relationship between the fibre extension ratio, intracellular calciumconcentration and active fibre stress, and the framework has been developed to include amore realistic model of active myocardial mechanics, which could be coupled to a realisticdescription of the time-varying spread of electrical excitation throughout the ventricularwalls. Simple volumetric cavity models were incorporated to investigate the effects of arterialimpedance on systolic wall mechanics.Ventricular mechanics model predictions of the cavity pressure versus volume relationships,longitudinal dimension changes, torsional wall deformations and regional distributions ofmyocardial strain during the diastolic filling, isovolumic contraction and ejection phasesof the cardiac cycle showed good overall agreement with reported observations derivedfrom experimental studies of isolated and in-vivo canine hearts.

Just like biologists, historical linguists infer relationships between the lineages they study by analysing heritable features. For linguists, these features can be words, grammar and phonemes. This linguistic evidence of descent with modification plays an important role in our understanding of human prehistory. However, conventional methods in historical linguistics do not employ an explicit optimality criterion to evaluate evolutionary language trees. These methods cannot quantify uncertainty in the inferences nor provide an absolute chronology of divergence events. Previous attempts to estimate divergence times from lexical data using glottochronological methods have been heavily criticized, particularly for the assumption of constant rates of lexical replacement. Computational phylogenetic methods from biology can overcome these problems and allow divergence times to be estimated without the assumption of constant rates. Here these methods are applied to lexical data to test hypotheses about human prehistory. First, divergence time estimates for the age of the Indo-European language family are used to test between two competing theories of Indo- European origin - the Kurgan hypothesis and the Anatolian farming hypothesis. The resulting age estimates are consistent with the age range implied by the Anatolian farming theory. Validation exercises using different models, data sets and coding procedures, as well as the analysis of synthetic data, indicate these results are highly robust. Second, the same methodology was applied to Mayan lexical data to infer historical relationships and divergence times within the Mayan language family. The results highlight interesting uncertainties in Mayan language relationships and suggest that the family may be older than previously thought. Finally, returning to biology, similar tree-building and model validation techniques are used to draw inferences about human origins and dispersal from human mitochondrial DNA sequence data. These analyses support a human origin 150,000-250,000 years ago and reveal time dependency in rates of mitochondrial DNA evolution. Population size estimates generated using a coalescent approach suggest a twophase human population expansion from Africa. Potential correlations between human genetic and linguistic diversity are highlighted. I conclude that there is much to be gained by linguists and biologists using the same methods and speaking the same language.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology, General (0621)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/86</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspiring for unity and equality : dynamics of conflict and change in the 'by women for women' feminist service groups, Aotearoa/New Zealand (1970-1999)</field><field name="creator">Vanderpyl, Jane</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the emergence and subsequent development of feminist activist service groups in Aotearoa/New Zealand feminist movements from the 1970s to the 1990s. It specifically considers, the Women's Centres, Women's Health Collectives, Women's Refuges and Rape Crisis groups. Feminism in the groups was closely linked to the internal processes of organising as a collective based on 'women's ways of working'. The groups merged a radical feminist political orientation with a service orientation as they developed services 'for women by women'. The study was based on a qualitative analysis of published and unpublished documents of activist service groups, and open-ended interviews with 65 women discussing their experiences of working in activist service groups. Two distinct phases of change to the internal organisation of the groups between 1970 and 1999 have been identified and examined. In the first phase, (1970s - 1980s), radical feminist collective ways of working acquired the status of a taken for granted institutional norm among the groups. These groups organised as women-only collectives, utilised consensus decision-making, embodied ideals of non-hierarchy, and had aspirations of sisterhood between women. The second phase (from the late 1980s) was marked by modification of the radical feminist collective, as groups experienced internal and external pressures to adopt bureaucratic practices. Major pressures included the shift by the state to contract funding of the groups, the changing participation of paid and unpaid workers in the daily work of the groups, and the increasing formal differentiation between employers and employees. These changes were a major source of conflict and tension, as the groups modified their organisations to include differentiation of roles, specialisation of positions and formal hierarchy. At the same time groups sustained aspects of radical feminist collective organising. Dealing with differences was a major site of tension and conflict in the activist service groups. Groups implemented various strategies to address differences between women in relation to race/ethnicity, sexuality and class. A major focus of the groups was the development of bicultural relations between M&#257;ori and non-M&#257;ori. Models of biculturalrelations in the predominantly P&#257;keh&#257; groups ranged from increasing M&#257;ori representation in the groups, to the formation of alliances between independent groups or alliances between ethnic-specific groups in the same organisation. These strategies were mostly framed in terms of a binary opposition between oppressed and oppressor, and along a single axis of oppression. Nevertheless, the groups' attempts to 'deal with differences' between women were important in challenging assumptions of genderbased commonality between all women. In spite of these conflicts and associated changes, participants in the activist service groups attempted to maintain inclusive, non-hierarchical, empowering organisations 'for women by women'. In the 1990s, many of the feminist activist service groups continued to pursue democratic collective ways of working and to engage in a politics of difference in their organisations.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Women's Studies (0453)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/87</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Older adulthood, education and social change (Australia, New Zealand)</field><field name="creator">Martin, Allan</field><field name="description">The outcome of demographics which point to a rapid increase in the number of older adults in the population has been widely debated in the literature. However, it has been examined primarily from the perspective of an unrealistically optimistic or unduly pessimistic view of the future, with few attempts to provide other alternatives.    This thesis is structured in three sections. The first backgrounds the context of the research question, the relevant literature, the prospect of gender bias in that literature and the historical development of government policy towards ageing. The second section presents a theoretical perspective for social change, examines the development of social movements and puts a case for a new social movement arising out of the increasing number of older adults and supporting educative processes. The third section reports on empirical research based on interviews in Australia and New Zealand with leaders of organisations involved with older adults and focuses on drawing conclusions from the research in relation to the research question.    The theory proposed in this thesis is based on the premise that an opportune time in history exists for older adults to contribute to social and political change. However, for senior members of society to undertake this role will require education in some form, to act as an agency or catalyst to initiate an organised social movement. Findings of this research support the view that the majority of older adults remain fit and healthy and do not conform to the medicalisation approach to ageing on which government policy and, to a large extent, public attitudes, have been formed. While there would be problems of organisation in the formation of a new social movement there are no insurmountable obstacles to overcome. The greatest difficulty would seem to lie in overcoming inertia, sectional interests, generating the leadership and developing innovative and imaginative educative processes.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/88</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The 'Jesus nut':  A study of New Zealand military chaplaincy</field><field name="creator">Tagg, Mary Alison</field><field name="description">Since the earliest days of the Christian Church, ordained ministers and priests have accompanied soldiers into battle. The religious presence in the war machine has been the subject of many debates, particularly those involving the conflict of ethics presented by the representation of a gospel of peace and love participating in a profession of violence and killing.    New Zealand is a secular country with a relatively well-developed system of secular pastoral care services. However the New Zealand Defence Force continues to request the churches' involvement in the military and those churches which respond continue to participate in work which appears contrary to their teaching. This study examines the relationship of church and military. It investigates the place of the church in the New Zealand Defence Force through an examination of the appropriate literature and other relevant information, and an empirical survey of the work and views of current, and some retired, chaplains.    The global military scenario has changed in recent years with the development of war technology. The New Zealand military focus is now largely directed towards policing New Zealand's economic zone and the preservation of independence of smaller neighbouring island states, while its active service role is one of participation in international peace-enforcement and peacekeeping. This thesis considers these changes and looks at the possible effects they may have on the future of military chaplaincy within the secular, multicultural context of the New Zealand state. The study concludes with a rationale for the presence of the Christian Church in the New Zealand Defense Force and presents issues which the current chaplaincy-providing churches need to consider if they wish to continue to provide effective chaplaincy for the military.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">RELIGION, CLERGY (0319)</field><field name="subject">THEOLOGY (0469)</field><field name="subject">HISTORY, CHURCH (0330)</field><field name="subject">EDUCATION, GUIDANCE AND COUNSELING (0519)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/89</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The epidemiology and clinical pathophysiology of thromboembolic disease</field><field name="creator">Egermayer, Paul Charles</field><field name="description">Thrombosis is a vascular pathological process which frequently affects the veins of the lower limbs, and embolisation of thrombotic material is common. Thromboembolic disease is a common cause of death in Western societies, predominantly affecting the elderly. Numerous risk factors and co-morbidities have been identified. Safe and effective means of prophylaxis are available but are underutilised.    Anticoagulant drugs are very effective in preventing thromboembolic disease, but their effects on the evolution of the thrombotic process remain poorly documented. These drugs are difficult to use, and treatment errors and treatment failures are common.    The factors which determine the embolisation of deep vein thrombosis are poorly understood. When such embolisation occurs it is usually asymptomatic. Symptomatic pulmonary embolism presents in 3 general ways-pleuritic pain, shortness of breath, or collapse. Tachypnea is the commonest sign.    Tests which are available to assist in the diagnosis of thromboembolic disease include the ventilation perfusion lung scan, ultrasound of the lower limbs, pulmonary angiography and echocardiography. The commonest investigation requested in this context is the lung scan. Although the results are often inconclusive, this is frequently the only specific investigation which is performed. The accurate interpretation of lung scans requires consideration of the pretest probability of pulmonary embolism. The D-dimer assay is another test which may be useful. The finding of a normal D-dimer level substantially reduces the probability of thromboembolic disease and may render a lung scan unnecessary.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">HEALTH SCIENCES, MEDICINE AND SURGERY (0564)</field><field name="subject">HEALTH SCIENCES, PATHOLOGY (0571)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/91</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The mechanism of death evoked by human amylin in pancreatic islet B cells</field><field name="creator">Bai, Ji Zhong</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.

As a number of studies have shown that galectin-1 is a growth inhibitor (Wells and Mallucci, 1991; Manilal et al., 1993), the starting hypothesis for this thesis was that galectin-1 might be a substrate for a growth-related proteinase (GRP). The intention was to identify the mechanism of action responsible for this growth-inhibitory property by looking at the effect of galectin treatment on the expression of the c-fos proto-oncogene.    The structure of the recombinant galectin-1 molecule was investigated in mass spectrometry determinations. Galectin-1 was further characterised in hemagglutination, cellular growth, cytotoxicity, proteolysis and cellular degradation experiments. Even though the recombinant galectin-1 was not identical with the natural protein because it contained two pGEX-linker amino acid residues, and had an apparently 933 Da bigger molecular weight, it fully retained the carbohydrate binding and mitogenicity properties and was still a biphasic growth modulator.    Repeated DNA sequencing and mass spectrometry determinations of the tryptic peptides have accounted for all the galectin molecule and have not detected an insertion. We concluded that the abnormal size was the result of a calibration error in the mass spectrometer.    Even though the recombinant galectin was proved to be very susceptible to soluble proteinase action, there was no evidence for its active degradation when incubated with cells, and this disproved the original hypothesis.    We showed for the first time that $/alpha/sb1$-antitrypsin inhibitor (which inhibits the GRP) had a down-regulatory effect on c-fos expression. Galectin-1 treatment of U2OS and HELA cells had a downregulatory effect on c-fos expression, which confirmed the hypothesis that this proto-oncogene is affected by the signal transduction pathway through which galectin-1 inhibits cell growth. C-fos expression is affected in HELA cells even though they do not undergo growth inhibition, indicating that this process is not as simple as we initially believed. Galectin-1 treatment also downregulated galectin-1 gene expression. This meant that feedback inhibition could take place in these tumour cells.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">BIOLOGY, MOLECULAR (0307)</field><field name="subject">BIOLOGY, CELL (0379)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/96</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rap Music in Aotearoa: A Sociological and Musicological Analysis</field><field name="creator">Zemke-White, Kirsten</field><field name="description">This thesis examines rap music in Aotearoa, demonstrates its popularity, and explores its presence as a cultural commodity, particularly among Polynesian youth. I show how analysis of a popular musical phenomenon can be used to illustrate other social facts such as identity, political awareness, and alliance. American rap's history, musical characteristics, misogyny, profanity, racial implications, associations with deviance, and nihilism are explored, outlining multiple levels of meaning and intention, not excusing its occasional harshness, but presenting perspectives from within rap and critical race theory discourses. From interviews with school students, teachers, rappers, adults involved with young people and persons in the media industry, I show that, in Aotearoa, it is the Polynesian youth who have embraced rap, both as fans and as performers, from breakdancing in the early 80's to the latest surge of "Pasifika Hip Hop". Through observation and collection of videos, CD's, sales charts, magazines and news articles I conclude that American rap has had a strong presence in the media and popular music history of Aotearoa, with many local rap artists and songs having local chart successes. Through musical and lyrical analysis I summarise and compare the themes and musical influences of both American and Aotearoa rap and discover that Aotearoa rap is used to assert and construct local identities exploring race, culture and history. The thesis begs the question: Why is rap so popular particularly among Polynesian youth? Four responses are explored: a) The rappers themselves cite a similar socio-economic and historical circumstance to African Americans; b) Rap is a popular globalised popular cultural form, possibly representing a generalised trend in Americanisation and homogenisation, (which I refute on the basis of rap's inherent "blackness" arguing that hip hop is rather a voice of opposition); c) Rap as a genre has kaupapa [philosophy] and presents an ideal tool for the exigencies of Polynesian youth's exploration of identity and community and for the communication of political and pride; and finally d) The Polynesian youth of Aotearoa feel a spiritual connection to rap and hip hop, hearing something of themselves in it, and have taken to it like it was already theirs. I offer that rap has been a Turangawaewae [place to stand] for the rangatahi [youth] and they have injected this fertile African American popular music genre with their own culture and ideology.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sociology, Ethnic and Racial Studies (0631)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/97</field></doc><doc><field name="title">J.

A study (German text)</field><field name="creator">Meuser, Anneliese</field><field name="description">This study contains a detailed interpretation of the fragmentary play  Catharina von Siena by the Sturm-und-Drang (Storm and Stress) poet Jakob Michael Reinhold Lenz (1751-1792). Although we have only drafts of this play, the topic, the structure, and the relatively long time Lenz spent on the drama indicate that it was nevertheless an important work.    Over three chapters this study approaches the Catharina fragments in various ways, the main focus being on improving our understanding of the text. Before starting on the actual interpretation a few basic questions need to be examined, these relating to the conditions in which the play was created and developed, the choice of subject and themes, the manuscripts and their history, as well as the six editions of Catharina von Siena . For this reason the central interpretative chapter is prefaced by a chapter on the genesis of the play, as well as another chapter on the manuscripts and texts.    Since it was not possible to work with original manuscripts, a microfilm and reader print copies of the manuscripts were used. The textual examination was based on the readily available edition by Damm. Where necessary the reading by Titel/Haug and the older text editions by Weinhold, Lewy, Blei and Freye were used to supplement these, and also for the purpose of comparison.    A pluralistic methodological approach was applied. A more exact period of time for the creation of Catharina von Siena was defined, information about the way Lenz worked and about his intentions with regard to construction and effect was obtained as well. Through this detailed study of the fragments, correspondence and biographical data, we can establish reasons for the fragmentary character of the play, and are able to ascertain the special nature of the drama.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">LITERATURE, GERMANIC (0311)</field><field name="subject">THEATER (0465)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/98</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Globalisation, internationalisation and the knowledge economy in higher education: A case study of China and New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Jiang, Xiaoping (Isadora)</field><field name="description">This thesis analyses the contemporary phenomena of globalisation, the knowledge economy and internationalisation in terms of their synergistic impacts on higher education and with special reference to China and New Zealand. Globalisation and the knowledge economy are seen to fuel each other as well as driving trends in higher education. Internationalisation is shown to be intimately related to, but conceptually distinguishable from, globalisation, and to occur partly as a consequence of the latter (and of developments in the knowledge economy) but partly also as a response to these forces. All three phenomena are addressed through assessments of their dominant economic imperatives.    As a prerequisite to understanding and critiquing these forces and their dominant imperatives, the early chapters expound a further tripartite structure, this time of political-economic theories: neoliberalism, neo-Marxism, and Giddens' 'Third Way'. The lens through which the analysis is made is explicitly neo-Marxist. The thesis critiques the ascendancy of neoliberalism in the discourse of globalisation, and the knowledge economy and the internationalisation of higher education. Neoliberalism's ascendancy is shown to be promoted through global, regional, national and sub-national entities, and this promotion is found to be often covert.    The middle section of the thesis traces the effects on higher education of the economic, and specifically neoliberal or global-capitalist imperatives that the foregoing analysis reveals. Policies of deregulation, liberalisation, marketisation, privatisation and commercialisation are shown to exert largely negative influences on universities and, by extension, on other higher education institutions. They over-emphasise the private value of both knowledge itself and higher education as a knowledge agent, something which leads to a homogenising, devaluing 'commodification' of higher education. Having made the general case, the thesis then considers the Asia-Pacific region before focusing in depth on China and New Zealand. This structure makes for a macro-meso-micro approach to the development of the inquiry but with emphasis on the macro and the micro.    Key questions raised in the thesis concern the establishment of a 'counter-hegemony' to oppose the dominance of neoliberal principles and policies. The study culminates by recommending the emergent concept of interculturalism as both an accurate description of the intersection of cultures on campus and a desirable nonnative policy which should complement internationalisation as part of national and institutional response strategies. The thesis argues for the legitimation and encouragement of neo-Marxist interculturalisation and outlines its relevance to New Zealand higher education institutions, which host many international and new immigrant students, above all from China.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">EDUCATION, HIGHER (0745)</field><field name="subject">ECONOMICS, GENERAL (0501)</field><field name="subject">POLITICAL SCIENCE, GENERAL (0615)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/99</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On the ontogeny and phylogeny of the representational mind</field><field name="creator">Suddendorf, Thomas</field><field name="description">This thesis proposes a theory for fundamental aspects of the evolution and development of the representational mind. Building on Perner's (1991) theory of representational development, it is suggested that mind evolved from the ability to represent current reality (primary mind) to further entertain secondary representations of hypothetical content (collating mind) to finally represent representational relations themselves (metamind). In child development these transitions can be observed by about 18 months and by about 42 to 48 months. In comparative analysis only the great apes show signs of a collating mind. Young children and great apes can, for example, pretend, consider a limited future and past, solve problems by insight, and consider others' basic mental states. By about age four children begin to show evidence for metarepresentation in their ability to pass theory-of-mind tasks. At about the same age they also gain considerable executive control which, together with metarepresentation, is the key cognitive advance of metamind. Empirical evidence suggests that various skills co-develop with metamind and the thesis includes four studies that investigate such associations. It was found that gestural representation with imaginary objects and the generation of creative problem solutions were robustly correlated with theory-of-mind measures. These results substantiate the claim for a domain-general change in cognitive ability by about age four. Understanding delayed video feedback, however, was not found to correlate with such measures and it is questioned whether delayed feedback tasks measure an extended sense of self as has been proposed (Povinelli, 1995; Suddendorf &amp; Corballis, 1997). Great apes, while showing evidence for a collating mind, have not yet provided any convincing evidence for metamind. It is thus suggested that metamind developed after the split from the line that led to modern chimpanzees about five million years ago. Metamind, it is argued, was a prime mover in human phylogeny and is a crucial step in human ontogeny.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">PSYCHOLOGY, DEVELOPMENTAL (0620)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/100</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Semiotics and the discourse of architecture</field><field name="creator">Walker, Paul Joseph</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses a problematic of meaning and of semiotics in architecture by considering a number of questions. Why have meaning and semiotics been of concern in architectural discourse? How did semiotics enter that discourse? How does it operate there?    The first chapter explores the notion of meaning in art, assuming this to have bearing on meaning in architecture. Functionalism is investigated as an implicitly semantic view of architecture: it is proposed that it is the failure of functionalism in practice which underlies the recent concern with meaning.    Chapter 2 introduces the work of eight semioticians: Saussure, Peirce, Morris, Mukarovsky, Jakobson, Levi-Strauss, Barthes, and Eco.    Chapter 3 poses the question of why semiotics has been attractive to architects. Attention is given to Tafuri's notion that semiotics serves both to bolster the current status of architecture (by blockading investigation of its discursive characteristics) and as radial criticism. Work by Norberg-Schulz and by Jencks is shown to be blockade; that by Agrest and Gandelsonas more nearly critical. It is proposed that semiotics and the discourse of modern architecture are epistemologically analogous, which circumstance has facilitated and been conditional to the entry of semiotics into architecture.    The fourth chapter examines Eco's and Preziosi's rigorous semiotic theories of the built. Both have been posited, however, as theories of architecture; as such they impede rather than foster theorizing with respect to architectural discourse.    Chapter 5 assumes a (semiotic) model of architecture as a hierarchy of codes (building, language, drawing, photography). The role of language in architecture is shown to be more important than is generally conceded. Architectural discourse is also shown to be dependent on photography, and, by implication, on other graphic modes.    While bearing in mind the links between the postmodern and radical strains of semiotics, the final chapter surveys architecture in culture's present postmodern moment. If the problematic of meaning in architecture has been motivated by the 'emptiness' of the built world constructed under the aegis of functional architecture, this problematic cannot be taken as a recuperation. Rather, the advent of semiotics in the discourse of architecture may signify its transposition to an unknown discursive configuration.</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ARCHITECTURE (0729)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/102</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Constructing the "other" : on being a man and a nurse</field><field name="creator">Harding, Thomas S</field><field name="description">This study explores the experiences of men who are nurses in Aotearoa New Zealand. Utilising discourse analysis a social constructionist reading of men, masculinity and nursing is provided to offer an alternative reading to much of the extant literature with respect to men in nursing. The study draws upon a number of different sources of "text", including over 600 written works, two films and interviews with eighteen men who currently are, have been or are intending to be, nurses. Drawing primarily upon the "literary" textual sources a number of themes were identified for further exploration in interview with the coresearchers. These themes were the construction of masculinity, the construction of images of the nurse, the reaction to men who are nurses, sexuality issues, career development, and men and caring. The findings of this thesis reveal that the literature pertaining to men in nursing is replete with paradox and contradiction and fails to adequately account for the male experience. It is argued that the images and arguments provided in the literature with respect to men in nursing are based on out-of-date models and understandings of gender relations, masculinity and nursing. It is suggested that rather than enjoying patriarchal privilege, men who enter nursing must contend with being constructed as both an inferior man and inferior nurse. Their careers are not, as is alleged in the literature, based on developing "islands of masculinity" and male privilege, nor upon the avoidance of the emotional labour of nursing but reflect a belief that career is one way of doing care. It is argued in this work that men in nursing have fewer "taken-as-givens" upon which to base work and that they work to develop trusting relationships with their patients that are based on communication and empathy within a context defined by the patients' circumstances.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Health Sciences, Nursing (0569)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/103</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Implementation and assessment of a new integrated drug administration system (IDAS) as an example of a safety intervention in a complex socio-technological workplace</field><field name="creator">Webster, Craig Stephen</field><field name="description">The rate of injury and death inadvertently caused by medical treatment is too high and exacts enormous human and financial costs. Each year in Britain and the United States alone, hundreds of thousands of patients are injured, ten of thousands are killed and billions of dollars are spent on additional health care due to iatrogenic harm. Health care organisations remain predominately human-centred in their approach to safety-that is, methods of avoiding error rely primarily on the resolve and vigilance of individual clinicians to avoid bad outcomes. However, this approach is becoming increasingly inadequate in the face of the steadily rising complexity of modern health care and the increasing number of procedures carried out each year. In other high-reliability organisations such as aviation and nuclear power generation, safety results not from the sheer effort of &#8220;operators&#8221;, but from in-depth analysis of problems and the removal and redesign of dangerous aspects of systems-the so-called systems approach. Here I present an evaluation of the integrated drug administration system (IDAS) as an example of the systems approach, intended to reorganise the way in which anaesthetists give drugs to improve performance and facilitate safe practice. The problem of drug error in anaesthesia is an important subset of iatrogenic harm in medicine. From the prospective study of 10806 conventional anaesthetics I define the rate of drug error in anaesthesia as one error in every 133 anaesthetics conducted-a rate five times higher than anything previously reported. In addition, anaesthetists rated the risk of harming a patient through drug error in the course of their career as high. I discuss the principles of safe system design, the psychology of error, and advanced systems safety concepts with respect to the design of the IDAS and the future of safety in medicine. In clinical use, the IDAS saved time before and during anaesthesia, and was rated by anaesthetists as significantly safer and more useable than conventional methods of drug administration. This work supports the hypothesis that error in anaesthesia can be reduced through the systematic analysis of its causes and the implementation of appropriate countermeasure strategies.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">HEALTH SCIENCES, PHARMACOLOGY (0419)</field><field name="subject">HEALTH SCIENCES, OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY (0354)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/104</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Network strategy in the New Zealand wine industry : how firms in an industry understand and use their business relationships</field><field name="creator">Benson-Rea, Maureen</field><field name="description">Network strategy in the New Zealand wine industry: how firms in an industry understand and use their business relationshipsThis theory-building study offers new theoretical explanations for how and why companies within a case industry use relationships in their strategies. Using qualitative data from multiple case studies within the New Zealand wine industry, the thesis captures and explains the strategic heterogeneity of diverse patterns of relationships and network interactions and how these are used strategically. Drawing on strategic management and business network theory, it emphasises how firms value their relationships in strategy, that is, how they contribute to strategy formation process and realisation outcomes. The study builds new interpretations and extends theory through in-depth exploration, providing two extensive typologies of relationships, one categorised according to the range of relationships, their functions, content and contribution to strategy, and another according to strategies and how relationships are used in their realisation. A model of relationship drivers in strategy is then developed, tested, and refined to show the purposes and outcomes of relationships and clarify the processes and conditions under which they arise and are used within an industry. The data support converging assumptions in strategic management and business network theory on the connectedness of firms in business relationships and the embeddedness of economic action in ongoing ties within social structures. Concepts of intentionality and emergence are used to show that emergence primarily arises out of intentionality.Understanding of relationships was based on the historically collective nature of the industry, on personal values, experience or approaches to relationships, on firm level strategy, especially decisions around grow, buy or connect options, and whether the firm aimed to control resources and activities internally or used relationships to achieve strategic goals. Firms focused on (in order of priority): resource-based input requirements, activity-based capability related strategies and actor-based values and these inputs operated at three levels which, singly or in combination, drove the diverse use of relationships: firm level strategy influences, relationship level influences and industry environment level influences. Two frameworks emerge which have strong explanatory power. One models how firms understanding and value placed on relationships is integrated into strategy processes. Another integrates concepts in a new way to show the main pathways through ways of understanding relationship development and use in strategy.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Strategy ; International Business ; Marketing</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Marketing (0338)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/105</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Resilience against stress and depression in the postpartum period</field><field name="creator">Thio, Irene Marie</field><field name="description">Background. Because there have been few studies examining resilience associated with postnatal (PN) depression, this study aimed at formulating and testing a theory-based model integrating both traditional resilience paradigms and non-traditional factors including existential beliefs about life, motherhood and religion.    Method. Study hypotheses addressed prediction of PN depression, stress and resilience, and the confounding influence of negative affectivity (neuroticism). Study variables included PN depression (Edinburgh PN Depression Scale, EPDS), stress, neuroticism, self-esteem, mother's distress and ambivalence, purpose/meaning, religious belief, parity, age, marital and social status. They were assessed with standardized self-report instruments and, following a pilot, administered to a probability sample of women four months postpartum in a one-wave, community, postal survey. Because the overall response rate was so low (49%) only the Europeans were included in the study (N = 225; response-rate = 78%). Statistical hypothesis-testing included linear and logistical multivariate model-twilding techniques, and principal components analysis.    Results. Sixteen percent scored in the major depression range (EPDS &gt; 12), and 14% in the minor depression range. Depression was associated with stress, neuroticism, purpose/meaning, mother's distress and (marginally) religious belief, but not with self-esteem, mother's ambivalence, age, parity or social class. Although neuroticism was strongly associated with depression, and also overlapped with most psycho-social variables, nonetheless stress, purpose/meaning, and mother's distress maintained significant relationships with depression after neuroticism was statistically controlled. Stress was associated in part with the perception of losing one's freedom in the motherhood role (neuroticism controlled). When resilience was defined as high stress coupled with low depression, it was associated with low levels of neuroticism and mother's distress. When resilience was defined in terms of high levels of maternal satisfaction, it was associated with high purpose and low ambivalence. Principal components analyses revealed that (1) stress scores reflected two dimensions suggestive of distress and self-efficacy; and (2) depression, stress, neuroticism, self-esteem and purpose were markers for the same underlying component, whereas mother's distress and ambivalence were markers for another (unrelated) component.    Conclusion. This study underlines the relevance of temperament, self-efficacy, self-transcendence, existential beliefs and motherhood-related cogniitions to the understanding of PN depression and stress.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">PSYCHOLOGY, CLINICAL (0622)</field><field name="subject">PSYCHOLOGY, PERSONALITY (0625)</field><field name="subject">PSYCHOLOGY, SOCIAL (0451)</field><field name="subject">HEALTH SCIENCES, MENTAL HEALTH (0347)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The evolution of the New Zealand monarchy:  The recognition of an autochthonous polity</field><field name="creator">Cox, Noel Stanley Bertie</field><field name="description">The aims of this thesis are to determine to what extent the Crown remains important as a source of legitimacy for the constitutional order and as a focus of sovereignty; how the Crown has developed as a distinct institution; and what the prospects are for the adoption of a republican form of government in New Zealand.    The imperial Crown has evolved into the New Zealand Crown, yet the implications of this change are as yet only slowly being understood. Largely this is because that evolution came about as a result of gradual political development, as part of an extended process of independence, rather than by deliberate and conscious decision.    The continuing evolution of political independence does not necessarily mean that New Zealand will become a republic in the short-to-medium term. This is for various reasons. The concept of the Crown has often been, in New Zealand, of greater importance than the person of the Sovereign, or that of the Governor-General. The existence of the Crown has also contributed to, rather than impeded, the independence of New Zealand, through the division of imperial prerogative powers. In particular, while the future constitutional status of the Treaty of Waitangi remains uncertain, the Crown appears to have acquired greater legitimacy through being a party to the Treaty. The expression of national identity does not necessarily require the removal of the Crown.    The very physical absence of the Sovereign, and the all-pervading nature of the legal concept of the Crown, have also contributed to that institution's development as a truly national organ of government. The concept of the Crown has now, to a large extent, been separated from its historical, British, roots. This has been encouraged by conceptual confusion over the symbolism and identity of the Crown. But this merely illustrates the extent to which the Crown has become an autochthonous polity, grounded in our own unique settlement and evolution since 1840. Whether that conceptual strength is sufficient to counterbalance symbolic and other challenges in the twenty-first century remains uncertain. But it is certain that the Crown has had a profound affect upon the style and structure of government in New Zealand.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">POLITICAL SCIENCE, GENERAL (0615)</field><field name="subject">LAW (0398)</field><field name="subject">HISTORY, ASIA, AUSTRALIA AND OCEANIA (0332)</field><field name="subject">Legal history</field><field name="subject">Politics</field><field name="subject">International law</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420305 New Zealand cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/107</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of simulation-based education in the management of medical emergencies</field><field name="creator">Weller, Jennifer Mary</field><field name="description">The traditional approach to medical education is changing and simulation is increasingly being incorporated into the curriculum, particularly in the context of emergency care. Simulation takes many forms, but this thesis refers only to whole patient simulators, where a computerised mannikin placed in a clinically appropriate environment is used to recreate a realistic clinical encounter. The focus of this work is the management of medical emergencies. Aim The overall aim of this body of work is to evaluate the effectiveness of simulationbased education across a range of different learners, and to investigate the properties of simulation-based assessment. In particular:  To review the literature on the effectiveness of simulation, and its use in assessment.  To evaluate the current status and effectiveness of CME interventions and the relative usefulness of simulation courses in this context.  To determine if simulation-based courses in crisis management can lead to changes in physician behaviour. iii  To evaluate student perceptions of learning in a simulator environment.  To assess students' ability to manage simulated emergencies, and their opinion of simulation-based assessment.  To define the psychometric properties and feasibility of simulation-based assessment in anaesthesia, the accuracy of self-assessment and the impact on learning. Methods and Results A number of different methods were used, which will be described in detail in the subsequent chapters. Overall, the results provide evidence for the effectiveness of simulation across a range of applications. Simulation-based assessment is acceptable, likely to have a positive impact on learning, and evidence support aspects of validity. Reliable scores can be generated but large numbers of cases are required. Conclusions There is sufficient evidence to recommend incorporating simulation-based courses into the acute care curriculum of medical undergraduates. Simulation is effective in CME in the context of anaesthesia crisis management and this is likely to apply to other acute care specialties. Like other clinically based assessments, extended testing time is required to generate reliable scores, limiting the feasibility of large scale, simulation-based exit examinations.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery (0564)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/109</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Furthering the role of corporate finance in economic growth</field><field name="creator">Kamiryo, Hideyuki, 1930-</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.

A total of 517 Taiwanese EFL students from four educational levels were recruited for inquiring into the development of EFL writing. Quantitative analyses of writing tasks, vocabulary tests and questionnaires were used to describe and explain the multi-faceted nature of EFL writing in terms of the likely influencing factors.    Initially the contributions of respective factors were examined separately. Rhetorical analyses of students' English and Chinese compositions showed there were co-existing positive and negative influences of first language (L1) rhetoric on English writing. Analyses of lexical use and errors in English compositions, plus results from the assessment of two vocabulary tests, indicated that lexical and grammatical knowledge was a critical factor in explaining English writing. Results of students' Chinese writing abilities in relation to English writing proficiency revealed that the transfer of Chinese writing expertise was conditioned by a developed Chinese expertise and a lack of English writing experiences. Findings from the written-speech analysis of English essays suggested a transitional development whereby spoken language was used. Analyses of questionnaires indicated that EFL writing was positively related to attention on the macro-level structure and negatively related to micro-level concerns.    Subsequently, integrated analyses were conducted to examine the interplay among these factors. The shared variability of factors contributed a much larger portion to the explanation of developmental changes, suggesting that the development of EFL writing involves the interaction among influencing factors much more than the individual factors themselves. The unique contributions (independent of other interrelated variables) showed that essay length outweighed the other predictors, suggesting a need for instruction to develop the skill of fluency. A determining factor that consistently accounted for English writing performance was the students' levels of English learning and English writing experiences. The implication is that, particularly in the context where writing is neglected for beginning or intermediate learners, there is a need to revitalize writing as a communicative skill in the EFL curriculum.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">LANGUAGE, RHETORIC AND COMPOSITION (0681)</field><field name="subject">EDUCATION, LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE (0279)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/111</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Housing and health (New Zealand)</field><field name="creator">Asaad, Eman</field><field name="description">A belief based on a personal experience that asthma incidence in New Zealand is interrelated with the indoor environment, led the author to establish the study between asthma and housing.    A considerable period of time was spent first on studying the roots of the two issues, asthma and New Zealand housing. The historical experience showed that health and housing problems at the national level in the 19 th century in England were solved by state interference.    The architectural background of this study created a need to cover some medical knowledge to understand the causes, symptoms and cure of asthma, if any. This knowledge was crucial while monitoring houses, designing the questionnaire, and analysing results.    Two stages of monitoring were achieved in 2000 and 2001. In addition to the monitoring, there was an attempt to find out as much information as possible about any issues related to the health conditions, especially the respiratory disorders, and the houses. The study of housing included building construction, house dust mite allergen levels in the carpet, building drawings, and other issues in preparation for the next stage of analysis.    The overwhelming quantity of information gathered about the 30 houses investigated in 2000 was so confusing that no statistical software package was seen as a perfect way for analysing it. It was decided then to establish comparisons between each factor investigated and asthma presence. Also, in most of the cases, the correlation between more than one factor with asthma rates was examined.    The investigation of the relations between many issues and asthma showed that there were links between asthma incidence and some indoor conditions of houses. Raised timber floors, which were found in most of the houses to be un-insulated, and in all the cases to be on unprotected ground, were found to have a strong relation with asthma incidence. In these houses, it was found that high asthma incidence was related to a higher level of moisture indoors. Asthma incidence in houses having old carpet, moulds, pets, or smokers indoors was higher than asthma incidence in houses without these. Old houses were found to have more asthma incidence than new houses. All the allergen levels in the carpets were extremely high and they were all above the allergen levels induced by house dust mites that can provoke asthma in susceptible individuals.    Based on the knowledge gained about the defective factors in housing affecting asthma, upgrading of the houses was designed. A house was chosen to be upgraded in three stages, each stage providing a different level of insulation. The upgrading costs were compared with the current national costs of health and heating to see what level of upgrading would be logical and cost-effective. National costs and savings were estimated in four cases each with different level of insulation. It was decided at the final stage of the study that insulating ceilings and floors in addition to other basic upgrading factors would provide savings in health and heating costs and would result in less CO2 emissions to the atmosphere of New Zealand.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ARCHITECTURE (0729)</field><field name="subject">HEALTH SCIENCES, PUBLIC HEALTH (0573)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/112</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Control of high voltage DC and flexible AC transmission systems</field><field name="creator">Jovcic, Dragan</field><field name="description">Analytical modeling of HVDC systems has been a difficult task without a to-date reported model convenient for serious analysis of practically reported HVDC stability problems. In order to cover the frequency range f&lt;100Hz, and to cater for different model requirements, three different HVDC-HVAC models are developed in this Thesis: Detailed linear-continuous model, simplified linear continuous model and linear discrete model. Detailed HVDC-HVAC system model is intended for small signal analysis of HVDC-HVAC interactions and resulting stability problems. It demonstrates good response matching against PSCAD/EMTDC simulation, where the CIGRE HVDC Benchmark model is used as the test system. All model variables (states) and parameters have physical meaning, and the model consists of modules, which reflect actual physical subsystems. Simplified HVDC-HVAC system dynamic model is developed as a fourth order dynamic model, which is less accurate but more convenient for the analysis, than the detailed model. The model proves to be reliable for controller design for mitigation of composite resonance and for the study of non-linear effects in HVDC systems. The developed linear discrete model is primarily intended for the system analysis at frequencies close to 100Hz on DC side of HVDC system. A new approach in modeling of TCR/TCSC, based on the same principles for HVDC modeling, is presented in this Thesis. The model development is far less difficult than the similar models presented in literature. PSCAD/EMTDC simulation confirms the model validity. The simplified, linear-continuous model is used for the analysis of dominant non-linear effects in HVDC systems. The analysis of non-linear mode transformation between constant beta and constant gamma operation, shows that limit-cycle oscillations are not expected to develop, for normal operating conditions. The analysis of converter firing angle modulation shows that converter behaves as a non-linear element only for some unlikely operating conditions. In this Thesis, it is attempted to counteract the composite resonance phenomenon by modifying the resonant condition on DC system impedance profile. This is accomplished by designing a supplementary HVDC controller that acts on HVDC firing angle on both line ends. PSCAD/EMTDC simulation results show that significant reduction in DC side first harmonic component (in some cases to 1/4 of the original value) is possible with the newly designed controller. Chapter 5 studies 100Hz oscillations on DC side of HVDC system. A methodology for designing a new controller to counteract negative affects of these oscillations is presented. Linear simulation of the detailed controller design confirms noticeable reduction in second harmonic on DC side. The eigenvalue decomposition and singular value decomposition is used for small-signal analysis of HVDC-HVAC interactions. The analysis of sensitivity of the dominant system eigenvalues with respect to the AC system parameters, shows the frequency range for the possible oscillatory instabilities at rectifier and at inverter side. The rectifier side of the system is most likely to experience instability at higher frequencies, whereas at inverter side the instabilities can be expected at lower frequencies. Further analysis shows that reduction in the AC system strength i will predominantly affect the eigenvalues at lower frequencies, where the SCR reduction at inverter side much more affects the system stability. The analysis of interactions between AC and DC systems through the influence of inherent feedback loops gives recommendations for the possible control of interaction variables with the aim of system stability improvement. The root locus technique is used for the stability analysis of HVDC control loops, where all conventional and some alternative control methods suggested in the literature are investigated. It is found that DC feedback, at rectifier side, significantly improves the system stability at lower frequencies, however, at frequencies close to the first harmonic this feedback control degrades the system stability, actually accelerating the development of composite resonance. At inverter side, most of the feedback loops improve the system stability in a certain frequency range, whereas at other frequencies they noticeably deteriorate stability. Among all reported inverter control methods, reactive current feedback is found to be the best option. The last Chapter develops a new controller for HVDC system operation with very weak inverter AC systems. The selection of feedback signal for this controller, is based on the analysis of positioning of zeros for candidate feedback signals. It is found that AC current angle is the best inverter feedback signal. This feedback signal can move the unstable complex eigenvalues left, into the stable region, without significantly affecting remaining eigenvalues. For the additional improvement in the system performance, a second order filter, designed using control theory, is placed into the feedback loop. The main design objective is the system robustness with respect to the AC system parameters changes. The controller designed in this Thesis, tolerates very wide changes in system strength, 1.7&lt;SCR&lt;3.5, with the nominal operating point at SCR=2.5. This wide change of operating parameters, although very unlikely in practice, demonstrates large improvement in the system performance with the new controller. The similar controller especially designed for extremely low SCR, shows that HVDC system can satisfactory operate with SCR=1.0 at inverter side and heralds the possible controller use instead of synchronous condensers or SVC elements at inverter AC bus.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/272</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Organisational learning facilitated by the analysis of student achievement information</field><field name="creator">Millward, Pamela</field><field name="description">This thesis explores reasons for New Zealand&#8217;s problematic tail of literacy underachievement and suggests one way to address the problem, is for schools to operate as learning organizations. A qualitative research design was used to identify elements of organizational learning in the practices of three very different schools identified as improving the students&#8217; learning outcomes. The research methods included semi-structured interviews, team meeting observations, an anonymous questionnaire and document analysis. An analytical framework identifying five elements of organizational learning, developed from a review of the organizational learning literature, was used to evaluate each school&#8217;s ability to learn about their teaching and learning programmes as a result of reviewing students&#8217; achievement information. The research findings identified elements of the organizational learning framework in the practices of all three schools. It was found that whilst the elements of the framework were necessary, the entirety of the framework was most significant in facilitating organizational learning. In order for the schools to learn to improve the learning of their students, they needed to have a well defined infrastructure for the collection, collation, analysis and use of student achievement information. The occurrence of the infrastructure alone did not, however, facilitate organizational learning. The school leaders and teachers needed to apply the appropriate curriculum content, pedagogical and assessment literacy knowledge to the assessment data in order to make sense of it and to use the information to review and refine their teaching and learning programmes. The acquisition of appropriate levels of professional knowledge appeared to be facilitated within a culture where teachers felt safe and confident to challenge and be challenged in their collegial discussions about students&#8217; learning. Rigorous collegial discussions appeared to foster team learning and to be leader driven. When the appropriate professional knowledge was not available within the organization, learning only appeared to occur when the necessary expertise was accessed from the external environment.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/274</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Te kaita&#772;rei ara ta&#772;ngata whenua mo te Whare Wa&#772;nanga : &#8217;E&#772;hara, he hara ranei?&#8217; = Developing indigenous infrastructure in the University :  'Another era or another error?'</field><field name="creator">Robust, Te Tuhi</field><field name="description">Abstract/ Whakar&#257;poto Take The specific aim of this study is to identify critical features of w&#257;nanga or the traditional M&#257;ori learning institution and how these might inform M&#257;ori education today in a University setting. It also examines the responsiveness of the tertiary institution in creating an indigenous infrastructure aimed at M&#257;ori educational participation. A number of &#8216;critical events&#8217; relating to M&#257;ori educational development interventions in the 1980&#8217;s will be considered with the expectation that they will serve to inform the development of better educational outcomes for access, participation, recruitment, retention and the advancement of M&#257;ori in the conventional University setting. For the purpose of this study contemporary M&#257;ori academic sites, which include state funded w&#257;nanga, as well as other indigenous academic sites will be discussed, including the First Nations House of Learning at the University of British Columbia1. There is thus an international perspective in this study. Whare w&#257;nanga were a key institution in traditional M&#257;ori society and represented in all regions of Aotearoa/ New Zealand. The ability to travel and share each other&#8217;s knowledge attested or benchmarked by others was a key part of the maintenance of the tribal lore. T&#333;hunga were central to the entire process of controlling the knowledge and selecting to whom it was to be imparted. This raises a question of what a contemporary w&#257;nanga, as an intervention and an academic entity would look like at the University of Auckland and would it withstand international scrutiny? As a kaupapa M&#257;ori educational intervention, it is a theoretical test in the configurations of conscientization, resistance and transformative praxis. The inclusive approach in using existing material and people resources to maximize the impact of the intervention is to be discussed in this thesis. Specific case studies provide a means for checking the evidence for the processes and the predicted outcomes for kaupapa M&#257;ori theory. The recalling of events is central to both case studies. An event such as the rugby match that took place between both countries in 1927, discussed later in this thesis, combined with similar initiatives embarked upon by indigenous leaders from both tertiary communities to create a physical presence for First Nations and M&#257;ori, are identities at the core of the case studies. Cultural connection, and a style of operation that is inclusive, enact in part the values raised by Madeleine McIvor: respect, reciprocity, relevance and responsibility. The factors all converge to build this thesis into a series of conversations. The collaboration undertaken over long distances and periods of time has motivated the creation of this record of the stories of both institutions, that can be added to by others in the future. The markers of success for the University of Auckland include the arresting of the decline of M&#257;ori student enrolments alongside the growth of M&#257;ori participating in post-graduate study and research, therefore providing opportunity to contribute to the bank of knowledge in New Zealand society. While the regeneration of the language in New Zealand has been the driving force behind the w&#257;nanga development at the University of Auckland building further on the foundations of kohanga reo, kura kaupapa M&#257;ori, whare kura and w&#257;nanga, the development of M&#257;ori as with First Nations initiatives has been in the area of education. Tertiary institutions offer a context in which kaupapa M&#257;ori theory brings together common threads of communication for people. Whether this is through elements of struggle within societies or just survival, the main thing is that people need each other to develop and progress.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/275</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A public silence : discursive practices surrounding homosexuality</field><field name="creator">Semp, David</field><field name="description">Considerable research points to an elevated prevalence of mental health problems and suicide for men who have sex with men (MSM). Yet there is little research on how public mental health services (PMHS) does, or could, address the needs of MSM. When such literature does appear, a common suggestion is that queer staff will be necessary to improve PMHS for MSM through a process of &#8216;matching&#8217;. Yet, no research has specifically explored the views of queer staff or MSM clients on this. Further, a positivist trend within the existing literature contains individualising and essentialising assumptions that limit our understanding of relationships between MSM and PMHS. Adopting a critical social constructionist perspective, I argue that Foucauldian theory and its analysis of the relationships between discourses, power, and subjectivity, enables research to focus on the social and structural processes constructing mental health care for MSM. This thesis explores the discursive construction of the relationships between MSM and PMHS, and the implications of this for practice. My analysis begins by explicating commonly circulating discourses of homosexuality, and of mental health, in New Zealand. These discourses are evidenced in (but not limited to) academic literature, governmental documents, and queer and mainstream media. They provide a framework for the analysis of interviews with 12 queer staff and 13 MSM clients of PMHS. The analyses illustrate the multiple discourses informing the MSM&#8217;s subjectivities as homosexuals and show the predominant discourses they draw on to account for their mental health problems. I suggest the term &#8216;homonegative trauma&#8217; to denote this. Analyses of the staff and clients&#8217; accounts around the &#8216;disclosure&#8217; of homosexuality within PMHS reveal discursive power relations which restrain staff, and some clients, from acknowledging homosexuality. I consider two strategies for disrupting this heteronormative silence within PMHS. I contend that the notion of &#8216;matching&#8217; queer clients and staff is a minoritising one, with limited ability to counter heteronormativity. In contrast, a universalising approach requires all staff to initiate conversations with all clients about sexuality. Making a comparison between staff inquiring about sexuality, and the currently recommended practice of staff asking about sexual abuse, I argue that this analogy provides useful resources to support such a universalising move. I conclude by arguing for systemic and structural changes in PMHS to support staff to routinely enquire about sexuality. If done with an awareness of the discursive complexity involved, such a shift has the potential to disrupt heteronormative practices within PMHS. My analysis suggests that the power of the medical discourse in particular, will be a significant restraint to such a change. However, if heteronormative practices within PMHS remain unchallenged they will continue to silence some MSM clients, thereby, maintaining the homonegative trauma described by most of the MSM clients interviewed. This would reproduce a tendency within the medical discourse to focus on individual pathology and to evade the ways in which social marginalisation and oppression can be constructive of mental health problems.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/276</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pathways to literacy and transitions to school : enabling incorporation and developing awareness of literacy</field><field name="creator">Tamarua, Lavinia Tina</field><field name="description">This study examines children&#8217;s development and incorporation of literacy expertise across multiple sites and the transitions to school by four M&#257;ori preschool children, their wh&#257;nau (families) and their teachers in Aotearoa/New Zealand. This study is embedded in a Kaupapa M&#257;ori framework of understanding and explaining teaching and learning processes across multiple sites of learning for children whose practices reflect ways of being and acting M&#257;ori. Descriptions of teaching and learning processes are also explained utilising a co-constructivist theoretical framework. These descriptions and explanations focus on the psychological processes of learning and development that children, wh&#257;nau and teachers&#8217; engage in their practice. A two phase case study design was employed that examines the teaching and learning processes of literacy across multiple sites. The first phase provides qualitative data that describes and explains how the different sorts of literacy and language activities are coconstructed by wh&#257;nau and children. The ways by which literacy activities are constructed are inherent in parents ideas about teaching and learning reflected out of their diverse pedagogical practices. The distinct pedagogical practices also highlight the multiple pathways to learning that children developed and experienced in becoming an expert. This study also reported the influence of early educational settings as alternative and multiple contexts by which learning is organised and constructed. The different contexts provided families with specific ideas and practices about the teaching and learning process. The second phase of the study provides descriptions of how children&#8217;s literacy expertise was incorporated into classroom literacy and language activities. This phase of the study examines how teachers provided opportunities by which children&#8217;s literacy expertise was incorporated into classroom activities. This study reported incidents where incorporation of children&#8217;s level of literacy expertise was enhanced while other children&#8217;s literacy expertise was discouraged in classroom activities. The significance of the reported differences of incorporation was provided from teacher&#8217;s ideas and beliefs about children&#8217;s literacy expertise upon entry to school. The study showed how teacher&#8217;s ideas reflected the way that they organised and constructed literacy activities. Teacher&#8217;s ideas also reflected their awareness of the diversity of children&#8217;s literacy expertise. The earlier phase of this study examined the multiple ways and multiple contexts by which children learn and develop literacy expertise. Incorporation of children&#8217;s literacy expertise into classroom activities was determined by the degree to which teachers made connections that resonated children&#8217;s expertise. This was also determined by teacher&#8217;s instructional practices in the context of the classroom environment. The implications of this study make important contributions to pedagogical practices for teachers in classroom environments. The descriptions and explanations reported in this study highlight the complexities of teaching and learning for children of diverse cultural and language communities.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/277</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electroless nickel-phosphorus (EN) coatings on magnesium and magnesium alloys</field><field name="creator">Liu, Zhenmin</field><field name="description">Magnesium (Mg) and its alloys are being used as structural components in industries because of their high strength-to-weight ratio and relatively high stiffness. A shortcoming of Mg alloys is poor corrosion and wear resistance that have hindered its widespread applications. Corrosion can be minimized by using high purity alloys, rapid solidification, and surface treatment or coatings. Of these techniques, electroless nickelphosphorus (EN) coating is one of the most effective methods to combat the problems. The objective of this research is to understand the relationships of processing, microstructure and properties of EN coatings on Mg alloys, and therefore to develop uniform, well-adhered, pore-free EN based coatings. In the first stage of the work, three types of EN coatings, namely, low, medium, and high phosphorus, were deposited on Mg and its alloy substrates. In the second stage of this research, EN coatings containing superfine Al2O3 particles and a novel plasma electrolysis assisted EN plating processing were developed on Mg alloys. XRD, SEM, TEM, EDX, XPS, and some corrosion and mechanical testing methods were implemented to evaluate and characterize the above EN-based coatings. The effects of various alloy substrates and plating bath parameters on coating deposition rate, porosity, phosphorus content, and properties, were studied in detail. Furthermore, the effect of post heat treatment on the properties of EN coatings was also investigated. The results of this study show that the properties of EN coatings are directly related to the phosphorus content and porosity of the coatings, and various Mg alloy substrates. EN coatings with low phosphorus content are nano-crystalline, hard and ductile. As a result, they have superior adhesion strength. EN coatings with medium phosphorus content have an amorphous structure with better corrosion and wear resistance. Especially, the medium phosphorus EN coatings produced by novel plasma electrolysis assisted processes provide superior corrosion resistance and higher adhesion strength. The novel EN technique is also an environmental friendly processing. Direct high phosphorus EN coatings show the least kinetic coefficient of friction and good wear resistance under dry sliding friction because of the self-lubricating nature of phosphorus element. However, the porosity is severe within the direct high phosphorus coatings, which is detrimental to its corrosion property. Adhesion strength and wear resistance of EN alumina composite coating on Mg alloys are improved significantly. It has also been demonstrated that the adhesion strength of EN on Mg alloys is strongly II related to several parameters including coating thickness, hardness, internal stress, nucleation density, and the substrate&#8217;s chemical and physical nature. In conclusion, this research has made good progress on producing a series of uniform, well-adhered, and pore-free EN-based coatings through better understanding of the relationships of processing, microstructure and properties. The EN-based coatings can provide adequate corrosion and/or wear resistance to Mg and Mg alloys.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/278</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spatial variations in the membrane properties of differentiating fibre cells isolated from the rat lens</field><field name="creator">Webb, Kevin F</field><field name="description">The ocular lens is a dense avascular structure composed of a bulk of terminally differentiated elongated fibre cells. During differentiation, lens fibre cells lose their nuclei and organelles and are laid down in successive layers to create a pseudocrystalline cellular architecture, where extracellular space dimensions are kept below the wavelength of visible light. Disruption of this precise structural arrangement leads to the development of cataract and eventual blindness. Differences in membrane transport within different regions of the lens, connected by gap junctions, are thought to generate a unique microcirculatory system which is essential for lens transparency - regulating tissue volume and ionic homeostasis and supplying internalised fibre cells with metabolic and antioxidant support. While the spatial differences in membrane transport thought to drive the lens internal circulation system have been inferred from intact-lens measurements, they have not yet been confirmed at the cellular level. Problems isolating and working with lens fibre cells has lead to a historical lack of information about the role of these cells in lens physiology. This thesis describes the development and characterisation of a viable isolated fibre cell preparation, representing the first investigation of physiological membrane behaviour in single fibre cells isolated from the rat lens. It was found that by blocking non-selective cation channels activated by fibre cell dissociation with ionic gadolinium, isolated fibre cells of a range of lengths could be maintained viable for several hours in the presence of physiological [Ca2+]o. Furthermore, fibre cell length in vitro was similar to that measured in the intact lens, allowing the spatial localisation of measured membrane properties within the outer lens cortex. The measured membrane properties of isolated fibre cells indicate that membrane conductances are altered during fibre cell differentiation, thus creating spatial differences in membrane transport across the lens radius. The measured transition from K+-selectivity towards Na+/Cl- selectivity during fibre cell elongation confirms inferred properties derived from intact-lens studies. These alterations in the membrane properties of differentiating fibre cells are arranged spatially in a manner appropriate for the generation of the circulating ion fluxes thought to form the lens internal circulation system. To investigate the role of fibre cell membrane properties in both physiological and pathological circumstances, modulation of fibre cell membrane properties was demonstrated by osmotic and pharmacological means. Data obtained indicates that fibre cells respond to osmotic or metabolic insult by altering their membrane behaviour. The physiological and pathological alteration in fibre cell membrane properties described directly answers significant outstanding questions in lens physiology, and has the potential to generate new therapeutic interventions in the development of cataract</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/280</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Passive myocardial mechanics : constitutive laws and materials parameter estimation</field><field name="creator">Schmid, Holger</field><field name="description">This study investigated the performance of orthotropic constitutive laws describing the passive mechanical behaviour of the myocardium. The performance was validated against simple shear experiments of pig hearts which were available from earlier studies. First, a homogeneous deformation model was developed which captured the main features of the deformation process. This served as the basis for a comparative study between three phenomenological material laws that had been published in the literature. Two of these laws exhibited certain limitations and two further constitutive laws were therefore developed that removed these limitations. Thus, five material laws were investigated in terms of their performance to fit the given experimental data by reducing a least-square objective function between the experimental and model data. Furthermore the consistency of the material parameters amongst experiments was investigated. As part of this study, a modified least-squares objective function was developed that decreased the computational time involved by about two orders of magnitude with comparable error. Second, the assumption of a homogeneous deformation of simple shear was removed and the parameters were estimated using a finite element environment using an inverse estimation technique and therefore fulfilling the equations of motion that underpin continuum mechanics. It was found that the material parameters of all laws were in the same range compared to those obtained from the homogeneous study. Relaxing the homogeneous assumptions slightly reduced the objective function error although the computational time increased by three orders of magnitude. Third, the experimental protocol of six simple shear modes was supplemented with three uniaxial deformations modes. The material parameters for the same constitutive relations were estimated. It was possible to show that the material parameters that were associated with shear strain were very similar to those obtained from the simple shear study. The axial material parameters, however, were considerably different. Finally, since it is recognised that phenomenological material laws do not provide insight into the underlying micro-structural mechanisms, the framework for a multi-scale constitutive relation was developed. This is based on multi-scale images of rat myocardium.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/279</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanical properties of passive rat cardiac trabeculae</field><field name="creator">Kirton, Robert S.</field><field name="description">In this thesis, the mechanical properties of quiescent, intact, viable, rat right-ventricular (RV) trabeculae were investigated. The main objective was to determine if strainsoftening, which is commonly reported during the deformation of passive cardiac tissue, is present in viable trabeculae. Strain-softening is typically manifested by a stiffer force-extension relation in the first deformation cycle relative to subsequent cycles, and is distinguished from viscoelasticity by a lack of recovery of stiffness, even after several hours of rest. The causes of this behaviour are unknown. To investigate whether strain-softening is observed during uniaxial extensions of viable cardiac tissue, stretch and release cycles of 5%, 10% and 15% muscle length were applied at a constant velocity to trabeculae mounted in a mechanical rig. The rig was custom-built for the purpose. Muscles at 26&#176;C and 0.5 mM Ca2+ were tested in random order in the presence and absence of 50 mM 2,3-butanedione monoxime (BDM). Strain-softening was not observed in viable trabeculae undergoing physiologically relevant extensions, either in the presence or absence of BDM. However, strainsoftening was readily apparent in non-viable trabeculae undergoing the same levels of extension, whether in the presence or absence of BDM. BDM had no effect on passive compliance of viable specimens, while its presence partially inhibited, but could not prevent, stiffening of the non-viable specimens. Loss of viability was accompanied by a uniform increase of dynamic stiffness. The presence of strain-softening during length extensions of non-viable tissue, resulted in a uniform decrease of dynamic stiffness. It is therefore concluded that strain-softening is neither intrinsic to viable rat RV trabeculae nor influenced by BDM but, rather, reflects irreversible damage of tissue in partial, or full, rigor. The addition of BDM was found to alter the dynamic stiffness and phase measured in intact viable quiescent trabeculae. In the absence of BDM, these alterations were calcium- and temperature-sensitive, whereas in the presence of BDM they were not. Therefore, the BDM-induced alteration of the dynamic stiffness and phase is attributed to the inhibition of spontaneous sarcomere activity.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/282</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Children in the moral community : predictive genetic testing of children for adult onset diseases : some ethical implications</field><field name="creator">Malpas, Phillipa Jean</field><field name="description">Where are children situated in the moral community? Are children special from a moral point of view? Does children&#8217;s youth and vulnerability say anything significant about how we ought to treat them? These questions seek to articulate and clarify the moral status of children by considering what is required to be the beneficiary of moral standing, and furthermore, the ways in which we, as moral agents, are obliged to treat them. The ways in which we answer these questions has significant implications for children, particularly in the area of predictive genetic testing. My thesis is divided into two sections. In the first section I examine the moral status of children within the moral community and the obligations owed to them from parents and society. This is important for a number of significant reasons: Firstly, within the literature children are often portrayed as smaller, less competent versions of adults, yet they are clearly different to adults in many significant ways. Secondly, whilst we claim that children are precious and deserve to be protected from harm, we continue to abuse, neglect, and treat them with indifference in our families and communities. Finally, children grow up and assume their place in the world. This suggests that their moral status changes over time. If children are important members of the moral community as I suggest they are, then we ought to be clear about what their moral status obliges of us as adults. This has crucial implications for children in the area of predictive genetic testing for adult onset diseases. In section two I build on the ethical framework and conclusions reached in the first section and examine the specific question of whether we ought to genetically test children for adult onset diseases. All international genetic service provider guidelines and professional genetic societies do not recommend testing currently healthy, asymptomatic children for such diseases. I examine their positions and consider the arguments not to test children for adult onset diseases.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/283</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification and Interpretation of Characteristic Periodic Variations of Near Surface Fluids in the Te Aroha, Rotorua, and Orakeikorako Geothermal Fields of New Zealand using Wavelet and Fourier Analysis</field><field name="creator">Leaver, Jonathan David</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the analysis of a series of experimental measurements from a selection of springs, geysers and wells at Te Aroha, Rotorua and Orakeikorako in New Zealand aimed at the identification of the frequencies of any characteristic variations with a period of 25 hours or less. The measurements taken from these sources collectively recorded water level, conductivity, temperature, rainfall and barometric pressure. The measurements involve the collection of data with high accuracy instrumentation and high sampling rates of 5 minutes to 1 hour over periods exceeding 1400 hours in both exploited and unexploited hydrothermal systems. The measurements are filtered using both an adaptive wavelet based filter and Fourier analysis to extract the influence of gravity tides, rainfall, and barometric pressure with the residual dominant frequencies being attributed to sub-surface thermodynamic processes. A review of the development of techniques for the determination of the pressure response of geothermal reservoirs to barometric pressure, gravity tides, and rainfall is presented. The fundamentals for the mathematical development of Fourier and wavelet analysis are discussed along with sources of error for both Fourier and wavelet analysis. A sensitivity study of wavelet and Fourier analysis is presented based on the analysis of a series of artificial signals. A system dynamics model of a spring at Orakeikorako is formulated to demonstrate fundamental heat and mass transfer processes and the effect of periodic forcing functions on spring response. This study is of importance in that it provides an understanding of periodic forcing functions derived from high accuracy measurements on geothermal features at high sampling rates over periods exceeding 1400 hours. Once identified, the amplitude and frequency of the forcing functions can be monitored to assist in identifying and quantifying any changes in reservoir characteristics.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/346</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Marriage, Inheritance, and the Balance of Power in Twelfth-Century England and France</field><field name="creator">Diggelmann, Lindsay</field><field name="description">This project attempts to chart the importance of the social institutions of marriage and inheritance in giving rise to political change in England and France during the period 1100-1215. It benefits from the study of diverse primary sources that include chronicle histories, legal and financial documents, charters, diplomatic treaties, letters, and contemporary works of imaginative literature. It also takes into account the extensive secondary literature dealing with the period both in the area of historical research and in related fields such as anthropology, political science, and literary criticism. The thesis is broadly divided into two parts, with four chapters devoted to an extended analysis of major themes and a further four providing a narrative reading of the period to illustrate the ideas put forward. The central argument contends that a &#8216;multipolar&#8217; balance of power existed among the quasi-independent states under the nominal lordship of the kingdom of France (and also involving England) around 1100; that this arrangement was disrupted frequently in the following years so that by around 1200 any remaining balance was more &#8216;bipolar&#8217; in nature with the Plantagenet and Capetian kingdoms now dominating the smaller territorial units; and that the most important factors in creating this change were the political ramifications of marriage and inheritance episodes. The idea of a balance of power is developed and discussed by reference to similar ideas prevalent in the study of international relations among European states during the eighteenth century. To support the argument several chapters are devoted to a close examination of the social practices and restrictions surrounding marriage and inheritance during the twelfth century. Issues such as the need for consent between marriage partners, marital restrictions on the basis of consanguinity, and the prevalence of primogeniture in the handing down of estates are all discussed at length. A central theme is the contested and provisional nature of all these issues during the period, with rules that were either unclear or not universally accepted creating opportunities for political advancement by members of the social elite. Further, this thesis contends that earlier historiographical models describing a simple and consistent opposition between ecclesiastical leaders and lay magnates on questions of marriage are unrealistic. It looks to identify points of overlap and temporary alliance in secular and ecclesiastical policies, as well as noting the conflicts that occurred between them on other occasions. The project also aims to use the techniques and advantages of cultural history to add a significant extra dimension to the central political argument, by examining prevailing beliefs and value systems surrounding the institutions of marriage and inheritance.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/289</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Choosing your future : the role of ideas in managing trade-offs between economic and environmental objectives</field><field name="creator">Boven, Rick</field><field name="description">Environmental deterioration continues despite availability of policies and technologies that could reduce damage. Given the scale of human activity this creates a risk of environmental crisis. This thesis argues for revision of the dominant paradigm that provides the default assumptions used for theoretical and policy analysis that affects longterm economic and environmental outcomes. The paradigm extensions proposed include an environment that can be damaged by human activity, individuals with diverse beliefs and values, and an argument that the Earth is not yet in the industrial era but rather nearing the end of the transition to the industrial era. The proposed revised paradigm can be used to develop a theoretically sound strategy to reduce the risk of environmental crisis. The ideas-based strategy requires individuals to influence the beliefs and values of others to build support for government regulation and to establish norms to constrain damaging activity. The thesis argues that the paradigms and theories chosen by economists and other theorists are important influencers of economic and environmental outcomes.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/291</field></doc><doc><field name="title">SIMULATION OF COMPLEX MULTIPHASE, MULTI-COMPONENT, REACTING FLOWS IN POROUS MEDIA</field><field name="creator">Zarrouk, Sadiq J.</field><field name="description">In this study we are concerned with the modelling of multi-component, multiphase chemically reacting flows in porous media, with particular application to the spontaneous combustion of coal and the extraction of coalbed methane. These two related problems involve complex multiphase, multi-component flow in a porous medium. Chemical reactions, adsorption, gaseous diffusion and changes in porosity and permeability are important in one or both of these problems. These matters are discussed in general in the first few chapters of the thesis. Several models for the spontaneous combustion of coal that include the effect of a diminishing reaction rate are investigated and a new formulation in the form of a generic power law model is introduced. A numerical module for modelling the spontaneous combustion of coal is described, based on the TOUGH2 code. A new equation of state (EOS) module is developed including realistic physical properties for all gases involved. The modified version of TOUGH2 is used for modelling the adiabatic method for testing the reactivity of coal samples. The results agree very well with experimental measurements for coal samples from different mines in New Zealand and Australia. Moisture effect on the reaction rate was then introduced to TOUGH2 using a new twophase EOS module with water and air broken into its main components (Nitrogen, Oxygen, Carbon dioxide and Argon). Finally the production of methane from low rank coalbeds is investigated. A new EOS for mixture of water and methane is developed and incorporated into the TOUGH2 code to produce a new and versatile coalbed methane simulator. It is validated by running some simple test problems and comparing results with those obtained with the commercial COMET simulator.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/293</field></doc><doc><field name="title">When harey met Shakespeare : the genesis of the first part of Henry the Sixth</field><field name="creator">Vincent, Paul J.</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the complex genesis of the play printed in the Shakespeare First Folio of 1623 as The first Part of Henry the Sixt. The Introduction identifies the tendency of previous scholars to minimise uncertainty in their chronological and authorship hypotheses for the play, and anchors the present study in the wider context of authorship theory and attribution studies. Chapters 1 and 2 examine the external and internal evidence for the play&#8217;s date, and deliberately avoid any speculation on its authorship in order to present the chronological evidence as objectively as possible. I demonstrate in Chapter 2 that it is only by carrying out a full structural analysis of the play that we can hope to disentangle and accurately appraise the various revision theories put forward by scholars over the centuries. Chapter 3 attempts, by means of a preliminary bibliographical analysis of the Folio text, to reconstruct the nature of the manuscript copy set into type by the Folio compositors. In Chapter 4 I conduct the first comprehensive assessment of Gary Taylor&#8217;s groundbreaking 1995 authorship hypothesis for the play and modify it significantly. The degree to which we are able to identify &#8216;who wrote what&#8217; in the play is the concern of Chapter 5, where I conclude that The first Part of Henry the Sixt is Shakespeare&#8217;s revision of the play that appears in Philip Henslowe&#8217;s Diary as &#8216;harey the vj&#8217;; a play written by Thomas Nashe (Act 1) and an anonymous playwright (Acts 2&#8211;5) for Lord Strange&#8217;s company and first performed at the Rose theatre on 3 March 1592.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/294</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Pedagogy of Graduate Supervision : Figuring the Relations between Supervisor and Student</field><field name="creator">Grant, Barbara M.</field><field name="description">The supervision of graduate research students is a pedagogy under pressure. Increasingly, in neo-liberal universities, it is subject to regulation and surveillance as well as stringencies of time and intensified expectations. Yet it is an elusive pedagogy, one that has not been much theorised. This is the field that my thesis is situated within. Through a series of small studies, I explore the &#8216;and&#8217; that relates &#8216;supervisor and student&#8217; in order to shed some light on the &#8220;unstated ethics&#8221; (jagodzinski, 2002, p.81) that shape how they act towards each other in supervision&#8217;s enclosed space. In the course of my enquiry, I critically engage with several dimensions of supervision: the public discourses that give it intelligibility, the layers of social relations that come into play, the meanings offered by a university&#8217;s code of practice, and those made by supervisors and students in an empirical study of several masters-level supervision pairs in the Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences. The main methodology used is a form of textual analysis that rests on an understanding of the slipperiness and ambiguity of texts and the inevitable partiality of interpretation. The mode of &#8216;knowing&#8217; offered here is one of reading and re-reading supervision through a series of figurative rather than literal accounts, none of which is intended to offer the last word on this complex pedagogy. Reckoned together, the interpretations offered here &#8211; supervision as a discursive object, as a palimpsest-like field of triangular relations, as a project of governmentality, as a fantasy, as the relation of Master-Slave, and as improvisation &#8211; give an overarching sense of supervision as a messy and unpredictable pedagogy in which the academic and the personal come together in an unusual way. The significance of this understanding is that we cannot easily or meaningfully regulate or &#8216;train&#8217; for supervision. Because of its implication in the production of original, independent academic work and the authorised academic subject, it must be as much a practice of improvisation as it is of regularity.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/295</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sport-related injury: prediction, prevention, and rehabilitation - a psychological approach</field><field name="creator">Maddison, Ralph</field><field name="description">Two interrelated studies were performed to examine the role of psychological factors in the prediction and prevention of sport-related injury. As far as injury prediction is concerned, Study 1 tested the Williams and Andersen (1998) revised stress-injury model. It was hypothesised through the model that athletes with a history of stressors, a shortage of coping resources, and personality dispositions that augment the stress response, would be the most vulnerable to injury. Four-hundred and seventy-rugby players from 37-teams participated in the study and completed measures corresponding to variables in the Williams and Andersen stress-injury model at the beginning of the playing season. The number of injuries sustained and the amount of time loss due to injury were recorded throughout the season. Data were analysed using product moment correlations between life-stress and injury for groups of participants who fell in the upper and lower third of the moderator variables (i.e., coping resources&#8212;type of coping and social support, history of stressor&#8212;previous injury, and personality&#8212;competitive anxiety) distributions. As expected, a mild positive relationship was found between life-stress and injury time loss (r = .09, p &lt; .05) and number of injuries sustained (r = .11, p &lt; .05). Results also showed that previous injury, the type of coping, social support, and competitive anxiety interacted in a conjunctive fashion to produce a maximum moderator effect (explaining up to 29% of the injury variance). A second study (Study 2) was performed to determine whether a stress management intervention programme could effectively reduce injury among athletes identified from Study 1 to be most vulnerable to injury. A second purpose was to examine what might explain a positive result by exploring psychological (i.e., coping and anxiety) and stress response (i.e., reaction time and perceptual sensitivity) variables. Fifty-one rugby players from Study 1 who were found to be most vulnerable to injury (i.e., a rugby player with many recent life-stresses, high competition anxiety, inappropriate coping skills, and a history of previous injury) were recruited and randomly assigned to either an intervention (stress management programme) or a control condition. Participants completed psychological inventories at the beginning (Time 1) and end (Time 2) of the 2002 rugby season. Prospective and objective injury data were obtained for both number of injuries and time loss. In addition, a purpose built apparatus was used to assess stress response variables at the beginning (Time 1) and end (Time 2) of the 2002 rugby season. Prior to the start of the 2002 rugby season participants in the intervention group started a 6-session stress management programme that lasted 4-consecutive weeks. Emphasis was placed on how athletes could modify their reaction to stress. Participants were contacted monthly to reinforce the intervention, discuss implementation of the skills, and any relevant issues. ANCOVA results showed a significant condition (control versus intervention) effect for total time missed, but not for number of injuries sustained. Participants in the stress management intervention reported missing less time due to injury at the end of the 2002 season compared to their non-intervention counterparts. Furthermore, the intervention group appeared to only marginally increase the amount of time missed in 2002 compared to 2001, whereas the control group missed significantly more time due to injury. ANCOVA results provided some insight into the potential reasons for injury reduction. For the psychological variables, a significant condition effect was found for total coping resources. The intervention group showed an increase in the amount of coping resources at Time 2 compared to Time 1, and showed greater coping resources than did the control group at Time 2. The intervention group also showed a decrease in worry at Time 2 compared to Time 1 and less worry than the control group at Time 2. The condition effect for concentration disruption (CD) approached statistical significance, with the intervention group showing less CD at Time 2 compared to the control group at Time 2. For the stress response variables no significant condition effects were found for reaction times or perceptual sensitivity (d&#8217;). Overall, results support the recommendation that a stress management programme is effective in preventing further time loss due to injury for athletes with an &#8220;at-risk&#8221; injury profile. This result in part, is due to these athletes increasing their coping skills, and decreasing their worry and concentration disruption cognitions. In an extension of the prediction and prevention studies, a third study was conducted to examine the effectiveness of a psychological intervention (modelling) in affecting rehabilitation outcomes. Specifically the purpose of Study 3 was to investigate whether a coping modelling intervention could decrease pre-operative anxiety and perceptions of expected pain, as well as increasing rehabilitation self-efficacy and motivation associated with surgical reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACLR). A second purpose was to determine whether the modelling intervention would be associated with improved functional outcomes in the early post-operative period (6-weeks) following ACLR. Sixty-four patients undergoing arthroscopic ACLR were randomised to receive a coping modelling intervention or to act as a control. Participants completed psychological inventories at different time periods during a 6-week period. In addition, the following functional outcomes were assessed, days walking with crutches, range of motion (ROM), and International Knee Documentation Committee assessment (IKDC). ANCOVA results revealed a significant condition effect for perceptions of expected pain, but not for state anxiety. Significant group differences were found for crutch self-efficacy, with the intervention group reporting greater self-efficacy than the control group. Repeated measure ANOVA results revealed significant time x condition effects for walking self-efficacy and exercise self-efficacy. No condition effect was found for jogging self-efficacy, nor were there any condition effects found for the motivation variables. ANCOVA results showed a significant condition effect (modelling) for functional outcome improvements (IKDC scores and crutch use) with the intervention group reporting superior IKDC scores and fewer days walking with crutches. No effects were found for ROM. Collective findings from the three studies highlight the importance of psychological factors in the prediction, prevention, and rehabilitation of athletic-related injury. Moreover, studies 2 &amp; 3 support the use of psychological based interventions for reducing injury and augmenting traditional rehabilitation outcomes. Opportunities for future research are discussed.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/296</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Personal practical theories : exploring the role of language teacher experiences and beliefs in the integration of theory and practice</field><field name="creator">Feryok, Anne</field><field name="description">The dominant model of teaching has shifted from a transmission model to an interpretive model with a concomitant focus on the role of teacher experiences and beliefs. This topic is explored from the perspective of six English as a Foreign Language teachers in Armenia. These teachers originally trained in Soviet and post-Soviet Armenia with a transmission model of teaching with a strong emphasis on grammar and translation. They later completed a threeterm Teaching English as a Foreign Language Certificate programme at a Western-sponsored graduate university in Armenia with a more interpretive model of teaching with a strong communicative language teaching orientation. The main research questions are: (1) How do EFL teachers develop personal practical theories? (2) What are the influences that shape personal practical theories? (3) To what extent are personal practical theories reflected in classroom practices? Interpretive analysis of e-mail interviews, classroom observations, and in-person interviews reveals that a variety of experiences and beliefs inform personal practical theories, including formal pedagogical education, personal experiences of language learning and teaching, personal beliefs and values, and the sociocultural context. Theory has several important roles to play in personal practical theories: it can offer explanations of experiences and practices as well as articulations of them, and it can offer directions for practices as well as hypotheses to test. Uptake of theory occurs through transmission, application, and critical reflection, all requiring interpretation. Classroom practices often, but not always, reflect personal practical theories. More experienced and more articulate teachers appear to have more coherent personal practical theories that are more consistently reflected in classroom practices. There are several implications for language teacher education programmes. Theory has a role to play in language teacher development. Teachers who voluntarily choose to engage in development are more likely to profit from it. Teachers need to become aware of what they do and don&#8217;t know. Teachers need to be autonomous in order to successfully adopt new practices. A professional community offers support to teachers. These implications are linked through a view of the teacher as an autonomous individual able to understand theory and practice as evidenced by the ability to articulate and integrate them in a personal practical theory reflected in effective classroom practices.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/298</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Globalisation and Pluri-scalar Orchestrations in Higher Education: Locating The University of Auckland's  Student Learning Centre Historically and Globally</field><field name="creator">van Rij-Heyligers, Josta Arlene</field><field name="description">Globalisation is a dominant theme in today&#8217;s discourse of educational and social politics, but its dimensions and forces are not well understood. Generally, Globalisation suggests that in meeting international pressures a nation state is less able to act. With diminished state control, the devolution and privatisation of the public sector are seen as solutions for states to operate in a global market. This thesis suggests that changes in New Zealand educational policy since 1984 show that far from weakening the authority of the state, its position has been strengthened through neoliberal policies creating quasimarkets and new forms of public management in the state sector. This thesis takes neoliberalism as the current manifestation of a world-system of capitalism in crisis, and synthesises historical socio-political approaches to globalisation and economic wave theory into a theoretical framework from which educational policies at the multiple levels of authority (transnational, national and institutional) are examined. Apart from a focus on the structural attributes impinging on reform, the thesis also argues that the global discourses of the knowledge economy and of building a nation&#8217;s human capital through increased private investment, as well as the state&#8217;s continued capacity to &#8216;mediate&#8217; the expansion of capitalism constitute the driving forces for the reshaping of the tertiary educational system in New Zealand under the fourth Labour Government and the National-led governments that followed. The impact of global dictates and the tertiary education reforms (1984-2000) in New Zealand on the mandate, delivery, and form of governance of university education is illustrated through the transformations the University of Auckland and its Student Learning Centre have experienced. However, this thesis contends that path-dependency, such as university traditions and culture, affects the way global dictates and state policies are accepted, contested, or translated in a manner consonant with institutional objectives. Yet, it is also suggested that the external pressure of reduced public funding and state regulations promoting a quasi-market environment in higher education pose perhaps the greatest threat to traditional notions of academic autonomy and collegiality built on cooperation and sharing of ideas. It is further shown that the climate of efficiency and rationality advanced during the period 1984-2000 has limited the scope of what is taught, how it is taught and why it is taught. Even though the thesis indicates that the number of programmes and subjects have increased as more students continue their education, the function of universities has narrowed: providing consumer choice and instrumental value for building the &#8216;elusive&#8217; knowledge economy. The thesis expresses concern that if this trend continues the community role of universities will be impeded and teaching will become more pragmatic and technocratic.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/299</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity and fitness measures in New Zealand : a study of validation and correlation with cardiovascular risk factors</field><field name="creator">Moy, Karen</field><field name="description">The primary aim of the study was to validate the short and long form of the recently-created NZ physical activity questionnaires (NZPAQ-SF and NZPAQ-LF, respectively) in a multi-ethnic sample in Auckland. An international physical activity questionnaire (IPAQ-long) was also validated and compared to the NZ instruments. Objective PA measures were used to create a NZ compendium of PA intensities, providing baseline data for culturally-specific PAs. Secondary aims included an examination of the relationship between PA and CRF, and their associations with cross-sectional measures of cardiovascular (CV) risk factors. The study sample consisted of 186 apparently healthy males (n=90) and females (n=96) aged 19-86 yrs, classified as European/Other (n=60), M&#257;ori (n=61), and Pacific (n=65). Heart rate monitoring (HRM) with individual calibration was used to objectively measure the duration, frequency, and intensity of at least moderate-intensity PAs performed over 3 consecutive days. Type of PA and the context in which it was performed was simultaneously recorded by participants on daily PA logs. Correlations between HRM and self-reported levels of brisk walking, moderate-intensity, vigorousintensity, were poor for each questionnaire, and correlations were lower for M&#257;ori and Pacific ethnic groups than for European/Other. The NZPAQ-SF (r=0.3, p&lt;0.001) and NZPAQ-LF (r=0.3, p&lt;0.001) performed better than the IPAQ-long (r=0.1, p=0.37). The culturally-specific list of PA intensities showed strong correlation (R2=0.68) to an internationally-accepted compendium of PA intensities, and provided baseline energy cost data for 13 PAs performed by M&#257;ori and Pacific people in NZ. CRF levels were primarily influenced by gender, ethnicity, obesity, and performing at least 15 min/day of vigorous-intensity PA, and showed stronger associations with fasting blood lipids and glucose, while PA was more strongly related to SBP and DBP. The validated NZPAQs are acceptable for measuring population level PA prevalence in NZ adults, although accuracy is lower for M&#257;ori and Pacific people. However, the availability of a culturallyspecific list of PA intensities could potentially increase the accuracy of self-reported PA by M&#257;ori and Pacific people. Results from this study highlight the importance of vigorous-intensity PA for CV health, and identifies NZ Pacific people as high risk in terms of PA, obesity, and CRF.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321207 Indigenous health</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/305</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Writing on the margins : the experimental poetry of Lyn Hejinian, Yang Lian and Arkadii Dragomoshchenko</field><field name="creator">Edmond, Jacob</field><field name="description">This study assesses macroanalytic theories of global aesthetics that propose a strong correlation between artistic innovation and social, political, economic and technological conditions. The assessment is carried out through substantial new microanalytic research on the social situation, poetry and artistic intentions of Lyn Hejinian, Yang Lian &#26954;&#29001; and Arkadii Dragomoshchenko, three experimental poets whose work pushed the boundaries of poetry within their respective countries, the United States, China and the Soviet Union, from the late 1970s to the early 1990s. Existing macroanalytic theories predict that these poets should be very different because they worked in contrasting conditions, but the microanalysis shows that there are remarkable points of correlation. The three major characteristics that the poets share are: an interest in lyric poetry as an exploration of consciousness and a closely connected though contradictory interest in language as a self-sufficient medium; the use of difficulty in poetry with an intent that is both utopian and anti-utopian; the production of poetry that was intended to provide an alternative to mainstream poetic discourse, and the association of this poetic experimentation with a way of life that was intended to provide an alternative to mainstream society. These findings undermine prevailing theorizations of the globalization of poetry and thus point to the need for a reconfiguration of theories of global aesthetics. This study employs an innovative approach that makes significant contributions to research at three levels of analysis. Firstly, it provides in-depth single-author studies of three difficult poets, based on substantial new close readings and statements of poetics in the original languages, and including valuable bibliographical material. Secondly, it presents social-context analysis of the place of experimental poetry in the United States, China and the Soviet Union, based on sociological and historical research. Thirdly, it offers a comparative, contrastive analysis, which calls into question prevailing theorizations of the way experimental poetry is developing in the context of globalization. This inquiry is built around new close readings of two works that are centrally important to the oeuvre of each writer over the period examined: The Guard (1984) and Oxota (1991) by Hejinian; &#8220;Nuorilang&#8221; &#35582;&#26085;&#26391; (Norlang) (1983) and &#8220;Banpo&#8221; &#21322;&#22369; (1984) by Yang; and &#8220;Summa Elegii&#8221; (Sum of Elegies) (1986) and &#8220;Nasturtsiia kak real'nost'&#8221; (Nasturtium as Reality) (1986) by Dragomoshchenko.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/308</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Corporate governance in China</field><field name="creator">Fu, Jiang</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses some important issues in corporate governance using data from Chinese stock markets. The thesis starts with a summary of relevant research in the area of corporate governance. Next, I describe the historic development of corporate governance in China and the corporate governance framework that is currently in place. These two introductory chapters are followed by my empirical research, which comprises three chapters. First, I analyse share price reactions and top-management turnover around announcements of negotiated block transfers between different State-ownership structures for a sample of State-controlled firms that are publicly traded on Chinese stock exchanges. I find that changes in firm value and CEO turnover are much greater when a government agency (GA) transfers a block of shares of a listed firm to a statecontrolled enterprise with a private joint venture partner (LPSOE) rather than to a solely state owned enterprise (SSOE). Second, using a sample of listed firms that issued debt guarantees to their large shareholders, I analyse the relation between firm- and ownership characteristics and the probability of expropriation of minority shareholders by controlling shareholders. I also analyse and validate the assumed relationship between &#8216;tunnelling&#8217; and several financial measures of expropriation suggested in the literature. I find that, in a weak legal environment such as China, the issuance of related guarantees is more likely at firms with large private blockholders than at firms with the State as the largest blockholder, and that related guarantees are more likely at larger firms and firms with a single controlling blockholder. I also find that firms that issued related loan guarantees have significantly lower industry-adjusted measures of Tobin&#8217;s Q, profitability, and dividend yields and have significantly higher leverage. This evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that tunnelling by controlling shareholders can be very costly to minority shareholders. I find no evidence of higher bid ask spreads for firms that issued related guarantees. Finally, I study the monitoring role of blockholders in China as an alternative mechanism of corporate governance that might result in reduced expropriation of firm assets by the controlling blockholder. I find that non-controlling block holders contribute to firm value only when their ultimate owners are different from the controlling blockholder in terms of the public/private distinction. I attribute this result to the potential conflict of interests between controlling and non-controlling block holders in this case, reducing the opportunities to tunnel and improving monitoring of management. I also provide evidence of a substantial valuation discount if there are clear signals that suggest collusion between blockholders.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/309</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The formation and fate of carbonyl sulfide (COS) gas in aluminium smelting</field><field name="creator">Hay, Suzanne Jill</field><field name="description">Carbonyl sulfide (COS) gas is emitted from aluminium smelters at concentrations of 1 &#8211; 8 ppmv or 0.2 &#8211; 1.6 kgt-1 Al produced. While COS emissions are relatively small compared to emissions of HF or SO2, previous measurements suggest that COS is not efficiently captured in the scrubbing systems used by aluminium smelters and it has been suggested that the industry is a significant anthropogenic emitter of COS. COS is a unique sulfur gas in the atmosphere, due to its stability, lifetime of several years and implication in ozone depletion. The source of COS and other sulfur gases from aluminium smelters, is the 1 &#8211; 4 mass% S content of anodes, consumed during aluminium electrolysis. These anodes are primarily made from petroleum coke, a low value and therefore high sulfur product, of crude oil refining. This thesis examines aspects of the formation and fate of COS in aluminium reduction cells. One thesis objective was to confirm the nature of sulfur species present in petroleum cokes and anodes. A XANES (X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure) spectroscopy study of cokes from the major suppliers and anode core samples showed that organic sulfur containing ring structures were the dominant sulfur species, before and after anode baking and even after significant desulfurisation at 1500&#186;C. Thermodynamic calculations performed using the HSC Chemistry&#169; computer package agreed with previous smelter measurements that COS gas was the dominant sulfur gas to form at the anode face and SO2 became the dominant sulfur gas after the anode gases left the cell and mixed with an induced air draft in the cell hooding. Previous smelter measurements showed that some COS (about 5 ppmv) did survive through the cell ducting into the dry scrubber and that there were only negligible reductions in COS concentration after dry scrubbing. The dry scrubber contains smelter-grade alumina, which adsorbs HF and other smelter gases, before the alumina is recycled to the cells. Another objective of this thesis was to study the effect dry scrubbing had on COS emissions in greater detail in the laboratory to better understand any reactions that may be occurring. A thermodynamic analysis using HSC Chemistry&#169; determined that alumina would reduce the stability of COS at a typical dry scrubbing temperature of 80&#186;C. The dry scrubber was modelled in the laboratory using an alumina containing fluidised bed reactor, with the inlet and outlet gas composition monitored using mass spectrometry. Adsorbed species resulting from COS adsorption on alumina were studied separately using DRIFTS (Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy). Experiments showed that COS was stable in the fluidised bed apparatus in isolation. The presence of smelter-grade alumina led to the adsorption of COS in its molecular form and as adsorbed hydrogen thiocarbonate. The latter species is believed to be an intermediate in the hydrolysis of COS into H2S on alumina. The effect of conditions which may vary in the dry scrubbing system, such as humidity, SO2 and HF concentrations, were studied. The presence of optimum humidity levels ensured sustained hydrolysis of COS over several hours, but adsorbed SO2 and HF interfered with COS conversion. This suggests that COS hydrolysis would be unlikely to occur to a great extent in commercial dry scrubbers used in the aluminium smelter industry.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/310</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An exploratory study of the interplay between teachers&#8217; beliefs, instructional practices &amp; professional development</field><field name="creator">Mohamed, Naashia</field><field name="description">Previous research has revealed the influential role of teachers&#8217; beliefs in determining their professional behaviour. Teachers&#8217; beliefs affect not only their teaching, but also filter new input, suggesting significant implications for the implementation of educational innovations and teacher development. This study explores the interconnections between teachers&#8217; beliefs, their instructional practices and professional development, examining the extent to which the introduction of an innovative teaching approach impacts teachers&#8217; beliefs and behaviour. It focuses particularly on grammar instruction in the context of English teaching in secondary schools of the Maldives. Combining descriptive ethnography with a quasi-experimental design, the study was implemented in two phases. Phase One, based on questionnaire data from 197 teachers from 51 schools, explored teachers&#8217; beliefs and their self reported practices. Findings indicated that teachers placed great emphasis on grammar and that they were unfamiliar with inductive approaches to grammar instruction. In Phase Two, inductive grammar teaching methods were introduced to 14 teachers from two schools, in a 12 week professional development programme. Drawing largely on data from observations and interviews, the results from this phase showed that although teachers were observed to generally follow their pedagogic beliefs, several points of difference between their beliefs and practices existed. While the professional development may have increased their understanding of inductive approaches to grammar instruction at the level of awareness, only limited changes to beliefs and practices were observed. Changing instructional practice appeared to be a difficult task with only two teachers uptaking the innovation. Some subsidiary changes were however observed in the practices of several other teachers. Various impediments constrained change efforts, including teachers&#8217; lack of openness to change, their low professional motivation and the lack of a supportive school culture. Contextual factors such as large classes and difficult working conditions also negatively affected the change process. Findings indicate that development activities which provided regular one-on-one support for the teachers were more likely to lead to uptake than those involving mainly workshops. The individual nature of the uptake process, its lack of uniformity and the challenges faced by the teachers are discussed, as are the implications for the provision of professional development.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/311</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Buckling and growth of disbonds in honeycomb sandwich structure</field><field name="creator">Southward, Temoana</field><field name="description">The response of honeycomb sandwich structure to disbond damage, in a compressive stress field, has been assessed. Two types of disbond were considered; those extending through the full width of a panel (through-width) and those enclosed within the panel boundaries (embedded). For each type of disbond the failure process was established through four-point bend testing of 56 sandwich specimens. For both types of disbond, failure was found to be governed by buckling-driven disbond growth and, consequently, models of buckling and disbond growth were developed. All of the models decoupled the face-sheets of the sandwich and treated the core as a spring foundation having a stiffness determined from equilibrium of a two-dimensional orthotropic solid. A linear Winkler beam model was used to predict buckling of a through-width disbond. The model buckling loads agreed with specimen test results with an average difference of 1.7%. A non-linear Winkler beam model was then developed to predict post-buckling behaviour and the initiation of disbond growth, through a fracture mechanics analysis. A characteristic growth curve, defining the work input required to initiate disbond growth, was developed and agreed with specimen test results with an average difference of 3.3%. The model also verified that disbond growth occurs in discrete increments approximately equal to the diameter of the honeycomb cells. A linear Winkler plate model was used to predict buckling of an embedded disbond. The model buckling loads agreed with specimen test results with an average difference of 3.7%. A non-linear Winkler plate model was then developed to predict post-buckling behaviour of a sandwich panel containing an embedded disbond. The model considered contact conditions and modelled disbond growth by releasing fractured nodes during load incrementation. Disbond growth initiation loads agreed with specimen test results with an average difference of 15.8%. Failure loads consistently over-predicted specimen test results by an average of 13.9%. It was concluded that the growth initiation loads should be used as a conservative estimate of failure. The models developed may be used to assess the criticality of disbond damage in sandwich structure having thin-gauge, composite face-sheets.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/313</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of Poly (ethylene naphthalate)-based polymer blends</field><field name="creator">Jung, Dylan D.

Ny66/PEN blends including several additives do not improve the miscibility of the constituent polymers and show lower tensile strength than those of homopolymers.  However, PBT/PEN blends reveal improved tensile strengths of the blends between the ROM and MROM predictions lines with more than 50 % volume fraction of PEN. On the other hand, NMR spectra show no evidence of interchange reaction in both Ny66/PEN and PBT/PEN blends.  SEM micrographs of fracture surfaces in PBT/PEN blends reveal a very small (sub-micron) domain size in contrast to large domains in Ny66/PEN blends, which indicates partial miscibility of PBT and PEN.  DSC and DMTA demonstrate partial miscibility of PBT/PEN blends by the change of Tgs of each component according to the weight proportions of the constituent polymers. Stress relaxation tests for the specimens of PBT/PEN blends and the homopolymers, using the Taguchi method of experimental design, determine that the most significant factor is the temperature, followed by PEN content and then the initial stress, and interaction effects between factors are insignificant.  To fit the relaxation curves of the PBT/PEN blends and the homopolymers at different temperatures, PEN contents and initial stresses, four different equations have been used.  The coefficients of the equation that fit best are used to predict the relaxation behaviour of PBT/PEN blends at a temperature between 30&#61616;C and 60&#61616;C, and at the initial stresses of 7 MPa.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Polymer blends</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290600 Chemical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/317</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of the ecology of forest invertebrates and the use of Brodifacoum</field><field name="creator">Craddock, Paul</field><field name="description">Brodifacoum is a potent second-generation anti-coagulant toxin routinely used to control problem populations of introduced mammalian pests (such as possums (Trichosurus vulpecula), rats (Rattus rattus) and mice (Mus musculus) in New Zealand forests. The toxin is packaged in the form of cereal bait pellets, which are distributed into managed forest locations in bait stations or by aerial drops. The toxin is persistent in vertebrate tissues, and there has been increasing concern recently about the potential for secondary poisoning of threatened insectivorous bird species via invertebrates that have fed on bait containing brodifacoum. This thesis studied relevant aspects of the ecology of forest invertebrates and the use of brodifacoum bait at Trounson Kauri Park, Katui Scenic Reserve and Wenderholm Regional Park, North Island, New Zealand. Video recording equipment was used to monitor invertebrate activity at bait stations, revealing that weta (Orthoptera) and cockroaches (Blattodea) were significant users of bait stations loaded with brodifacoum bait. These animals were attracted to full bait stations, and could spend considerable time in contact with toxic bait. Weta were even observed grazing poison baits. Pitfall traps, &#8216;weta boxes&#8217; and rodent tracking tunnels were used to sample the invertebrate populations in the three study areas. Wetas and beetles were present in significantly greater numbers at Trounson and Wenderholm compared to Katui. It was concluded that this difference was due to the reduction in pest mammal populations, resulting from the intensive pest control at the two former sites. Invertebrates captured in pitfall traps were sent for brodifacoum residue analysis to determine if brodifacoum was present in their tissues. Weta, cockroaches, beetles and other miscellaneous invertebrate species recorded significant residues of brodifacoum (up to 7.47 &#181;g/g). Residues were found to be dependent on the loading of toxic bait into stations. Levels recorded after bait was loaded were significantly higher than levels recorded before bait was loaded in bait stations. Invertebrates carrying brodifacoum were found to disperse up to 10 metres from the source of the toxin (loaded bait stations). Residue levels recorded decreased significantly the further away from the full bait stations that samples were taken. After toxic bait had been removed from bait stations, residue levels in invertebrates took in excess of 4 weeks to return to background levels. Trace levels of brodifacoum were still detectable up to 10 weeks after bait had been removed. Physiological experiments on the effect of brodifacoum consumption on captive locusts found no evident harmful effects. Locusts fed readily on toxic bait with no significant increase in mortality. They excreted brodifacoum rapidly, and there was no evidence of long-term bio-accumulation of the toxin. A risk assessment was made exploring the potential for invertebrates to secondarily poison insectivorous bird species. This found that bird species that consume substantial numbers of weta, cockroaches and beetles (eg. kiwi (Apteryx spp), ruru (Ninox novaeseelandiae) and robin (Petroica australis)) are at risk of secondary poisoning from their food supply during pest control operations using brodifacoum. The risk is higher during and immediately after bait containing brodifacoum is loaded in bait stations. Risks decreases progressively after bait is removed, as invertebrates excrete any brodifacoum residues present in their tissues. The risk of secondary poisoning is likely to be greater during warmer months, due to increased invertebrate activity (and residues in invertebrates) during this time. The frequency of consumption of contaminated invertebrates by birds was also determined to affect risk of secondary poisoning. A series of management recommendations are made to reduce risks of secondary poisoning when using brodifacoum for pest control in New Zealand.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/316</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Neglected Offender: Exploring the Role of Executive Dysfunction in Violent Offending</field><field name="creator">Crump, Sheree A</field><field name="description">Executive dysfunction and aggression and violence have been consistently associated in the research literature over at least the last 50 years. Some literature documents profound behaviour changes and the development of antisocial traits after changes to the prefrontal cortex and it&#8217;s supporting neural networks. Other research makes tentative links using brain imaging and neuropsychological methods. Prefrontal dysfunction can lead to executive dysfunction, and executive dysfunction may constitute a pathway to violence. Robust demonstrations of the association between executive function and violence have been limited by poor methodology in previous studies. This study attempts to address methodological concerns and uses a neuropsychological battery to examine the role of the executive functions in the expression of violence through violent offending. It is hypothesised that problems with executive functioning as measured by a neuropsychological battery may be linked to violent offending through impulsivity and disinhibition. Two studies were completed with sixty participants across the two groups. In the first study three groups of men were assessed on tests of executive dysfunction; 21 inmates convicted of violent crimes; 16 inmates convicted of non-violent crimes; and a matched control sample of 16 men in the community who are conviction free. Results demonstrate a positive relationship between executive dysfunction and violent offending. A similar association was demonstrated between the length of formal education each participant across the sample reported, with less years of education increasing the likelihood of participants being in one of the incarcerated groups. The second study examined neuropsychological differences between seven murderers; three who killed impulsively and four who premeditated a murder. There were no conclusive results from this study, which may be due to the small sample size. It is suggested that identifying pathways to violence can inform therapeutic interventions. The indication of executive dysfunction as a pathway to violence was used to develop an intervention specifically geared towards executive deficits in violent offenders. The third study, Study Three (which was not completed due to constraints imposed by the research setting beyond the control of the researcher) includes the design of a study to assess the outcome of an intervention for inmates with ED. The intervention itself is appended to this thesis.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/320</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Form-focused Instruction in L2 French</field><field name="creator">Erlam, Rosemary May</field><field name="description">While substantial evidence lends support to an explicit focus on form in language programme design, there is a need for systematic investigation of the relative effectiveness of subtypes of explicit L2 instruction (Norris &amp; Ortega, 2000). This study considers planned approaches to form-focused instruction, that is, focus-on-forms (Long, 1991). It contrasts grammar instruction that is deductive (i.e., involving rule presentation and metalinguistic information) with instruction that is inductive (i.e., instruction that focuses student attention on form but includes no rule presentation). Language instruction traditionally focuses on giving students opportunities to produce the particular language forms that have been the focus of instruction. Recent research claims that instruction that gives students the opportunity to process language input is more effective (e.g.,VanPatten, 1996, 2002a). This study compares the relative effectiveness of structured input and output-based instruction. Most research investigates the effectiveness of instruction in terms of overall group gains. A particular instructional method may not, however, benefit all learners uniformly. This study establishes whether there is any relationship between the effectiveness of the instructional methods investigated and learner aptitude. The study was conducted in a New Zealand high school and the structure targeted was direct object pronouns in L2 French. Students (N = 92) were assigned to four groups: (a) structured input instruction; (b) output-based/deductive instruction; (c) inductive instruction (input/output-based); (d) control. They were assessed on listening comprehension, reading comprehension, written production and oral production tasks. All but one of these language measures required a pressured response. Students were also assessed on measures of language aptitude: (a) language analytic ability, (b) phonemic coding ability and (c) working memory.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/321</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A new approach to estimate congestion impacts for highway evaluation: effects on fuel consumption and vehicle emissions</field><field name="creator">Greenwood, Ian Douglas</field><field name="description">The evaluation of highway projects where traffic congestion is a significant problem requires careful analysis to accurately identify the true costs, and therefore potential benefits, of operational changes. Models have previously been derived that employ either simplistic speed-flow approaches or highly detailed micro-simulation techniques. Another approach, and the goal for this research, is to develop a midrange modelling framework whereby the predictive capability could be enhanced in comparison to the simple speed-flow models but without the onerous data issues of micro-simulation, for use in highway evaluation projects. The approach adopted was based on modelling of acceleration noise defined as the standard deviation of the accelerations. During periods of high traffic congestion there is a greater variability in speed resulting in higher acceleration noise levels. Once the acceleration noise level is estimated, the impact on fuel consumption and vehicle emissions can then be determined. The framework consists of a series of discrete sub-models that firstly estimate the base (steady-speed) fuel consumption and then the acceleration noise level value. From these data, the additional fuel consumption from congestion is calculated and vehicle emissions are finally estimated. In this way, the model can be made more flexible for application to future research because it allows replacement of any portion of the model sub-routines without the need for a complete restructuring of the model framework. Data collection and analysis of the regimes for modelling were undertaken on highways in Auckland (New Zealand), Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia) and Bangkok (Thailand). The new modelling approach and the results of the work have been integrated into with the International Study of Highway Development and Management Tools (ISOHDM) in order to provide a model for inclusion into the Highway Development and Management Model version 4 (HDM-4). Fuel consumption predictions were tested both with and without the impact of a simulated acceleration noise level. For the latter of the two (i.e. a given drive cycle) the predictions were within 0.25 per cent. When including the impacts of a generated drive cycle from a known level of acceleration noise, the results show a consistent under-prediction of some 25 percent when compared with on-road test results. It is believed that this under-prediction is largely due to the assumption of the acceleration noise data conforming to a Normal Distribution. The research results of the new modelling approach for emissions have been tested against an existing data set of seven vehicles sourced from independent research on Auckland&#8217;s motorways. Vehicle emissions of carbon dioxide and hydrocarbons were under-predicted by some 50 per cent in relation to the average tested vehicle, but were still well within the range of the seven observed results. Carbon monoxide and oxides of nitrogen were grossly under-predicted and were below the minimum observed values. The new modelling approach, even with the above limitations, still has wide application in improving the prediction of vehicles operating on highways in congested conditions. The patterns of fuel consumption and emissions are showing the appropriate changes in relation to traffic congestion, and therefore further calibration is required. Furthermore, the model framework readily lends itself to enhancement via adoption of some new sub-models.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/323</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Basic word order in De Agricultura</field><field name="creator">Hanna, Kirsten M</field><field name="description">Latin word order has been the subject of scholarly debate for centuries, yet the question is far from resolved. In terms of the basic order of the clause's core constituents, some analysts argue that the basic order is SOV, while others argue for SVO. Some scholars argue that basic order is determined primarily by pragmatic principles, others hold the view that order is primarily syntactically determined, and others suggest that both syntactic and pragmatic principles are in operation. The purpose of this study is to contribute to the debate on basic order in Latin and its determinants. Specifically, I examine the order of subject, object and verb in De agricultura, an agricultural manual written in the 2nd century BC. The study shows that the orders SV and OV are so overwhelmingly predominant that we are justified in labelling them as basic; indeed they are so common that we could argue that the order of these elements is relatively fixed. Departures from the basic order fall into two categories: those instances where a subject or object comes later in the clause than usual (i.e. after the verb) and those instances where they appear earlier in the clause than usual (i.e. in a fronting construction). It will be shown that there is a constellation of factors which must be taken into account to explain the distribution and function of these deviations, including the information status of a fronted or postposed NP's referent, its pragmatic function in the clause, and the function of the clause in structuring the discourse. In summary, I argue that in De agricultura there is a syntactically determined basic order for subject, object and verb, and that departures from the basic order are motivated by pragmatic factors, viz either (a) the need to draw attention to an NP's referent(s) for a specific discourse-structuring reason or (b) the positioning of certain 'focally heavy' information after light verbs.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/322</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Kristeva&#8217;s Social Theory: A Lacanian Critique for Education</field><field name="creator">Holmes, Lucille Anne</field><field name="description">This research aims to provide a symptomatic reading of the work of Julia Kristeva. A symptomatic reading is one that constructs the problematic or the unsaid of the text. As a symptomatic reader, I attempt to occupy a position within a theoretical discourse that interrogates the texts by Kristeva and those that surround her work. In doing so, my aim is to make visible the suppressed and excluded discourses within Kristevan theory and which have enabled that theory to make sense in particular ways. The specific systems of meaning in Kristeva&#8217;s work that I will interrogate coalesce around her theory of the semiotic and the symbolic, which is presented as a revolutionary theory of subjectivity in relation to the social. Kristeva&#8217;s theory will be critically examined in terms of how it is formulated in relation to the theories of Althusser, Hegel and Lacan. Each chapter aims to displace an accepted or dominant interpretation by Kristeva and also by her readers. In reconstructing the problematic that is concealed in Kristeva&#8217;s work, I will explore how her theory maintains an Althusserian approach to social theory, and how this underlies her critique of Hegel and Lacan. In the final chapters on Lacan, my argument is that Kristeva&#8217;s critique of Lacanian psychoanalysis is inherently flawed and that this, therefore, leads her psychoanalytic work into ethically difficult areas. In the last chapter, on education and transference, I will show how certain educational applications of Kristevan psychoanalysis culminate in the very same ethical problems. These ethical difficulties, I will argue, are avoided by Lacanian psychoanalysis and, therefore, by its application to education.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/324</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development and validation of a student evaluation instrument to identify highly accomplished mathematics teachers</field><field name="creator">Irving, Stephen Earl</field><field name="description">This study describes the attributes of a highly accomplished mathematics teacher as reported by the students in their class, and also determines whether high school students can differentiate between highly accomplished mathematics teachers and others. The 51-item instrument, Students Evaluating Accomplished Teaching &#8211; Mathematics, was developed to map the construct of highly accomplished teaching as articulated by the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards in their Adolescent and Young Adulthood Mathematics Standards. Two focus groups of New Zealand high school mathematics teachers reviewed these Standards, and found that there were more similarities than differences between the Standards and what they would expect of a highly accomplished teacher in New Zealand. Questionnaire items were drafted relating to each of 470 statements in the Standards. These items were trialled in New Zealand high schools, and analysed using factor analysis and item response theory, to select items that completely mapped the Standards. The questionnaire was then administered to 1611 students in the classes of thirty-two National Board Certified Teachers and twenty-six non-Board colleagues in 13 states of the USA. Multivariate analysis of variance and discriminant function analysis were used to establish that students can record and report the difference between NBCTs and their non-Board certified colleagues, and describe what students believe are the attributes of a good teacher. Highly accomplished teachers build a relationship between their students and the mathematics curriculum, as well as with the language and processes of mathematics, by engaging their minds with challenging material and rich tasks. These results provide further validation of the NBPTS certification process, and indicate that students provide dependable evaluations of their teachers.

It achieves this through a three-stage multi-method action research based study including survey work, multiple cases, and a single site industrial SME case. The study is grounded in the resourcebased view (RBV) of the firm, providing a linkage between the strategic management and marketing disciplines. The purpose of this research is to support theory development in the area of customer value. A new definition of customer value was developed, recognising the complex, dynamic and multi-dimensional nature of the construct. The definition is supported by a series of empirically based conceptual frameworks, describing the customer value construct and the customer value development process of the firm. A number of perspectives on customer value-related marketing practice were found. Successive stages of the research identified six approaches to creating and delivering customer value: Traditional Transactional, Transitional or hybrid, Traditional Relational, Network, Systemic and Pluralistic. These approaches are not mutually exclusive. Rather, they characterise various approaches to customer value creation and delivery practiced in various contexts (e.g. for-profit and not-for-profit, consumer and industrial) and at various levels within firms (e.g. senior management, functional and front-line), strongly suggesting a contingency of practice. The customer value creation and delivery process was conceptualised as a triad, viewed through the lens of making, keeping, and enabling promises (Gronroos, 1996). A fourth dimension, realising promises, was added, encompassing the outputs of the process (i.e. financial and non-financial value for both customer and firm). Future research should be directed at testing and refining elements of the conceptual frameworks and value postures, offering significant benefits to practicing managers, to management education, and to theoretical understanding.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/327</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Employment system mental models in organisation building : founder&#8217;s mental models of employment in New Zealand biotechnology start-ups</field><field name="creator">Ho, Marcus</field><field name="description">The majority of biotechnology firms are founded by scientists and the organisations are characterized by high human capital density. The existing research has focused on these founders and their impact on the human and social capital within their firms (Powell, 1996; Murray, 2004). However, there are significant gaps in understanding the unique requirements and employment demands of biotechnology start-ups. While there have been several studies investigating the organisation and building of the employment system of entrepreneurial firms (e.g., Burton, 1995), our understanding of the role founders play in building of the employment system still remains limited particularly in the context of biotechnology. The focus of this study is how founders of biotechnology companies organise and build the employment system in their start-up ventures. Based on a study of three biotechnology firms and their founders, this thesis adopts an integrative cognitive methodology in studying the founder&#8217;s role in the employment system creation within their new ventures. This study builds on an in-depth multi-method case study approach in examining founders&#8217; mental models of the employment system and the organisations that they have built. The findings suggest that founders approach the human capital systems within their firm with a specific mental model of human capital organisation. These mental models of the employment system emphasise informal and formal managerial practices that are designed to achieve various aspects of the organisation&#8217;s culture and goals. The findings also suggest that founders&#8217; mental models of employment systems are influenced by a variety of determining factors that include strategic choice, environmental influences and individual backgrounds that shape the nature and content of the employment system they form.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/328</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thalidomide Metabolism and Metabolites</field><field name="creator">Lu, Jun</field><field name="description">Thalidomide, renowned for causing birth defects in the late 1950s when used for the relief of morning sickness, has attracted new interest for the treatment of inflammatory conditions such as erythema nodosum leprosum and human malignancies such as multiple myeloma. Different species have different sensitivities to thalidomide that could be related to differences in its metabolism. In this study, methodologies using liquid chromatographymass spectrometry were developed to identify thalidomide metabolites formed in vivo and in vitro in liver microsomes from mice, rabbits and humans, firstly to seek explanations for inter-species differences in sensitivity, and secondly to determine whether thalidomide or its metabolite(s) is the active agent. Four hydrolysis products were detected in plasma and urine samples from multiple myeloma patients (MMPs) on thalidomide therapy, and mice and rabbits after oral administration of thalidomide. Six hydroxylated metabolites were detected in mice and rabbits, but not in plasma and urine from MMPs. In vitro studies confirmed that murine and rabbit liver microsomes catalysed the hydroxylation of thalidomide efficiently, but significant production of hydroxylation of thalidomide was not observed using human liver microsomes. The degree of hydroxylation both in vivo and in vitro was highest in mice and lowest in humans with rabbits in between. It is unlikely that hydroxylated metabolites are responsible for the effects of thalidomide in the treatment of multiple myeloma, since they were not present in quantifiable amounts in patients who were responding to the treatment. The three major hydrolysis products that were detected in patients were compared with thalidomide for their ability to inhibit tube formation in an in vitro angiogenesis assay, to inhibit TNF production induced with LPS in human peripheral blood leucocytes, and to modulate DMXAA-induced TNF production and antitumour activity in mice. One of the three, N-(o-carboxybenzoyl)glutamic acid imide (CG) was found to be as active as thalidomide in all the assays at concentrations (1-2 &#956;g/ml) that are achievable in MMPs. Since CG has been shown by other laboratories to be non-teratogenic, the studies in this thesis indicate that CG would be a more favourable, non-teratogenic approach to cancer therapy compared with thalidomide.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/329</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A methodology for the optimisation and synthesis of digital FPGA-based circuits</field><field name="creator">Maunder, Richard Bruce</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the development and analysis of a methodology for designing and optimising digital FPGA-based circuits.

Initially, a synthesiser is developed to produce hardware description language listings for stochastic neural networks. This highlights the advantages and disadvantages of special-purpose synthesis. In particular, the close hardware mapping of stochastic summation and sigmoidal activation functions is described. The second synthesiser is developed for general purpose synthesis. It is based on synchronous sub-circuit modules and supports hierarchical designs. The modules are described in static libraries or in extensions to the synthesiser core that create the modules during synthesis. The modules can be of various data types including parallel, serial, and stochastic representations. The synthesiser supports hardware resource-sharing to trade-off cell count and cycle count. It analyses the circuits in terms of their pipelined data flow and operating latency. A separate module scheduler and controller circuit is synthesised as part of the synthesiser's operation. A genetic algorithm is tailored to the problem of digital circuit optimisation through the development of specific structures and procedures. In particular, a concise encoding of the circuit is developed that the genetic algorithm can manipulate. Specific crossover and mutation mechanisms are also developed to complement the functionality of the synthesiser. The searches are effected by altering module data type, hardware resource sharing, and module implementation version. A fitness function is derived that makes use of a number of optimisation parameters to objectively evaluate each particular circuit. The features of each circuit are calculated and estimated during the analysis phase. This includes an estimate of cell-count for a particular target technology, for which the concept of a hardware compression factor is introduced. The developed software implementations are examined in terms of the software development process. Various engineering issues are discussed along with details of the development strategies employed. The synthesis software is designed for robustness, low development time, and low debugging time. The cost is a less-than-optimal operating speed of the synthesis and optimisation code. Two detailed case studies are examined to show the synthesis and optimisation performance. A formula is derived to calculate the quantitative extents of the design spaces being searched. The optimiser is shown to converge to 'fit' solutions-in terms of the desired constraints and the objective fitness function. Clustering of solution points in the design spaces is observed. These are generally narrow in terms of cycle count and considerable in terms of cell count. Trends are apparent across the design space showing that module data type and resource sharing are correlated to cell-count and cycle-count. Different circuit optimisations produce different correlations such that an overall generalisation was not appropriate.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/331</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A broad application optimisation-based rostering model</field><field name="creator">Nielsen, David</field><field name="description">This work considers the automated generation of high quality rosters for the general rostering situation. We develop a general modelling framework based on integer programming that promises to provide good descriptions of a broad range of rostering problems and we present optimisation-based solution methods that efficiently provide good solutions to the problem instances. We examine our current modelling approach in terms of expected future requirements of the system. We currently see these requirements as being an increasing demand for modelling with respect to the preferences of staff. Computational results and feedback from commercial projects demonstrating the system are provided as well as comparative results against existing rostering processes on the same rostering problem. A new solution method is reported that uses multiple constraint branching within a dive-and-fix heuristic. This method has been used with success to improve performance of the branch-and-price solution approach implemented as part of this project.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/332</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Collective mediation: a neo-Vygotskian perspective of undergraduate interdisciplinary group projects</field><field name="creator">Raven, John M.</field><field name="description">With an underlying concern for grounding pedagogical practice, this study uses controversial methods to research a controversial issue: the dynamic between the social nature of learning and the isolating nature of computer technology. The context chosen for researching this concern comprises a case study of four groups that participated in an undergraduate interdisciplinary group project as part of their second year studies in business at the Auckland University of Technology, a programme marketed on the basis of the development of authentic skills and capabilities using this particular pedagogy. What is of interest is how the use of computer technology allowed the participants to co-construct meaning in this context. This interest in the socially and culturally constructed aspects of human functioning rests upon a Vygotskian perspective, which I review along with various appropriations of this theory and other viewpoints in the literature review. Based upon this analysis, I then present a model for Collective Mediation, which views the computer as a mediational tool encompassed within the collaborative activity of the groups involved in this study. At this point I also suggest a protocol, or framework, for understanding this joint activity, which then guides the research methodology. The primary source of data in the study consists of transcriptions of focus group meetings with the participants over a four month period of time, a method that is justified by the requirements of the research to understand the multitude of relationships among the group members and with computer technology. To support triangulation, a questionnaire, log sheets, and member checks were also employed. The results reveal not only a rich fabric of activities and meanings, but a complex social dynamic guiding the events leading up to the construction of a joint project: one that was constrained, as well as supported, by the use of computers. In key areas, the pedagogy studied was shown to lack support. This thesis adds material to the debate concerning the interface between the computer, as an increasingly complex medium for educational activities, and the social fabric created within an authentic group project at tertiary level. There are clear practical implications. On a theoretical level, the study adds to an understanding of how neo-Vygotskian theory can, or cannot, be interpreted to understand such settings and, in terms of methodology, the study introduces a new protocol for analysing the rich data set that is needed to capture the dynamics involved.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/333</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Going far?: John O&#8217;Shea&#8217;s Runaway in the context of his attempt to establish a feature film industry in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Reynolds, John Stuart</field><field name="description">Over the past two decades, the amount of media attention and scholarly research focused on New Zealand feature-films has greatly increased. However, because this work has emphasised directors and films from 1977 onwards, John O&#8217;Shea (1920- 2001) has not received the detailed treatment called for in terms of the crucial role he played in sustaining and building film production in New Zealand through his company Pacific Films. This thesis seeks to make a comprehensive study of one of O&#8217;Shea&#8217;s most important feature films, Runaway (1964). The film provides a classic example of the importance of contexts in film study, and this thesis seeks to explore a variety of relevant contexts &#8211; the previous history of film production in New Zealand; the development of a general &#8216;film culture&#8217;; O&#8217;Shea&#8217;s personal background; the events leading up to the Runaway&#8217;s production; the social, cultural, technical and financial challenges O&#8217;Shea faced in completing the film; and its reception and subsequent influence. His earlier and later feature films are also discussed in some detail. The limited amount of previous scholarship on this topic necessitated primary research of various kinds, beginning with a study of the extensive records of Pacific Films &#8211; scripts, correspondence, music scores, flyers, press clippings, etc. Interviews were conducted with O&#8217;Shea over a six-year period. In addition, interviews were held with various people involved in the production of Runaway, as well as a number of writers. These included Colin Broadley, Betty Curnow, John Graham, Kevin Ireland, William Johnstone and Ian Mune. Runaway makes an interesting case study for many reasons &#8211; its novelty as the first 35mm feature made in New Zealand for 12 years; O&#8217;Shea&#8217;s struggle to create the necessary creative and technical infrastructure; the influence of contemporary European cinema; the film&#8217;s portrayal of an &#8216;Angry Young Man&#8217; combined with the New Zealand &#8216;Man Alone&#8217; tradition; and its creative achievement in a situation when there were so few precedents or possible ways of funding film-making. This thesis seeks to expand the record of an under-researched period of our film history, to provide insights into the dynamics of New Zealand culture at the time, and to analyse O&#8217;Shea&#8217;s remarkable contribution to the development of a local film industry.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/334</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Antimicrobial Factor From Grapes</field><field name="creator">Rhodes, Phillippa Louise</field><field name="description">Food-borne pathogens and in particular the emergence of new food-borne bacterial pathogens, which includes Listeria monocytogenes, are a significant threat to public health. This thesis investigated a commercial red grape juice, derived from Vitis vinifera variety Ribier grapes, with a strong inhibitory action against Listeria monocytogenes. The commercial grape juice caused a 6- log reduction in Listeria monocytogenes numbers within 10 minutes exposure to the grape juice. The inhibitory effect was specific to all Listeria species. The grape juice was bactericidal and inhibitory at pH &#8804; 5.0. The addition of protein (BSA), PVPP, and metal ions (Fe3+ and Mg2+) suppressed the antilisterial activity of the grape juice. The antilisterial factor in the commercial grape juice was identified as pigmented condensed tannin (proanthocyanidin oligomers). The antilisterial pigmented condensed tannin in the commercial grape juice was likely derived from the skin of Ribier grapes. Fractionation of the commercial grape juice pigmented condensed tannin by molecular weight revealed that the antilisterial activity was distributed over a range (mean degree of polymerisation 2.8 through 8.5) of tannin fractions. Condensed tannin fraction (G) had a mean degree of polymerisation of 5.9 and was found to have the strongest antilisterial activity. The molecular weight of oligomers identified in fraction G ranged from MW 867 to MW 2905. Fraction G contained the highest percentage of polymeric colour with 90% the pigmented moieties (anthocyanins) in the fraction incorporated into the polymer structure. Fraction G was comprised of the flavonoid subunits catechin, epicatechin, epigallocatechin, and epicatechin-3-O-gallate. Ribier grape seed condensed tannin had strong antilisterial activity. The antilisterial condensed tannin derived from Ribier grape seed was comprised of the flavonoid subunits catechin, epicatechin, and epicatechin-3-O-gallate and increasing antilisterial activity was associated with increasing mean degree of polymerisation of the tannin polymers. The efficacy of the pigmented condensed fraction of the commercial grape juice and Ribier grape seed condensed tannin as natural food preservatives were assessed. In the presence of Listeria monocytogenes contaminated cabbage the inhibitory activity of the pigmented condensed tannin from commercial grape juice was suppressed. The antilisterial activity of the Ribier grape seed condensed tannin was reduced but not eliminated when Listeria monocytogenes was associated with cabbage. The grape seed tannin may be effective at eliminating Listeria monocytogenes from food.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/335</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Connecting selves: relationship, identity and reflexivity on the 'frontline' in a New Zealand call centre</field><field name="creator">Copas, Susan</field><field name="description">This dissertation centres on process and connection. Beyond the popular concept of &#8216;worklife balance&#8217; it presents an integral and holistic view of how work (including the &#8216;work&#8217; of research), and life are inextricably connected. Eschewing the more conventional model of the PhD; it does not develop a question (or set of questions) about this area of interest, and then proffer answers. Rather, it works with/in an ever emerging flow of living relationships and experiences, to offer inclusive, constantly shifting understandings of the embodied dialogical processes that relationally construct and connect people, our &#8216;selves,&#8217; in the everyday flow of life, work and research centred around a particular organisational setting: a large public sector call centre. The study rests on the assumption that rich multiply inflected emergent processes and relationships &#8216;make&#8217; people and their worlds, including the world of research. Hence the dissertation is presented as an on-going construction, in which individuals and organisations are not autonomous entities, but are in-effect, always becoming. The organisation, its frontline staff, managers, and I (the &#8216;researcher&#8217;) emerge moment-bymoment, relationally made and remade, within the communicative realm of embodied language, in many different social, local, and historically inflected ways. In the field, this everyday becoming is explored using a hybrid form of organisational ethnography and collaborative action research. On the page, academic prose, stories and narrative poems combine and interweave to (re)construct and deconstruct the situated dialogues and relationships. Narrated in two parts, the first section - &#8220;Telling Stories&#8221; - works with contexts, scene setting and character development. Its layered and iterative unfolding begins with a day-in-the-life story of work, life and research at the call centre. The section then outlines the attitudes and assumptions that guide relational-responsive becoming, before detailing the political economic, organisational and personal backgrounds and values influencing this study. With/in the conversations and complications of collaborative practice I &#8216;show and tell&#8217; how &#8216;coming to know what is known&#8217; is a rich relational emergent process that reworks research away from the more traditional notion of it as data gathering and retrospective analysis. Part two - &#8220;Stories Told&#8221; - is the heart of this study. It brings a sense of emergence to life by focusing the kaleidoscopic lenses of relationship, identity and reflexivity on people-in-process within the dynamic interplay of call centre technologies, organisational systems and human interaction; both at work and outside of the workplace. The stories interweave the rich multidimensionality of emergent lives, as they explore the camaraderie and subversion of working in a tightly monitored and time pressured environment, amidst changing conceptions of what constitutes public service in New Zealand. Radically reflexive, they unsettle the often taken-for-granted assumptions, feelings, actions and words that make selves in life, work and research. In doing so, the stories raise expansive and inclusive possibilities for new ways of understanding each other, our knowledges, practices and experiences. They also remind us of the everyday, every moment possibilities for developing more mindful and holistic understandings of the relational processes and the communicative practices, within which we make our selves, our organisations, and our worlds.

It focuses on examining how Christian missionaries and Chinese reformers, in the process of advancing their goals, made use of aspects of Western musical culture and how their actions helped facilitate the introduction of Western music to a wider Chinese audience in the late Qing. The purpose of this study is to show that the introduction of Western music in China was essentially a by-product of Christian evangelism and Chinese reformism. The central contention of the thesis is that Western music was introduced to the Chinese not for its aesthetic appeal or artistic superiority but for its utility in China&#8217;s conversion to God and in its struggle for modernity. This study is constructed upon empirical evidence chiefly from primary sources and from citations in Chinese and Western scholarship. It makes use of written accounts such as diaries, letters, memoirs, newspaper and magazine materials, religious tracts, sermons, and visual representations of musical activity in contemporaneous paintings, photos, drawings and prints. The thesis is divided into two main parts. The first part, comprising Chapters 1 to 4, investigates the uses of music in Christian missions in China and the role of missionaries in the introduction and gradual spread of Western music in China. The second part, consisting of Chapters 5 to 9, deals with the role of Chinese reformers and that of Japan in the wide dissemination of Western music at the turn of the twentieth century. The Conclusion recapitulates some of the findings from the nine chapters and restates the general argument of this thesis. It also offers some reflections on the broad significance of the role of the missionaries and Chinese reformers in the forming of a new musical tradition in China.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/337</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Recognising women&#8217;s responses to heart disease symptoms: different groups respond in different ways</field><field name="creator">Campbell, Cheryl Anne</field><field name="description">This study explored the recognition and understanding of angina or heart attack symptoms and the reasons for delay in seeking appropriate care with particular reference to women and Maori. The study population consisted of European and Maori people aged between 45 and 85 years either diagnosed as being at high risk of having a heart attack, experiencing angina, or requiring admission to hospital with their first heart attack. The study methodology is a qualitative analysis of 30 individual interviews (nine European women, nine European men, five Maori women and seven Maori men) conducted using grounded theory. A semi-structured interview schedule followed the sequence of events that led to seeking medical care. Interviews were audio taped, transcribed and coded using a computer software programme. The data analysis included collaboration with Maori. Delay times from symptom onset to hospital admission were: five participants delayed less than two hours (range 1 hour to 1 hour 30 minutes), and six participants delayed more than 2 hours (range 2 hours 30 minutes to 10 hours). Delay times from symptom onset until attending a medical clinic were: four participants delayed less than 2 hours (range 1-2 hours) and fourteen participants delayed more than 2 hours (range 4-24 hours). Reasons for delay, common to both European and Maori were: difficulties recognising their symptoms, self treatment, obtaining reassurance, differences in symptom descriptions between the participants and doctors, and several participants&#8217; symptoms were initially misdiagnosed. In the European group specific reasons related to delay were: a lack of knowledge, and consultations with general practitioners. European women reported that uncommon symptoms were disregarded in the pre-diagnosis period. For Maori, specific reasons for delay were: a greater emphasis on consulting family and minimising the symptoms. Participants had a codified set of rules within the self regulatory model that determined their actions that became the emergent theme in the overarching category &#8211; &#8216;Recognising Women&#8217;s Responses to Heart Disease Symptoms: Different groups respond in different ways&#8217;. The fact that people have different perceptions about symptoms, endure symptoms in different ways, obtain reassurance in different ways, and take action in different ways formed the categories that made up the theoretical concept. The rules differed according to gender and culture. The study findings will contribute to the understanding of gender and cultural differences in care seeking for heart disease symptoms.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/338</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanisms of compensation in agenesis of the corpus callosum</field><field name="creator">Barr, Melodie</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the compensatory mechanisms that allow information to be available to both cerebral hemispheres in individuals with agenesis of the corpus callosum. The first set of experiments, detailed in Chapter Three, were designed to determine what types of visual information can be integrated interhemispherically in these subjects. Two acallosals, J.P. and M.M., and ten control subjects were tested. Results showed that M.M., whose anterior commissure was within normal limits, was much worse at matching colours and letters between visual fields than within visual fields, while J.P., whose anterior commissure was greatly enlarged, showed no evidence of interhemispheric disconnection on these tasks. This suggests that in some cases of callosal agenesis an enlarged anterior commissure may compensate for the lack of a corpus callosum. Neither acallosal subject showed disconnection on tasks requiring integration of location and orientation, however, suggesting that the anterior commissure plays no role in such tasks, although both subjects performed poorly relative to controls. These tasks may depend on subcortical commissures, such as the intertectal commissure. The two experiments in Chapter Four tested J.P. and M.M. tested on a simple reaction-time (RT) task, with visual stimuli presented either singly to one or the other visual field or in bilaterally presented pairs. Stimuli were either white against a black background, or grey against an equiluminant yellow background. RTs to bilateral pairs were decreased beyond predictions based on a simple race between independent unilateral processes, implying interhemispheric neural summation. This effect was enhanced under equiluminance in M.M., but not J.P., suggesting that the anterior commissure may act, relative to its size, to affect cortical activation to bilateral pairs, which then acts to decrease subcortical neural summation. In Chapter Five, J.P., M.M. and A.L.M. (the daughter of M.M.), and twelve control subjects were tested on a simple RT task, with visual evoked potentials collected using a high-density 128-channel system. Independent-components analyses were performed to isolate the visual components of interest. Contrary to previous research with acallosals, evidence of ipsilateral activation was present in all three acallosal subjects. While ipsilateral visual components were present in all four unilateral conditions in M.M. and A.L.M., in J.P. these were present only in the crossed visual field/hand conditions and not in the uncrossed conditions. It is suggested that individual differences and methodological limitations in the previous studies due to the small number of electrodes used are the most likely explanation for the difference in findings. Finally, due to the clear individual differences in aetiology, neurophysiology and compensatory mechanisms utilized by the three acallosal subjects tested here, a case study approach was taken with each subject discussed separately.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/339</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fiction and the emotions.</field><field name="creator">Travinor, Grant</field><field name="description">Our participation with works of fiction involves the emotions. Just what this involvement amounts to is a question of great interest. I argue that the literature on the involvement of the emotions in fictive practice has usually made several mistakes. Firstly it has assumed that the emotions are better understood than they actually are. I argue that the theory of emotions common to most of the theories of fiction and the emotion is far from controversial. Revising our conception on what emotions are may allow us to revise our conception of the nature of our emotional involvement in fiction. Second, I argue that two forms of problem are often conflated when philosophers discuss fictional and the emotions. There are semantic and ontological problems, and substantive psychological problems. Often these problems are confused for each other. Distinguishing between the two forms of problem will help to clear up the significant disagreements that exist in the literature. My thesis is broadly naturalised in intent, in the hope that this focus will be productive in explaining the role of the emotions in fictive practice.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/340</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Deformation characteristics of knitted fabric composites</field><field name="creator">Duhovic, Miro</field><field name="description">A relatively recent innovation in the field of thermoplastic composites is the reinforcement with knitted structure that offers a number of potential advantages over the more conventional straight-fibre reinforcements. They can be stretched in both directions during forming, increasing the potential for forming complex and deeplycurved components and have excellent impact, fracture toughness and energy absorption properties. An understanding of some of the unique behaviour of these sheet materials during forming and the practical viability of various forming processes are crucial in assessing their applicability to given products and uses. The first part of this study concentrates on identifying the types of micro-level mechanisms that occur during the forming process of knitted fabric thermoplastic composite sheets. It has been proposed that knitted fabrics and textile composite materials, in general, follow a three-level hierarchy of deformation modes. The most important of these levels are the micro-level fabric deformation modes, which have been identified and specifically developed for study in this thesis. In order to study these modes, the material has been subjected to a series of simple inplane, single and double curvature forming experiments. The main purpose of the inplane forming experiments was to record tensile data that would later be used to establish the warp and weft direction modulus curves, important inputs for the numerical simulations. Grid strain analysis (GSA) was also performed to investigate the strains that occur during the forming of more complex shaped components and to verify the numerical simulation results. The experiments highlighted that the behaviour of the molten composite was very similar to that of the dry fabric at forming rates below 100mm/min and that the lubricating effects of chemical sizing on fibres in both the composite and the fabric were present. It was also found that a more even surface strain and thickness distribution could be attained using flexible tooling and higher forming temperatures. iii High fibre volume fraction knitted fabric composites were produced from 1x1 rib fabric made from commingled yarn at different pressures and temperatures. The material was able to match the stiffness and strength of a commercially available woven fabric product, Twintex&#174;, for strains of up to 8%. An optimum forming pressure of 400kPa was found to give the best consolidation without causing fibre damage due to excessive compression. During the forming experiments the importance of the reinforcing structure was realised and provided the impetus for a detailed micro-level numerical investigation. The simulation involved the production of a narrow strip of 1x1 rib fabric and subsequent tensile testing. The model was verified in two ways: i) by comparing the physical and numerical specimens geometrically and ii) by using force displacement curves generated from the tensile tests on real specimens manufactured using the same knitting machine parameters. A correlation factor was defined to allow the comparison of numerical and physical specimens containing different numbers of fibres. Comprehensive analysis of the model revealed bending as the most dominant microlevel mechanism, followed by torsion, uniaxial tension and contact energy at low strain levels and bending followed by uniaxial tension, contact energy and torsion at high strain levels. In addition, macro-level numerical modelling was performed using the data gathered from molten tensile tests. A PAMFORM&#8482; material model originally designed to model the sheet behaviour of unidirectional and woven composites was used. Minimum thickness strains showed close agreement. However, further development of the model is required to allow more accurate predictions of the surface strains and stability at very high strain values.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/341</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The particle ai in New Zealand Ma&#772;ori</field><field name="creator">Hunter, Ian Murray</field><field name="description">This study looked at the functions and uses of the problematic particle ai in New Zealand M&#257;ori. Ai is described primarily as a verbal particle. It appears in a number of seemingly disparate constructions, has no parallel in English, and there has never been a satisfactory explanation of all its uses. The data consists of a large corpus of sentences containing ai that were extracted from selected texts written by native speakers from as early as the 19th Century up until 2005. Sentences were also solicited from fluent speakers. Analysis of the data and discussions with native speakers led to the conclusion that ai exists as two distinct particles, which were labelled habitual ai, and anaphoric ai. Habitual ai is a verbal marker that confers habitual aspect on its verb. It was found that it is mainly used by speakers from the Eastern regions of the North Island. Anaphoric ai refers back to some element earlier in the discourse. It has two forms, labelled resumptive ai and resultative ai. Resumptive ai is an anaphoric pro-form that resumes a specific noun phrase in its clause. It was found to have a grammatical function. When resumptive ai was deleted from its clause consultants judged the results ill-formed. An example of a construction with resumptive ai is a sentence with an adverbial of reason located before the verb. Resultative ai locates its clause in prior discourse, making a causal link between its clause and the prior element. It was found to have a mainly lexical function. When resultative ai was deleted from its clause consultants judged that the meaning had altered and that the causal link was weakened or lost. An example of a construction with resultative ai is a purpose clause which follows an action that has been carried out for that specific purpose. This thesis provides a unified explanation for all uses of ai. It also accounts for previously unexplained appearances, by showing that one form of ai may occur in environments restricted to another. Its appearance in non-verbal phrases are accounted for, and observations have been made about changes in its use over time.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/343</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Alzheimer&#8217;s disease and the utilisation of procedural learning</field><field name="creator">Russell, Kathryn A.</field><field name="description">This thesis investigated the utilisation of procedural learning to improve self-care tasks and activities of daily living (ADLs) in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD). Procedural learning is relatively preserved in AD, presumably due to relatively little degeneration of critical neural circuits. Current interventions for AD (medical and nonmedical) have limited effects on these skills, and attempts to enhance memory with explicit learning methods have been largely ineffective. Two studies assessed the effectiveness of procedural training for ADLs in AD. Study one involved both a group and single subject design (multiple baseline across tasks) with 12 pre-selected tasks. Eight AD participants were trained on six tasks (counterbalanced across subjects) for 10 days, six tasks remained untrained. The group showed significant improvement at post-test in performance time and number of errors for trained tasks, whereas untrained tasks showed no significant change. At post-test no significant difference was found between the AD and control groups on trained tasks. Seven of the 8 participants showed a significant decrease in overall performance time (binomial analyses) and errors (visual analyses) for trained tasks. Significant training effects were maintained at 12-week follow-up. There was variability in training effectiveness between individuals and tasks. Study two assessed the effectiveness of individually-tailored training programmes, in which tasks were selected for each individual according to task impairment and relevance. A single subject design, multiple baseline across tasks, was repeated across 6 participants. Change in task performance (time or errors) coincided with the onset of training. At post-test all participants showed some training benefits in either performance time or number of errors: 4 showed training effects on 77 to 100% of their tasks and 1 participant showed training effects in 60% of tasks. The final participant showed training effects in 75% of tasks, although a truncated follow-up period limited analyses. Training benefits endured throughout follow-up for 3 participants (2 to 4 months), and for at least 5 months for the 2 participants who had longer follow-up periods (some tasks endured up to 10 (KW) and 13 months (PB)). Procedural learning methods can assist individuals with mild-to-moderate AD maintain self-care skills and ADLs. Additionally, this method could be adapted to provide a model of effective communication for caregivers, for example, breaking tasks into components and presenting requests one at a time.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/345</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Making the instructional curriculum : case studies of seven teachers of adult ESOL</field><field name="creator">Wette, Rosemary</field><field name="description">Joseph Schwab claimed that only teachers are capable of translating scholarly theory into curriculum, as only they have knowledge of and are able to co-ordinate its four cornerstones of subject matter, learners, context and the teacher. Organised around Schwab&#8217;s heuristic, this thesis explores from an ecological perspective the curriculum making practices of seven experienced, effective teachers of adult ESOL over the trajectory of a course that each one taught. While normative advice in second language teacher education texts encourages a more systems-based approach to curriculum development, there is increasing awareness in research-based literature that the instructional curriculum is in fact an interactive construction played out in a dynamic, non-linear process and particularised to a certain context and group of learners. This evidencebased study aims to illustrate how teachers engage with written curriculum sources, classroom and cultural contexts, their own theories of practice and the developing understandings and wishes of learners as they make the instructional curriculum. Data were collected from guided pre-course and post-course interviews with teachers as well as persistent, debriefing-type interviews throughout the courses, supported by course documentation and teaching materials. Themes emerging from the data and from relevant literature were coded and analysed qualitatively. Findings of this study illuminate significant aspects of teachers&#8217; curriculum making practices, including the weaving of conceptual content onto the timeframe of the courses, teachers&#8217; efforts to achieve coherence, balance and variety in the instructional curriculum, and the importance of time and process. They emphasise the central role of the teacher as synthesiser of a variety of considerations, and provide evidence of the rich and complex understandings of teachers&#8217; professional knowledge in action. They also show the fundamental importance of good cognitive and affective rapport between teacher and learners, and the need for teachers to constantly monitor and adjust the instructional curriculum according to learners&#8217; developmental needs, while at the same time taking into account a unique constellation of influences from its micro- and macro- context. Implications for ESOL teachers and teacher educators of this more detailed understanding of the instructional curriculum and of teachers&#8217; professional knowledge bases are also explored.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/348</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The professional socialisation of medical students through the preclinical to clinical transition</field><field name="creator">Lamdin, Rain Janet</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the professional socialisation of medical students through the preclinical to clinical transition of medical education. The research is based in a traditionally structured medical programme. Early clinical experiences are provided for students during their early years of teaching. Twenty-one students were interviewed in their third year and fourth year, before and after their shift into the clinical environment, and participant observation was also undertaken. The findings of this study are that in medical students&#8217; preclinical years human dissection teaches students to manage their emotions, and that students are separating from the lay world. Early clinical experiences in the preclinical years appear fragmented compared to the medical practice of doctors but, introduce students to aspects of medical work, patients and the patient case history. As students shift into their first full-time clinical year, they shape earlier knowledge to make it meaningful to its new context. Medical students &#8216;medicalise&#8217; patients through the patient case history, but they also &#8216;personalise&#8217; diseases as they associate patients with diseases. By learning in the clinical environment and being associated with medical teams, students observe and undertake parts of medical work, in an apprentice-style way. Finally, while students learn medical language and the patient case history, their experiences with patients requires them to be with patients in a way that is beyond the disease-based approach of medicine. This thesis concludes that while the biomedical science shapes students&#8217; early medical education, it is in the clinical environment that students learn to be doctors. This includes the biomedical-based practice of the patient case history, and physical examination, as well as how to be with patients when what is required from the student is not to &#8216;do&#8217; but to &#8216;be with&#8217; the patient.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/349</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Efficient and "fair" pricing under New Zealand&#8217;s power distribution sector reforms : a model of intertemporal cross subsidies and economic depreciation</field><field name="creator">Gunn, Calum Ian Maxwell</field><field name="description">The New Zealand Government&#8217;s objective in reforming the electricity supply industry has been economic efficiency. Policy actions specific to the power distribution sector have been based on the premise that electricity distribution is a natural monopoly, and a key desired outcome has been efficient and &#8220;fair&#8221; prices&#8212; those which allow electricity distributors to make a &#8220;fair return&#8221; on their network investments, while ensuring that consumers face prices which are &#8220;subsidy-free&#8221;. This thesis poses the question: what are the characteristics of efficient and &#8220;fair&#8221; prices for power distribution network services? Of crucial significance to this question is the time dimension, since debates over pricing principles posit: static versus dynamic efficiency; short run versus long run marginal cost; backward-looking versus forward-looking costs; historic cost versus replacement cost valuation; and back-loaded versus front-loaded depreciation. To address this question, a deterministic two-good/two-period model of intertemporal subsidy-free prices and economic depreciation is presented, by extending the model of intertemporal unsustainability developed by the contestability theorists, William Baumol, John Panzar and Robert Willig. This new model indicates that intertemporally subsidy-free prices are forward-looking, indexed to the hypothetical amortised opportunity costs incurred by a coalition of current and future consumers optimally constructing a greenfields network to meet their own demand. Depending on the similarities between this notional asset configuration and the incumbent distributor&#8217;s actual network, such prices may or may not reflect the distributor&#8217;s historic or replacement costs. Where spare capacity is optimally built today, in anticipation of future demand, prices should cover the opportunity cost of the total capacity required to meet current and future demand. Where capacity does not require expansion or replacement until some later date, prices should initially cover the opportunity cost of the capacity required to meet current demand alone, then rise to the cost of total capacity at such time as it would become optimal for consumers to construct greenfields capacity sufficient to meet both current and anticipated demand. These results reaffirm Marcel Boiteux&#8217;s position that spare capacity has its own income, as well as Ralph Turvey&#8217;s view that the expectation of lower costs in future raises today&#8217;s prices, providing&#8212;in some cases&#8212;justification for accelerated depreciation. However, under New Zealand&#8217;s light-handed regulatory regime, electricity distributor prices and associated depreciation schedules do not appear to have exhibited these characteristics.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/351</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ua malie toa ua malie tau = student with silver tongues whip the tail: enhanced teaching and learning of reading comprehension in Samoan bilingual classes</field><field name="creator">Amituanai-Toloa, Meaola</field><field name="description">The achievement of Samoan students in English reading comprehension has been identified as a major challenge for the education in New Zealand. This study examined the effectiveness of reading comprehension instruction in the context of six Samoan bilingual classrooms in two schools in South Auckland. The quasi-experimental intervention involved two phases over three years. One was the development of an inter-school standardised process of administering and scoring assessments to identify student weaknesses and strengths. The other involved 10 professional development sessions over the year built around the profiles of teaching and learning collected in the first year. Systematic observations of teacher instruction were carried out in both phases. In addition to the English reading comprehension measures, there were specially designed assessments of students&#8217; oral language and reading comprehension in Samoan. These assessements enabled relationships to be examined between students&#8217; Samoan oral language and reading comprehension and their English achievement. In addition, teachers were interviewed about their ideas of reading comprehension from a cultural perspective. Three approaches were used to judge the effectiveness of teaching. These showed that teaching became more effective generally when examined for students in a longitudinal cohort, but also for new cohorts in Year 1 and Year 2. In addition, the results showed that students in the bilingual classrooms had initially lower levels in reading comprehension in English but made more rapid gains with the intervention and reached comparable levels earlier. These gains are linked to specific changes in the teachers&#8217; instruction. Analyses showed that the focus of instruction, for example, instruction which increased general awareness was prominent in raising reading comprehension levels. Three teachers who attended professional development consistently showed more gains at the end of the study than the other three teachers who inconsistently attended. However, despite the gains achievement of bilingual students were still below national norms. At a general level, no relationships were found between Samoan oral language and reading comprehension and English reading comprehension but the presence of relationships between Samoan reading comprehension and English reading comprehension and between Samoan reading comprehension and English reading comprehension vocabulary at year 6 suggests a transitional effect particularly at the level of word knowledge. This effect might explain the lagging behind of achievement in English from year 4 and year 5 and a catching up at year 6. Teachers&#8217; placing more emphasis on vocabulary instruction evidenced in the observations suggests that this is an urgent need. While there was great variability in reading comprehension instruction, teacher ideas also add to the complexity given teachers&#8217; understanding of what comprehension is from the Samoan concepts of &#8216;iloa&#8217; (know) and &#8216;malamalama&#8217; (understand). Teachers differed in their understanding of these two terms. These findings suggest that low achievement in English reading comprehension can be changed, but there is more research that needs to be done to expand our knowledge of how Pasifika students in schools comprehend English texts but specifically how they should be taught.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/352</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Therapeutic effects of massage on coping with stress and migraine: a self-regulatory perspective</field><field name="creator">Lawler, Sheleigh Patricia</field><field name="description">Massage therapy, now considered a complementary therapy has seen growing interest and popularity in both research and use by the general population. Firstly, this thesis aimed to extend the research investigating the beneficial effects of massage therapy by developing and assessing an integrative model of massage effects on stress, coping, and physiological processes by using Leventhal&#8217;s Common Sense Model (CSM) of the self-regulation of behaviour. Secondly, this thesis aimed to investigate the duration of massage effects by including assessment periods past the last day of intervention and measures of coping efficacy and perceived stress. The first study investigated the effects of massage therapy (compared to a television activity) on perceived stress, coping efficacy, sleep, and health variables in students leading up to final examinations. Results revealed that massage was more effective than the television activity in reducing perceived stress and improving coping efficacy. The second study extended the first study by investigating the effects of massage (compared to a daily diary control group) for migraine sufferers, as migraine is exacerbated by stress and a stressful condition to manage. Results revealed that the massage group exhibited a reduction in migraine frequency, fatigue, and improved sleep quality, compared to the daily diary control group. The integrated CSM was further extended in the second study to investigate how the physiological processes of migraine may interact with migraine mechanisms. In both studies, the massage group revealed a significant decrease in immediate measures of heart rate and state anxiety from pre- to post-massage. The migraine massage group also exhibited decreases in salivary cortisol from pre-to post-massage. The findings are consistent with the integrated CSM of massage and self-regulation of behaviour, highlighting that massage can be a useful emotional regulation strategy through its influence on perceived stress, coping efficacy, and physiological processes. Immediate massage effects revealed reductions in state anxiety, and other physiological stress processes (heart rate and cortisol), and these changes may lead to alterations in cognitive appraisals of stressors, thus impacting on coping efficacy. Given the potential benefits identified in these two studies as well as previous massage research, an anonymous survey was conducted with general practitioners (GPs) and patients in the Auckland area to explore their attitudes, beliefs, and use of massage therapy and other complementary therapies. Results revealed that GPs regularly recommend patients see a massage therapist, and the majority of patients reported using massage in the previous year, most commonly for stress and musculoskeletal problems. The majority of GPs would like to see regulatory standards implemented for complementary medicine.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/356</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cardiac electro-mechanics: from CellML to the whole heart</field><field name="creator">Nickerson, David Phillip</field><field name="description">We have developed a computational modelling and simulation framework for cardiac electromechanics which for the first time tightly couples cellular, tissue, and whole heart modelling paradigms. Application of the framework has been demonstrated in simulations of the electrical activation and mechanical contraction of cardiac myocytes, myocardial tissue, and models of ventricular structure and function. The framework has been implemented as part of the CMISS computational modelling environment. This allows for detailed specification of tissue microstructure and the variation of cellular models and their material parameters over a geometric domain of interest. Through previous work in CMISS we have access to a large pool of existing models and methods on which to base this work. A key aspect of our framework is the implementation of methods allowing the dynamic specification of mathematical models at run-time using CellML &#8211; an XML language designed to store and exchange computer based biological models. We use these methods to enable the specification of cellular level models using CellML, thus providing a very powerful method to simply &#8220;plug&#8221; cellular models into the distributed tissue and organ level models. While in this work we have developed specific cellular models, and their CellML description, the framework is now developed to the point where a non-expert user could pull out a given model and plug-in their own model. This allows cellular modellers to develop their models and then bring them into a distributed model of tissue or organ physiology. We present a review of cellular electrophysiology and mechanics models. As a demonstration of the ability of CellML to describe cardiac cellular models in a computationally useful manner we have encoded the majority of these models into CellML. The CellML descriptions of these models are provided as they were used in the computational simulations which generated all results presented for the models directly from the CellML encoded models. While the work described in this thesis focuses on cardiac electro-mechanics, the framework has much wider applicability. As such, this work forms the beginning of a generalised simulation framework for the IUPS Physiome Project, with the goal being models describing entire organisms from proteins through to organ systems.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/358</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Negative masking and the units problem in audition</field><field name="creator">Shepherd, Daniel</field><field name="description">For humans with adequately operating auditory systems the arrival of acoustic waves to the ear and the subsequent displacement of the tympanic membrane gives rise to the sensations and perceptions commonly known as hearing. One aspect of hearing is loudness, to which the field of psychophysics attempts to ascribe a physical correlate intrinsic to the incoming acoustic wave. For over 50 years psychophysicists have attempted to explicitly define the just-noticeable difference (JND) for loudness: the smallest amount, in physical units, that a stimulus needs to be increased to produce a perceptual difference. A review of the literature suggests that the problem in defining the JND is twofold. Firstly there is the measurement problem, with specific weighting on two competing measures of the JND: the level difference (&#916;L) vs. the Weber fraction (&#916;X/X). Deciding between the two measures has proved difficult: within the natural operating range of the auditory system the two measures are directly proportional to one another. Secondly there is the units problem, concerned with the physical unit in which the measure should be expressed. The units problem exists because it has yet to be determined which property of the acoustic stimulus accounts for the perception of loudness. There are several candidates: acoustic pressure (p); acoustic intensity (I); acoustic power (P), and acoustic energy (E). The necessity of determining which, if any, is the proper measure of the stimulus is forced by the phenomenon of negative masking, which is manifest when the stimulus is expressed in terms of pressure. Selecting among the various quantities is complicated by the fact that the four measures are linearly related and constitute a direct transformation of one another. In the laboratory context existing techniques can produce stimuli that severely challenge the auditory system and break down the proportionality exhibited by the various candidate JNDs. These techniques however require greater scrutiny and development. Buus and Florentine (1991) have proposed that the JND measure (i.e., &#916;p/p, &#916;I/I, &#916;L) that realizes a linear relationship with the detectability index, d&#8217;, is the correct measure. The proportionality of the measures makes such comparison complicated, and threshold values need to be inflated by manipulating stimulus parameters in order to exceed the range of proportionality. This is accomplished using short duration (10-ms) sinusoids and low level masking noise. The experimental program commenced with a series of negative masking experiments to ensure the phenomenon is still relevant to short duration stimuli. Laming&#8217;s (1986) sensory analytical model, which assumes the auditory system responds to pressure, provided an acceptable fit to these data. Experiments on the pedestal effect, a related phenomenon, generated fixed-increment functions that could be compared to the masking functions generated from the negative masking data. A consistent relationship between the two was found when the stimuli were expressed in units of pressure. Attention then turned to improving the studies undertaken by Buus and Florentine (1991) to determine what the proper measure of the JND should be. A series of experiments, differentiated by stimulus conditions, suggest a JND measure expressed in pressure units had the most linear relationship with d&#8217;. The results argue for pressure as the correct measure of the stimulus, and &#916;p/p to be the most qualified representative of the JND.

Accountability for public safety in nurse education</field><field name="creator">Stokes, Gillian</field><field name="description">Nursing students assessed as being unsafe by nurse educators present specific challenges in tertiary education organisations. Nurse educators and education administrators are required by law to respect the rights of students to receive education, if it is deemed they will benefit from it. As registered nurses, nurse educators are also required by law to protect the public from unsafe nursing practice. The focus of this study is the management of unsafe nursing students within the tertiary education context. The moral dilemmas experienced by nurse educators, specifically linked to the issue of accountability for public safety, are explored. The theoretical framework for the thesis is informed by the two moral voices of justice and care identified by Gilligan and further developed using the work of Hekman and Lyotard. Case study methodology was used and data were collected from three schools of nursing and their respective educational organisations. Interviews were conducted with nurse educators and education administrators who had managed unsafe nursing students. Interviews were also conducted with representatives from the Nursing Council of New Zealand and the New Zealand Nurses Organisation to gain professional perspectives regarding public safety, nurse education and unsafe students. Transcripts were analysed using the strategies of categorical aggregation and direct interpretation. Issues identified in each of the three case studies were examined using philosophical and theoretical analyses. This thesis explores how students come to be identified as unsafe and the challenges this posed within three educational contexts. The justice and care moral voices of nurse educators and administrators and the ways in which these produced different ways of caring are made visible. Different competing and conflicting discourses of nursing and education are revealed, including the discourse of safety - one of the language games of nursing. The way in which participants positioned themselves and positioned others within these discourses are identified. Overall, education administrators considered accountability for public safety to be a specific professional, nursing responsibility and not a concern of education per se. This thesis provides an account of how nurse educators attempted to make the educational world safe for patients, students, and themselves. Participants experienced different tensions and moral dilemmas in the management of unsafe students, depending upon the moral language games they employed and the dominant discourse of the educational organisation. Nurse educators were expected to use the discourses of education to make their case and manage unsafe students. However, the discourses of nursing and education were found to be incommensurable and so the moral dilemmas experienced by nurse educators were detected as differends. This study bears witness to these differends.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/360</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Seismic performance of a post-tensioned concrete masonry wall system</field><field name="creator">Wight, Gavin D</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the development of a post-tensioned concrete masonry (PCM) wall system designed using generic materials. PCM walls derive their lateral strength and self-centering behaviour from unbonded post-tensioning. During in-plane loading, a horizontal crack forms at the wall base, which minimises masonry tensile strains and associated wall damage. An extensive literature review identified numerous instances where PCM has been used in projects worldwide, and this is reflected in the growing presence of the technology in international masonry codes. However, the lack of knowledge associated with seismic behaviour has resulted in limited use of this material in seismic zones. Although recent studies have begun to address this through pseudo-static testing, there remained a clear need to investigate the dynamic performance of such walls. Pseudo-static testing of two partially grouted PCM walls demonstrated the suitability of this system for residential structures in seismic areas. A subsequent shake table test series investigated the response of rectangular walls, walls with openings and a shrinkage control joint. The series concluded with the testing of a simple square structure that investigated multiple openings and wall corners. Rocking was shown to be the predominant deformation component, with minimal residual displacements at the conclusion of testing. Damage was restricted to the lower wall corners and above and below openings. Equations provided in international masonry codes for estimating the tendon stress at the nominal strength limit state were shown to be inappropriate for in-plane walls. A new expression was developed based on test results and finite element modelling, and was shown to provide improved accuracy, permitting the complete monotonic response of PCM walls to be predicted with excellent accuracy. An investigation into the creep and shrinkage properties of PCM demonstrated that prestress losses can be significant and must be considered in design. A displacement based design method for post-tensioned masonry walls was developed and demonstrated using a design example. The widely used bracing design method for reinforced masonry structures was adapted for PCM walls and utilised in the design of New Zealand's first post-tensioned concrete masonry house.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/362</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Population structure and genetic variation in Hector&#8217;s dolphin (Cephalorhynchus hectori)</field><field name="creator">Pichler, Franz</field><field name="description">This thesis uses molecular genetics as a tool to uncover information about the population structure and genetic variation in Hector&#8217;s dolphin (Cephalorhynchus hectori), to track population declines and to assess the evolutionary origins and taxonomic status of this species. A high-resolution genetic analysis of population structure was considered important for the determination of population boundaries and delimitation of conservation management units due to potentially unsustainable fisheries-related mortality. Population structure and dispersal rates were assessed using 281 samples collected from individual Hector&#8217;s dolphins of ten population groups representing the known geographic range of this species. Variation among mitochondrial DNA sequences (&#934;ST = 0.545) and microsatellite allele frequencies at six loci (RST = 0.252) indicated the presence of four genetically isolated regional populations, North Island (n = 29), East Coast South Island (n = 110), West Coast South Island (n = 122) and South Coast South Island (n = 19). Significant levels of genetic differentiation were not detected within local sub-populations of the East Coast and West Coast regional populations. However, the estimated geneflow between these sub-populations fitted a one-dimensional stepping-stone model (r2 = 0.6225) suggesting a vulnerability of local populations to fragmentation. A measure of expected mtDNA diversity (Tajima&#8217;s D statistic) suggested decline in eight of the ten populations. Microsatellite heterozygosity was also lower than expected in the East Coast and North Island regions, suggesting either further regional sub-structuring (Wahlund effect), loss of diversity due to population decline or the presence of null alleles. Examination of all Hector&#8217;s dolphin museum specimens of known origin (n = 55) enabled comparison of historic (1870 - 1987) genetic diversity to contemporary (1988 &#8211; 1999) diversity in two regional populations to assess the possibility that these populations have undergone recent declines. Over the last 20 years the North Island population has been reduced from at least three lineages (h = 0.41) to a single lineage (h = 0, p &lt; 0.05). The diversity of the East Coast, South Island population has declined significantly from h = 0.65 to h = 0.35 (p &lt; 0.05). These results suggest that the low abundance currently observed is due to recent population declines and that the North Island population is threatened with extinction in the near future. Based on a trend analysis of the mtDNA, it can be predicted that the East Coast South Island population may lose all mtDNA diversity within the next 20 years. Alternatively, detection of a one dimensional dispersal pattern may indicate that some populations are at risk of extirpation while others may not be in decline. If this is the case then the East Coast regional population is at risk of fragmentation. On a wider evolutionary scale, Hector&#8217;s dolphin is one of four species of the genus Cephalorhynchus, all of which suffer fisheries&#8211;related mortality. To describe the origin and radiation of these species, 485 bp of the mitochondrial DNA control region was sequenced from 320 individuals (including previously sequenced 200 Hector&#8217;s dolphins) representing nine of the ten species in the sub-family Lissodelphininae. The hypotheses that either Cephalorhynchus is a monophyletic genus or that the four species have arisen separately from pelagic Lissodelphine species and have converged morphologically were tested. The mtDNA phylogeny supported the monophyly of the genus and suggested that the genus Cephalorhynchus originated in the waters of South Africa and, following the West Wind Drift, colonised New Zealand and then South America. Secondary radiations resulting in two genetically isolated populations were found for the Kerguelen Island Commerson&#8217;s dolphin and the North Island Hector&#8217;s dolphin. A comparison of the genetic differentiation between the Commerson&#8217;s dolphins of the Kerguelen Islands (n = 11) and the coast of South America (n = 35), and between the North Island (n = 14) and South Island (n = 185) Hector&#8217;s dolphins, was conducted in order to assess the conservation and taxonomic status of these populations. A single fixed substitution in the mtDNA control region was diagnostic for the Kerguelen Island compared to South America (FST = 0.306, &#934;ST = 0.602) and the North Island compared to the South Island (FST = 0.442, &#934;ST = 0.495). Population differentiation of four microsatellite alleles (including unique alleles in each of the four populations) between the Kerguelen Island and South American Commerson&#8217;s dolphin (FST = 0.036, RST = 0.0493) and between the North and South Island Hector&#8217;s dolphins (FST = 0.391, RST = 0.3197) indicated restricted nuclear as well as maternal geneflow. These data, combined with additional evidence of morphological and geographic isolation, indicated that the Kerguelen Island Commerson&#8217;s dolphin and the North Island Hector&#8217;s dolphin are likely to be reproductively isolated from their alternate con-specific populations. Examination of various species concepts and definitions of conservation units leads to the conclusion that these four populations should each be considered unique at the subspecies level for the purposes of management, protection and evolutionary potential. These results lead to the conclusion that the Hector&#8217;s dolphin consists of highly subdivided populations. As a result of this and a low reproductive potential, Hector&#8217;s dolphin populations are vulnerable to extirpation through even low levels of human induced mortality. To manage such populations, it is appropriate to consider each of the two islands as separate sub-species. Within the South Island, the populations may be further subdivided into three demographically independent Management Units &#8211; the East, West and South Coasts. The South Coast management unit is vulnerable due to its low abundance and isolation and requires further investigation. Population modelling will need to reflect the fact that the local populations within the East and West coast regions share only limited dispersal with immediately adjacent populations and are thus susceptible to fragmentation. These results also show that the population declines of the East Coast South Island and the North Island populations are of recent origin thus implicating fisheries-related mortality as the principal threat to Hector&#8217;s dolphin. To prevent further decline or fragmentation of South Island populations more stringent control of inshore gillnet fisheries is required. By contrast, current decline of the North Island population may be a result of inbreeding depression. Given the low abundance and rapid decline of the North Island population, it is imperative to evaluate the potential for inbreeding depression while continuing to mitigate all human-related threats.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/363</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Between deference and self-assurance: reconciling realism and response-dependence</field><field name="creator">Bowell, Tracy Amanda</field><field name="description">This thesis deals with response-dependence accounts of concepts - concepts the extensions of which are determined by our responses under certain conditions - and the possibility of realist construals of practices involving such concepts. Drawing attention to distinctions between different types of response-dependent concepts, Chapter I proposes an account of response-dependence that recognises a variegation of types of concept that can plausibly be identified as response-dependent. Chapter II continues the development of this account by considering matters relevant to the form and content of the biconditional theorems (basic equations) of which responsedependence accounts are comprised. The account I propose in these first two chapters attempts to abstract from the details of existing accounts. Nevertheless, the middle section of the thesis &#8211; Chapters III, IV, V and VI &#8211; provide critical exegeses of response-dependence accounts developed by three authors &#8211; Mark Johnston&#8217;s Response-Dispositionalism, Philip Pettit&#8217;s Global Response-Dependence account of basic concepts and Crispin Wright&#8217;s Order of Determination distinction - accounts that have been fundamental to and influential in the literature on response dependence. Consideration of Crispin Wright&#8217;s realism relevant distinctions provides a bridge to Chapter VII where I undertake a detailed analysis of realism, according to which realism is recognised as an array of commitments that are best understood as organised within three distinctive and largely independent clusters &#8211; semantic, ontic and epistemic. Finally, in Chapter VIII we are able to effect a productive engagement between realism, understood according to the taxonomic exercise undertaken in Chapter VII, and response-dependence, understood according to the account developed and promoted in Chapters I and II, an engagement that results in a more fine-grained and sophisticated analysis of the prospects for a reconciliation of realism and response-dependence than has yet appeared in the literature.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/364</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecological factors associated with speciation in New Zealand triplefin fishes (Family Tripterygiidae)</field><field name="creator">Wellenreuther, Maren</field><field name="description">Theoretical research has demonstrated that ecological interactions in sympatry or parapatry can generate disruptive selection that in concert with assortative mating can lead to speciation. However, empirical examples are few and restricted to terrestrial and lacustrine systems. New Zealand triplefin fishes (Family Tripterygiidae) are an ideal model system to study speciation in the sea, as they conform to the criteria of an adaptive radiation, being philopatric, speciose and abundant, and having largely sympatric distributions. This thesis investigates two key aspects of the New Zealand triplefin radiation: 1) which ecological traits are under selection?; and 2) which traits are potentially available for the development of assortative mating? Habitat use was identified as a possible key trait for selection and investigated in detail in this thesis. Habitat use of the majority of New Zealand triplefin species was censused quantitatively throughout most of their latitudinal range and analysed using novel statistical methods. Analyses showed that habitat use was highly divergent between species and thus diversification in habitat may have been a major component in the evolution of this clade. The phylogenetic analysis of habitat characters confirmed that there has been rapid evolution in habitat use among species. Habitat selection at settlement was highly species-specific, indicating that interspecific differences in adult habitat use may be the outcome of active habitat choice established at settlement. These species-specific habitat associations showed no evidence for geographic variation in habitat use. Laboratory trials and field observations of the sister-species pair Ruanoho decemdigitatus and R. whero showed that competition was linked with body size, with R. decemdigitatus being the larger and consequently dominant species. The second part of this thesis investigated which traits may have contributed to prezygotic isolation, and thus to assortative mating. Little evidence was found for divergence in breeding season or male colour patterns. However, divergence in habitat affected breeding habitat choice, as triplefins court and mate in the same territory as that occupied year round. This suggests that assortative mating in New Zealand triplefin species could be the by-product of adaptation to habitat resources. Body size affected mate choice and time at first maturity in the Ruanoho sister-species pair, suggesting that size is important in the maintenance of reproductive isolation in these species. Differences in body size may have also lead to assortative mating in other New Zealand triplefin sister-species pairs, as all sister-species pairs differ in maximum body size. The findings of this thesis invoke a strong role for ecologically-based selection in speciation, and support the hypothesis that adaptation to habitat has been a major factor in speciation in this system.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Research Subject Categories::NATURAL SCIENCES::Biology::Terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecology::Marine ecology</field><field name="subject">Research Subject Categories::NATURAL SCIENCES::Biology::Terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecology::Marine ecology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/407</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Laterality and interhemispheric transfer in schizophrenia</field><field name="creator">Barnett, Kylie</field><field name="description">There is a plethora of research describing dysfunction of a single hemisphere (usually the left) in schizophrenia, while there is less evidence to suggest right-hemisphere dysfunction. There is also much evidence to suggest that individuals with schizophrenia have difficulties integrating information between the two cerebral hemispheres or transferring information between the hemispheres. The aim of this thesis was to investigate lateralized and interhemispheric information processing in males with predominantly negative-symptom schizophrenia. This thesis employs behavioural (i.e. computer-based reaction-time tasks), neuropsychological (i.e. the line-bisection task) and electrophysiological (i.e. electroencephalogram) measures to assess laterality and interhemispheric processing in schizophrenia relative to matched controls. In Experiment 1, the Poffenberger (1912) paradigm was used to compare the difference between &#8220;crossed&#8221; (stimuli and motor response areas are contralateral) and &#8220;uncrossed&#8221; (stimuli and motor response areas are ipsilateral) conditions to estimate interhemispheric transfer time. Simple reaction time (RT) was recorded to stimuli presented unilaterally or bilaterally in participants who responded using either the left or right hand. While the results provide no evidence for differences between the groups in information transfer or integration between the hemispheres, the schizophrenia group was significantly slower to respond to LVF stimuli, suggesting right-hemisphere dysfunction. In Experiment 2, bilateral gain was assessed using a lexical-decision task where word or non-word judgments were made to letter strings presented in the LVF, RVF, or BVF. The schizophrenia group showed normal lateralization of language to the left hemisphere, but unlike controls who showed a bilateral gain (decrease in RT), they were actually disadvantaged when two stimuli were presented simultaneously to both hemispheres. In Experiment 3, the linebisection task (see Appendix A) was used to estimate right-hemisphere visuospatial processing. The schizophrenia group showed a rightward bias under certain conditions, for example when lines were positioned on the right side of the page, when the right hand was used, and when a right-to-left scan was adopted suggesting a deficit in the transfer of visuospatial information. In Experiment 4, interhemispheric transfer was investigated using 128-channel EEG as a direct measure. Evoked potentials (EPs) were obtained while participants performed the Poffenberger task. The N160 was measured from homologous occipital sites to assess transfer latency in milliseconds. While controls had faster information transfer from the right hemisphere to the left hemisphere, this asymmetry of transfer was absent in the schizophrenia group who had similar transfer speeds in both directions, i.e. &#8216;symmetry of transfer&#8217;. Similarly, in Experiment 5, the schizophrenia group failed to show faster transfer of linguistic information (words and non-words) from the right hemisphere to the left. In both EEG tasks the schizophrenia group showed a concomitant decrease in the amplitude of the N160 that was marked over the right hemisphere. This suggests that right-hemisphere dysfunction, rather than callosal dysfunction may better explain interhemispheric deficits in schizophrenia. Results are discussed with reference to Miller&#8217;s (1996) hypothesis regarding differences in cerebral hemispheric specialization and axonal conduction delays. These findings suggest that righthemisphere dysfunction may be associated with negative symptoms in males with schizophrenia.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/365</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Speaking up in court: repair and powerless language in New Zealand courtrooms</field><field name="creator">Innes, Bronwen M.</field><field name="description">Law courts purport to be seats of justice, yet there is constant debate about the evenhandedness of that justice and ordinary people&#8217;s access to it. This thesis reports on a study of seven criminal hearings in the District Court in Auckland, New Zealand. The study focussed on repair (as defined in conversation analysis) and various phenomena which have been identified previously as characteristic of &#8220;powerless language&#8221; (that is, the speech used by those in subordinate positions to their social superiors). These phenomena included hesitations, hedges, intensifiers, witnesses asking questions, tag questions, high rising terminal intonation, polite terms, terms of address and well. The results of the analysis have led to two interesting conclusions. First, traditionally linguists have considered repair as a means of dealing with problems. As such, repair itself has often been thought of as a problem. As far as these seven hearings are concerned, it is evident that repair is being used as a highly effective interactional resource in the process of &#8220;coming to an understanding&#8221; which seems to me to be the basis of courtroom interaction. Second, the study calls the notion of powerless language into question. While it is true that many researchers have found that people evaluate powerless language negatively, this study finds that a) the features which have been said to form the powerless style in English are not used only by the powerless people in these hearings and b) these features cannot always or necessarily be said to operate in a powerless manner during the hearings. The analysis has produced a more detailed account of the features and their use than previous studies have achieved. The results show that the notion of powerless language is highly questionable. This in turn means that further study is necessary into how people make judgements on language use and what role such judgements play in the decisions of juries.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/366</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessment of Systemic Blood Flow in the Newborn Infant</field><field name="creator">Groves, Alan Martin</field><field name="description">Preterm infants are vulnerable to brain injury which is thought to be caused partly by abnormalities in cerebral perfusion. However the accurate assessment of cerebral and general systemic perfusion remains a challenge in the newborn infant. Commonly used clinical parameters such as blood pressure and blood lactate concentrations are imperfect predictors of blood flow. Cardiac output measurements used in older children do not reflect true systemic perfusion in the neonate due to shunting of blood through persisting fetal pathways. Echocardiographic measurements of descending aortic (DAo) and superior vena caval (SVC) blood flow may provide more reliable assessment of neonatal systemic perfusion. This thesis evaluates these techniques in the first days of postnatal life. Measures of flow volume in the SVC and DAo were found to be feasible in the vast majority of infants, and were performed without significantly affecting cardiorespiratory status. Assessment of SVC flow volume showed similar repeatability to other measures of blood flow in neonates when assessed by a single observer, as did assessment of velocity of flow in the DAo. We then used these techniques to further assess the transitional circulation, and found no evidence of a positive association between arterial blood pressure and volume of systemic perfusion. Contrary to previous assumptions that ductal shunting compromises systemic perfusion, we found that left ventricular output tended to increase with increasing shunt through the ductus arteriosus, thereby maintaining upper, though not necessarily lower, body perfusion. There was an association between very low levels of flow in individuals and some adverse outcomes that had a strong circulatory component to their pathophysiology (periventricular haemorrhage and necrotising enterocolitis). However low blood flow in the SVC or DAo did not predict poor outcome within the entire cohort. Assessments of SVC and DAo flow in the neonate are feasible, relatively repeatable and have already enhanced our understanding of the pathophysiology of the transitional circulation. These and other techniques to monitor systemic blood flow in the neonate may aid identification of circulatory failure, act as short-term endpoints in clinical trials of interventions supporting the circulation, and eventually improve neurodevelopmental outcome in preterm infants.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/370</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nabokov&#8217;s humor: the play of consciousness</field><field name="creator">Brillinger, Matthew</field><field name="description">Vladimir Nabokov' s fiction, particularly in its later stages, is thoroughly and multifariously humorous, with individual works incorporating large numbers of jokes to tremendous effect, to the point that enjoyment of Nabokov 's art is to some extent indistinguishable from engagement with his humor. Why is Nabokov 's art so robustly funny? Humor theorists, in varied words and with differing degrees of forcefulness, posit humor as necessarily presenting a possibility  - ontological, behavioral, circumstantial, or interpretative  - unforeseen by its audience, as a joke introduces that audience to a surprising entity, action, event or viewpoint. Nabokov, experiencing his own world as ceaselessly surprising, consciously deploys humor as a means of underscoring for readers the infinite possibilities available at each moment, utilizing jokes in the countering of divers types of expectation. Nabokov 's use of humor emerges from a well-considered theory of humor, while also reflecting a singular metaphysics. This thesis, as it maps the relationship between Nabokov 's use and theory of humor, offers a rationale for much of the humor on offer in Nabokov' s art, accounting for that humor by reference not only to its effects and implications but also to its significance in the eyes of Nabokov himself.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/367</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Wandering Jew as a synecdoche of anti-Jewish construction: a psychoanalytic perspective</field><field name="creator">Stroobant, Anthony David</field><field name="description">After around half a century of progress, Jewish-Christian relations seem to have reached a plateau. Among many possible reasons, it appears that good intentions at &#8220;official&#8221; church levels continue to be subverted by traditional Christian supersessionism, especially as manifest in the &#8220;performed&#8221; life of the church, and in relation to Jews and Judaism. The research generates a psychoanalytical understanding of Christian anti-Jewishness complementary to those from other fields, to try to understand more comprehensively its aetiology and why it manifests in such particular ways. The theoretical approach begins with Freud and the British Object Relations school, but includes perspectives from other streams of psychoanalysis, and from contemporary cognitive theory. Utilising an &#8220;applied&#8221; psychoanalytic reading of The Wandering Jew as a synecdoche of Christian anti-Jewishness, the research argues that performance of the church&#8217;s sacred texts (traditionally interpreted in anti-Jewish ways) connects, via unconscious association, with latent primal fears and anxieties of worshippers. It is this regular, uncritical performance of such texts that keeps a largely unconscious, affect-laden, contemporary anti-Jewishness alive. Understanding that &#8220;bodies&#8221; can bear powerful meanings, the research investigates the person of The Wandering Jew as a Christian anti-Jewish construction, and uncovers a number of psychoanalytically significant themes which closely relate to issues of human development. All of this, taken together, helps explain why Christian anti-Jewishness is often so passionately irrational, palpably incarnate, deep-rooted and difficult to educate against. The research concludes with two theoretical reflections. The first explores whether the idea of the analytic third might help towards a better understanding of the potency of Christian anti-Jewish fantasy. The second is a discussion of whether it is helpful, given anti- Jewishness is no longer generally understood as &#8220;psychopathological&#8221;, to think instead of Christian anti-Jewish construction as taking place on neurotic islands having cultures of narcissism and paranoia. The main implication of the research is that the church needs to take responsibility for its own anti-Jewishness which is what, in essence, is currently subverting better Jewish- Christian relations.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/369</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structural Genomics of Mycobacterium tuberculosis</field><field name="creator">Johnston, Jodie Margaret</field><field name="description">In 1998 the genome sequence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv was published1.  M. tuberculosis is the primary causative agent of tuberculosis, a disease with a long history in humans, which still has a great impact on human mortality today.  As part of the M. tuberculosis Structural Genomics Consortium we selected nine target genes (Rv0534c (menA); Rv0548c (menB); Rv0553 (menC); Rv0555 (menD); Rv0542c (menE); Rv3853 (menG); Rv0558 (ubiE); Rv0989c (grcC2) and Rv0990c) from M. tuberculosis, including all known members of the menaquinone biosynthesis pathway, for structural studies.  All nine genes were taken through the structural genomics &#8220;pipeline&#8221;, either becoming stuck at various &#8220;bottlenecks&#8221; or continuing successfully to structure solution.  At the initial bioinformatics analysis step, eight of the nine targeted genes were deemed suitable for further study.  PCR amplification and cloning of these genes into several different expression vectors followed.  Expression of the gene products for the seven successfully cloned genes was undertaken in an E. coli expression host, followed by experiments (refolding, lysis buffer and expression temperature screens) aimed at obtaining soluble protein in sufficient quantities for crystallisation.  Of the seven proteins successfully overexpressed, five remain at this stage as they could not be obtained in soluble form.  The remaining two, Rv3853 (MenG), solubilised by refolding, and MenB, solubilised by 24&#186;C expression, were purified and both successfully produced diffracting crystals.  The crystal structure of Rv3853 was determined by isomorphous replacement (SIRAS) and refined at 1.9 &#197; resolution (R = 19.0% and Rfree = 22.0%).  The structure of several different crystal forms of MenB, were determined by molecular replacement.  Refinement of two of these structures, MenB_P43212 at 2.15&#197; resolution (R = 20.3% and Rfree = 23.1%) and MenB_C2-NCoA at 2.3 &#197; resolution (R = 19.7% and Rfree = 22.5%), has been completed. The structure of Rv3853, combined with the discovery that UbiE was more likely to catalyse the final, S-adenosylmethionine-dependent, methyltransfer step of menaquinone biosynthesis, led to the conclusion that Rv3853 had been misannotated as MenG.  Combined with further bioinformatics analysis the Rv3853 structure has been useful in providing new ideas as to the real function of Rv3853.  In contrast, the structure of MenB confirmed its place as a member of the crotonase superfamily although the C-terminus was located in a position not observed in other crotonase superfamily structures.  Several flexible regions likely to be important in MenB function have been identified by examination of the various MenB structures</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Structural genomics</field><field name="subject">tuberculosis</field><field name="subject">Mycobacterium tuberculosis</field><field name="subject">menaquinone biosynthesis</field><field name="subject">protein structure</field><field name="subject">biological sciences</field><field name="subject">structural biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/379</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Antenna Selection and Deployment Strategies for Indoor Wireless Communication Systems</field><field name="creator">Wong, Alex H. C.</field><field name="description">Effective antenna selection and deployment strategies are important for reducing co-channel interference in indoor wireless systems. Low-cost solutions are essential, and strategies that utilise simple antennas (such as directional patches) are advantageous from this perspective. However, performance is always an issue and the improvements achievable through clever antenna deployment need to be quantified. In this thesis, an experimental investigation of indoor propagation comparing the performance of directional antennas and multiple-element arrays (MEAs) with omni-directional antennas is reported. Estimation of the performance of a direct sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) system operating in a variety of deployment scenarios allows the identification of a range of performance-limiting factors and the optimal deployment strategies.  It is shown that the orientation of single-element directional antennas can significantly impact on system performance compared to omni-directional antennas in traditional systems. The deployment of MEAs with an active diversity combining scheme can further improve system performance by more than one order of magnitude. From the perspective of system planning, the choice of antenna selection and deployment options depends on the current and future demand for system performance and the financial resources available. An evolutionary path has been proposed to provide a smooth transition from conventional (low-cost) to high-performance (high-cost) antenna systems as demand dictates. Other performance-limiting factors in indoor wireless systems include the physical environment and external interference. It is also shown that electromagnetically-opaque obstacles in the environment can amplify the effectiveness of the antenna deployment by acting as physical zone boundaries that restrict interference. External interference has been shown to cause a significant degradation to the performance of an indoor system when the carrier-to-external-interference ratio (CEIR) is below 30 dB. This performance degradation can be minimised by appropriate antenna deployment, although the optimum antenna orientations depends on the strength of the external interference.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Radiowave propagation</field><field name="subject">Indoor radio</field><field name="subject">Directive antennas</field><field name="subject">Interference suppression</field><field name="subject">Measurement</field><field name="subject">Rician channels</field><field name="subject">Systems analysis</field><field name="subject">Wireless CDMA</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/432</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cartographies of childhood : mapping the modern/global child</field><field name="creator">Duhn, Iris</field><field name="description">Childhood in western societies is apparently at risk. In a globalised, interconnected world, &#8216;the child&#8217; is in danger of loosing its innocence too early &#8211; ideal childhood seems under threat like never before. In this thesis I argue that concerns over childhood and the ideal child are nothing new. Questions over what ideal childhood looks like have preoccupied the social and political imagination for centuries. Taking a poststructural approach, I investigate how childhood and the western modern child have been produced discursively. I argue that the modern child has been shaped by political rationalities that emphasise the child&#8217;s potential as resource &#8211; the ideal child is the child with promise. This ideal child is governed through its Other, the child as/at risk who marks the boundaries of ideal childhood. Modern childhood as a domain has been structured by the tensions that are created between the child with promise and the child as risk. The contemporary preoccupation with childhood is embedded in wider social, cultural and political shifts in postmodern/late-industrial society. It is the modern ideal of childhood that is at risk. This study takes an interdisciplinary approach to childhood studies to map the transformation of childhood over time. I argue that changes in contemporary discourses of childhood are effects of changes in political rationality.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/375</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"Turning the stone of being": Migrant Poetics in the Novels of Janet Frame</field><field name="creator">Haarhaus, Isabel</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/382</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Automatic Planning and Optimisation of In-building CDMA Systems</field><field name="creator">Wong, Joseph</field><field name="description">The placement of base stations is an important issue in planning wireless systems because it has a significant influence on overall system performance. In order to achieve good performance in an interference limited CDMA system, a large number of variables must be considered simultaneously during the planning stage. A traditional manual planning approach that involves an iterative application of analysis may not produce satisfactory results since it can only consider a small number of variables simultaneously. This thesis proposes the use of automatic optimisation that allows more variables to be considered and more solutions to be examined within the same time period. This thesis aims to produce a unique framework for creating an automatic optimisation tool for solving the CDMA base station placement problem. This framework contains a number of mathematical models that describe various deployment scenarios and a number of customised optimisation algorithms that solve these models. Although the work presented in this thesis does not result in a complete design tool, the findings are expected to provide a solid foundation for the development of such a tool. During the course of study, a number of issues associated with the proposed planning approach have been discussed and some future research directions have been identified. The results from the example problems have shown that automatic optimisation has the potential to reduce the planning time significantly, assess system performance accurately and utilise limited resources efficiently. These benefits certainly confirm the need for such a tool and reinforce the importance of the work documented in this thesis.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Optimisation</field><field name="subject">linear programming</field><field name="subject">wireless</field><field name="subject">communications</field><field name="subject">interference</field><field name="subject">CDMA</field><field name="subject">base stations</field><field name="subject">planning</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/434</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Self-reflexivity and the construction of subjectivity in contemporary French cinema: Alain Resnais</field><field name="creator">Walker, Deborah A.</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT This study uses the work of French filmmaker, Alain RESNAIS (1922 - ) to examine the role of self-reflexivity in the construction of subjectivity within contemporary French cinema (from 1958 to the present day). Close analysis of self-reflexivity in its various forms - mise en abyme, intertextuality, the foregrounding of cinematographic and narrative conventions - reveals the construction of a new form of subjectivity. The self-reflexive gaze, in the films of Resnais as in such other &#8220;modernist&#8221; French filmmakers as Godard, Duras and Robbe-Grillet, constructs a decentred, fissured subject. This process is particularly evident in Resnais&#8217; subversion of mise en abyme, which, from a reflection in miniature of the work, becomes a refraction, a mise en &#233;cart that points toward both the alterity and the absence of origin at the heart of subjectivity. I propose that self-reflexivity in Resnais participates in a philosophical, deconstructive enterprise which serves to question the metaphysics of presence and explore the limits of representation and subjectivity. His work asks whether the subject is a free, self-constituting self-present agent or whether it is constructed by the Other, and to what extent this subject, whether author, character or spectator, can access or represent truth or reality. From Resnais&#8217; early work on, I argue, reality is shown to be, always, already, the result of a process of mediation by a subject also in process (en proc&#232;s), both constituted and constituting. Moreover, implicit in this view of subjectivity is an ethical injunction that closely relates to Derrida&#8217;s impossible ethics of deconstruction. Here the thesis aims to demonstrate that the radical questioning of the notion of the subject in Resnais closely parallels, and indeed, even anticipates the redrawing of the limits of subjectivity by contemporary structuralist and post-structuralist thought (late 1950s - early 1970s). For whereas the positivist, humanist subject of theory must die before it can be reborn in another form, in Resnais the process of transformation is immediate: a linguistic and an ethical turn take place in the same moment. The absence of grand narratives does not project the subject into a post-modern void. Thus, I argue that Resnais&#8217; self-reflexive film practice can serve as an innovative and positive model of post-modern subjectivity.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">fr</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/378</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gee's territory: Pakeha society in the fiction of Maurice Gee</field><field name="creator">Dugdale, Sarah</field><field name="description">This thesis offers a detailed reading of the adult fiction of the New Zealand writer Maurice Gee in order to examine their representations of a settler community in a post-colonial society. The works of social historians, political economists and sociologists are used to make relevant connections between events and attitudes in the actual world and those portrayed in the novels. Observations are made on the overall condition of the Pakeha in New Zealand society at the end of the millennium. The Introduction discusses the current understanding of the post-settler position in post-colonial theory, and explains the use in the thesis of the term Pakeha to describe this position. The body of the thesis is divided into five chapters that roughly correspond with the final decades of the twentieth century. Each chapter discusses the two or three novels Maurice Gee published in each decade, starting with the little known novels from the 1960s, The Big Season and A Special Flower, and concluding with the three novels published during the 1990s. Working from the premise that the acknowledgement and understanding of the settler position is an important responsibility of the modern post-colonial society, the thesis argues that Gee's novels are a profound expression of the settler position in contemporary New Zealand, and that the uncertainty and hesitation revealed in each of them reflect a cultural anxiety underlying the settler consciousness. In the bibliography Gee's novels are acknowledged as the primary resource of the thesis, and the numerous books, articles, reviews and essays used to support the ideas proposed in the thesis &#8211; literary, historical, economic and sociological &#8211; are presented as secondary sources.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/380</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regulation of the noradrenaline transporter in a model neuronal cell line: effects of cell signalllng pathways and the tricyclic antidepressant drug, desipramine</field><field name="creator">Wong, Chi Yan</field><field name="description">The noradrenaline transporter (NAT) is found in presynaptic noradrenergic nerve terminals. It regulates noradrenergic neurotransmission by mediating reuptake of noradrenaline (NA) from the synapse. The NAT is inhibited by the tricyclic antidepressant agent, desipramine (DMI). While a single dose of DMI rapidly inhibits noradrenaline reuptake, repeated administration is required for therapeutic effects. This thesis aimed to investigate whether DMI has cellular effects in addition to the inhibition of the NAT. To research this hypothesis, the effect of DMI on protein expression and regulation of the NAT in cultured neuronal cells was investigated. Short-term DMI treatment was shown to increase the expression of phosphorylated CREB in several mammalian neuronal cell lines, as shown by immunocytochemistry. These results were confirmed by western blotting in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, but not for the other cell lines. Short-term DMI treatment also appeared to augment the expression of phosphorylated substrates of PKC and MAPK, as investigated by western blotting with kinase specific phospho-protein antibodies. However, there did not appear to be phosphoproteins expressed specifically in response to DMI. To study the regulation of the NAT, a stable human noradrenergic neuroblastoma cell line, SY5Y cells transfected to express a GFP-NAT fusion protein, was produced for this thesis work. SY5Y-GFP-NAT cells displayed a 3-5 fold increase in [3H]noradrenaline uptake with GFP-fluorescence localized to the plasma membrane. The level of GFP-NAT expression was sufficient for biotinylation analysis of surface NAT expression. SY5Y-GFP-NAT cells treated with the PKC activator &#946;-PMA showed a significant reduction in both [3H]noradrenaline uptake and surface GFP-NAT expression, confirming that the cell line was suitable for studies of NAT regulation. Treatment with muscarinic receptor agonists was found to reduce NAT activity. This effect was abolished by the depletion of PKC activity, suggesting that the signalling pathway involved PKC. Unlike the effect of &#946;-PMA, muscarinic agonists did not affect cell surface NAT expression. Regulation of the NAT by the insulin signalling pathway was investigated in SY5Y-GFPNAT cells. Insulin treatment robustly increased [3H]noradrenaline uptake, an effect blocked by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein. Genistein treatment alone significantly reduced noradrenaline uptake, suggesting insulin receptor tyrosine kinase regulated basal NAT activity. Further investigations suggested that insulin-dependent regulation of the NAT involved cross-talk between PKC and PI3K signalling pathways. DMI treatment of 1 to 3 days was shown to reduce cell surface NAT expression in the SY5Y-GFP-NAT cells. This was detected both by GFP fluorescence and surface protein biotinylation. Increased intracellular GFP-NAT was also observed in DMI-treated cells. GFP-NAT associated mostly with recycling endosomes after 1-day of DMI treatment, as shown by co-localization with transferrin conjugated to Alexa-568. GFP-NAT became associated with late endosomes and lysosomes after 2 &#8211; 3 days of DMI treatment. A model was developed to explain the effect of DMI on the cellular trafficking of the NAT. This research clearly demonstrated a novel finding, that the tricyclic antidepressant drug DMI, affects the cellular distribution of the NAT in the SY5Y-GFP-NAT model cell-line. While specific changes in protein expression in response to DMI were not found, it appears likely that regulation of the NAT by DMI treatment involves cell signalling pathways and post-translational protein modification. The SY5Y-GFP-NAT cell, developed during this research, is a novel cell-line that has proved its value for studies of the regulation and trafficking of the NAT. This cell line should be useful for future studies of potential transporter-protein interactions and additional studies of the cellular actions of DMI.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/381</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Accident or Design?

After giving a series of performances of the work, the author became convinced that this latter view must be incorrect, and that Bach left the work unfinished deliberately. This thesis explores this idea in detail and, by presenting a number of new theories, suggests not only that Bach left the work unfinished deliberately as an invitation to the reader, student or performer to work out his or her own completion, but also that he left a number of clues, hidden to a greater or lesser extent, to indicate that that was his intention and to supply vital information about the content of the missing bars.   Divided into two parts, the thesis first considers some of the evidence contained within the manuscript itself, up to and including the final written bar, and then in the second part goes on to consider two essential aspects of the completion.   By way of introduction, the first chapter surveys the controversial area of Bach&#8217;s use of numbers in his music and draws attention to the number of the final bar, which can be interpreted as a clue to the fact that Bach expects the music to be continued.   Chapter Two invites a reconsideration of Christoph Wolff&#8217;s famous &#8220;Fragment X&#8221; theory, which suggests that the continuation of the final fugue was written on a separate, now lost, piece of paper. Many inconsistencies and details in the manuscript suggest strongly that Wolff&#8217;s theory is incorrect. As part of this theory, the author reports on his own examination of the original manuscript in Berlin.   Chapter Three, through a detailed study of the architecture of the final fugue, makes the bold claim that the author has definitively proved the exact number of bars required to complete the music in accordance with Bach&#8217;s intentions: this theory develops and refines the work of Gregory Butler in this area, and, to corroborate the theory, presents a possible interpretation of the unusual markings at the end of Bach&#8217;s score and of a significant correction made by Bach in his manuscript.   Finally, in Chapter Four, the question of the proposed inverted combination of all four fugue subjects is revisited &#8211; a combination that several writers have claimed to be impossible &#8211; and a new and convincing solution to this problem is presented and justified.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bach</field><field name="subject">Art of Fugue</field><field name="subject">Counterpoint</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/392</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Political participation of "Asian" New Zealanders : a case study of ethnic Chinese and Korean New Zealanders</field><field name="creator">Park, Shee-Jeong</field><field name="description">Politics is a numbers game. Having sufficient numbers is a prerequisite for any ethnic minority group to have political influence in a host country. But numbers are only a prerequisite &#8211; numbers do not automatically increase the group&#8217;s political power. Individual members of the group need to have sufficient resources, interest, knowledge, and the confidence to participate in politics in order for the group to transform its numbers into political power. Having strong ethnic communities and political parties that actively seek out minority voters can also facilitate this process by encouraging ethnic minority groups to participate in politics. But even with the right combination of these individual and community factors, without a liberal institutional structure which facilitates political participation, it would be difficult for any minority group to have adequate political representation in a host country. A study on the political participation of Asian New Zealanders proves that understanding ethnic minority groups&#8217; political participation is a complex yet interesting issue, which challenges various aspects of traditional theories on political participation. This thesis is a first in many ways. The thesis introduces Asians for the first time into the literature that seeks to explain what factors influence the political participation of people living in New Zealand. The thesis also introduces Asian New Zealanders for the first time into the international literature that seeks to explain what factors influence the political participation of Asian immigrants in Western democratic countries. The findings of the survey conducted as a part of the thesis indicate that Asian New Zealanders, as the newest and most rapidly growing segment of New Zealand society, provide an important and unique insight into our understanding of political participation, and that Asian New Zealanders are set to emerge as even more important players in New Zealand politics in the coming decade.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/393</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Management Rhetoric as Performance, Perspective and Persuasion: A Scriptive Reading of Management Theory Texts</field><field name="creator">Monin, Nanette</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/383</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Property Rights in Environmental Resources</field><field name="creator">Sheard, Murray</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the nature of property rights over environmentally sensitive resources and develops a new conception of property in these resources. It has implications for the design of property law, environmental law, and the ethical responsibilities of business in the use of resources. I pursue this project by examining arguments employed in the defence of the institution of private property. These arguments are, on one hand, the &#8220;original appropriation&#8221; arguments of John Locke (1632&#8211;1704) and modern versions of this, that appeal to ownership of one&#8217;s labour and, on the other hand, arguments that appeal to utility and economic efficiency. I show how the central intuitions of these arguments can be used to construct a theory of property in environmental resources. I argue that property rights do not conceptually conflict with duties of preservation and that they admit of more environmentally motivated restrictions than is often thought. They do not license uses that contribute unjustifiably to environmental hazards or that lower environmental quality below certain minimums. Government interventions in the form of land use planning, monitoring, and other activities are justified in principle. The public retains a say on legal limits to property use, reflecting the interest of the community. The conception of property that arises is a form of private ownership with an element of stewardship. I argue that this conception better captures the moral reasons that justify property than does a traditional &#8220;full liberal&#8221; conception. The account is sensitive to a plurality of justifying principles and a range of object types and gives flexibility within a property regime. It rewards labour and productivity while curbing the more destructive potential of unrestricted rights. I conclude the thesis with an application to the issue of climate change. I show that this conception of property gives the flexibility needed if necessary restraints on emissions are not to clash severely with property rights. I develop a proposal for fairly distributing the burdens of climate change mitigation.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/384</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Out for the count: the last alternative state high school in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Vaughan, Karen</field><field name="description">This thesis is based on a five-year case study of Auckland Metropolitan College ("Metro"), the only state-funded alternative secondary school in New Zealand. At the time of writing in September 2001, the school teeters on the brink of closure after the eighth negative Education Review Office (ERO) report in eight years. Metro appears to exemplify many neo-liberal principles in education - choice, freedom, lifelong learning, and flexibility - which are considered integral to the "effective school". However its position as a sink (and market safety valve) for unwanted students from other schools, as well as its long history without any official clarification of its status as alternative within the New Zealand education system, positions the school as a danger at the margins of mainstream schooling. Metro's apparent inability to function "properly" within a framework that includes notions of the "good (professional) teacher", the "good (enterprising) student", and the "good (effective) school" is examined against a number of current neo-liberal educational discourses and concepts including teacher professionalism, classroom management, school effectiveness, the exercise of "proper" consumer choice, and the market place of "at risk" students. The thesis re-situates the site of struggles away from the school, teachers, students andfor ERO per se, moving the focus to the narratives of the teachers, students, and ERO. A "post-structural ethnography" is built by combining some aspects of traditional ethnographic methodology with post-structural questions about meaning and historical specificity, moving beyond the ethnographic imperative of getting to the "real story" (Britzman 1995) into a new role of "making the familiar strange rather than the strange familiar" (Van Maanen 1995: 20). In particular Foucault's work on governmental power relations is used as an account of liberalism and neo-liberalism to problematise the current discursive framework in New Zealand education. The framework is explored as a "tricky combination in the same political structures of individualisation techniques and of totalisation procedures" (Foucault 1982: 2 13) and shows how Metro is inevitably a failing school.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/385</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characteristics of Teacher Expertise</field><field name="creator">Davis, Alison</field><field name="description">This study explores characteristics of teacher expertise associated with raising the reading comprehension achievement of year low achieving year 5&#8211;9 students. It reports on the first year of a three year research and development collaboration between researchers and teachers in six different schools situated within a New Zealand Ministry of Education schooling improvement initiative. The project&#8217;s objective has been the deliberate identification of teacher and student needs, the analysis and collaborative use of this information by the researcher and participant teachers to identify characteristics of comprehension teaching that raise student achievement in reading comprehension and identify characteristics of teacher expertise in reading comprehension instruction. In particular, this research is concerned with developing, using and evaluating pedagogical approaches to comprehension strategy instruction in a way that is clearly linked for teachers to the reading comprehension achievement data of the students they teach. The study developed over three phases using action research methodology. At each phase the researcher systematically observed, analysed and enhanced teachers&#8217; expertise and instructional practices associated with improvements in underachieving students&#8217; comprehension. Three sources of data were gathered at each of the three phases to inform the action research. These were data from participating teachers through taped, transcribed and coded interviews, researcher in-class observation (videoed and coded); and student reading comprehension achievement assessment data, gathered through the Supplementary Test of Reading Comprehension &#8211; STAR; (Elley, 2001a, 2001b). Data gathered from the first phase indicated a high proportion of students were underachieving in areas of sentence comprehension, paragraph comprehension and vocabulary. By contrast, teachers believed they were doing a &#8220;good&#8221; job in teaching reading comprehension. Analysis of this mismatch indicated that the following characteristics of teaching and learning in comprehension were not evident: the in-depth analysis and use of student data to inform reading comprehension programs and the successive selection of appropriate teaching approaches, resources and activities; teacher and student analysis and use of formative assessment practices to raise achievement; the importance of taking a strategic approach to comprehension teaching that provided teachers with ways to support and develop both strategic and student centred processing of text, and the critical role of explicit comprehension strategy instruction. This analysis informed the ensuing collaborative approach to professional development in which researchers and teachers jointly developed an ongoing process of analysing and responding to student achievement data to inform instructional strategies, theoretical ideas and practices. The study focused on four main areas of teacher expertise identified through research as critical to raising the reading comprehension achievement of low achieving students. These were teacher knowledge of literacy learning in reading comprehension; teacher knowledge of effective reading comprehension approaches with a specific focus on developing teaching practice specific to low achieving comprehenders; teacher knowledge of analysis and use of student reading comprehension achievement data, and teacher collaboration and problem solving associated with issues of low reading comprehension achievement amongst students in participant teachers&#8217; classrooms. The study concluded that each of these four components were essential characteristics of teacher expertise associated with raising the reading comprehension achievement of low achieving students in years 5-9. As teacher knowledge of literacy learning developed so too did teacher expertise in instructional practice and their ability to analyse areas of student underachievement. The study further found that when ongoing professional learning is evidenced based changes can occur in levels of teacher expertise that result in improved levels of student achievement.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/391</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Experience of Psychosis: Fragmentation, Invalidation and Spirituality</field><field name="creator">Geekie, Jim</field><field name="description">This study is a qualitative investigation into the subjective experience of psychosis as expressed by clients of a first episode psychosis service in psychotherapy sessions. Fifteen participants, already engaged with the author in his clinical role, were recruited for this study. Recordings were made of psychotherapy sessions where participants  subjective experience of psychosis was being discussed as part of the normal course of therapy. Sixty two recordings were made in total, with a mean of 4.1 recordings with each participant. Transcriptions of recordings were made by the author and analysed using Grounded Theory. Commonalities in the data were identified and sorted into categories. Relationships between these categories were explored. Initial analyses yielded 103 distinct categories, which were subsumed under the general headings of Storytelling and Authoring, Causes of Psychosis, Descriptions of Psychotic Experience, Impact of Experience, Responses to and Coping with Experience, Spirituality, and M&#257;ori Issues. Subsequent analysis yielded three theoretical constructs which capture the essence of the subjective experience of psychosis: fragmentation   integration, invalidation  validation, and spirituality. Fragmentation   integration relates a sense of a loosening (or, less often, tightening) of connections and associations between aspects of experience, and applies to the personal and interpersonal domains. Validation   invalidation refers to the sense of having (or not having) confidence in one s ability to accurately perceive or construe experience and to convey this to self and others. Spirituality refers to an inclination to view the experience of psychosis, or aspects of it, in terms of a broad framework of meaning pertaining to how the individual views his or her relationship with the universe. Findings from this research indicate that those who experience psychosis are eager to explore the meanings of their experience and are competent at reflecting on this experience based on their own subjective experience. Important contributions to our understandings of psychosis can be made by those who have such first-hand acquaintance with psychosis. Theoretical, research, clinical and training implications of this research are discussed.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/705</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Churchman: a study of James Michael Liston, bishop of Auckland 1920-70</field><field name="creator">Reid, Nicholas Evan</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the life of James Michael Liston (1881-1976), ordained priest 1904, rector of Holy Cross College, Mosgiel 1910-20, Coadjutor-Bishop of Auckland 1920-29, Bishop of Auckland 1929-70, Archbishop from 1954. While Liston was never metropolitan of the Catholic Church in New Zealand, his longevity and the initiatives he took made him for many years the church&#8217;s most visible spokesman. As mentor and teacher of most of the hierarchy, he was widely regarded as the country&#8217;s Catholic &#8220;patriarch&#8221;. The thesis explores Liston&#8217;s personal and cultural inheritance as the New Zealand-born son of expatriate Irish parents. His involvement in Irish-related controversies is examined, including his trial for sedition in 1922. However it is a major contention of this thesis that Liston&#8217;s primary focus was always the welfare of the Catholic Church in New Zealand and in the diocese of Auckland. &#8216;Romanita&#8217; and loyalty to the Vatican were more important than residual Irishness. For each phase of Liston&#8217;s priesthood and episcopate, the thesis examines Liston&#8217;s relationship with diocesan clergy, religious orders, Catholic laity and the general public. Some aspects of Liston&#8217;s behaviour and management style are open to criticism. His rejection by Dunedin clergy (1918-20) and his conflict with Bishop Cleary (1923-29) suggest limitations to his character. His differences with younger clergy in the 1960s suggest that old age affected his judgement. Nevertheless, for most of his career, Liston was an effective and compassionate church leader at a time when the diocese of Auckland became the largest diocese in the country. Necessarily, much detail is given to the administrative processes by which the diocese was developed. James Michael Liston operated on the hierarchical assumptions that were then the episcopal norm. He was essentially a Churchman.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/390</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterising GIGANTEA interactors: the BELL-LIKE HOMEODOMAIN 3 and BELL-LIKE HOMEODOMAIN 10 proteins</field><field name="creator">Milich, Raechel Jean</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT The ability to detect and respond to environmental signals is fundamental in coordinating floral induction in plants to favourable conditions. An important flowering time cue is day length and it is proposed that light signals are perceived and measured by an interaction between photoreceptors and an internal pacemaker, the circadian clock. The control of flowering has been best characterised in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana L. Heynh (Arabidopsis). The GIGANTEA (GI) gene has a complex role in both the promotion of flowering in response to photoperiod and the regulation of the circadian clock. The expression of GI is under circadian control and is affected by day length, light quality and temperature changes. The GI protein is also circadian regulated and is actively degraded in the dark. The biochemical function of GI is unknown and one method to elucidate the role of this protein is to identify protein interactors. The aim of this thesis project was to characterise proteins that interacted with GI. Previously, the BELL-LIKE HOMEODOMAIN 3 (BLH3) protein was identified as a putative GI protein interactor. As part of this thesis work, yeast 2-hybrid and in vitro pull down assays were utilised to confirm the interaction between GI and BLH3. Sequence and phylogenetic analyses were used to further examine the BELL family of proteins. The BELL-LIKE HOMEODOMAIN 10 (BLH10) protein was found to be closely related to BLH3 and also interacted with GI. Reverse 2-hybrid assays were used to determine the regions or domains within the GI, BLH3 and BLH10 proteins required to mediate protein interactions. Expression assays established that the BLH3 and BLH10 transcripts were present throughout plant tissues and times of development. Further analyses revealed that BLH3 and BLH10 are not directly regulated by the circadian clock. The results of GFP expression assays demonstrated that the BLH3 protein is localised to the nucleus in plant cells. Transgenic blh3 and blh10 mutant plants were identified and analysed for flowering and light response phenotypes. BLH3 and BLH10 do not function with GI in the photoperiodic pathway to control flowering, yet the blh3 and blh10 mutants do have a flowering phenotype in short day conditions. Like gi, the blh3 and blh10 mutants exhibited exaggerated hypocotyl elongation in response to red and low light conditions. These results are suggestive of a role for BLH3, BLH10 and GI in flowering and deetiolation responses to specific light conditions in plants.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">flowering, Arabidopsis, protein interaction</field><field name="subject">plant molecular biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/417</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular Quest for Avirulence Factors in Venturia inaequalis</field><field name="creator">Win, Joe</field><field name="description">The molecular basis for the gene-for-gene relationship of Vm-resistance in apple to Venturia inaequalis was investigated. Incompatible reactions involved a hypersensitive response (HR), which was accompanied by the accumulation of dark brown pigments and autofluorescent materials in epidermal and mesophyll cells at the site of invasion. Cell-free culture filtrates of the avirulent isolate elicited an HR in the Vm host (h5) leaves, but not in the susceptible host (h1). The elicitor activity was resistant to boiling but was abolished by proteinase K digestion. Elicitation of HR was used to monitor purification of the avirulence factor, AVRVm, from liquid cultures of the avirulent isolate following ultrafiltration, acetone precipitation and ion-exchange chromatography. The purest fraction contained three major proteins all with low isoelectric points (pI 3.0-4.5). The fraction also elicited HR on the differential host h4, but not on other resistant hosts (h2, h3 and h6) tested. Three candidate AVRVm proteins were identified and amino acid sequences were obtained using Edman degradation and mass spectrometry. Nucleotide sequences corresponding to these proteins were found in databases of V. inaequalis expressed sequence tags. There were no polymorphisms evident between avirulent and virulent isolates (representing races 1 and 5 respectively) either at genomic DNA or cDNA level of the full open reading frames. RT-PCR revealed that all genes were expressed in both avirulent and virulent isolates during in vitro and in planta growth. All three genes showed similar levels of expression between avirulent and virulent isolates during their in vitro growth. However, preliminary RT-PCR experiments showed that two of these genes were likely to be expressed at lower levels in the virulent compared with the avirulent isolate during compatible infection. Implications of this difference in expression and the future experiments to identify the genuine AvrVm gene were discussed.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Avirulence, Apple Scab, Venturia Inaequalis, Gene-for-Gene</field><field name="subject">Plant Pathology, Molecular Plant-Microbe Interactions</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/397</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Medical decisions at the end of life that hasten death</field><field name="creator">Mitchell, Kay</field><field name="description">Medical decisions at the end of life (MDELs) that have the potential to hasten death are increasingly prevalent in medical practice given (a) an aging population and (b) the increase in medical technology that allows life to be sustained beyond what it could be in the past and sometimes beyond what may be comfortable for the patient. When a decision is made to introduce life-sustaining interventions this may imply a later decision to halt these. Attitudes towards medical decisions that hasten death were explored among Greypower members, 55+ years (N = 595), Psychology students, 29 years and under (N = 205) and General Practitioners, 70 years and under (N = 120) in Auckland, New Zealand. Vignette scenarios were used related to withdrawing and withholding life support and nutrition and hydration, denying dialysis to a requesting patient, increasing medication to address pain at the risk of hastening death, physician supplying information, drugs, physician assisting patient to take drugs and physician giving a lethal injection to a terminally ill patient with intractable pain, on request and physician providing assisted death to a requesting tetraplegic patient. The effect of age of patient and consent on decision-making was also explored. Greypower members and Doctors had similar attitudes towards MDELs that are legal in New Zealand but over three-quarters of the Greypower members judged physician-assisted death for a terminally ill patient as justified compared to only one third of the Doctors. Psychology students were more conservative than either the Greypower members or the Doctors for all judgments related to the justifiability of MDELs. There appear to be underlying philosophical differences in the approaches to end of life decision-making by the three groups with Psychology students favouring a Sanctity of Life position and General Practitioners favouring the Status Quo. Greypower members appear to have a pragmatic approach to end of life care that does not favour one position over another. A second study adapted the questionnaire used in Holland in 1990 by the Remmelink Commission of Inquiry exploring the incidence of MDELs among general practitioners in New Zealand (N = 1255). Results indicate that 63% of general practitioners had made an MDEL for the last patient who died in their practice in the previous twelve months. Practitioners could select more than one action for this patient and taking into account the probability that the end of life would be hastened, 37.2% had withheld treatment, 28.8% had withdrawn treatment and 84.9% had increased medication to relieve pain. Medication to relieve pain or other symptoms was increased in part with the intention of hastening the end of life by 24.8% of practitioners. Actions were taken with the explicit purpose of not prolonging life or hastening the end of life and death was caused by withholding treatment 18.7%, withdrawing treatment 10.2% and prescribing, supplying or administering a drug 5.6%. In 54.8% cases, there was no discussion with the patient prior to the action taken, although in some of these cases a wish had been expressed by the patient at a previous time to have death hastened. Of the 39 cases where a drug was supplied or administered with the explicit intention of hastening death and death occurred, the drug was administered by a nurse alone in 15 cases (under physician orders, implied in the question) and the physician alone in 13 cases. In two cases the patient selfadministered the drug. In order to assess the impact of euthanasia (arguably at the extreme end of the MDEL continuum) on practitioners, a qualitative study was conducted to explore the accounts of ten Dutch doctors who had cared for dying patients, five who had performed euthanasia and five who had not. Themes were compared and contrasted to expose similarities and differences in the approaches of the two groups to patient care. Both groups endorsed palliative care as the preferred approach to the care of the dying patient. Those who had not performed euthanasia expressed their commitment to the patient in continued exploration of palliative options and a stated commitment of non-abandonment of the patient. Those who had performed euthanasia portrayed this action as the &#147;ultimate commitment&#148; to the patient, no other option being seen as meeting patient need. The effect on the doctor of performing euthanasia was intense. Other medical decisions at the end of life that hasten death such as terminal sedation or withdrawing nutrition and hydration were posited by the doctors who had performed euthanasia to be analogous to euthanasia, and the psychological effect on the doctor was similar. Those who had not performed euthanasia stated that these actions were not the same as euthanasia. Dissonance theory was used to explore why the two groups may portray their actions that hasten death in different ways.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/395</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inter-market linkages : a study of the relationship between the bank bill and the bank bill futures markets in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Poskitt, Russell</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the linkages between the bank bill market and the bank bill futures market in New Zealand using intraday data. The thesis is motivated primarily by the dearth of research on inter-market linkages in interest rate markets using high frequency data. The thesis examines four aspects of the inter-market linkage: (i) the pricing of the bank bill futures contract; (ii) inter-market arbitrage opportunities; (iii) evidence of arbitrage activity, and (iv) inter-market information transmission. The key to the empirical work on these four issues is a model of bill futures pricing developed using the no-arbitrage approach and an intraday data set provided by Reuters and the New Zealand Futures and Options Exchange. The empirical work yields the following findings:  &#8226; the implied forward rate (IFR) model performs well in pricing the bill futures contract. The futures/IFR differential is negligible compared to that documented in many prior studies. The performance of the IFR model is attributed to the fact that it mirrors the favoured quasi-arbitrage strategies of the price-setting interbank dealers.  &#8226; quasi-arbitrage opportunities are infrequent and substantially less profitable than prior studies report. This is also the case when the stringent requirements for conventional arbitrage are relaxed. The frequency and profitability of quasi-arbitrage opportunities are on a par with those reported in the stock index futures and foreign exchange markets.  &#8226; arbitrage opportunities exert only a weak equilibriating influence on the bill futures yield, suggesting that arbitrage activity plays little formal role in price-setting in the bill futures market.  &#8226; information transmission between the bill and bill futures markets is dominated by the contemporaneous flow of information between the two markets and the lagged flow of information from the bill futures market to the bill market. This is consistent with the proposition that bill dealers base their quotes on the bill futures yield curve.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/396</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Facing new challenges: adapting the NZDF and ADF to the post-Cold War security environment</field><field name="creator">Alach, Zhivan</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the development of the Australian and New Zealand Defence Forces during the post-Cold War period. It has been motivated partly by a desire to clear up the confusion that has sometimes developed over recent force structure changes in both countries, as well as a desire to make recommendations for enhanced practise. The thesis combines analysis of both policy process and content, although it is more focused on content. It begins by examining the post-Cold War strategic environment, comparing it to the situation as it was in the Cold War, and identifying what has changed, and the effect of that on the role of militaries around the world. It then focuses more closely on the two countries. It examines their defence policy environments, identifying the various participants in the policy process. It then engages in an analysis of major defence policy reviews of the post-Cold War period, as well as a range of other defence policy occurrences. It identifies the overall impact of those defence policy processes on the force structures of the two defence forces, by identifying elements of continuity and change. The thesis then assesses the capability of the two forces against the requirements of the current strategic environment, and makes recommendations for enhanced practise. Recommendations are focused on both elements of force structure, and the policymaking system itself. The broad conclusion of the thesis is that neither defence force has evolved markedly in the post-Cold War period. Continuity, rather than change, has been the dominant theme. This has been the result of multiple factors, and while many are common between the two countries, others are markedly different. This continuity has not been particularly beneficial in enhancing the effectiveness of the two forces. Change would be useful.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/431</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identity and socio-historical context : transformations and change among Ma&#772;ori women</field><field name="creator">Houkamau, Carla Anne</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT  Several writers have argued that New Zealand&#8217;s colonial history has thwarted optimal identity development among M&#257;ori (Awatere, 1984; Lawson Te-Aho, 1998a; 1998b). In recent decades the view that M&#257;ori identity may be restored via enculturation has gained widespread acceptance (Broughton, 1993; Edwards, 1999). Recent research indicates, however, that many M&#257;ori perceive their identities in ways that differ from the enculturated ideal (Borrell, 2005; Te Hoe Nuku Roa, 1996; 1999). Relatively little is known of the diverse interpretations that comprise &#8216;alternative&#8217; M&#257;ori identity forms. This thesis aims to contribute to current understandings of M&#257;ori identity by exploring identity change across three generations of M&#257;ori women. For the purposes of the research, identity was treated as &#8216;held&#8217; within personal life-stories and transformations were investigated by comparing the life-stories of 35 M&#257;ori women from different age groups. Attention was given to the impact of three socio-historical processes on identity:  the mass migration of M&#257;ori from rural to urban locations after the 1950s, the drive towards M&#257;ori assimilation which underpinned Government policy towards M&#257;ori until the late 1960s, and the M&#257;ori political and cultural renaissance which gathered momentum in New Zealand from the 1970s. Data analyses found participants born prior to urbanisation evaluated their M&#257;ori identities positively and this seemed to reflect their isolation from P&#257;keh&#257; and exposure to competent M&#257;ori role models during their formative years. Participants aged between 35 and 49 expressed disharmony and tension around their M&#257;ori identities which many attributed to their early exposure to negative evaluations of M&#257;ori people. &#8216;Post-renaissance&#8217; M&#257;ori, aged between 18 and 35, reported prizing their cultural distinctiveness from a young age and affirmed M&#257;ori political, cultural and social equality despite what they perceived as enduring P&#257;keh&#257; prejudice. This interpretation appeared to reflect their early exposure to educational experiences which imparted a sense of cultural pride and a national news media which publicised M&#257;ori political activism. Women&#8217;s life-stories reveal distinct intergenerational differences, a multiplicity of interpretations of M&#257;ori identity not widely articulated in literature, and the need to expand current paradigms of M&#257;ori identity to incorporate the individuality of group members.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/404</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"Therapy: it's a two-way thing": women survivors of child sexual abuse describe their therapy experiences</field><field name="creator">McGregor, Kim</field><field name="description">This thesis gives a voice to women who have been sexually abused and subsequently received therapy. It contributes to the scarce international literature on evaluations of therapy by women survivors of child sexual abuse (CSA). It is hoped that policies and clinical practices for survivors of CSA will be improved as a result of this research. The study was advertized in the general public to women survivors of CSA who were over the age of 20, who had had at least five therapy sessions but were not currently in therapy. One hundred and ninety-one women completed a postal questionnaire that included open and closed questions about their CSA and disclosure experiences and about what they found helpful and unhelpful in therapy. Twenty respondents took part in follow-up interviews of up to two hours. Themes from the questionnaires and the interviews were analysed using EpiInfo6 and the data management tool NVivo. The majority of participants (91%) experienced CSA to the level of genital contact, or attempted penetration or penetration. Participants took over 16 years on average to disclose the CSA. The majority of participants (86%) reported that, overall, therapy was either somewhat or very helpful. Participants who had over 50 sessions of therapy were significantly more likely to report improved emotional well-being compared with those who had 50 sessions or less. Obstacles to participants gaining sufficient therapy for their needs included the cost of therapy and/or a restricted number of therapy hours subsidized by ACC. Participants reported that helpful therapy included a supportive, interactive therapy relationship with a therapist who was knowledgeable about the dynamics and effects of CSA and of abuse-focused therapy. Acknowledgement, understanding, normalisation and assistance to talk about the CSA and work through the effects on their lives were valued. Unhelpful therapy included a therapy relationship where the therapist was not affectively available or knowledgeable about the dynamics and effects of CSA. Therapists who were unable to support participants to talk about the CSA and work through the effects on their lives were criticized. There were also a few examples of harmful practices. The limitations of the study are the lack of a control group, the fact that participants were self-selected and the retrospective nature of their reports. It was concluded that most therapists were doing an effective job in difficult circumstances. However, some therapists need to develop a more open therapeutic relationship that would allow clients to give feedback about the impact of the therapy.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/408</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cross-cultural communication in a postmodern business environment: the role of French language and culture in New Zealand-French business relations</field><field name="creator">Speedy, Karin Elizabeth</field><field name="description">In international business, notions of homogeneity and standardisation are promoted as necessary parts of the globalisation process. &#8220;One world&#8221; is equated with &#8220;one language&#8221; and English, portrayed as the global lingua franca, is seen as the only language needed to operate successfully in world markets. Using Jean Baudrillard&#8217;s theory of the cyclic superposition of the singular, universal and global as a framework and applying it to the business communications between New Zealand exporters and their French buyers, this thesis questions the beliefs underpinning Anglophone reliance on English, and the value of this reliance, in a postmodern business environment. It first examines historical shifts in attitudes to and use of both dominant &#8220;universal&#8221; languages and individual &#8220;singular&#8221; languages and finds that tensions tend to arise when dominant powers try to impose, in an imperialistic fashion, their language on the &#8220;Other&#8221;. It argues that the universal ideals of unity and openness popularly associated with globalisation are myths expounded by Anglophone big business, which, as the advocate of English as the language of international commerce, fails to recognise the hegemonic implications of its discourse. Through both qualitative and quantitative field research, it reaches the conclusion that, aside from a lack of attention paid to foreign languages in business, international business writers offer outdated and often erroneous cross-cultural advice for doing business in France. This cultural guidance is tainted by both the universalist/structuralist frameworks employed by the writers as well as their own inherent cultural assumptions, and is found to be of little use to New Zealand business people. By reviewing previous research, the thesis determines that New Zealand business has demonstrated a slight shift in attitude toward foreign language use in recent years. The results of my survey, designed to gauge the present attitudes to and use of French among New Zealand exporters, show that while some firms have embraced the idea of using French in business, most are still reliant on English for day-to-day business communications with their French customers. In the view of the latter, however, this behaviour does not foster efficient and equitable business relations. For the French, a New Zealand exporter prepared to use French in the French market would have a competitive advantage. Set in the context of Baudrillard&#8217;s paradigm, the thesis demonstrates that within the New Zealand-French business relationship the perpetual struggle between local and dominant languages continues to be a critical issue that requires urgent redress.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/409</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In-plane Seismic Design of Concrete Masonry Structures</field><field name="creator">Voon, Kok Choon</field><field name="description">The research presented in this thesis consists of two parts. The first part involved the investigation of concrete masonry shear strength and the second part reports an investigation of the lateral strength of partially grout-filled nominally reinforced perforated concrete masonry walls.    Valuable information about masonry shear strength is reported following the testing of ten full scale concrete masonry walls. It was verified that horizontal shear reinforcement and axial compression load provided additional shear resistance to masonry walls. Consequently, the nominal shear strength of reinforced masonry walls could be evaluated as a sum of contributions from masonry, shear reinforcement and applied axial load. It was also established that masonry shear strength decreases inversely in relation to an increase of the wall aspect ratio.    Criteria relating to codification of the in-plane shear strength of concrete masonry walls when subjected to seismic loading are presented. Particular emphasis is placed on a computational model that is capable of representing the interaction between flexural ductility and masonry shear strength to account for the reduction in shear strength as ductility level increases. The simple method proposed here allows the strength enhancement provided by axial compression load to be separated from the masonry component of shear strength and is considered to result from strut action. In addition, minor modifications are made to facilitate adoption of the method in the updated version of the New Zealand masonry design standard, NZS 4230:2004.    Prediction of shear strength from NZS 4230:2004 and using alternative methods are compared with results from a wide range of test of masonry walls failing in shear. It was established that the shear equation in the former version of the New Zealand masonry standard (NZS 4230:1990) was overly conservative in its prediction of masonry shear strength. The current NEHRP shear expression was found to be commendable, but it does not address masonry shear strength within plastic hinge regions, therefore limiting its use when designing masonry structures in seismic regions. Finally, the new shear equation adopted by NZS 4230:2004 was found to provide significantly improved shear strength prediction with respect to its predecessor, with accuracy close to that resulted from NEHRP.    Test results obtained in the second part of this research indicated that the size of openings and the length of trimming reinforcement significantly affected the lateral strength of perforated masonry walls. The observation of diagonal cracking patterns that aligned well with the load paths by which shear force was assumed to be transferred to the foundation in the strut mechanism supported the use of strut-and-tie analysis as a viable tool to evaluate the flexural strength of walls of this type. Strength prediction using the improved strut-and-tie method and the modified plastic collapse analysis were found to closely match the experimental results of the perforated walls tested in this study. Strength prediction by the simplified strut-and-tie method was found to closely match the test results of masonry walls with a single opening, but significant underestimation of strength by this method was found for walls with double openings. Full plastic collapse analysis was found to significantly over-predict the strength of all perforated walls included in this study.    Finally, the NZS 4229:1999 detail for shrinkage control joints was shown to result in adequate structural performance. In addition, shrinkage control joints constructed in accordance with the NZS 4229:1999 prescription resulted in masonry bracing capacity substantially in excess of the tabulated values in the standard, with gradual strength and stiffness degradation.  This increase in strength is due to pier double bending that is not considered by the standard.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/580</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Biochemistry of GIGANTEA: A Circadian Clock-Controlled Regulator of Photoperiodic Flowering in Plants</field><field name="creator">Black, Moyra Maria</field><field name="description">In many organisms, important biological and developmental processes such as growth and reproduction occur in time with particular seasons of the year. Many species recognise seasonal changes through the measurement of changes in day length (photoperiodism) by comparison to an internal oscillator called the circadian clock. Genes involved in photoperiodic processes such as flowering can be studied using the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis). One Arabidopsis gene central to photoperiodism is GIGANTEA (GI). GI mutants show a delay in flowering in inductive day lengths, leading to a longer phase of vegetative growth. Expression of GI is regulated by the circadian clock and is cyclical, peaking in the evening. The GI protein is large, plant-specific, nuclear localised, and has no homology to any other proteins. GI accumulates during the day and drops at night due to predicted proteosomal degradation. While it has been forty years since the first mutant alleles of GI were described much is still unknown about the molecular mechanism of GI action. The objective of this work was to characterise the GI protein, to give a greater understanding of the role of GI in floral induction. Soluble affinity-tagged full-length GI was expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli) and was stabilised by the addition of the detergent N-dodecyi-&#946;-D-maltoside (DDM) to storage and purification buffers. Stabilised GI was purified using a variety of chromatographic methods, and characterised using a selection of biochemical techniques including circular dichroism, and dynamic light scattering. This showed that purified GI contained secondary structure, but was polydisperse in solution. Limited proteolytic digests and mass spectrometry were used to identify possible GI domains. This led to the identification of a predicted 46 kDa amino terminal GI domain. A variety of potential GI domains were targeted using either a sequence-based bioinformatics approach or an experimentally-derived approach, and were expressed in E.coli. While most of these domains remained intractably insoluble, the 46 kDa amino-terminal domain showed partial solubility when expressed at 10&#176;C and lysed in buffer containing DDM. This domain was expressed from two plant species (Arabidopsis and Rye Grass) and large-scale expression and purification protocols developed. In vivo characterisation of the amino terminal GI domain in Arabidopsis plants suggested that while the protein product of the domain may be unstable, a region of the domain could have a dominant negative effect on flowering time in wild type plants. Arabidopsis plants were also used to characterise the light responses of full-length GI protein. This showed that GI protein accumulated to high levels in plants exposed to blue, white and red light, with blue-light plants showing the highest levels of GI accumulation. GI protein was then shown to accumulate less in plants lacking the CRY1 and CRY2 blue light photoreceptors than plants with functional CRY1 and CRY2 genes.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/414</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Drawing the line: a working epistemology for the study of architectural drawing</field><field name="creator">Wood, Peter</field><field name="description">The conventional view of architectural drawing presents it as a paradigm for architectural knowledge based on a visual relationship between an idea and a built work where the drawing operates as a neutral and passive vehicle for the transformation of architectural thought into architectural practice. In this model the drawing is merely a utilitarian convenience for the passage of the architect&#8217;s imaginings. Coded into this relationship is the accepted authority of our visual faculties to mediate and interpret the communicative aspects of drawing. This work questions the hegemonic role of vision in the execution and interpretation of architectural drawings, and proposes instead a more complex and discursive model for the transmission of architectural knowledge through a drawn medium. With reference to three case study drawings circa 1980 (Aldo Rossi: Interno con il del mondo, 1981; Morphosis: Venice III, 1982; Peter Eisenman: House X, 1976) this period is identified as the end of a tradition of manual drawing for architects, that has historically defined the practice of contemporary architecture. It is argued that architects have depended upon a visual paradigm for the operation of drawing to organize their relationship to architecture, and that this has in turn prohibited comprehensive analytical critique of the drawing and its place in wider architectural production. Each case study offers a point of departure for a critical reappraisal of the role played by drawing in the relationships that exist between the idea and the work in architecture. In particular the function of touch is proposed as a counter sensory knowledge that is coded into architectural drawing, but whose presence is then repressed as unconstitutional to the idea/project relationship. In making this argument a series of figures are introduced (consisting principally of the hieroglyph, the hand and touch, and blindness) to produce an epistemological framework for further discussion on the subject. It is suggested in conclusion that although the development of digital technologies has shifted architectural representation away from traditional manual practices that this should not be viewed as a representational paradigm shift since the ideological framework that organizes our relationship to the screen is the same one that has existed with the page, and perpetuates the same ideological problems.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/426</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling Breast Tissue Mechanics Under Gravity Loading</field><field name="creator">Rajagopal, Vijayaraghavan</field><field name="description">This thesis presents research that was conducted to develop anatomically realistic finite element models of breast deformation under a variety of gravity loading conditions to assist clinicians in tracking suspicious tissues across multiple imaging modalities. Firstly, the accuracy of the modelling framework in predicting deformations of a homogeneous body was measured using custom designed silicon gel phantoms. The model predicted surface deformations with an average RMS error of 1.5 mm +/- 0.2 mm and tracked internal marker locations with an average RMS error of 1.4 mm +/- 0.7 mm.  A novel method was then developed to determine the reference configuration of a body, when given its mechanical properties, boundary conditions and a deformed configuration. The theoretical validity of the technique was confirmed with an analytic solution. The accuracy of the method was also measured using silicon gel experiments, predicting the reference configuration surface with an average RMS error of 1.3 mm +/- 0.1 mm, and tracking internal marker locations with an average error of 1.5 mm +/- 0.8 mm.  Silicon gel composites were then created to measure the accuracy of standard techniques to model heterogeneity. The models did not match the experimentally recorded deformations. This highlighted the need for further validation exercises on modelling heterogeneity before modelling them in the breast. A semi-automated algorithm was developed to fit finite element models to the skin and muscle surfaces of each individual, which were segmented from breast MR images. The code represented the skin with an average RMS error of 1.46 mm +/- 0.32 mm and the muscle with an average RMS error of 1.52 mm +/- 0.3 mm.  The framework was then tested using images of the breast obtained under different gravity loading conditions and neutral buoyancy. A homogeneous model was first developed using the neutral buoyancy images as a representation of the reference configuration. The model did not accurately capture the regional deformations of the breast under gravity loading. However, the gross shape of the breast was reproduced, indicating that a biomechanical model of the breast could be useful to reliably track tissues across multiple images for cancer diagnosis.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">breast</field><field name="subject">finite element modelling</field><field name="subject">soft tissue mechanics</field><field name="subject">biomechanics</field><field name="subject">image registration</field><field name="subject">finite elasticity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/704</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of two cognitive-behavioural interventions on patient adherence to physiotherapy rehabilitation</field><field name="creator">Bassett, Sandra Frances</field><field name="description">The research in this thesis used prospective randomised controlled trials to evaluate two cognitive-behavioural interventions designed to improve adherence to physiotherapy in patients with ankle sprains. In Study 1, a DVD and written intervention grounded in Protection Motivation Theory (PMT: Rogers, 1983) and assessment tools were developed and piloted. In the pilot 31 patients were randomized into one of three treatment conditions (PMT, attention control and non-contact control). Following the intervention patients beliefs toward physiotherapy and injury were assessed. Compared to the two controls, the PMT group had significantly higher scores on severity, vulnerability and response efficacy. No differences were found for self-efficacy or intentions. Both response efficacy and self efficacy were significantly related to intentions. Based on these findings, the self-efficacy component of the PMT DVD was revised. Study 2 (n = 71), an identical three group design, tested the PMT-based intervention&#8217;s effect on beliefs, intentions, adherence and functional outcomes. Before physiotherapy, antecedents to adherence (motivation, pain, and subjective norm) and functional outcomes were measured, then the intervention was given, and beliefs and intentions evaluated. Adherence to clinic and home physiotherapy was assessed throughout the treatment programme and functional outcomes again at the end of treatment. Compared to the two controls, the intervention group was significantly higher on all PMT beliefs barring self-efficacy. No significant group differences were found for intentions, adherence and post-physiotherapy functional outcomes. Significant relations occurred between the antecedents, PMT beliefs, intentions, adherence and functional outcomes. The lack of group differences on intention, adherence and functional outcome was attributed to most participants having previously had physiotherapy and antecedent scores that typify highly adherent patients. Study 3 (n = 47) compared a home-based programme steeped in adherence enhancing strategies with its traditional clinic counterpart. Psychological variables (antecedents, locus of control, and anxiety) and functional outcomes were measured before and after the course of physiotherapy, and adherence during. No group differences occurred on either the psychological or functional outcome variables. Compared to the clinic group, the home-based participants required significantly less clinic appointments, had a higher percentage of attendance and a significantly better completion rate. No group differences existed for their adherence to the physiotherapy. Significant relations occurred between psychological variables, adherence, and functional outcomes. Findings suggest home-based physiotherapy is a viable, safe treatment option.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/439</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Three-dimensional mapping of electrical propagation in the heart: experimental and mathematical model based analysis</field><field name="creator">Hooks, Darren Anthony</field><field name="description">In this thesis, mathematical modelling, instrumentation development and experimental studies are combined to effect two advances in the study of cardiac electrophysiology. Firstly, we outline a method that will enable microstructural information gathered using extended confocal microscopy to be incorporated into whole heart models of electrical propagation. A structured finite element technique is used to solve the bidomain equations on a realistic representation of myocardial architecture. The effects of intercellular gaps in the tissue on electrical propagation, and the response of myocardium to defibrillation-strength shocks, are examined. It is shown that myocardium is not a transversely isotropic electrical medium as has been widely assumed. Instead it is most appropriately viewed as orthotropic, with different electrical properties assigned to three microstructurally defined orthogonal axes. It is also concluded that the intercellular tissue gaps provide a likely mechanism for activation of a critical volume of tissue during defibrillation. Secondly, a novel imaging system is presented which enables transmembrane potentials to be recorded simultaneously at multiple sites through the heart wall. While heart surface optical recordings of transmembrane potential have been widely used in studies of normal and pathological heart rhythms, it is difficult to obtain information about propagation processes deep within the heart wall. A probe constructed from optical fibers is used to deliver excitation light to and collect fluorescence from 6 tissue sites each spaced 1mm apart. For individual channels, excitation is provided by the 488nm line of a watercooled argon-ion laser, while the fluorescence of a voltage-sensitive dye is split at 600nm and imaged into separate photodiodes for later signal ratioing. The system has been sucessfully used to record intramural action potentials in the isolated rabbit heart and is designed to be easily expandable to accommodate multiple optical probes. The fluorescence collection volume of the fibre-optic probe has been characterised in rhodamine solution using two-photon microscopy. These data are compared with corresponding results obtained with two flat cleaved optical fibres in solution and in stained heart tissue. The results demonstrate that the effective collection depth in cardiac tissue for our optrodes was 100&#956;m, but that this is dependent on the type of optical fibre used to fabricate the optrode. These techniques developed in this research provide a basis for more systematic study of the initiation and termination of reentrant electrical activity in the heart. Future research that builds on the original findings presented in this thesis is discussed.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/440</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Prenatal and postnatal nutritional influences on leptin sensitivity and susceptibility to diet-induced obesity in the rat</field><field name="creator">Krechowec, Stefan Ostap</field><field name="description">The developmental origins of health and disease hypothesis suggests that exposure to adverse prenatal environmental influences can determine an individual&#8217;s susceptibility to obesity in adult life. However, the specific causal mechanisms which underlie this hypothesis have yet to be identified. Focusing on the potential mechanistic role of the leptin endocrine axis, the main objective of this thesis was to investigate the long term effects of prenatal undernutrition and different levels of postnatal nutrition on leptin sensitivity and the development of diet-induced obesity (DIO) in the Wistar rat. A well established animal model of maternal undernutrition during pregnancy was used to induce prenatal undernutrition in experimental offspring. To investigate the interaction between prenatal nutrition and postnatal diet, and its effects on obesity development, female offspring were placed on three different diets: standard chow, a high fat diet or a calorie restricted diet. The effects of prenatal undernutrition and postnatal diet on leptin sensitivity were investigated, in adult offspring, by measuring the response to 14 days of peripheral leptin treatment. Changes in gene expression in the liver, retroperitoneal adipose tissue and soleus muscle were then characterised by custom microarray and quantitative real-time RT-PCR (QPCR) analysis.  Adult female offspring exposed to prenatal undernutrition (UN offspring) were found to exhibit leptin resistance in adulthood, independent of postnatal DIO. This result demonstrates for the first time that exposure to prenatal undernutrition has a long term effect on adult leptin sensitivity. In UN offspring fed on a high-fat diet, leptin resistance significantly accelerated the development of DIO while in contrast, offspring maintained on calorie restriction remained lean. These findings suggest that prenatal nutrition can shape future susceptibility to DIO by altering postnatal leptin sensitivity. An analysis of gene expression suggests that prenatal undernutrition causes the development of peripheral tissue-specific leptin resistance, and may also further enhance an offspring&#8217;s susceptibility to DIO by altering the regulation of peripheral tissue lipogenesis, mitochondrial function, glucocorticoid metabolism and insulin sensitivity.  In conclusion, these studies identify peripheral leptin resistance as a key mechanism that can influence postnatal susceptibility to DIO in female offspring exposed to prenatal undernutrition. Furthermore, the identification of specific changes in peripheral gene expression highlights four additional metabolic mechanisms which may also facilitate the development of DIO in leptin resistant UN offspring.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fetal programming</field><field name="subject">Obesity</field><field name="subject">Leptin</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321019 Paediatrics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/701</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ethical pesticide policy : beyond risk assessment</field><field name="creator">Watts, Meriel Ann</field><field name="description">This thesis sets out to develop a pesticide policy process that is ethical, one that fairly addresses the needs of society whilst at the same time minimizing the impact of pesticides on nature. The process that is developed here is context dependent: it is not a prescription for all public policy processes, but one specifically for pesticides in one country at a particular period in time. Nevertheless, the general principles are widely applicable to other areas of policy, particularly those involving technological risks, and to other countries. Much of the material used is drawn from the New Zealand experience, with two major exceptions: United States data is used to describe the toxicological risk assessment process and its failures, and studies conducted in Asia are used to illustrate community participatory research. The development of Auckland City's Weed Management Policy is used to illustrate the potential of the proposed approach to pesticide policy. It is argued that the reductionist science of toxicology, on which current pesticide policy heavily depends, fails to accurately predict the effects of pesticides on human health and on the environment. It is shown to be based on a particular set of values that cannot be said to represent those of society in general. These two factors contribute significantly to the differences in the acceptability of risks from pesticides by lay people and by technical experts. There are also gender and race differences in assessment of risk. It is argued that to base pesticide policy on toxicology is irrational because this science fails to incorporate ecological rationality, i.e. the interconnectedness of nature, and social rationality. It is also argued that pesticide policy based on the anthropocentric approach of the domination of nature, which broadly underlies the mechanistic worldview of science, is unethical because it fails to take into account the needs and interests of nonhuman nature. Ethical pesticide policy is therefore based on ecological rationality ( as well as social rationality) and a recognition of the intrinsic interests of nature, both aspects of an ecocentric ethic. The ecocentric ethic is practically applied to pesticide policy processes by using the decision rule of the principle of minimum harm, which is an expression of the precautionary approach. The objectivity and cultural authority of science are challenged and the way is cleared for the introduction of other knowledge into the ethical pesticide policy process. It is scientism, not science that is rejected, and science takes its place alongside other knowledge systems. Wisdom is incorporated into the policy process by including the knowledge of members of the community and of public interest groups who have understanding and experience of the effects of pesticides, and also the management of pest, weeds and disease in agri-ecosystems in ways that minimize harm to nonhuman nature, principally by the methods of organic agriculture and natural farming. Democracy is improved by including in the decision-making those who lie in the path of the policy: public interest groups that bring expertise, experience, and social values, farming interest groups that bring the views of those who use pesticides and those who manage the agri-ecosystem without them, and the appropriate bureaucrats. The pesticide industry is not included in the decision-making group for ethical reasons. The tripartite approach is augmented by a person representing the interests of nonhuman nature, an ecocentrist whose role it is to ensure that the principle of minimum harm is adequately applied. This is an acknowledgement of the need for considerable attitudinal change, particularly on the part of bureaucrats and pesticide users, in order that the ethical pesticide policy process lives up to its potential. Distributional justice issues are addressed by requiring that the policy decision-making group consists of 50 percent women/50 percent men, and 50 percent pakeha/50 percent Maori, to reflect firstly the gender differences in the acceptability of risks from pesticides, and secondly the bicultural nature of New Zealand as afforded by the nation's founding legal document, the Treaty of Waitangi.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/442</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Metabolism and physiology during ontogeny of cultured yellowtail kingfish (Seriola Ialandi Carangidae)</field><field name="creator">Moran, Damian</field><field name="description">Various aspects of metabolism and physiology were investigated during the ontogeny of yellowtail kingfish (Seriola lalandi), a fish of growing aquaculture importance in both New Zealand and other countries. Incubation experiments between 18-24&#176;C showed that developing eggs and larvae were heavily influenced by temperature. It appeared that at warmer temperatures larvae hatched smaller but grew on the yolk sac, whereas at cooler temperatures larvae grew inside the chorion. Oxygen consumption data supported this, with a negative correlation found between total embryonic oxygen consumption and temperature. A mechanism was proposed to explain the differential effect of temperature on ontogeny and growth. Like other marine fish with pelagic eggs, yellowtail kingfish were found to be heavily reliant on free amino acids as a source of energy. At 23&#176;C the pattern of substrate utilisation in eggs was considerably different from that at 17-21&#176;C, indicating that 23&#176;C exceeded the tolerance for normal development. Inter-individual aggression by large individuals was associated with the development of size heterogeneity in juveniles. Although this aggression also affected the survival of smaller juveniles, it was not the primary agent of much of the mortality that occurs during this phase, as many of these individuals were on a degenerate developmental trajectory. Yellowtail kingfish fingerlings used for ongrowing were robust to the stressors imposed by live transport. The ontogenetic development of metabolic rate from 0.6 mg-2.2 kg did not follow the same scaling exponent as that observed for mammalian models of allometry, and has implications for interspecific studies of mass-dependent metabolism.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/443</field></doc><doc><field name="title">International Labour Standards. The formation and development of an international regime. New Zealand and the International Labour Organisation 1919-1945</field><field name="creator">Hughes, Stephen</field><field name="description">The purpose of this thesis is to examine the development of the international labour standards regime and the role of New Zealand in the development of this regime. To achieve this aim, it first sets out to determine what we mean by a regime, second it examines the development of relations between the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and New Zealand in the context of regime development from 1919 to 1945. The substantive analysis is confined to the period from the end of the First World War to the end of the Second World War. This is done for the following reasons. First, the period saw the introduction of an international labour standards regime and constituted a critical period in regime formation and development. Second, it marks a period when New Zealand developed from a reluctant and passive regime member to a proactive advocate of the principles and norms of regime compliance. Third, the international order that prevailed from 1945 onward is of such significant difference from that which prevailed during the inter-war period that it merits a sustained examination in its own right and as such remains outside the scope of this thesis. This thesis demonstrates that three substantive policies &#8211; a policy of autonomy; a policy of presence; and a policy of relevance &#8211; cultivated and employed by the ILO made a significant contribution towards the development and consolidation of the international labour standards regime. In the context of these three policies it explores the role of New Zealand&#8217;s in the process. In particular, it identifies and examines linkages between domestic and international interests and their influence on regime development. Furthermore it shows how and why the international labour standards regime distanced itself from the League of Nations. This thesis seeks to achieve these aims for three reasons. First, no previous work has attempted to conduct a detailed examination of relations between the ILO and New Zealand. Second, no previous work has examined the formation and development of the international labour standards regime from the perspective of international organisation/state relations. Third, it seeks to contribute to a research programme that views international co-operation as not only a product of inter-state relations but of the interaction between domestic and international interests. - FROM INTRODUCTION</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/456</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Problems in Tongan Lexicography</field><field name="creator">Taumoefolau, Melenaite L.</field><field name="description">This thesis is an attempt to address the major theoretical and practical problems in compiling a monolingual Tongan dictionary. The first question that is asked is: what can be learned from the lexicographical experiences of Pacific languages to date? Since the Pacific islands share a common history with regard to European contact, and since many Pacific languages are characterised by the same basic principles, many languages being of the same language family, Austronesian, it is expected that important issues pertaining to lexicography in a language like Tongan would be similar to those in related Pacific languages, and much will be learned from the experiences and achievements in lexicography of other Pacific languages. For this reason, chapter 1 looks at a brief history of lexicography in the Pacific islands, and chapter 2 reviews selected Pacific dictionaries with a view to identifying their merits and demerits. Chapter 3 then identifies the main functions envisaged for the monolingual Tongan dictionary in developing the Tongan language. These functions are responses to language needs that arise out of the sociolinguistic situation. Chapters 4 - 7 examine various aspects of the language that are relevant to dictionary making and try to determine appropriate ways of describing the language in the dictionary. Chapter 4 gives a description of the main aspects of the Tongan phonological system and suggests ways of improving the present orthography for use in the dictionary. Chapter 5 looks at Tongan morphology and suggests, with reference to the sociolinguistic process of conventionalisation, an answer to the question: what is a lexical item in Tongan? The principles governing the selection of lexical items for inclusion in the dictionary are given here. Chapter 6 looks at major aspects of Tongan syntax, namely parts of speech, transitivity, and possession, with a view to determining how they are to be used in dictionary entries. Chapter 7 looks at the way meaning and usage are to be represented in the dictionary. Chapter 8 addresses the question of organization and presentation of material in the dictionary. Principles of ordering headwords, homonyms, the senses of headwords, and the elements of an entry are discussed. Chapter 9 consists of sample entries for different word categories in Tongan. The entries, which are translated into English for assessment purposes, show the recommended ways of presenting different word types in Tongan.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420307 Pacific cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/475</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Computational Model of the Ocular Lens</field><field name="creator">Malcolm, Duane Tearaitoa Kingwell</field><field name="description">The aim of this project is to develop a computational model of the structure and function of the ocular lens, specifically the solute and fluid transport in the lens.  The modelling framework was based on finite volume methods. The intracellular and extracellular solute fluxes were modelled using the Nernst-Plank equation with an extra term to capture solute fluxes due to advection. The modelling framework included equations describing the flux through the Na+ /K+ pumps and K+ channels in the surface membrane, and Na+ and Cl- channels in the fibre cell membrane. The intracellular fluid flow between adjacent fibre cells was modelled by a homogenised transmembrane fluid flow equation and the intracellular fluid flow along the fibre cell was modelled as Poiseuille flow. The extracellular fluid flow was modelled as Couette flow with an extra term to capture electro-osmotic flow. The fluid flow through the fibre cell membrane and surface membrane was modelled as transmembrane fluid flow. The governing equations account for the structural properties of the lens, such as the tortuosity of the extracellular cleft, the intracellular and extracellular volume fractions, and the membrane density.  A one-dimensional model of the Na+ , K+ , Cl- and fluid transport in the frog lens was developed. This model was based on the analytic model developed by Mathias (1985b). The results were consistent with the results from the analytic model and experimental data.  Two versions of the two-dimensional model were developed. In the first model, the parameters were spatially constant except for the distribution of the Na+ /K+ pump currents at the lens surface and the fibre cell angles. The second model was the same, except the extracellular cleft width and fibre cell height was spatially varied to represent the sutures and the diffusion barrier. These models were solved and compared with each other and with experimental data.  Compared to the first, the second model predicted a significantly larger circulation of solutes and fluid between the pole and equator. It predicted a 12-20% increase in the penetration of Na+ , K+ and fluid into the lens. The second model also predicted a 300-400% increase in Cl- penetration and, unlike the first model, a Cl- circulation between the poles and equator. This is significant since Cl- is not an actively transported solute. These results highlight the strong structure-function relationship in the lens and the importance of an accurate spatial representation of model parameters.  The direction of the current, solute fluxes and fluid flow that were predicted by the model were consistent with experimental data but the magnitude of the surface current was a tenth to a third of the values measure by the vibrating probe.  To demonstrate the application of the lens model, the two-dimensional model was used to simulate age-related changes in lens physiology. This was done by increasing the radius of the lens to simulate growth with age. The model predicted an increase in the intracellular Na+ concentration, Cl- concentration and potential, and a decrease in the intracellular K+ concentration with age. These trends were consistent with those observed by Duncan et al. (1989), except for the intracellular K+ concentration, where they reported no change with age.  The two-dimensional model forms a foundation for future developments and applications.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bioengineering</field><field name="subject">model</field><field name="subject">finite volume methods</field><field name="subject">ocular lens</field><field name="subject">eye</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/754</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reproductive Biology and Early Life History of the Chilean Oyster, with Special Reference to Populations in Northern New Zealand.</field><field name="creator">Jeffs, Andrew</field><field name="description">The Chilean oyster, Tiostrea chilensis, is a commercially important species that is native to New Zealand and the Pacific Coast of South America. The description of the variability in life history characteristics among populations of the Chilean oyster is fundamental to understanding its biology and may help in solving some of the problems encountered in culturing this species. Research presented in this thesis describes some aspects of the reproductive biology of the Chilean oyster from four populations, mainly in northern New Zealand, and compares the results with previous studies from elsewhere. Similar patterns of gametogenesis were found among three study populations at Manukau Harbour, Hauraki Gulf and Foveaux Strait. Oysters were protandrous, maturing firstly as males and later also producing ova. In all three populations the majority of the contents of all the gonads were male reproductive products. There was no evidence that the sexuality of oysters alternated rhythmically as has been reported in other species of larviparous oysters. For spawning females, the often concurrent release of ripe sperm indicated the possible presence of self fertilisation. In samples of oysters examined from Foveaux strait the sexuality of oysters was found to change markedly with size. This suggested that the infection of oysters by the parasite Bonamia may not be related to their sexuality as was previously thought. At two northern populations (Hauraki Gulf and Manukau Harbour) larvae were produced from young, small oysters, and a much larger proportion of the population was brooding larvae each year than has been reported elsewhere. In both populations, larvae were being brooded, released and were settling at all times of the year, unlike other populations. The mean fertility of the Manukau Harbour oysters was the highest so far reported for any population of this species. The size of larvae in all three northern populations were smaller than has been reported for all other locations in New Zealand and chile and is thought to be related to differences in water temperatures. Overall, the results highlight the importance of investigations into populations of molluscs across their geographical range for revealing variation in life history characteristics which may be of benefit for aquaculture.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/489</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Designing an application-specific programming language for mobile robots</field><field name="creator">Biggs, Geoffrey</field><field name="description">The process of programming mobile robots is improved by this work. The tools used for programming robot systems have not advanced significantly, while robots themselves are rapidly becoming more capable because of advances in computing power and sensor technology. Industrial robotics relies on simple programming tools usable by non-expert programmers, while robotics researchers tend to use general purpose languages designed for programming in other domains.  The task of developing a robot cannot be assumed to be identical to developing other software-based systems. The nature of robot programming is that there are different and additional challenges when programming a robot than when programming in other domains. A robot has many complex interfaces, must deal with regular and irregular events, real-time issues, large quantities of data, and the dangers of unknown conditions. Mobile robots move around and are capable of affecting everything in the environment. They are found in cluttered environments, rather than the carefully-controlled work spaces of industrial robots, increasing the risk to life and property and the complexity of the software.  An analysis of the process of developing robots provides insight into how robot programming environments can be improved to make the task of robot development easier. Three analyses have been performed: a task analysis, to determine the important components of the robot development process, a use case analysis, to determine what robot developers must do, and a requirements analysis, to determine the requirements of a robot programming environment. From these analyses, the important features of a robot development environment were found. They include features such as data types for data commonly found in robotics, semantics for managing reactivity, and debugging facilities such as simulators.  The analyses also found that the language is an important component of the programming environment. An application-specific language designed for robot programming is proposed as a solution for providing this component. Application-specific languages are designed for a particular domain of programming, allowing them to overcome the difficulties in that domain without concern for their usefulness in other domains. To test the hypothesis that such a language would improve robot development a set of language extensions has been created. These extensions, named RADAR, provide explicit support for robotics. The prototype implementation uses the Python programming language as the base language.  RADAR provides support for two of the necessary features found in the analyses. The first is support for dimensioned data via a new primitive data type, ensuring all dimensioned data is consistent throughout a program. Dimensional analysis support is provided, allowing the safe mixing of data with compatible units, the creation of more complex units from simple single-dimension units, and built-in checking for errors in dimensioned data such as performing operations involving incompatible dimensioned data. For example, the data type will prevent the addition of distance and speed values. Several dimensional analysis systems have been developed for general purpose languages in the past. However, this is the first application of the concept specifically to robotics.  The second feature is semantics for managing reactivity. In RADAR, the principle of ease-of-use through simplicity is followed. Special objects represent events and responses, and a special syntax is used for both specifying these objects and managing the connections between them in response to the changing state of the program. This reduces programming complexity and time. There are many other languages for managing reactivity, both the more general languages, such as Esterel, and languages for robotics, such as TDL and Colbert. RADAR is simpler than the general languages, as it is aimed solely at the needs of robot developers. However, it takes a different approach to its design than other languages for reactivity in robotics. These are designed to provide support for a specific architecture or architecture style; RADAR is designed based on the needs of robot developers and so is architecture-independent.  RADAR&#8217;s design philosophy is to provide robot-specific features with simple semantics. RADAR is designed to support what robot developers need to do with the language, rather than providing a special syntax for supporting a particular robot, architecture or other system. RADAR has been shown to provide an improvement in dimensioned data management and reactivity management for mobile robot programming. It increases the readability, writability and reliability of robot software, and can reduce programming and maintenance costs. RADAR shows that an application-specific approach to developing a robot programming language can improve the process of robot development.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">robots</field><field name="subject">programming</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/702</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mapping a new future: Primary Health Care Nursing in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Sheridan, Nicolette Fay</field><field name="description">The aim of the study was to determine the practice of nurses employed in integrated care projects in New Zealand from late 1999 to early 2001. Integrated care was a major health reform strategy that emphasised primary health care as a means to improve service provision between the health sectors. An investigation of nurses&#8217; practice sought to determine the extent to which primary health care principles had been adopted in practice, as a comprehensive primary health care approach has been advocated globally in the management of chronic conditions; the leading cause of disability throughout the world and the most expensive problems faced by health care systems. The philosophical basis of the research was postpositivism. The study employed a quantitative non-experimental survey design because it allowed numeric descriptions of the characteristics of integrated care projects to be gained for the purpose of identifying nurses&#8217; practice. The unit of inquiry was the integrated care project, and 80 comprised the study population. Data were obtained on projects from expert informants (n=27) by telephone survey using a structured interview questionnaire developed by the researcher. Data obtained from interviews were statistically analysed in two stages. First, data were produced to comprehensively describe the characteristics of integrated care projects and nurses practice. The &#8216;Public health interventions model&#8217; was used as a framework to analyses the interventions (activities) and levels of population-based practice of nurses. Following this, the social values embedded in nurses&#8217; practice were determined using &#8216;Beattie&#8217;s model of health promotion&#8217; as a framework for analysis. A strong association was found between nurses&#8217; practice in projects and strategies used in integrated care, such as information sharing, guideline development and promotion, and case management, and projects with an ethnic focus, low income focus, chronic condition focus, and well-health focus. Whilst nurses undertook interventions most frequently at the individual practice level they were also strongly ii associated with the small proportion of interventions that were undertaken at the community level. The majority of interventions by nurses reflected the health promotion value of health persuasion, indicating a paternalist and individual-oriented philosophy. Nurses were engaged in two interventions that indicated a collectiveoriented philosophy - coalition building and community development, the latter reflecting health promotion values of negotiation, partnership and empowerment. The study demonstrated that nurses&#8217; practice in projects was predominantly centred on individual-focused population-based practice suggesting the need for a framework to assist nurses to transition their practice to include more activity at the community and systems levels. Without a reorientation of practice, nurses will remain limited in their ability to achieve health gains for populations. In response to this conclusion, and drawing on research results and reviewed literature, a new model, The &#8216;Primary Health Care interventions model&#8217; was constructed. Recommendations include advocacy for the acceptance of the model by the health funder, professional nursing bodies, health organisations, educational institutions, nurses, communities, and individuals.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Primary Health Care Interventions Model</field><field name="subject">Nursing</field><field name="subject">primary health care</field><field name="subject">health promotion</field><field name="subject">health determinants</field><field name="subject">chronic conditions</field><field name="subject">integrated care</field><field name="subject">New Zealand health reforms</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/507</field></doc><doc><field name="title">&#8216;The Paradise of the Southern Hemisphere&#8217;: The Perception of New Zealand and the Maori in Written Accounts of German-speaking Explorers and Travellers 1839-1889</field><field name="creator">Harrison, Oliver J.</field><field name="description">The aim of this research is to examine the much neglected body of writings on New Zealand and the Maori by German-speaking explorers and travellers during the colonising period of the 1840s to 1880s. To the nineteenth-century breed of visitor from Germany and Austria, 'Old' New Zealand often presented itself as an unexplored field of scientific curiosities, from botany and geology to ornithology and ethnology, at the same time as a paradise for immigrant workers. The investigation begins with an evaluation of the eighteenth-century account of Georg Forster, who accompanied Captain Cook on his second voyage to the South Pacific. Forster's account is entrenched in the early racial stereotypes and theories of the 'savage', and provides the first major primary source for all of German-speaking Europe up to the period under investigation. The second main source to be considered is the dominant 'paradise' image which evolved out of the propaganda of the New Zealand Company and continued right through the colonising era. The principal figures to be examined include Ernst Dieffenbach, the official Company naturalist, Friedrich August Krull, the first German Consul in New Zealand, Ferdinand von Hochstetter, the resident geologist on the Novara expedition, Julius von Haast, the founder and director of the Canterbury Museum, Andreas Reischek, the taxidermist and collector, as well as other notable visitors including Max Buchner, Franz Reuleaux, Otto Finsch, Alexander von H&#252;bner and Robert von Lendenfeld. Thus, it is the goal of this investigation to analyse the perception of New Zealand and the Maori in selected works by German-speaking explorers and travellers who arrived in the colony between 1839 and 1889 through, first of all, confronting the prevailing stereotypes and images inherent in the philosophical attitudes of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries towards the 'savage' and those present in the 'paradise' rhetoric of the British campaigners of colonisation, and secondly, examining the origins, patterns and evolution of their respective perceptions, impressions and opinions in order to reveal the true extent of their non-British 'Germanic' viewpoint.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Germany</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Travel Literature</field><field name="subject">History</field><field name="subject">Nineteenth Century</field><field name="subject">Explorers</field><field name="subject">Travellers</field><field name="subject">Natural History</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Austria</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::430000 History and Archaeology::430100 Historical Studies::430102 History: Maori</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/703</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The functional role of anthocyanins in leaves</field><field name="creator">Neill, Samuel Oliver</field><field name="description">The anthocyanins, a relatively small group of pigments in the diverse flavonoid family, are largely responsible for the red-blue colouration in a large number plant species worldwide. Their occurrence in fruits and flowers seems to offer clear benefits in attracting pollinators and aiding seed dispersal, however their presence in the vacuoles of leaves remains obscure. The accumulation of anthocyanin pigments in leaves can be induced by a host of disparate environmental and anthropogenic stressors, such as UV-exposure, wounding, pathogen infection, high light, chilling, pollution, osmotic stress, and nutrient deficiency. Anthocyanins are in some species expressed throughout leaf development; in others the pigments are found exclusively in the young, rapidly expanding leaves, or at later stages of leaf senescence. Many researchers have explored the possible functional role(s) of anthocyanins within leaves, although none of the hypotheses provides a unified explanation for the diverse range of environmental triggers, or for the variability in the pigment&#8217;s location and expression at particular stages of development. Differences in the cellular location of cyanic pigments had little effect on the optical properties of leaves from several native New Zealand species. Instead, the absorptance of green-yellow light was strongly proportional to the concentration of anthocyanin. Red leaves absorbed up to 17 % more PAR (400-700 nm) than green leaves of same species. The reflectance of red light was independent of leaf anthocyanin content. In Lactuca sativa, the absorption of light by anthocyanic cell vacuoles in the upper epidermis led to a reduction in the light incident on subjacent chlorenchyma. Under high irradiances, the dissipation of excess energy through non-photochemical processes (qNP) was lower in the red regions of the leaves than in the green regions. Red L. sativa, maintained higher photochemical efficiencies (0PSII), and had greater rates of photochemical quenching (qP) than the green tissues. Moreover, the cyanic areas were photoinhibited significantly less (7 %), as measured by levels of maximum PSII efficiency (Fv/Fm), than green areas during a high light treatment of 1300 mmol m-2 s-1. Chloroplast suspensions from shade adapted L. sativa generated less superoxide (O2 -) through the Mehler reaction and had reduced rates of chlorophyll bleaching, when irradiated with 300 mmol m-2 s-1 of red light rather than white light. These data demonstrated the impact of the light-filtering effects of anthocyanins on the photophysiology of the leaves. Complementary to their light-shielding functions, anthocyanins also demonstrated potent antioxidant capabilities at pH values typical of both the cytoplasm and the vacuole. The addition of cyanidin-3-malonylglucoside, which was colourless at the cytoplasmic pH, to a chloroplast suspension receiving high irradiance resulted in the significant scavenging of O2 -. The red, flavylium form of anthocyanin was also oxidised by O2 -. After 15 minutes, this oxidation equated to a 40 % reduction in antioxidant potential of the anthocyanin, as measured by cyclic voltammetry. The data suggested that anthocyanins could provide widespread cellular protection to cellular membranes, organelles, and DNA. Analysis of the overall antioxidant defence in red and green leaves of Elatostema rugosum, a shade-adapted herb native to New Zealand, and Quintinia serrata, a native tree found on exposed ridges, provided evidence for a photoprotective role of anthocyanins. Red leaves of E. rugosum were on average five-times more effective at scavenging DPPH radicals than were green leaves. The anthocyanins constituted the most active phenolic component, providing a greater relative contribution to the antioxidant pool than the flavones, flavonols, and hydroxycinnamic acids. In contrast, red and green leaves of Q. serrata exhibited comparable ranges in antioxidant activities. The data suggest that for some species, anthocyanins can supplement the pool of low molecular weight antioxidants but are not a prerequisite for protection from oxidative stress. It is likely that the localised accumulation of anthocyanins in the leaves of Q. serrata serves to shield photosynthetic tissues that are the more susceptible to photodamage. In conclusion, the accumulation of anthocyanins represents a multifunctional mechanism to; i) directly reduce ROS through scavenging and possibly metal chelation, acting in conjunction with other antioxidants, and ii) to shield photosynthetic processes experiencing excessive irradiances, thereby reducing the extent of photooxidation, photoinhibition, and wasteful dissipatory systems. Such protection may be vital for leaves experiencing stressful environments.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/497</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Packetised wireless communication systems in interference limited environments</field><field name="creator">Orange, Matthew</field><field name="description">There is a strong likelihood that future wireless communication systems will employ packetised transmission techniques. Such an approach would provide a number of benefits, including the ability to integrate with emerging wired systems based on Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM). In addition, packet-based wireless networks would allow for diverse traffic types and in particular, speech and data traffic, to be integrated more readily. This thesis presents theoretical models and performance studies for various interference limited, packet-based, speech and data wireless communication systems. Two packetised random access protocols are considered for investigation, namely Slotted ALOHA (S-ALOHA) and Packet Reservation Multiple Access (PRMA). The S-ALOHA protocol is designed specifically for data traffic, whereas the PRMA protocol is optimised for speech traffic, with the ability to also cater for data traffic. Previously published research into S-ALOHA and PRMA has generally focused on the performance of these protocols in idealised single cell systems, free from cochannel interference. Previous studies have normally only considered simple signal propagation models that give little or no consideration to signal variability. A common assumption made in previous studies assumes that all packets involved in collisions with other packets are lost, while those packets received in the absence of other packets are received successfully. In this thesis, the performance of S-ALOHA and PRMA in more realistic multiple cell configurations, namely the outdoor cellular and in-building pico-cellular environments, has been considered. The fluctuations in received signal strengths have been modeled in this thesis using narrowband statistical propagation models. In addition, the assumption relating to packet collisions has been reconsidered in this thesis because practical receivers are often capable of locking onto one packet in the presence of other intra-cell and inter-cell interfering packets, due to the receiver capture effect. A capture probability model has been developed in this thesis, which defines the probability of a desired packet capturing the central cell base station in the presence of both intra-cell and inter-cell interfering packets. Accompanying Markov analysis theory has been developed to analyse the performance of multiple cell S-ALOHA and PRMA systems. Having developed the necessary framework, it has been possible to successfully analyse various multiple cell S-ALOHA and PRMA systems. These include a multiple cell data-only S-ALOHA system, multiple cell speech-only PRMA systems with and without selection diversity and speech packet retransmission and an integrated speech-data multiple cell PRMA system with selection diversity and speech packet retransmission.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/498</field></doc><doc><field name="title">High-resolution splatting</field><field name="creator">Kulka, Peter</field><field name="description">Volume rendering is a research area within scientific visualisation, where images are computed from volumetric data sets for visual exploration. Such data sets are typically generated by Computer aided Tomography, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Positron Emission Tomography or gained from simulations. The data sets are usually interpreted using optical models that assign optical properties to the volume and define the illumination and shading behaviour. Volume rendering techniques may be divided into three classes: object-order, image-order or hybrid methods. Image-order or ray casting methods shoot rays from the view plane into the volume and simulate the variation of light intensities along those rays. Object-order techniques traverse the volume data set and project each volume element onto the view plane. Hybrid volume rendering techniques combine these two approaches. A very popular object-order rendering method is called splatting. This technique traverses the volume data set and projects the optical properties of each volume element onto the view plane. This thesis consists of two parts. The first part introduces two new splatting methods, collectively called high-resolution splatting, which are based on standard splatting. Both high-resolution splatting methods correct errors of splatting by applying major modifications. We propose the first method, called fast high-resolution splatting, as an alternative to standard splatting. It may be used for quick previewing, since it is faster than standard splatting and the resulting images are significantly sharper. Our second method, called complete high-resolution splatting, improves the volume reconstruction, which results in images that are very close to those produced by ray casting methods.  The second part of the thesis incorporates wavelet analysis into high-resolution splatting. Wavelet analysis is a mathematical theory that decomposes volumes into multi-resolution hierarchies, which may be used to find coherence within volumes. The combination of wavelets with the high-resolution splatting method has the two advantages. Firstly the extended splatting method, called high-resolution wavelet splatting, can be directly applied to wavelet transformed volume data sets without performing an inverse transform. Secondly when visualising wavelet compressed volumes, only a small fraction of the wavelet coefficients need to be projected.  For all three versions of the new high-resolution splatting method, complexity analyses, comprehensive error and performance analyses as well as implementation details are discussed.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Volume Rendering</field><field name="subject">Volume Visualization</field><field name="subject">Splatting</field><field name="subject">Wavelets</field><field name="subject">Ray casting</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/503</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contracting Cost Determinants of the Accounting Change for Income Tax</field><field name="creator">Wong, Norman</field><field name="description">This thesis adopts a contracting cost perspective to examine the decision of firms in New Zealand to change their accounting policy for income tax. It uses efficient contracting theory to posit that firms change to new accounting procedures if they lead to firm value maximisation. Specifically, an empirical study and six case studies are presented. These examine the contracting cost determinants of the decision of firms to change from the comprehensive tax allocation procedure to the partial tax allocation procedure to account for income tax which has the effect of (a) reducing the income tax expense recognised in the statement of financial performance, thereby increasing earnings after tax, and (b) reducing the deferred tax liability reported in the statement of financial position. I hypothesise that, under the comprehensive tax allocation procedure firms experiencing growth in depreciable assets encounter economic "friction" (i.e., contracting costs that do not maximise firm value). This is because comprehensive tax allocation recognises deferred tax liabilities which may not result in cash outflows, thereby producing an unintended and potentially ever growing liability on the statement of financial position. Overstatement of these liabilities could result in inadvertent adverse consequences such as perceived increased risk, leading to higher borrowing costs and debt covenant violation which is costly. As a result, these firms are likely to switch accounting procedures to mitigate the friction. Further, these firms are also likely to recontract with debtholders to incorporate the new, more efficient accounting technology (i.e., the partial tax allocation procedure) for monitoring compliance with the debt covenants. The results suggest the following. First, the extent of investment in depreciable assets, which gives rise to depreciation timing differences thereby increasing deferred tax liabilities, is an important determinant in the firms' decision to change interperiod tax allocation policy to the partial basis. In particular, firms that change are more likely to have greater levels and rates of investments in depreciable assets than those firms that remain using the comprehensive basis. This is consistent with the efficient contracting argument. Second, firms that change to the partial basis are more likely to include partial deferred tax liabilities in their leverage ratio calculations by choosing to do one of the following: (l) companies change their accounting-based debt covenants to allow the explicit inclusion of partial deferred tax liabilities; or (2) companies do not need to change their accounting-based debt covenants to include partial deferred tax liabilities if the accounting-based debt covenants already allow this; or (3) companies do not need to change their accounting-based debt covenants to include partial deferred tax liabilities if the accounting-based debt covenants state that liabilities include those reported using the accounting policies in the financial statements. The specification of any of these policies in companies' debt contracts is the result of efficient contracting. All these options are written in debt contracts to enable the efficient accounting policy to be used in calculating the leverage ratio constraint when changing firm circumstances create unintended economic "friction" with the use of an inefficient accounting policy. While there is empirical support for the efficient contracting argument, the effect that opportunism may have on firms' decision to change to the partial tax allocation basis cannot be totally ruled out.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/520</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Influence of Environmental Factors on Reproduction and Recruitment of Macomona liliana (Class: Bivalvia) in Manukau Harbour, New ZeaLand</field><field name="creator">Taylor, Michael D.</field><field name="description">The tellinid bivalve, Macomona liliana, is important to the structure and organisation of intertidal sandflat communities in Manukau Harbour. This thesis reports on features of the reproductive, larval supply and recruitment biology of Macomona liliana in relation to environmental factors in the harbour. Macomona liliana is gonochoric. In a mid-tide population sexual maturity occurred in animals &#8805; 22 mm (shell length). Spawning is asynchronous and protracted from late November to March throughout the harbour and timing of the reproductive cycle is associated with seasonal changes in environmental variables: temperature, salinity and seasonal production of phytoplankton and benthic microalgae. A visual gonad index was useful for establishing the main periods of spawning activity. Favourable habitats are at mid-tide on the large exposed sandflats characterised by well sorted fine sands. Less favourable habitats are in sheltered bays characterised by moderate-poorly sorted sands. A delay in the onset of gametogenesis in small compared to large adults (July-August of. May-June) indicates size and/or age dependent resource allocation to growth and reproduction. Adult size classes are evenly represented in favourable habitats whereas in less favourable habitats size classes are dominated by small adults. Favourable habitats have an equal sex ratio or are biased towards females whereas in less favourable habitats the converse is true. Early life-history stages are described and techniques employed to facilitate their identification in plankton and sediment samples. A spatial Taylor's Power Plot (slope, b = 1.31) demonstrates thorough mixing of larvae in the main channels. Spatial autocorrelation models confirm that densities of larvae are higher to the south of Karore Bank than to the north. The recruitment period is December to early March but varies between successive years. Physical transport processes, post-settlement migration and high levels of mortality in Boccardia syrtis tube-mats dominate recruitment patterns in the high energy environments. Larval supply and active habitat selection by settling larvae may, however, be significant determinants of population structure in sheltered bays. Generalisations are made on the effect of habitat quality on the reproduction and recruitment biology of the Manukau Harbour metapopulation.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/521</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An integrated approach to the analysis of the circadian clock of the blow fly Lucilia cuprina</field><field name="creator">Warman, Guy Robert</field><field name="description">The Australian sheep blow fly Lucilia cuprina is an economically important dipteran pest whose circadian behavioural rhythms have been the subject of considerable scrutiny. The underlying biochemical nature of these rhythms however, has remained a mystery. The primary objective of this thesis was therefore to investigate the molecular control of circadian rhythms in L. cuprina using an integrative approach. To these ends, a dynamic molecular simulation model for L. cuprina was formulated using existing biochemical data on insect circadian clocks. The validity of this simulation model was subsequently tested at both molecular and behavioural levels. The basic molecular assumptions of the simulation model were tested by cloning a full length L. cuprina per cDNA and analysing its mRNA and protein expression levels. Isolation of the 4 Kb L. cuprina per cDNA revealed the conservation of three functional domains known to be important for circadian clock function; namely the PAS dimerisation motif (with 92% identity to D. melanogaster at the amino acid level), and the cytoplasmic and nuclear localisation domains (with 85% and 80% identity respectively). A fourth domain, the threonine-glycine (TG) repeat region, was also found to be conserved, but severely truncated in L. cuprina. No length variation was found in the TG repeat of flies collected from several different latitudinal zones, and no correlation was detected between sequences flanking the repeat and latitude of collection of flies. Thus, the contention that the TG repeat region plays a role in temperature compensation of the circadian clock is cast in doubt. Expression analyses (using quantitative RT-PCR) showed per mRNA levels to undergo diel oscillations with a period (24 h) and peak phase (Zt 12) consistent with the Drosophila data. PER-immunoreactive protein oscillations were also demonstrated, with peak immunoreactivity lagging approximately 3 h behind peak mRNA levels. The behavioural predictions of the model were tested by recording adult locomotor activity under different light regimes. The simulation model successfully predicted free-run, entrainment, the effect of short light pulses, and the effects of constant lighting on behavioural rhythms. Disparities between the simulated and real phase response cnrves for L. cuprina are hypothesised to be indicative of an ealier nuclear entry time of the PER-TIM dimer in L. cuprina compared with D. melanogaster. The three different approaches of simulation modellingo molecular analysis and behavioural investigation are integrated in the discussion in order to help provide a comprehensive explanation of circadian function in L. cuprina. The benefits of an integrated approach to the analysis of circadian function are discussed, as is the relevance of the present findings to the development of a clock-based control strategy for this economically important pest species.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology::270505 Entomology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/518</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hei tautoko i te reo : Maori language regeneration and wha&#772;nau bookreading practices</field><field name="creator">Hohepa, Margie Kahukura</field><field name="description">I nga rua tekau ma rima tau nei ka puta ake &#275;tahi kaupapa m&#257;tauranga hei whakaora i te reo t&#363;turu o Aotearoa, i te reo M&#257;ori me &#333;na tikanga.

This thesis explores the premise that in order for such educational initiatives to be effective, those who have intimate contact with students in their personal domains of life also need to be interacting with them in the target language. It examines interactions in family literacy practices as a constitutive context for adult M&#257;ori language elaboration and acquisition processes. 'Literacy' is conceived as providing tools within sociocultural practices to amplify M&#257;ori language regeneration and cultural persistence. Across two separate studies the home literacy practices of ten families with new entrant children in a M&#257;ori medium sclooling initiative, kura kaupapa M&#257;ori, are examined. The results of the studies indicate that specific literacy-related strategies sited in bookreading with 5 year olds can increase the use of M&#257;ori language within homes, thereby increasing the effectiveness of M&#257;ori language regeneration programmes and initiatives across school and family settings.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/517</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dipolarity and God</field><field name="creator">Brimblecombe, Mark D.</field><field name="description">The Christian doctrine of the Trinity is about one God in three divine persons, with one of these three becoming human (without ceasing to be divine) in Jesus of Nazareth. The concept of dipolarity is about the combination of complementary but opposite principles. The most widely recognised examples of this concept are one-many and being-becoming. But what is not so recognised is that these dipolarities are clearly illustrated in the Christian doctrine of God as Trinity. By contrast, philosophers and theologians throughout history have often attempted to reconcile or synthesise these dipolar 'opposites', or to place one over the other. This quest, enshrined in Neoplatonic philosophy, has influenced the development of the Christian doctrine of God (less so in regard to the particular doctrine of the Trinity just mentioned). Divine 'Oneness' and 'Being' have often been regarded as exclusive of 'many'and 'becoming'. But the theological insight that God the Trinity is a relational and active personal being, may be contrasted with this depiction of God as singular absolute and beyond becoming. From a trinitarian foundation, a theology of God can be developed which expresses both the being-becoming and one-many dipolarities. This means revising elements of traditional Christian theism, especially in regard to understanding the eternal and unchangeable God as also becoming and many (in relation).</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/567</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ripe for Harvest</field><field name="creator">Brailsford, Ian</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/516</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Occurrence and Characterisation of Enterococci in Terrestrial and Aquatic Environments</field><field name="creator">Anderson, Sally Ann</field><field name="description">The use of enterococci as a microbiological indicator of water quality requires an understanding of the sources, persistence, and ecology of this group of bacteria in the environment. This research describes a series of investigations undertaken to describe the abundance, occurrence, and diversity of enterococci from aquatic and terrestrial environments. A screening protocol for environmentally sourced enterococci was developed to describe species and sub-species variability. This protocol combined classical microbiological methods of selective culture and biochemical characterisation, with molecular techniques including gene probe screening for identity and RAPD-PCR for genotypic diversity. Preliminary studies on the occurrence of enterococci in terrestrial and aquatic environments suggested that these organisms are ubiquitous. However, abundance varied between individual samples taken from terrestrial (e.g. leaf litter, sand, seaweed, animal faeces) or aquatic (marine or freshwater) environments, complicating the ability to predict the enterococci load from these sources. Enumeration of enterococci from bathing beach environments indicated occasionally high levels from seaweed and sand, where levels of up to 660 CFU/100 g (wet weight) were recorded from aged and degrading seaweed but not from fresh seaweed samples. Restriction enzyme analysis (REA) of isolates from degraded seaweed indicated a dominance of clonal populations and supported the notion of replication or survival of strains. Laboratory studies conducted to investigate enterococci persistence and growth on seaweed were not conclusive, although there was some evidence to suggest enterococci replication was occurring. This was indicated by molecular fingerprinting (REA analysis), which showed that the inoculated strain persisted for the full duration of experiments (up to 28 days). The isolation of non-inoculum strains from seaweed treatments, combined with increased abundance of these strains with incubation, suggested the persistence or replication of enterococci that were naturally occurring on seaweed. To investigate the occurrence of enterococci in bathing environments a statistical analysis of Auckland Regional Council (ARC) bathing water quality data was undertaken. This analysis indicated a strong positive correlation between enterococci and turbidity, and hence turbidity may serve as a useful physical measure to indicate deteriorating water quality. Surveys of three marine bathing beaches on Auckland's North Shore (Long Bay, Mairangi Bay, and Rothesay Bay) indicated the abundance of enterococci in all bathing beach environments surveyed. These included marine and fresh water, sand, seaweed, and stream sediment, and a significant association between enterococci levels found in the sand and in the seaweed. Enterococci screening protocols were evaluated for use in describing enterococci species and sub-species diversity in bathing beach environments. This investigation showed a diversity of enterococci from all beach environmental sources, with highest levels of species diversity from marine and stream water. Enterococci diversity did not provide clues as to the sources in marine water samples. RAPD-PCR analysis and phenotypic screening of enterococci isolates did not indicate a pattern of niche-specific associations of enterococci strains, and there was no strong evidence from this study that enterococci sub-species associate with specific environments. However, the presence of identical genotypes indicated that enterococci can persist and possibly replicate in environments such as sand and seaweed. Calculation of similarity coefficients from Ent. faecalis and Ent. casseliflavus sub-species groupings indicated a greater level of sub-specific similarity between selected environments, for example, seaweed:sand, marine water:stream water, seaweed:marine water, although this was not a guarantee that environments were biologically or ecologically associated. Where an elevated level of enterococci is measured in the absence in identifiable pollution source the separation of pigmented from non-pigmented enterococci was proposed as an indicator of the environmental or faecal nature of the enterococci within the sample. Although not tested under controlled conditions, this concept was found to have good utility for discriminating sources from elevated marine bathing water samples. Enterococci from one of 13 elevated ARC marine water samples examined was shown to be environmentally derived, with 5 of the 13 samples attributed to putative human or animal faecal sources. With further validation, this concept may be a useful means of determining source.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/523</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The retention of picoplankton by the pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, and implications for oyster culture</field><field name="creator">Bell, Andrew Harwood</field><field name="description">Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) farming in New Zealand has reached a point where the pressures on resources appear likely to constrain current, and future, development. To maintain industry growth, security of juvenile oyster (spat) supply and productivity gains within the existing farm leases, are becoming industry imperatives. The use of hatchery technology could achieve both of these requirements, but it is expensive to establish and maintain. The additional expense of a hatchery could be offset by the establishment of, for example, a selective breeding program to enhance oyster productivity and/or marketability. Consequently a pilot-scale oyster hatchery facility was constructed to investigate the potential for establishing hatchery production of Pacific oysters in New Zealand. This study showed that in the pilot-scale hatchery, oysters could be successfully spawned from in-season broodstock, the eggs fertilised and the resultant larvae reared through to settlement for on-growing to adult size. This process was successful for both oysters selected for morphological characteristics and those which were not. On-growing of the resultant stock indicated growth rate could be normal relative to wild caught oysters spat, although data was limited by the small scale of the experiment. However, an investigation of broodstock conditioning, to achieve out-of-season spawning, was less successful. Disease occurred and condition was lost in some broodstock, suggesting they were enduring stress within the conditioning system. The microalgal food supply was examined but the clearance rate of the microalgal species suggested they were an acceptable feed supply which agreed with previous reports of successful conditioning techniques. Comparing the pilot-scale facility in this study with descriptions of facilities which reported successful broodstock conditioning suggested that the use of a microfiltered recirculating water supply, as opposed to the more common flow-through, natural seawater systems containing a range of small size particles, limited necessary nutrient and/or maturation factors and may have had a significant impact on conditioning. The nanoplanktonic (&lt; 10 &#956;m), food resource, which includes key microalgal species such as Chaetoceros spp. and Isochrysis spp., is generally considered the primary food resource for suspension feeding bivalves, including C. gigas. However, the picoplanktonic fraction (&lt; 3 &#956;m) can provide the largest proportion of this food resource in the water column in terms of abundance and biomass. Consequently, an investigation of the in situ retention of picoplankton populations (picoeukaryotes, Synechococcus-type cyanobacteria and heterotrophic bacteria) by oysters was undertaken. Flow cytometry was used to quantify the picoplankton populations in water samples taken from the inhalant and exhalant feeding currents of individual oysters, allowing retention efficiency of the particles to be calculated. Five picoplankton populations were identifiable by flow cytometry (picoeukaryotes, heterotrophic bacteria and 3 populations tentatively identified as cyanobacteria) and accounted for a large proportion (up to 97 %) of the estimated available carbon (picoplankton + microalgae) in Kerikeri Inlet water. Generally the heterotrophic bacteria accounted for the largest proportion of the biomass with up to 564 &#177; 51 ng C ml-1. Retention of each picoplankton population was found to be variable and not directly related to particle concentration. Cyanobacteria (Cy2 population) were retained with the greatest efficiency (up to 42 &#177; 4.4 %), followed by heterotrophic bacteria (up to 38 &#177; 4.5 %) and picoeukaryotes (up to 12 &#177; 3.8 %). Overall more picoplankton biomass was retained during the summer months, of which the heterotrophic bacteria made the largest contribution in either cell number or estimated carbon retained. Tracking of the condition and constituent fractions (glycogen, lipid and protein) of the subject oysters showed that in the summer months, post-spawn, these levels were lowest, indicting a period of nutritional stress. This appeared to suggest that C. gigas was able to alter its retention efficiency to expand the range of particles captured, and consequently the available nutrient pool. The retention of greater quantities of heterotrophic bacteria may allow for the acquisition of essential nutrients required for growth and later gametogenesis (such as B vitamins). However, it is also possible that the heterotrophic bacteria mediate access to otherwise inaccessible, or inefficiently accessed, nutrient resources through their degradation of, for example, crystalline cellulose. Consequently, the microbial flora associated with the oyster gut was investigated. An initial investigation, cultivating bacteria from gut contents, showed considerable variability in the numbers of colonies present within and between samples, but was inconclusive for identifying differences in species diversity. Using culture independent histological and 16S rDNA PCR/RFLP techniques to investigate the oyster gut microflora a spirochaete flora, commonly associated with bivalve crystalline styles, was clearly present. Molecular analyses provided evidence of other bacterial in the gut. A signature RFLP band pattern was found in oysters at low tide and this generally reoccurred in oysters that had been immersed for varying lengths of time up to high tide. However, the signature RFLP pattern became more dilute as immersion time/potential feeding time extended. The isolation of culturable bacteria from the oyster gut allowed characterisation and identification of a subset of the oyster gut microflora. 16S rDNA sequence analysis from selected isolates showed a predominance of Vibrio spp. These bacteria had previously been associated with marine molluscs, including as symbionts. Characterisation of these and other isolates from oyster gut showed a diversity of attributes including the ability to degrade cellulose. This suggests the bacterial production of enzymes, such as cellulases, which have been reported by other researchers as being present in ineffectual or low native levels in oysters. Consequently the bacterial presence in the oyster gut may be essential to efficient nutrient acquisition. The results of these investigations have highlighted the potential importance of the heterotrophic bacteria to C. gigas. To date, bacteria have received relatively little attention in terms of their potential nutritive contribution to oysters, primarily due to observations that they are retained with low efficiency. However, even at low retention efficiencies the potential nutritive contribution is large due to the available abundances of heterotrophic bacteria. While the mechanisms and controls of bivalve suspension feeding have yet to be fully elucidated, the published literature indicates that selective mechanisms are available to bivalves including C. gigas and this current research suggests that even pico-sized particles, retained with apparently low efficiency, can be subject to selection. The importance of the heterotrophic bacteria to C. gigas requires further investigation as it will have implications for not only hatchery production, but also farm management, public health and environmental impact monitoring.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/504</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular and Ecological Aspects of Heliothis Armigera</field><field name="creator">Waghorn, Tania Susanne</field><field name="description">The species status and host range of Heliothis armigera was investigated. DNA profiling, mitochondrial DNA sequencing, RAPD's, along with traditional morphological and crossing methods were used to investigate micro, macro and mega-population structuring. Thirty-six new host records were added, of which a number are important common weeds and crops. Mortality due to parasitoids and fungal infections were quantified on many host species. Genetic analysis of the COII and the AT-rich regions of the mitochondrial DNA showed very high levels of variation, as did the DNA profiling using the probes (CA)n and 33.15. The morphological analyses also showed variation, but to a lesser degree and without statistical significance. The variation found at all levels and in all aspects is discussed with respect to caterpillar host-plants and geographical location. All host-plant populations of caterpillars showed very high levels of genetic variability. However, the population of caterpillars found on Sulla (Hedysarium coronarium) was significantly more variable than those found on Lotus and Lucerne when compared using DNA profiling. The sequences obtained from the two mtDNA regions also showed considerable variation, a great percentage of which was uninformative. This variation did not allude to any structuring of caterpillar populations with respect to host-plant or geographical location. H. armigera is genetically a very variable species which does not equate with any population structuring present in the host-plant or geographical populations investigated here. This study has greatly increased the general understanding of this insect, and has elucidated a portion of the genetic makeup, but not helped in the development any new control methods.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology::270505 Entomology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/522</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Science in the social sphere: weather-modification and public response</field><field name="creator">Matthewman, Steven David</field><field name="description">This thesis is organised around two questions: how do we explain planned weather-modification's shifting scientific status, and how do we explain public opposition to weather-modification programmes? The last four decades have seen weather-modification oscillate wildly between pseudo-science, orthodox science, and now apparently, bad science. Paradoxically, widespread private scientific scepticism towards weather-modification has been matched by wholesale public belief in its efficacy. Weather-modifiers have been accused of causing drought instead of creating rain, of ruining harvests rather than encouraging cultivated wealth. Public groups have objected to this most social science on aesthetic, cultural, economic, environmental, legal and theological grounds. Far from being an interesting aside in meteorological history, weather-modification lurks perpetually on the policy horizon. To therefore ignore the circumstances under which weather-modification was first legitimised is foolish, since the recurrence of these material conditions could reinstate its scientific position despite scanty evidence of its efficacy. Not only is the current practice of weather-modification a waste of time and money, it postpones pressing decisions regarding water allocation and conservation, and it annoys a lot of people in the process. In the final analysis, attempts at weather-modification illustrate many key issues surrounding the relationships between and among science, technology and society, for the weather-modification story tells us important things about the problems that arise when there is no time lag between a supposed breakthrough and its subsequent application, the difficulties which scientists encounter when working in politically charged atmospheres, and the problems that follow when such work intrudes upon the public domain.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/575</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Trade Policy, Processing, and New Zealand Forestry</field><field name="creator">Gilbert, John</field><field name="description">The New Zealand forestry sector is well recognised as being amongst the oldest and most historically, politically, and economically significant sectors in this country's European history. In recent years, in particular those following the major restructuring of the industry which took place in the latter half of the 1980s, the forestry industry has come under increasing scrutiny for its potential as a major source of export revenue for New Zealand, as supplies have begun to vastly outstrip demand. The sector is also a significant employer, and contributor to national income. Moreover, it is an industry which has come to embody the current New Zealand debate on foreign ownership, environmental concerns, and in particular, the costs and benefits of encouraging the domestic processing of New Zealand's resources. However, despite its substantial importance to the New Zealand economy, surprisingly little extensive research has been undertaken on the forestry sector. This is particularly so with respect to trade policy aspects. It is a well accepted fact that there has been an imbalance of effort within New Zealand which has led to numerous models of the forest resource and limited attention to the market, and in particular models of the small open economy and international trade. This study partially corrects this imbalance. It identifies and examines three core issues with respect to the issue of  log export restrictions; the impact on processing and welfare; the effect of foreign ownership of the resource in respect of the income transfers which result from processing incentives: and the possibility of utilising export restrictions as a retaliatory strategy against escalating tariff structures. It also examines the impact of  liberalisation of forestry products trade on a region-wide basis. The methodology employed in this study is a combination of formal economic modelling, and counterfactual simulation using computable general equilibrium (CGE) modelling techniques. We make use of both our own purpose-built single country model, and the existing GTAP model in our simulations. The study makes a contribution to the existing literature by incorporating foreign ownership into a formal analysis of processing incentives, developing a new CGE model of the New Zealand economy which incorporates econometric estimates of key relational parameters, utilising this model to evaluate the costs of export restrictions - which are shown to be substantial, and utilising the GTAP to provide insights into the possible effect of the APEC Early Voluntary Sector Liberalisation strategy - where we find evidence to suggest that MFN liberalisation by APEC members may lower group welfare.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/515</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An evaluation of piano sound and vibration leading to improvements through modification of the material properties of the structure</field><field name="creator">Keane, Martin</field><field name="description">A study of vibrations and sound radiation in upright and grand pianos has been made to determine whether the piano may be improved by altering the materials of the component parts which are traditionally fabricated in timber.  Modal analysis and sound level measurements of an upright piano has shown that the radiation from the case is at least 20 dB lower than the radiation from the soundboard, and therefore the case is not a significant determinant of piano tone.  A method was developed for separating piano sound and vibrations into broadband and tonal components and used to compare the performance of upright and grand pianos. Using this method it was found that the broadband vibration level was twice as high in the uprights as in the grands.  A finite element model of an upright piano was developed and used to demonstrate that replacing the keybed with a higher impedance material than conventionally used would reduce the key vibration level, and hence bring the uprights closer in performance to grand pianos, and improve the 'feel' of the instrument for the player. The keybed of one of a pair of identical pianos was replaced with high density fibreboard, and subsequent objective measurements showed that the broadband component of key vibrations was reduced by 3.2 dB while the radiated sound was unchanged. A controlled subjective comparison between the modified and unmodified pianos undertaken by experienced players showed that a statistically significant number preferred the modified piano, and that the upright piano had been improved.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Piano</field><field name="subject">Pibration</field><field name="subject">Modal analysis</field><field name="subject">Finite element model</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1430</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Economic evaluation of active labour market policy in New Zealand 1989 to 1997</field><field name="creator">Perry, Geoffrey E</field><field name="description">Active labour market programmes are an important component of government labour market policy internationally and in New Zealand. The growth in unemployment, and in particular male and long term unemployment, since the mid 1980's in New Zealand have contributed to the enhanced role of active labour market programmes in government policy. In the early 1990's the New Zealand government introduced a menu of interventions including subsidy, work experience and training programmes. Concomitant with this development has been increased pressure from political, business and social groups to assess the effectiveness of this approach in lowering unemployment. The aim of this thesis is to evaluate the effect of active labour market policy utilised in New Zealand from 1989 to 1997. Whether or not these active labour market interventions were beneficial to those males who participated in them, the effect of treatment upon the treated, is the parameter estimated. The range of programmes makes it possible to analyse a number of programme evaluation issues. These include the overall question of the impact of subsidy, work experience and training programmes in general, but also other specific research questions. In particular the range of subsidy programmes makes it possible to identify that subsidies to private sector firms are more effective than those to public sector organisations. The effectiveness of start-up subsidies for the unemployed are also evaluated and found to be beneficial. The effects of participation upon selected education and ethnic groups are also estimated. Since there is no one estimation approach that works in all circumstances, both regression and matching estimators are used. In order to achieve this it is necessary to create two estimation datasets as the data requirements vary for each technique. The main findings from the research are that participation in active labour market programmes is beneficial in reducing the length of time that participants are registered as unemployed. Work experience programmes have the largest impact, followed by subsidies. The effect of training programmes is smallest. The major beneficial effect occurs in the year following participation and then reduces in subsequent years. There are also some important methodological findings, including the sensitivity of results to the time frame, to the datasets chosen, and to the estimation techniques used.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/525</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Place as Occupational Histories: Towards an Understanding of Deflated Surface Artefact Distributions in the West Darling, New South Wales, Australia</field><field name="creator">Shiner, Justin Ian</field><field name="description">This thesis develops theoretical and methodological approaches to the investigation of deflated surface stone artefact scatters beyond those that emphasise synchronic behavioural interpretations. The study is undertaken on Pine Point and Langwell Stations, two adjoining pastoral leases south of Broken Hill in arid Western New South Wales, Australia. The main objective of the study is to investigate long-term accumulated patterns in stone artefact assemblage composition within archaeological deposits with known occupational chronologies. These are derived from the dating of charcoal from heat retainer hearths. It is argued that the Pine Point-Langwell assemblages represent multiple episodes of accumulation over the last 2,000 years. Therefore, the formation of the Pine Point-Langwell assemblages means they are ideal for the investigation of long-term accumulated patterns. To analyse the composition of the Pine Point-Langwell assemblages, the concepts of artefact use life, curation, the intensity of raw material utilisation and occupation intensity are used. These permit the investigation of assemblage accumulation as a temporal process. Assemblages are not thought of as synchronic functional sets but rather as the consequence of repeated and discontinuous discard episodes overtime. As occupation intensity increases, so does the intensity of raw material utilisation. Cores and tools will be worked more intensively and assemblages will be dominated by local raw material, as access to distant sources becomes restricted. Analysis of the composition of the Pine Point-Langwell assemblages indicates both consistencies and inconsistencies in the reduction and utilisation of lithic raw materials. Some of the consistencies are argued to reflect the character and distribution of the wider lithic landscape. In general, there is a distance decay relationship in the reduction of silcrete. This relationship is not evident in all measures of reduction intensity. Variation in measures of core reduction is interpreted to reflect the variable nature of occupation through time at each of the locations in both duration and frequency. Over the time span represented in the Pine Point-Langwell occupational chronology, multiple behavioural patterns result in internal assemblage variability. Environmental variability may also contribute to the formation of variable assemblage patterns. There is evidence from south western NSW for environmental oscillation over the period represented by the occupational chronologies in the Pine Point-Langwell study area. This is interpreted as a possible impulse for the punctuated record of human occupation in the area during the last 2000 years. Hiatuses in the occupational chronology provide further evidence of the variability associated with the formation of the assemblages. Finally, notions of continuity and discontinuity in assemblage formation are explored across the wider region of Western NSW. Late Holocene assemblages from Fowlers Gap and Burkes Cave are compared to the Pine Point-Langwell assemblages. It is concluded that the approaches to reconstructing past settlement systems in the Australian arid zone are based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the formation of deflated archaeological deposits. This in turn leads to the use of inappropriate interpretive frameworks for the archaeological record. These frameworks often ignore chronology and assume both contemporaniety and consistency in behaviour through time. This denies the opportunity to investigate the diachronic aspects of deflated deposits, both in terms of occupational chronologies and discontinuities in raw material management and reduction.

There have been fewer investigations to develop a comprehensive model that includes the effects of personal and environmental variables on both action and on the development of attitudes and personality traits related to motivated behaviour. This thesis aims to integrate several such approaches within the context of a developing model of action and personality (Krampen, 1988), the Rotter tradition of social learning theory, and Bandura's more cognitive approach to motivation. In order to explore the utility of this action-theoretical model of personality a number of measures of motivation, person and environmental variables were administered to a group of Year 12 students from 4 English classes in each of 3 different schools. These measures included a new multi-dimensional locus of control instrument which incorporates a measure of self-efficacy. These data were analysed for between-group differences by school, class-within school, sex, classroom climate and locus of control cluster. A major aim was to check for interaction effects between personality and environmental measures, particularly as they impact on motivated behaviour. The environmental factors had a more powerful effect on motivated behaviour than the personality measures. In particular that aspect of classroom climate measured by the 'affiliation' scale appears to be critical in relation to motivation. Results are discnssed in terms of their contribution to the further development of the proposed interactive model, and in terms of their implications for educational practice and further research.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/776</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Personal Constructs of Organisational Identity and Identification Following Education Reform in the New Zealand Polytechnic Sector</field><field name="creator">Conroy, Denise M.</field><field name="description">Organisations face massive changes as they adapt to mergers, takeovers, downsizing or simply adding .com to their name, and all of these changes challenge the organisation's identity. Despite this understanding, little research has been done in the area of how employees react to a change in their organisation's identity, and how such a change may impact upon their own identification. The New Zealand environment represented a unique opportunity to address this gap in the literature. Local expressions of worldwide economic reform have been swift and extensive, with the commercialisation of the tertiary sector presenting a rare opportunity for exploring how change impacts upon the organisation's identity and employees' identification. From this base, the following research question was developed: How do polytechnic tutors interpret the changes to their organisation's identity and their own identification, following education reform in the New Zealand polytechnic sector? A constructivist approach was used" utilising three means of inquiry. Firstly, three separate institutes were selected, with the business school being the site of inquiry for each Case. At each site, repertory grid interviews with long-term employees were conducted to generate data at the level of the individual, and at the level of the organisation. And finally, semi-structured interviews were undertaken with senior management to provide background information on strategic direction and vision. A content analysis of both the repertory grid interviews and the semi-structured interviews provided a rigorous process of analysis. Results from this research make several contributions to our knowledge of identity and identification. The data revealed that the organisation's identity consists of a plurality of identities, with one overarching Meta Identity. Whilst other aspects of identity may change to adapt to the demands of the external environment, the Meta Identity is far more resilient, or 'sticky.' In addition to revealing the hierarchical nature of organisational identity, the data also demonstrate evidence of two paths for employees 'becoming' identified, specifically emulation and affiliation. The findings also indicate that whilst change may not create a reduction in the strength of identification, it may create a change in the need it is serving for the employee. Such changes can be detrimental to both the employee and the organisation.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/749</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reciprocal Teaching as a School-Wide Inclusive Strategy</field><field name="creator">Westera, Wilhelmina Julia</field><field name="description">Informed selection, development and implementation of inclusive teaching practices are critical with the move towards more inclusive education evident in recent major policy changes in New Zealand. In this thesis, guiding questions for validating inclusive teaching practices were extended to include a school-wide approach. These questions guided a review of the literature on reciprocal teaching (RT), a metacognitive method for teaching reading comprehension, to examine its potential as an inclusive method. They were also used to examine the findings from two implementation studies using RT within inclusive and culturally diverse urban classrooms in a school-wide approach. In the high school study, RT was introduced after a systemic analysis showed the need for a school-wide approach to pervasive reading comprehension problems. In a collaborative effort between departments, English, social studies and learning support teachers were supported in incorporating RT into the regular curriculum and timetable. Four classroom teachers with two support teachers were trained and ran eight RT groups for the lowest reading comprehenders within seven classrooms. In the primary school study, RT was incorporated into four Year 4 and 5 inclusive classrooms at syndicate level. Half of each class (Group One) was matched on reading comprehension (high, medium, and low) and in prior experience of RT, with the other half of each class (Group Two). Group One completed the intervention in the first part of the year, whilst Group Two formed a no treatment comparison condition. Group Two completed the intervention in the second part of the year. In both studies, teachers and teacher aides were trained and supported into the use of the new procedure, including in-class observations, feedback and regular discussions during intervention. In the primary school study, specific adaptations to the RT method were also made by read aloud, tape-assisted, and prior repeated practice methods, for students new to the English language, and those with special needs. Statistically significant gains on reading comprehension scores were observed with the 20 high school students who received an extended RT programme (with 12 to 16 sessions), whereas no significant differences were observed with 26 students in the short programme (6 to 8 sessions) and control groups. Follow-up assessments of extended programme students showed maintenance of comprehension gains. This study highlighted the need to introduce preventative and inclusive metacognitive instruction methods not only at high school, but also earlier. With intervention in the primary school study, low comprehenders (n=41), including those who had prior experience with RT, made practically significant gains not only on reading comprehension, but also on decoding. Further, all students (n=103) made significant gains on a measure of metacognitive awareness of reading strategies, but not on measures of reading comprehension and reading attitudes. Analysis of data on programme adherence showed that students had high participation rates and regular use of all four cognitive strategies throughout the intervention. In terms of programme adherence by instructors during the group dialogue, there was an appropriate focus on idea rather than word level, but scaffolding was only partially evident. Teacher feedback in both studies supported the feasibility of the method for regular teachers working together with support staff during the introductory phase. The high school study also showed that this arrangement can work for several years, and that RT will be effective - if students are provided with more than 12 sessions, and if adequately sustained at a class teacher and school-wide level. Both studies contribute to our understanding of the potential of RT as an inclusive instructional procedure, illustrating that RT can be incorporated at a school-wide level as a means of early intervention to address widespread reading problems and facilitate more inclusive practises between regular teachers and special needs staff. Implications are also discussed in terms of strategic resourcing for remediation, value for staff development in inclusive methods, and school commitment to sustaining inclusive and early intervention within a school-wide approach.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/767</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Educating About Asia in New Zealand Secondary Schools in The 1990s Contesting Policy Curriculum and Practice</field><field name="creator">Pang, David Nui-Nyen</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/641</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Roles for Cation-Chloride Cotransporters in Maintenance of Lens Volume &amp; Transparency</field><field name="creator">Chee, Kaa-Sandra Nardia</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/830</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On the Borders of Consciousness</field><field name="creator">Fairhall, Scott Laurence</field><field name="description">The neural mechanism by which the brain creates conscious awareness remains unknown. The present thesis employs electroencephalography to investigate these neural substrates of conscious awareness through an investigation of the distinctions between neural activity associated with conscious awareness and neural activity which is not accompanied by conscious awareness. The temporal dynamics and the complexity of content during the unconscious processing of information are assessed in the first two chapters using the masked presentation of word stimuli. Results reveal that abstract information is extracted from unconsciously presented stimuli more rapidly than is usually associated with the neural indices of the conscious representation of information. It is also shown that the delay between the processing of different elements of word stimuli is such that some form of stable reentrancy is likely established during unconscious neural activity. The third experiment investigate the oscillatory event related beta desynchrony (ERD) preceding movement with and without awareness of the impending movement. The results show that beta ERD, unlike the evoked EEG response, reflects the awareness of the intention to move. It is argued that beta ERD allows the establishment of reverberating neural assemblies that are thought to be necessary for conscious representation. The final experiment uses a binocular rivalry paradigm to investigate the role of synchronous oscillations in determining the contents of consciousness. It is argued on the basis of this chapter that synchrony reflects the reorganisation and coordination of neural activity but is not, in itself, a mechanism for the binding of neural assemblies. The results are  discussed in relationship to the distinction between conscious and unconscious cognition existing across a spectrum rather than representing qualitatively different neural states.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/613</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Investigation on the Non Thermal Pasteurisation Using Pulsed Electric Fields</field><field name="creator">Alkhafaji, Sally</field><field name="description">Increasing consumer demand for new products with high nutritional qualities has spurred a search for new alternatives to food preservation. Pulsed electric field (PEF) is an emerging technology for non thermal food pasteurisation. Using this technology, enzymes, pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms can be inactivated without affecting the colour, flavour, and nutrients of the food. PEF treatment may be provided by applying pulsed electric field to a food product in a treatment zone between two electrodes at ambient , or slightly above ambient temperature. Exposure of microbial cells to the electric field induces a transmembrane potential in the cell membrane, which results in electroporation (the permeabilization of the membranes of cells and organelles) and/or electrofusion (the connection of two separate membranes into one) of the cells. An innovative pulsed electric field (PEF) unit was designed and constructed in the University of Auckland using modern IGBT technology. The system consists of main equipments, the high voltage pulse generator and the treatment chambers.  The main focus of this work was to design an innovative PEF treatment chamber that provide uniform distribution of electric field, minimum increase in liquid temperature, minimum fouling of electrodes and an energy efficient system. Four multi pass treatment chambers were designed consisting of two stainless steel mesh electrodes in each chamber, with the treated fluid flowing through the openings of the mesh electrodes. The two electrodes are electrically isolated from each other by an insulator element designed to form a small orifice where most of the electric field is concentrated. Dielectric breakdown inside the chambers was prevented by removing the electrodes far from the narrow gap. The effect of the chambers different geometries on the PEF process in terms of electric parameters and microbial inactivation were investigated. Electric field intensity in the range of (17-43 kV/cm) was applied with square bipolar pulses of 1.7 &#181;s duration. The effect of PEF treatment on the inactivation of gram-negative Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 suspended in simulated milk ultra-filtrate (SMUF) of 100%, 66.67% and 50% concentration was investigated. Treatments with the same electrical power input but higher electric field strengths provided larger degree of killing. The inactivation rate of E coli was significantly increased with increasing the electric field strength, treatment time and processing temperature. Morphological changes on E coli as a result of PEF treatment were studied under transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Significant morphological changes on E coli after PEF treatment were observed. The TEM studies suggested that the microbial inactivation was a consequence of electroporation and electrofusion mechanisms. Kinetic analysis of microbial inactivation due to PEF and thermal treatment of E coli suspended in SUMF were also studied. Comparison between measured (experimental) and predicted (theoretical) variation of E coli concentration with time following the PEF treatment was discussed, taking into consideration the recirculation mode of the PEF treatment. The treated liquid was circulated more than once through the treatment chamber to provide higher microbial inactivation. Arrhenius constants and activation energies of E coli inactivation using combined PEF and thermal treatment were calculated and generalized correlation for the inactivation rate constant as a function of electric field intensity and treatment temperature was developed.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Non thermal pasteurisation</field><field name="subject">Pulsed electric field</field><field name="subject">New treatment chamber design</field><field name="subject">Microbial inactivation</field><field name="subject">E coli ATCC 25922</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/543</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Manipulation of Dietary Fatty Acids and Soluble Fibre: Controlled Intervention Trials Investigating Cardiovascular and Type 2 Diabetes Risk</field><field name="creator">Keogh, Geraldine F.</field><field name="description">Cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus are two of the leading causes of death in developed countries and the prevalence of these integrally linked disease states continues to grow. A number of modifiable risk factors contribute to the development of cardiovascular disease including raised blood cholesterol, hypertension and obesity, the latter also being an important modifiable risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Diet is also a critical factor underpinning the development and progression of these adult-onset diseases, however the complete role of diet in modifying risk has not yet been fully ascertained. This thesis describes a series of randomised, controlled cross-over intervention trials that have investigated the potentially beneficial effects of alterations in the macronutrient composition of the diet, specifically lipid and carbohydrate composition, in relation to both cardiovascular and type2 diabetes risk. Trial 1 investigated whether modifying the fatty acid profile of a bovine butter-fat, using simple feeding methods to substitute a moderate proportion of the saturated fatty acids with mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids, could improve blood lipid profile and haemostatic clotting factors in 20 healthy men following a tightly controlled dietary regimen in which butter-fat was incorporated into a typical Western diet. Results showed that the inclusion of the modified butterfat led to a clinically significant reduction in serum total (P &lt; 0.05) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P &lt; 0.01) without a concomitant reduction in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The 7% decrease in serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, achieved with only a small alteration in the fatty acid composition of the total diet, would represent a significant reduction in cardiovascular risk if applied across a whole population. The sub-study of Trial 1 investigated changes in erythrocyte membrane fatty acid composition during a period of controlled fat feeding in order to assess whether dietary change could alter membrane fatty acid composition over a 3 week period, and hence determine whether it may be a useful short-term biomarker of dietary compliance. The results showed some significant changes in erythrocyte membrane saturated, mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids within 3 weeks following alterations in dietary fatty acid composition. All fatty acids changed in parallel with diet but in this group of 20 men only C18:0 and C18:1 had altered significantly (P &lt; 0.05) by 3 weeks. The results of this trial suggest that the measurement of erythrocyte membrane fatty acid composition may be a valuable, independent, qualitative measure of dietary compliance in short-term intervention trials that currently rely on self-reported intake data, however they can provide no quantitative information. Trial 2 assessed postprandial metabolic outcomes associated with cardiovascular risk, including triacylglycerol, triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins, cholesterol-rich lipoproteins, haemostatic clotting factors, glucose, insulin and amylin, using the high saturate and high mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acid butter-fat as the fat challenge. The study, carried out in 18 healthy men, showed a significant increase in plasma triacylglycerol in the 3 hours immediately following ingestion of the high mono- and polyunsaturated fat feeding compared with the high saturated fat (P &lt; 0.05). No other differential effects were observed. When both treatment groups were combined the total lipaemia induced by an acute fat bolus caused a delayed and prolonged increase in serum cholesterol and cholesterol-rich lipoproteins, confirming evidence from previous trials that fatty meals may cause cholesterol to be elevated for many hours postprandially and thereby confounding measures taken in the fasted state. Trial 3 investigated the effects of adding a highly enriched barley-derived &#946;-glucan (75% w/w) into a typical Western diet, in 18 'at risk' hypercholesterolaemic men following a highly controlled dietary protocol. The addition of lOg/day &#946;-glucan to the diet failed to demonstrate significant improvements in lipid or glucose control, and hence no evidence of improvement in cardiovascular disease or type 2 diabetes mellitus risk. The inability to reduce serum cholesterol may have been a consequence of structural changes that occurred during the enrichment process converting the natural barley cereal into a high &#946;-glucan product, as has been shown during similar enrichment processes of oat &#946;-glucan. These trials have demonstrated that under strictly controlled experimental conditions changes in the fatty acid composition of the diet can lead to improvement in cardiovascular disease risk, as measured by alterations in serum lipids, over a 3 week period. However, beneficial changes in postprandial markers of cardiovascular disease were not observed, nor were markers of type 2 diabetes risk in this group of individuals with normal lipid and glucose metabolism. The measurement of erythrocyte membrane fatty acid composition identified some potentially useful biomarkers of dietary compliance that may be useful in short-term trials. The dietary fibre manipulation described did not result in any significant improvements in cardiovascular disease or type 2 diabetes risk factors and raised important issues regarding the physiological activity of highly processed soluble fibre products, and highlighted the fact that not all &#946;-glucan products have beneficial cholesterol-lowering properties.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/690</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Putative Mucin-degrading Operon and a 6-Sulfo-N-Acetyl-&#946;-D-Glucosaminidase in Prevotella Strain RS2</field><field name="creator">Wright, Damian Paul</field><field name="description">A protective layer of mucus lines the surface of the gastrointestinal tract. Agents or processes that interrupt the continuity of this layer can potentially compromise the integrity of the mucosa, causing disease. The anaerobic bacterium Prevotella strain RS2 utilises the major structural component of the mucus layer, the mucous glycoprotein or mucin, as an energy source. Prevotella strain RS2 possesses a novel mucin-desulfating sulfatase (MdsA) which removes the protective sulfate ester group from N-acetyl-&#946;-D-glucosamine-6-sulfate sugar residues of mucin oligosaccharide side chains. The desulfation of sulfated sugar residues in mucin is thought to be the rate-limiting step in mucin degradation. The gene sequence for MdsA has previously been determined. The 4650 bp of genomic DNA downstream of the gene encoding MdsA was amplified by inverse PCRs and sequenced. Two complete open reading frames, mdsC and mdsD, were identified and are predicted to encode putative proteins of 362 and 1073 amino acids respectively. The deduced MdsC protein exhibited homology to the catalytic domain of aminoglycoside phosphotransferases and may perform a similar function. The deduced MdsD protein is predicted to be transported to the periplasm and/or outer membrane, and based on homology, may have a multiprotein proteolytic function similar to the tricorn protease. Northern and Western blot analyses suggest mdsA, mdsC and mdsD are coexpressed and their expression is increased when Prevotella strain RS2 is grown on mucin. This work is the first mucin-degrading operon of genes to be described. Also during the course of this research, a novel desulfating enzyme, 6-sulfo-N-acetyl-&#946;-D-glucosaminidase(6-SNG) was discovered in Prevotella strain RS2. The enzyme can remove intact N-acetyl-&#946;-D-glucosamine-6-sulfate residues from sulfated sugar substrates and is different to MdsA which removes the sulfate ester group. A procedure for the partial purification of active 6-SNG has been determined. The 6-SNG is predicted to corresponded to a 67.0 kDa SDS-PAGE protein band though several isoenzymes or fragmentation products were detected during the purification. The 6-SNG is located in the periplasm of Prevotella strain RS2 and is expressed at increased levels when grown on mucin. Inhibition studies for the partially purified enzyme have identified a number of potential enzyme inhibitors. This work represents the first 6-SNG to be described that may play a role in mucin-desulfation.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/607</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterization of the Plant CXE Carboxylesterase Family</field><field name="creator">Marshall, Sean D.G</field><field name="description">A large family of plant carboxylesterase genes (CXEs) has been identified, which may encode enzymes involved in secondary metabolism (among other potential functions) in higher plants. CXE family members were identified from the model plants Arabidopsis thaliana (20) and Oryza sativa (48), from the commercial fruit crops Actinidia spp. (12), Malus pumila (12), and Vaccinium corymbosum (1), plus several CXEs previously identified from a variety of other plant species. Plant CXEs share conserved sequence motifs and secondary structure characteristics with members of the &#945;/&#946; hydrolase fold superfamily. Phylogenetic analysis of the plant CXE genes distinguishes eight distinct clades. Detailed examination of the A. thaliana genome reveals that the AtCXEs are widely distributed across the genome, being present in four out of five chromosomes. Of the inter-chromosomal duplication events, two have been mediated through newly identified partial chromosomal duplication events that also include other genes surrounding the AtCXE loci. Eighteen of the 20 AtCXE genes are expressed over a broad range of tissues, while the remaining two unrelated genes are expressed only in the flowers and siliques. Four plant CXE carboxylesterases (A. thaliana CXE18, 20, Actinidia spp. CXE1, and M. pumila CXE1), representing two separate phylogenetic clades (clades II and IV), were recombinantly expressed in bacteria. The expressed CXEs were inhibited by organophosphates. Kinetic analysis with a series of 4-methyl umbelliferyl esters showed that substrate affinity for all four CXEs increases as the acyl chain length increases. Reaction efficiency of the plant CXEs is split along clade boundaries, with the two clade II enzymes preferring short acyl chain esters (acetate to butyrate), while the two clade lV enzymes prefer mid to longer acyl chain esters (heptanoate to laurate). A large number of volatile esters commonly found in plants can be hydrolyzed by these CXEs. Substrates utilized range from simple straight chain hydrocarbons (e.g. butyl acetate, hexyl hexanoate) to esters possessing more complex branched (e.g. linalyl acetate) and aromatic structures (e.g. methyl salicylate), suggestive of a spacious active site. Preliminary metabolic profiling of four AtCXE T-DNA insertion mutants reveals subtle differences in metabolite levels when compared to wildtype plants. This initial characterization of the CXE family provides a foundation for future structural studies as well as hypotheses for the role(s) these enzymes play in plants.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/636</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Johann Jacob Bodmer, Interculturalist Cultural Realignment in the 18th Century and the Role of a Zurich Translator</field><field name="creator">Baumer, Helen</field><field name="description">Johann Jacob Bodmer stands at the beginning of a new era that saw the establishment of major English literary influences in Germany along with the rise of English to become a language of importance of the European stage. The particular importance of this eighteenth-century Zurich translator and literary scholar lies in his translation of a canonical work of English literature, Paradise Lost, and in his tireless efforts to develop appreciation of this work in the German debate on aesthetics and translation of the 1730s. Bodmer was strongly opposed by scholars wishing to establish in Germany the neoclassical aesthetic conventions prevailing in France, then the hegemonic power in Europe. By overcoming the advocates of French literary models he paved the way for the widescale translation of English authors such as Shakespeare, and the adoption of English models. As a translator, Bodmer advocated norms of faithful translation that deviated from those advanced for Germany by the advocates of French literary models. This study explores the origin of the new Zurich ideas, and outlines the extensive debate on translation conducted in Germany in the 1730s, in which Bodmer and his colleague Johann Jacob Breitinger overturned the arguments of Johann Christoph Gottsched and his supporters. In a number of respects, Bodmer and Breitinger's ideas on translation can be seen as precursors of the 'foreignising' approach to translation developed by German thinkers such as Friedrich Schleiermacher at the end of the eighteenth century. My study also investigates Bodmer's translation practice in detail, based on analyses of his German translations of Paradise Lost. It gives particular attention to the way in which the debates of the 1730s prompted changes in his thinking on translation. Of especial interest here are his ideas on the translation of metaphor, to which he appears to have devoted more attention than any thinker before him. My study applies a new approach to studying translation history currently being developed by translation scholar Anthony Pym. Pym's 'professional interculture' ideas focus particular attention on individual translators and groups of translators, and the importance of their debates and discussions for negotiating translation norms.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bodmer, Johann Jakob</field><field name="subject">Translating and interpreting</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/653</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Knowledge and Vital Piety: Methodist Ministry Education in New Zealand from the 1840s to 1988</field><field name="creator">Thompson, Susan J.</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the history of Methodist clergy training in New Zealand from the 1840s, particularly as it was carried out at Trinity College between 1929 and 1988. It explores the way Methodist theological educators struggled with the tensions between a focus on active piety and practical training on the one hand, and intellectual and academic scholarship on the other. The thesis gives a chronological account of the work of Trinity College and the training ventures that preceded it, and reflects upon the main emphases of ministry education throughout the period. Changes in the relationship between academic, practical and spiritual aspects of preparation are discussed in detail through a study of the curriculum, skill development opportunities and community life of the theological institutions. In considering the interweaving forces that shaped Methodist training, the thesis notes the critical influence of the aims and vision of the college's principals, and of the needs and concerns of New Zealand Methodism as a whole. It explores the implications for ministry education of internal tensions and shifts in emphasis within the denomination, which produced among Methodists differing priorities for church life and ministry. These factors are viewed within the context of world-wide trends in ministry training, and of social, political and economic changes often arising out of the New Zealand setting. The interaction between such imported and local forces points towards aspects of Methodism's sense of self-understanding as a church with a New Zealand ethos. The thesis reflects upon some of the outcomes of Methodist preparation, both in terms of the kind of ministry it produced, and in the way training emphases helped to shape the direction and identity of the denomination. It explores the creative, yet sometimes divisive, effects of college initiatives in such areas as biblical scholarship, worship, and pastoral understanding. The thesis also examines the particular impact of ministry education upon Methodism's Maori, women and Pacific Island students, arguing that the theological institution often struggled to acknowledge the distinctive needs of these groups. The thesis concludes that the history of Methodist ministry education from the 1840s to 1988 has been one of shifting emphases and varying combinations of priorities as, in each period, Methodists have struggled to embody in training programmes just what it means to reflect a Methodist identity.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/689</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Practical Light Field Rendering</field><field name="creator">Van der Linden, Jarno</field><field name="description">Light field rendering is an image-based rendering method first explicitly described in 1996. The light field function determines the radiance, or colour, seen along any ray into or out of a scene. It is a function over a 4D space of directed lines. With some restrictions on the placement of the eyepoint, almost any view of the scene can be recreated by sampling the light field function for every ray that goes through the eyepoint and the scene. In practice, the light field function consists of discrete samples obtained either photographically using a calibrated camera setup, or from computer-generated imagery. Light field rendering is a purely image-based rendering technique. No geometric information about the scene is required or derived in the process. Although potentially capable of creating photorealistic renderings quickly, light field rendering has seen little use in either the research community, or the wider graphics world. The reasons may be traced to a number of weaknesses and limitations in the method, which make its use impractical. This thesis explores and improves upon several aspects of light field rendering, with the aim of making it a more practical means of image-based rendering. The main contributions are: &#8226; Better interpolation using a focal distance for improved rendering quality. &#8226; Incorporating depth information in the light field. &#8226; A light field parameterisation which encompasses the entire light field scene within a single structure. &#8226; Creation and rendering of compressed light fields using the standard MPEG video encoding scheme. &#8226; Use of light fields as a scene element in combination with polygon rendering. The most important contribution of this thesis is the use of light field rendering in combination with another rendering method, namely polygon rendering. A scene can be composed using both polygon objects and light fields. Light fields can intersect with other light fields or with polygonal objects, and still be rendered in a consistent manner from all view directions. This demonstrates, for the first time, that light fields can be used as part of a general rendering system in a practical manner.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/762</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Turf Wars in Environmentalism: Competing Discourses in Hydroelectric and Nuclear Power Campaigns in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Wilson, John Francis Hamilton</field><field name="description">This study examines the role of environmental movement organisations in New Zealand during the early years of the 1970s.

Research is performed in three areas: identification of the interpretive packages and discursive frames that delineate environmental discourse up to 1976, measurement of these discourses mobilised by environmental movement organisations, and an assessment of the influence this mobilisation had on the politicisation of the energy policy agenda. The study uses both qualitative and empirical methods. Qualitative research is performed to identify the discursive interpretive packages and frames through a hermeneutic analysis of the literature on the history of the environmental movement. This analysis shows that three historically distinct environmental movements can be identified up to the mid-1970s. These are the conservation, preservation, and political ecology movements whose discourses can be analysed in terms of three culturally resonant frames. The study finds that these interpretive frames - the rational, the moral and the aesthetic - offer similar but competing understandings of the environment. The empirical research is based on three data sets - the submission records presented to three commissions of inquiry held between 1970 and 1976. These samples are used to estimate and compare the mobilisation of positions taken by a diverse range of environmental movement organisations. The results of this analysis suggest that, to varying degrees, these competing discourses help to politicise the energy policy domain. Conservationism was found to be the least mobilised environmental discourse by environmental organisations. Nevertheless, it provided institutional energy policy actors with a rhetorical strategy in an interpretive arena in which resource development claims could be presented and defended. Environmental organisations were found to be important political actors not just because of their ability to mobilise organisational resources, or take advantage of political opportunities, but as engaged in discursive attempts to set the frames in which public discussion about energy policy issues took place. The study concludes that this political role may ensure the environmental movement remains an effective and non-transitory new political actor able to compete politically with, rather than for, party attention. It is the discursive ability of environmental movement organisations that allows them to compete in an increasingly politicised discursive sphere.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/693</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Costs and Benefits of Alternative Employment Structures: A Comparison of Employees and Contractors</field><field name="creator">Peel, Simon Mark</field><field name="description">Managers make choices regarding the types of employment structures that meet the needs of the firm, and workers make choices regarding the type of arrangement that meets their needs. Various streams of literature (for example, economics, human resource management, industrial relations, and organisational/industrial psychology) offer perspectives on why an employment relationship or a contractual relationship might be preferred under particular circumstances. However, it is often the needs of the firm that are deemed of primary importance, and it is the perspective of the firm that dominates the analysis. This kind of single perspective weakens our understanding of the employment relationship. It jacks recognition of the importance of matching the needs of the worker with the needs of the business. This thesis brings together the employer perspective and the worker perspective in an attempt to deepen our understanding of core/periphery preferences in today's labour markets. The research utilises a multiple case study design to investigate managers' decisions to use self-employed contractors or employees for particular jobs, and workers' decisions to seek or accept organisational employment or self-employment (contracting). Field research resulted in the development of seven case studies, encompassing two very different industries, and two very different groups of workers. The thesis attempts to build theory through explaining management 'analyses' of the factors relevant in the decision to employ or contract, and worker decisions to prefer employment or contractor status. In examining employer and employee 'employment structure choice', the thesis seeks to deepen our understanding of the interactional dynamics of employment relationships. It concludes that managers and workers who more carefully assess the extent to which a particular employment structure best meets the needs of both parties are better placed to build highly effective relationships.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/774</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessment in a Pre-Service Teacher Education Programme: The Rhetoric and the Practice</field><field name="creator">Hawe, Eleanor M.</field><field name="description">This study investigates how students, lecturers and others involved in a teacher education programme at a large metropolitan college of education experienced and interpreted assessment. To understand the actions and associated meanings of participants, the researcher worked 'in the field' (Burgess, 1984). Fieldwork was conducted over a period of forty months while the researcher was employed as a lecturer at the college. In addition to being a full participant /opportunistic complete member (Adler &amp; Adler, 1987, 1994; Riemer, 1977), the research roles of observer-participant and participant-observer (Adler &amp; Adler, 1987, 1994) were assumed. Each role provided access to different sources of data. Prolonged engagement in the field generated a detailed, rich data base that reflected the everyday lived experiences of participants. Data gathering techniques centred on observation, informal listening, formal interviewing and the study of documentary evidence. Analysis and organisation of data were informed by the constant comparative method (Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967) and analytic induction (Denzin, 1970). These processes resulted in the development of a number of conceptual categories and related properties (Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967) which represented the interpretations and understandings of participants. Students were found to have expectations regarding the outcomes of assessment, they reacted emotionally to these outcomes and attributed both success and failure, in the main, to external factors (Weiner, 1985). Assessment was perceived by them as a highly subjective activity and they personalised the assessment process. Game playing, negotiation of outcomes and cue seeking were common practice among the student population. Assessors also personalised the assessment process, using criteria and standards they considered important, to judge the student. Assessor personalisation was linked to a reluctance to award fail grades. Thus a marked disjuncture was apparent between the assessment rhetoric of the institution and both assessor practice and student behaviour. Two class based case studies provided additional insights into the meaning that assessment held for participants and highlighted the complex interrelationship between assessment, learning and teaching.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/632</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Prophecies of the Great Canyon of Toi: a history of Te Wha&#772;iti-nui-a-Toi in the western Urewera Mountains of New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Wiri, Robert K.J.</field><field name="description">This doctoral thesis is a social history of the lands and people Te Wh&#257;iti-nui-a-Toi, also known as The Great Canyon of Toi, a small isolated valley located on the western borders of the Urewera mountains of New Zealand. In the first chapter, the prophecies of the Great Canyon of Toi are revealed which is followed by a discussion of the theoretical model of the thesis in chapter two. In chapter three, an interesting historiography of Te Wh&#257;iti-nui-a-Toi and the scholar, Elsdon Best, is presented. These three preliminary chapters set the scene for the three main parts of the thesis. The first two parts of the thesis retrace the evolution of the M&#257;ori and P&#257;keha social histories of Te Wh&#257;iti, from their earliest origins, to the present day. In Part I of the thesis, chapters four to six, the mana M&#257;ori model is presented, which proposes the view that there is a peculiarly M&#257;ori way of knowing the social history of Te Wh&#257;iti-nui-a-Toi. Part I is divided into three domains of the spiritual, human and earthly authorities. In Part II, chapters seven to nine, the mana P&#257;keha model is presented, which argues that there is a peculiarly P&#257;keha way of knowing that same social history. Part II is divided into the three domains of initial alienation, legal imperialism, and neo-colonialism. Part III, chapter ten, analyses the power-struggle between the models of mana M&#257;ori and mana P&#257;keha and explores the dynamics of the relationship between M&#257;ori and P&#257;keha ways of knowing the social history of Te Wh&#257;iti-nui-a-Toi. The title of this thesis, 'The Prophecies of the Great Canyon of Toi', is a direct reference to a song composed by Te Kooti at Te Wh&#257;iti-nui-a-Toi in 1884. The lyrics of this song form a theoretical framework for this thesis and the song provides a new and fresh way of seeing the history of New Zealand. Finally, the events foretold in the song have all been fulfilled and are confirmed by historical events that are explained throughout the body of the thesis.

Given the nature of the phylogenetic model, it is expected that phylogenetic analyses only work well on populations that have stopped sharing biological information. This is particularly pertinent when looking at phylogenies of Pacific populations. This thesis presents a unique biological approach to the study of human settlement and population mobility in Polynesia, focusing on an animal that was transported through the Pacific by the ancestral Polynesians. I argue that analyses of genetic variation of the Polynesian rat (Ratus exulans) are appropriate for a phylogenetic model of human colonisation and mobility. DNA phylogenies derived from 132 mitochondria1 control region sequences of ratus exulans from East Polynesia are - presented. These results (1) identify a Southern Cook/Society Islands origin for all East Polynesian R. exulans populations, (2) indicate dual origins for Hawaiian R. exulans, and (3) indicate multiple origins for New Zealand Ratus exulans. These results are inconsistent with models of Pacific settlement involving substantial isolation following colonisation, and confirm the value of genetic studies of commensals for human prehistory.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420307 Pacific cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/597</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Phenology and frugivory of large-fruited species in northern New Zealand and the impacts of introduced mammals</field><field name="creator">Dijkgraaf, Astrid Cora</field><field name="description">This thesis investigated the reproductive phenology, fruit features, dispersal and seed predation of native New Zealand fleshy-fruited species, concentrating mainly on fruits larger than 10-mm in diameter borne by trees.  There are several species with large tree-borne fruit in New Zealand and they currently only have one seed disperser (kereru, Hemiphaga novaeseelandiae).  Historical evidence suggests that kereru might have been the sole effective disperser for most of the Quaternary.  Thus the New Zealand large-fruited frugivore system is relatively simple.  It might, therefore be possible to test whether competition amongst large-fruited species for dispersers has resulted in character displacement in the timing of ripe fruit presentation.  With this in mind I examined the timing of ripe fruit presentation &#8211; the phenological patterns &#8211; and nutrient complementarity of fruit species known to contribute to the kereru diet.  Introduced mammals have impacted significantly on New Zealand forest ecosystems, including fruit production.  An experiment was designed to measure the level of mammalian fruit consumption.  Three paired forest patches, with similar topography, aspect and forest type, were selected.  Mammalian pests were suppressed in three forest patches, but left unchanged at the paired site.  This allowed comparison of fruit production and fruit phenology at sites with and without pest suppression.  The effects of mammal pests on kereru, other bird species and some insect species were also investigated.    Showing that phenological patterns have statistically significant character displacement has proved difficult in the past.  It was considered that significant differences might be obtained if phenological patterns were broken down in to the most important character displacement attributes.  These were thought to be: (1) order of ripe fruit presentation amongst species; (2) peak fruit production should be greater than could be expected by chance; (3) synchronicity of fruit production within species; (4) lack of significant overlap between species competing for the same resource.  The two sites with the longest phenological record and best level of pest suppression were used to investigate whether character displacement occurs amongst large-fruited species.  The fruiting pattern of large-fruited species in northern New Zealand was more akin to tropical forests with year round fruit supply, than to temperate forest with more seasonal fruiting.  The order of fruiting tended to be consistent between years at both sites.  Fruit was not produced throughout the year by individual species, but tended to occur in defined peaks.  A combination Simpson Index and Monte Carlo parametric bootstrap method was used to confirm that the fruiting peaks were non-random.   The theory of competitive displacement amongst co-existing species requires that little or no overlap should occur in the production of ripe fruits by competing species.  This means that the period of ripe fruit presentation for one species should not overlap significantly with ripe fruit production of another species.  This was tested by modifying a formula developed by Augspurger (1983) that considers the phenological state of an individual in the context of what all other individuals of that same species (for synchrony) or other species (for overlap) are doing over the same period.  A further development was the generation of critical values against which the values for individual species could be compared.   Species tended to be more synchronous than asynchronous in the presentation of ripe fruits but only one species was consistently more synchronous than the calculated critical value at both sites.  Two other species at Whitford Bush exceeded the critical synchrony value and several other species from both sites came close to exceeding the synchrony value.  Despite synchrony values being generally smaller than expected species tended to not overlap significantly with other species in some or all years.  Character displacement, in the form of timing of ripe fruit presentation, was demonstrated for most species.  However, it is not possible to conclude that this has come about through co-evolution, solely, with the frugivorous kereru.  Fruit nutritional analysis of a range of (mostly) large-fruited species gave rise to six &#8216;fruit types&#8217; that clustered on size, lipid content, sugar and moisture content, carbohydrate or protein content.  These categories and the nutritional values obtained for New Zealand fruits tended to agree with overseas studies.  Compared to overseas fruits, a generalist description of New Zealand fruits could be &#8220;relatively small, moist, fibrous but nutritionally poor fruits&#8221;.  In the forests of Auckland, fruit is available throughout the year.  Reasonable quantities of high-lipid fruits are available throughout most of the year, except for parts of summer, and there is little overlap between lipid-rich species.  High-sugar fruits are most common during summer and autumn.   Kereru were shown to use fruit species as they become seasonally available.  However, they preferred large lipid-rich fruits, which can amount to 40% or more of the diet at one time and possibly up to 80% of the diet fed to chicks.  Taraire (Beilschmiedia tarairi) and nikau (Rhopalostylis sapida) were the most preferred of the lipid-rich fruits.  Nikau is also a calcium-rich fruit.  Puriri (Vitex lucens), a large sugar-rich fruit, was a common dietary item, eaten throughout the year, even when the fruit was relatively scarce.  Kahikatea (Dacrycarpus dacrydioides; small and sugar-rich) was eaten by kereru when large quantities of ripe fruit were available.  The timing and nutrition of the fruiting species was generally complementary, with different nutritional components available from species fruiting simultaneously.  Observational data indicate that kereru generally prefer large-fruits over small fruits.  The greatest numbers of feeding observations were of kereru taking fruits that were too large to be taken by other extant bird species.   Fruit species were available and eaten throughout the period that foliage (e.g. kowhai Sophora spp.) was also eaten.  Kowhai leaves and other sources of foliage have higher concentrations of nitrogen than most fruits.  Thus perhaps a switch to utilizing foliage is not so much due to a lack of food but more an issue of nutrient complementarity, during the periods of egg development and nesting.   Possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) and rodent (Rattus spp., Mus musculus) control was reflected in the number of possums and/or rodents caught in forest patches at the end of the study.  Long-term pest mammal suppression resulted in no trappable possums, rats or mice.  Sites lacking mammal suppression had moderate to high numbers of possums and rodents.  Possum numbers were lower at one site with partial possum suppression but lacking rodent suppression.  Rodent (rats and mice) numbers were generally too low to make valid comparisons but appeared somewhat elevated at the site with partial possum suppression.   Possum droppings were more frequent in seedfall traps at sites with no systematic possum suppression.  Rodent droppings had less clearly defined patterns and showed more seasonal variability than possum droppings.  The data for number of pest-mammal droppings in seedfall traps generally support the mammal trapping data.   Possums and rodents had adverse effects on fruit production at sites without pest suppression.  Suppression of possum and rodent numbers resulted in more fruit production, less fruit damaged, more fruits maturing and more fruits consumed by birds that void the seed unharmed.  Pest suppression also ensured that ripe fruits were available throughout the year, supporting resident native frugivores.  Partial possum control resulted in both the production of more fruits and proportionally more possum and rodent damaged fruits.  Mammal pests showed preference for energy rich fruits such as taraire, and nikau, which are also preferred by kereru.  Pest suppression generally increased the number of traps with insect or kereru droppings, except at the site with partial pest suppression where the occurrence of insect droppings was relatively low.  It is not possible to determine whether the benefits to these species are solely through a reduction in possum numbers or through a combination of reduced possum and rodent numbers.  Bird encounter rates were generally greater at sites where pest-mammals were suppressed, especially for frugivorous birds.  This increased encounter rate is unlikely to be solely due to behavioral changes in the bird population since the proportion of consumed fruits also increased.  Other factors, such as forest patch size and forest patch isolation, are also thought to be important in determining bird numbers.  Some forest patches seemed to have insufficient kereru to consume and disperse available crops of large fruit.  The timing of fruit production and the nutrient content of the fruits resulted in some fruits being more attractive (e.g. high energy food source, or important seasonal nutritional component) to frugivores than others.  These fruits were consumed more often by both seed dispersers (kereru) and seed predators (possums and rodents).  Predation of fruits has negative consequences for the survival and fecundity of the kereru and long-term implications for the survival of these large-fruited tree species.   The interrelationships between ripe fruit production, disperser availability and predator impact has implications for managing forests and pest and kereru populations.  Management will also need to consider the plant species composition since there are fewer large-fruited species at southern latitudes and higher altitudes.  At northern latitudes pest suppression may be less successful because fruit is available virtually throughout the year and pest species may not be not food limited.  Fewer large-fruited species are found at more southerly or higher locations and might result in &#8216;windows&#8217; of food shortage that can be utilized for delivering toxic baits.  Being able to predict unusually large or small fruiting events would thus be very useful for conservation management.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/605</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Protection and recovery of the injured brain the significance of the cerebral growth hormone and prolactin axes</field><field name="creator">Mo&#776;derscheim, Tanja Anna Elisabeth</field><field name="description">Brain injuries such as stroke and birth asphyxia cause major physical and cognitive disabilities. Accumulating evidence shows that the injured brain produces growth factors as an endogenous protective and regenerative mechanism. Several of these factors have been identified and include insulin-like growth factor-I, transforming growth factor and fibroblast growth factor. Recent work in our laboratory has shown that the growth hormone axis is also upregulated following hypoxic ischemic injury to the juvenile rat brain. Importantly, central treatment with growth hormone offered strong neuroprotection in this model. In vitro studies reported in this thesis have confirmed the neuroprotective properties of growth hormone. Growth hormone-induced neuroprotection occurs via a neuronal brain-specific growth hormone receptor, which behaves differently from that found in the periphery. Whereas both ligands are strongly somatogenic in the periphery, rat but not bovine growth hormone had strong neuroprotective, neurotrophic and gliatrophic effects in cortical primary cultures. This distinct ligand specificity agrees with previous in vivo studies in our laboratory. Further, I show for the first time that the prolactin axis, which is closely related to the growth hormone axis, is also upregulated within the injured brain. Surprisingly, central treatment with prolactin failed to offer neuroprotection. Immunohistochemistry however showed that prolactin and its receptor were strongly and primarily upregulated on reactive glia in the penumbra, with limited staining on neurons. This neuronal staining contrasts with a persistent and intense staining for the growth hormone receptor and the growth hormone binding protein on these cells. The lack of any neuroprotective effect of prolactin in vivo was confirmed using primary cortical cultures. In these cultures, prolactin had only gliatrophic effects. These findings indicate a primary role for prolactin in glial wound responses following brain injury. Furthermore, the prolactin axis was upregulated in the neurogenic subventricular zone and dentate gyrus following hypoxia ischemia. In a spatio-temporal fashion, the increased prolactin and prolactin receptor immunoreactivity was specifically associated with an increased neuroblast proliferation and migration within the neurogenic regions. A strong association between the prolactin axis and neuroblast activity was also seen in neuroblast migration routes. Interestingly, subsequent in vitro studies by T. Gorba in our laboratory confirmed that PRL has strong and direct proliferative and migratory effects on neural stem cells. In summary, these findings show for the first time that the growth hormone and prolactin axes i have distinct roles in the injured brain. The growth hormone axis provides neuroprotection through a distinct neuronal growth hormone receptor. In contrast, the prolactin axis is associated with glial wound repair responses, post-injury neurogenesis and neuroblast emigration. Since this prolactin-associated neuroblast activity was bilateral, prolactin may mediate distal processes such as the transfer of function to the uninjured hemisphere. In conclusion, the growth hormone and prolactin axes have distinct neuroprotective and restorative roles in the injured brain respectively. Activation of both systems may therefore benefit neurological outcome following injury.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/612</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Discourses of research policy in New Zealand, 1984-2005 neoliberalism, tertiary education and national science</field><field name="creator">Harvey, Sharon</field><field name="description">This thesis analyses research policy in the fields of New Zealand tertiary education and national science in the period 1984 - 2005. It poses the question: How has what can be done, said and written in tertiary education and science research shifted and how have shifts been constituted in policy and related texts? In addition, the study considers the overlapping and increasing convergence of research policy between the two fields (tertiary education and national science) as an example of what happens to previously discrete areas of policy development and their constitutive discourses under a state logic (and pervasive discursive formation) of neoliberalism. The key hypothesis is that the economic genre has come to dominate research discourses and related practices with increasingly problematic effects. The study is underpinned by a poststructuralist/postmodern philosophical position which seeks to interrogate, historicise, problematise and politicise dominant research policy discourses. Jean Francois Lyotard&#8217;s prophetic work, The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge (1984) is mobilised to argue that since at least the 1950s, the western world has been moving into a recognisably different mode of societal organisation and production. In the 2000s the role of technology and particularly computerisation in shaping our societies, identities and, as Lyotard argued, knowledge itself, is indisputable. Lyotard&#8217;s analysis of the growing importance of innovation and &#8216;techno-science&#8217; in the regeneration of international capital is highly pertinent to this study, as is his problematisation of notions of western &#8216;progress&#8217; principally through a theorisation of the metanarrative of performativity. The thesis is also strongly informed by Michel Foucault&#8217;s work. Of particular interest is his work on the imbrication of power and knowledge, the value of close historical investigations and how subjects become governed and govern themselves through the (usually unconscious) uptake of circulating discourses. For both Foucault and Lyotard the study of ruptures, continuities, emergences and descents in institutional discourses provides evidence on which to base judgements about the limits of what can be said in the institution at any one time. They both advocate studying &#8216;what we know so well&#8217; and &#8216;rendering the normal strange&#8217; in order to consider how the contours of dominant discursive formations might be constituted and to generate the intellectual resources to explore how matters might be organised otherwise.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/654</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Orca (Orcinus orca) in New Zealand waters</field><field name="creator">Visser, Ingrid</field><field name="description">Orca (Orcinus orca), also known as killer whales, are more widely recognised than other marine mammals. Although they have been reported from all oceans of the world, including the seas around New Zealand, information above anecdotal notes exists for only a few places. Orca are an apex marine predator that exhibits cultural differences in diet, vocalisations, and behaviour, between and within populations. This study was established to determine baseline information on New Zealand orca and to provide recommendations for future management and conservation. The conservation status of orca worldwide is poorly known, although two populations of the Pacific North West Coast of North America have recently been classified as &#8216;Threatened&#8217; and &#8216;Vulnerable&#8217;. Photo identification was used to determine the population size, distribution around New Zealand waters, as well as range use and association among individuals. The total New Zealand orca population is small (range 65-167 animals, with 115 calculated alive in 1997). Resighting rates were high, with 75 % (n = 88) of the animals seen on more than two occasions. The mean number of sightings for the 117 photo-identified animals was 5.4, the mode was one sighting, and the median 9 &#8211; 10 sightings. One orca was photographed over a 20 year period. Population structure, frequency of association with others, and other social behaviours were used to determine population demographics. The New Zealand orca population appears to be made up of at least three sub-populations based on geographic distribution (North-Island-only, South- Island-only and North+South-Island sub-populations). Preliminary mtDNA analysis supports the hypothesis that some New Zealand orca do not mix. The mean Association Indices within the North-Island-only and South-Island-only sub-populations are significantly greater than within the North+South-Island sub-population. Those animals sharing food had higher Association Indices than those who did not share food. Sex ratios appear similar within each sub-population and calves were present in each, suggesting all sub-populations are breeding. Feeding behaviour was observed to assess habitat use and differences between foraging strategies and prey preferences. Twenty four different species of prey have been recorded in the New Zealand orca diet. Of these, ten have not been recorded elsewhere. The prey consists of four types; rays (the most common food type), sharks, fin-fish and cetaceans (pinnipeds have not been identified as a prey source). Foraging strategies were different for each prey type, with benthic foraging for rays in shallow waters the most diverse strategy used in New Zealand. Food sharing was observed for all prey types. One of the three proposed New Zealand subpopulations appears to be generalist or opportunistic foragers, feeding on all four prey types, another sub-population slightly less so, feeding on three prey types, and the third sub-population appears to be a more specialist forager, only recorded taking one prey type (cetaceans). Potential threats to orca, in addition to small population size, such as bioaccumulation of toxic chemicals, oil spills, boat strikes and shootings are considered and recommendations for conservation and future management are offered. Whether the three sub-divisions within the New Zealand orca population are reproductively isolated and hence require separate management, and whether there is further sub-division within the proposed North+South-Island sub-population, requires further study including genetic analysis. Some level of ongoing monitoring is recommended to ensure that the population of New Zealand orca does not decline. In addition, records of stranding locations and details of strandings are appended. Twenty-four live strandings occurred, involving 63 killer whales, of which 17 animals were successfully refloated and two of these resighted. One was seen after three years (nine resightings) and the other after four months (10 resightings). Refloating stranded orca is recommended.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/614</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In vivo confocal microscopy of the cornea in health and disease</field><field name="creator">Patel, Dipika</field><field name="description">The cornea is the transparent structure forming the anterior eye. Principal functions include: transmitting and focusing light onto the retina, containing intraocular pressure, and providing a protective interface with the environment. The specialized microstructural organization of the cornea is key to these functions and maintenance of corneal integrity. In vivo confocal microscopy enables examination of the living human cornea at the microstructural level. This technique, in combination with computerized topography, corneal aesthesiometry and other clinical assessments has been utilized in a series of inter-related studies of the human cornea. Both slit scanning and laser scanning in vivo confocal microscopes were used and the attributes and performance of the two types of microscope were compared, demonstrating marked differences. Quantitative analysis of the sub-basal nerve plexus in the normal cornea and the inherited ectatic condition of keratoconus was correlated with central corneal sensitivity, revealing that nerve density does not change with increasing age and that nerve density is positively correlated with corneal sensitivity. However, in keratoconus, central corneal sensation, sub-basal nerve density, and basal epithelial density are all significantly lower than normal. A novel technique developed to map the corneal sub-basal nerve plexus enabled elucidation of the previously enigmatic architecture, revealing an overall radial pattern with a clockwise whorl at the area of convergence, inferior to the corneal apex. Keratoconic corneas demonstrated gross abnormalities of the nerve plexus even in mild cases. A two-dimensional reconstruction of the inferior limbus was also produced using this method. IV Analysis of the corneal endothelium in posterior polymorphous dystrophy revealed that endothelial density does not correlate with the clinical severity of this dystrophy. Key observations included hyper-reflective endothelial nuclei and apparent aggregation of keratocytes around the endothelial lesions. Investigation of hyper-reflective corneal endothelial nuclei per se, revealed that these are not seen in the normal cornea but are associated with endothelial trauma, intraocular surgery or disease states that primarily affect the endothelium. In conclusion, using in vivo confocal microscopy, these studies have provided important qualitative and quantitative data that add to our knowledge of the human cornea, at the microstructural level, in health and disease states.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/615</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A prospective investigation of cognitive-behavioural models of irritable bowel and chronic fatigue syndromes: implications for theory, classification and treatment</field><field name="creator">Spence, Meagan</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to prospectively evaluate the application of the cognitivebehavioural model to two common functional somatic syndromes: irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). A range of predisposing, precipitating and perpetuating variables operationalised from this model were assessed in two acutely ill samples. The significance and relative importance of these variables with regard to the development of post-infectious IBS and CFS were then examined. At the same time, information was gathered to assess the appropriateness of an overall conceptualisation for the functional somatic syndromes. Similarities and differences between the two syndromes were investigated, and the impact of differing thresholds and disability criteria were compared to determine the utility of current diagnostic criteria. Patients with a positive laboratory test result for Campylobacter gastroenteritis or glandular fever were recruited through general practitioners. A total of 1018 participants completed a baseline questionnaire at the time of infection which included measures of anxiety, depression, perfectionism, somatisation, perceived stress, acute illness perceptions and illness related behaviours. Those previously diagnosed with CFS or IBS were excluded, along with participants experiencing any medical condition known to impact on fatigue levels or bowel function (n=183). Participants completed follow-up questionnaires at three (93% response rate) and six months (90% response rate) post-infection. At each point, cases of IBS and CFS were identified using published diagnostic criteria. Results indicated that a range of cognitive, behavioural, physiological and emotional variables were significantly related to the development of both IBS and CFS. Whilst there were some similarities between the two conditions, there were also some key differences. Depression and somatisation were significant predisposing variables in the development of CFS, but not IBS, for which anxiety was a key predictor. Perceived stress and the type of acute infection were more important as precipitants of IBS than CFS. Campylobacter was a significant predictor of IBS at both timepoints, whilst the presence of this illness type also strengthened the association between IBS and the psychological variables. In contrast, glandular fever was a significant predictor of CFS at three months only, and this iii association was outweighed by the inclusion of the psychological variables. With regard to perpetuating factors, negative illness perceptions at the time of acute infection were significantly related to both conditions, and all-or-nothing behaviour was also associated with IBS. When CFS and IBS cases at six month follow-up were compared, CFS cases had higher levels of disability, but not health care utilisation. Finally, when subthreshold cases of IBS and CFS were compared to their diagnosed counterparts, on the whole they did not differ with regard to the psychological risk factors, disability or health care utilisation. These results support the application of the cognitive-behavioural model to IBS and CFS as a useful explanatory tool and guide for treatment. The results provide a degree of empirical detail that has previously been lacking with regard to these models. Comparing the application of the model to two separate conditions has demonstrated subtle but important differences between the development of post-infectious IBS and CFS. These findings suggest that an overall conceptualisation for the functional somatic syndromes may not be capable of determining and addressing such differences for individual conditions. With regard to the diagnostic criteria for IBS and CFS, results suggest that the current criteria may be unnecessarily restrictive and complex. Simplification or the formalised addition of subthreshold conditions may result in more widespread usage and clinical applicability of these criteria.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/616</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Qualitative topological coverage of unknown environments by mobile robots</field><field name="creator">Wong, Sylvia</field><field name="description">This thesis considers the problem of complete coverage of unknown environments by a mobile robot. The goal of such navigation is for the robot to visit all reachable surfaces in an environment. The task of achieving complete coverage in unknown environments can be broken down into two smaller sub-tasks. The first is the construction of a spatial representation of the environment with information gathered by the robot&#8217;s sensors. The second is the use of the constructed model to plan complete coverage paths. A topological map is used for planning coverage paths in this thesis. The landmarks in the map are large scale features that occur naturally in the environment. Due to the qualitative nature of topological maps, it is rather difficult to store information about what area the robot has covered. This difficulty in storing coverage information is overcome by embedding a cell decomposition, called slice decomposition, within the map. This is achieved using landmarks in the topological map as cell boundaries in slice decomposition. Slice decomposition is a new cell decomposition method which uses the landmarks in the topological map as its cell boundaries. It decomposes a given environment into non-overlapping cells, where each cell can be covered by a robot following a zigzag pattern. A new coverage path planning algorithm, called topological coverage algorithm, is developed to generate paths from the incomplete topological map/slice decomposition, thus allowing simultaneous exploration and coverage of the environment. The need for different cell decompositions for coverage navigation was first recognised by Choset. Trapezoidal decomposition, commonly used in point-to-point path planning, creates cells that are unnecessarily small and inefficient for coverage. This is because trapezoidal decomposition aims to create only convex cells. Thus, Choset proposed boustrophedon decomposition. It introduced ideas on how to create larger cells that can be covered by a zigzag, which may not necessarily be convex. However, this work is conceptual and lacking in implementation details, especially for online creation in unknown environments. It was later followed by Morse decomposition, which addressed issues on implementation such as planning with partial representation and cell boundary detection with range sensors. The work in this thesis was developed concurrently with Morse decomposition. Similar to Morse decomposition, slice decomposition also uses the concepts introduced by boustrophedon decomposition. The main difference between Morse decomposition and slice decomposition is in the choice of cell boundaries. Morse decomposition uses surface gradients. As obstacles parallel to the sweep line are non-differentiable, rectilinear environments cannot be handled by Morse decomposition. Also, wall following on all side boundaries of a cell is needed to discover connected adjacent cells. Therefore, a rectangular coverage pattern is used instead of a zigzag. In comparison, slice decomposition uses topology changes and range sensor thresholding as cell boundaries. Due to the use of simpler landmarks, slice decomposition can handle a larger variety of environments, including ones with polygonal, elliptical and rectilinear obstacles. Also, cell boundaries can be detected from all sides of a robot, allowing a zigzag pattern to be used. As a result, the coverage path generated is shorter. This is because a zigzag does not have any retracing, unlike the rectangular pattern. The topological coverage algorithm was implemented and tested in both simulation and with a real robot. Simulation tests proved the correctness of the algorithm; while real robot tests demonstrated its feasibility under inexact conditions with noisy sensors and actuators. To evaluate experimental results quantitatively, two performance metrics were developed. While there are metrics that measure the performance of coverage experiments in simulation, there are no satisfactory ones for real robot tests. This thesis introduced techniques to measure effectiveness and efficiency of real robot coverage experiments using computer vision techniques. The two metrics were then applied to results from both simulated and real robot experiments. In simulation tests, 100% coverage was achieved for all experiments, with an average path length of 1.08. In real robot tests, the average coverage and path length attained were 91.2% and 1.22 respectively.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/619</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A qualitative study of emotional experiences during the pre-psychotic period</field><field name="creator">Watts, Peter Murray</field><field name="description">Psychosis typically emerges after a heterogeneous range of premonitory symptoms. This has been labelled the &#8216;pre-psychotic period&#8217; (PPP). Emotional disturbances are prominent features of this state and have shown to be risk factors for psychosis. The present study had two interrelated aims: to explore in-depth the experiential nature of the emotional changes that occur during the PPP; and to examine whether there are similarities between these pre-psychotic emotional changes and the concept of delusional atmosphere. Twelve men experiencing first-episode psychosis with delusional thought content were recruited for the study. Information regarding their emotional experiences during the PPP was gathered using a semi-structured interview format. Corroborating information about observable changes in the men&#8217;s behaviour during the PPP was also gathered from a family member or friend of theirs who had close contact with them during this time. The data was analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis. A variety of strong emotional changes were reported during the PPP, including depression, anxiety, anger, and guilt, as well as love and happiness. Negative emotions were prominent during this time, but positive emotions were also found to be a feature of this state for some people. Overall, the PPP was characterised by an increase in distress over time. Features of delusional atmosphere that were evident during the PPP included: experiences of derealisation and the environment feeling different; anxiety and confusion and a drive to find and explanation for the changes that were being experienced; and a sense of apprehension that something significant was about to happen. The relevance of these findings to researchers and clinicians working in this area is discussed.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380107 Health, clinical and counselling psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/620</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of Argentine Ant (Linepithema Humile) on Arthropod Fauna in New Zealand Native Forest</field><field name="creator">Haw, James</field><field name="description">Although Argentine ant(Linepithema humile), a highly invasive ant species, has been in New Zealand for at least l4 years, little is known about their ecology and potential for invasion. Increasing spread and establishment of populations throughout New Zealand is disturbing because of the devastating impacts documented on native invertebrate biodiversity overseas. The primary aim of this study was to determine the impacts of Argentine ants on arthropods in native forest habitats in west Auckland. Pitfall traps at invaded and uninvaded sites were used to quantify ant and non-ant arthropod faunas. Argentine ants did not adversely affect native host ant communities. Moreover, two ant species appeared to be resistant to invasion. Argentine ant invasion reduced the abundance of a few orders of invertebrates while several taxa were more abundant in the presence of Argentine ants. Distribution and foraging activity of Argentine ant populations were monitored in this study from 2000-2003. Also, rate of spread was investigated to evaluate whether native forest habitats would be at risk from invasion. Measurements of foraging ant trails on monitored tree trunks revealed seasonal distribution patterns involving high activity in summer/autumn and low activity in winter/early spring. Argentine ants were found to be established primarily along the edge of the forest and did not invade into the interior of the forest during the study period. An Argentine ant poisoning operation on Tiritiri Matangi Island in January 2001 provided the opportunity to document the results of the eradication trial. In addition, pitfall traps placed at two treated sites and one untreated site were used to compare pre-poison and post-poison effects on ant and non-ant invertebrate communities. Fipronil baiting at 0.01% effectively reduced Argentine ants at the study sites and very few ants were observed in both tree count and pitfall trap recordings two months after poisoning. The invasion of Argentine ants on Tiritiri Matangi Island decimated native host ants and no recovery was detected throughout the study. Several groups of invertebrates appeared to benefit from the removal of Argentine ants while a few showed no detectable changes. Conservation implications resulting from the findings of this study are discussed Also, potential future research involving Argentine ants are outlined.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology::270505 Entomology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/625</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A grounded theory of international information systems</field><field name="creator">Lehmann, Hans</field><field name="description">This research project establishes theoretical foundations for a better understanding of the factors that influence the design, creation and implementation of international information systems (IIS). Three cases of multinational companies - in 9 locations on 3 continents - were investigated to that end, using a grounded theory methodology. Grounded theory was chosen because the paucity of research into international information systems means that there is an insufficient base for verification-t1pe research approaches' The traditional grounded theory approach was extended to work with cases, whilst fully preserving the principles ofjoint coding and collection, constant comparison and theoretical sampling. After every case, the relationships between categories were formally subsumed into theoretical frameworks. As a final step, a substantive theory of the factors influencing IIS was formulated. It explains the specific nature and architecture of international information systems, what affects the way in which they are built and why their users will accept or reject them. The theory defines a generic architecture, specific for international information systems, consisting of a 'Central' part, containing shared systems, and 'Local' systems that are unique for each site. Synchronicity, the degree to which systems require same-time use of identical data and information, determines the central and local applications. It further governs the configuration and technical architecture of the IIS. The 'CentraI'/'Local'debate can become embroiled in antagonistic politics, acted out in an ever-present 'Force Field'. Two variables influence the intensity of the Force Field interactions: o Utitity of the system's functionality lowers the conflict potential all around; . using the IIS to increase central Control intensifies local management's resistance against invasion of their'turf . Acceptance or Rejection of an intemational information system depends on the net-balance of these opposing forces. At a more sophisticated level, User/IT Consensus Processes are effective instruments for neutering faction politics and maximising the Utitity of the resulting system, substituting 'Coutrol' conflict with rational dialogue or amicable persuasion. Most of the theory can be directly translated into a practical methodology for designing, building and implementing international information systems. Manyparts of the theory, however, are still in an 'approximate' state and point to several future research projects- They will be concemed with refining concepts, constructs and their relationships as well as further adapting and improving the extended grounded theory methodology used in this study.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/626</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors influencing entry to residential care among older people</field><field name="creator">J&#246;rgensen, Diane Mary</field><field name="description">With the population increasing, and the occupancy and dependency levels of older people in residential care rising, it is essential to examine the factors surrounding admission. The reasons for an older person choosing to move to residential care in New Zealand are not well documented, and little evidence surrounds the process. Clearly there is interplay of many factors, such as risk mitigation by health professionals, co-morbid disease, and concerns of the family. Objective: To seek out the significant factors and influences which persuade an older person to enter residential care, and the subsequent satisfaction. Design: Longitudinal mixed methods design (N = 31), using interviews with older people who were referred by the Needs Assessment Services Co-ordination (NASC). Also interviewed were caregivers, NASC managers, and the Multidisciplinary team. This research, called Older People Entering Residential Accommodation (OPERA) was a sub-study of the Assessment of Services Promoting Independence and Recovery in Elders (ASPIRE) trial (N=569). The data from ASPIRE was also available for use in the analysis. Face-to-face or telephone interviews were held with older people in three cities who needed substantial levels of support. Findings: The most significant factors for increasing the likelihood of residential care entry were: to have the potential care-giving child living far away, and needing a lot of support with the higher level daily living tasks. Also significant was the older person being home alone for long periods. It was clearly shown that while the doctor had the most influence over the person&#8217;s entry into residential care, the older person had the most influence with the decision to stay at home. The vast majority of the older people staying at home were happy with their decision to stay there, but unfortunately the vast majority of older people who entered residential care were unhappy with their decision to move there. Conclusions: This study demonstrated who was at risk of residential care entry, who had the controlling influence, and the subsequent older person satisfaction. Also highlighted was the need for improved communication to the older person, with improved community support and more customer-focused residential care.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1762</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Collecting and Dividing : on the diversity of particulars and the framing of kinds</field><field name="creator">Moffatt, Barry</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/637</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Entrepreneurial Action: Casting the Entrepreneur in the Market Process</field><field name="creator">Woods, Christine</field><field name="description">The entrepreneur has been cast in many different roles in economic theory. Studies have highlighted the various roles and functions of the entrepreneur within the economic system, leaving entrepreneurial behaviour largely unexplored. This work examines entrepreneurial action in more detail, focusing on the decision-making process informing the entrepreneurial act: constructing the ends-means framework. An Entrepreneurial Decision-making Cast (EDC) is developed from theoretical work in four areas: i) contextualism; ii) the Kirznerian entrepreneur; iii) rationality and decision-making; iv) Personal Construct Psychology (PCP). A behavioural approach to entrepreneurial action, located within a contextualist framework, offers the opportunity to extend the Kirznerian notion of alertness and elucidate distinctive aspects of entrepreneurial decision-making. An Entrepreneurial Decision-making Model (EDM) is constructed drawing on the theoreticalfoundations of PCP and illustrative empirical research. lt is established that profit opportunities are not discovered. The entrepreneur subjectively construes an opportunity for gain based on a store of knowledge, as represented by a construct system. Furthermore, entrepreneurs adopt methodological pluralism when assessing constructed opportunities. Any change in knowledge, any revision of a constructed opportunity, is equivalent to learning. The EDM draws-out dimensions of entrepreneurial action, illustrating how endogenous change may occur in the market process. Entrepreneurial action transcends the traditional type cast role of the entrepreneur in economic theory. The entrepreneurial act unfolds in the market process and potentially arises from action taken by any of the four traditional categories of economic actor. The EDC extends our knowledge of entrepreneurial behaviour, casting entrepreneurial action as a central feature of the market process.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/642</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influences on Midwifery Practice for the Management of Women in Labour</field><field name="creator">Freeman, Lesa Maree</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/652</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of AAV1/2 mediated delivery of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and fibroblast growth factor-2 on adult rodent neurogenesis</field><field name="creator">Henry, Rebecca Ann</field><field name="description">Neurogenesis is the process by which functionally integrated neurons are generated from progenitor cells.  In the adult mammalian brain two sites of high density cell division have been identified that contain neural progenitor cells retaining the ability to generate new neurons:  the subgranular zone of the hippocampus (SGZ) and the subventricular zone (SVZ) lining the lateral ventricles in the forebrain.  Several studies have suggested that SVZ neural progenitor cells in the adult brain can migrate into regions other than the olfactory bulb after either administration of growth factors, induction of neuronal cell loss or injury.  Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) play major roles in regulating the survival and fate of progenitor cells in the adult mammalian brain.  To determine the effect of BDNF or FGF-2 on neurogenesis in the injured adult brain, BDNF or FGF-2 were over-expressed in the subventricular zone (SVZ) via recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV1/2) delivery and newly generated cells were identified using bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU; 150mg/kg intraperitoneal) labelling.  Selective striatal cell loss was induced in a subgroup of rats by unilateral striatal injection of the excitotoxin quinolinic acid (QA) 21 days after AAV1/2 injection and 24 hours prior to BrdU labeling.  The results of this thesis demonstrate that BDNF augments the recruitment, neuronal differentiation and survival of progenitor cells in both neurogenic and non-neurogenic regions of the unlesioned or QA lesioned brain.  BDNF also appears to contribute to the persistence of newly generated neurons in the QA lesioned striatum.  Our results provide the first evidence demonstrating the neurogenic effect of BDNF on compensatory striatal neurogenesis in the injured adult brain and suggest that enhanced BDNF expression may be a viable strategy for inducing or augmenting endogenous neural progenitor cell neurogenesis.  Unlike the effect of BDNF, FGF-2 appears to have no effect on proliferation and/or survival of neural progenitor cells in either the normal or damaged brain.  FGF-2 appears to be unable to act as a positive mediator of SVZ progenitor cell proliferation and neurogenesis in this study.  However, FGF-2 may be having an inhibitory effect on progenitor cell differentiation.  The negative result of the FGF-2 study may be of major significance in indicating the potential requirement of additional factors interacting with FGF-2 to influence neurogenesis.  The results from the FGF-2 study contribute to the research field in highlighting the complexity of the mammalian neurogenic process.  This thesis highlights the need for further investigation into multiple factor interactions, tighter regulation of the transgenic protein expression from the AAV1/2 delivery vector or alternative progenitor cell labelling paradigms.  However, it does show that if neurogenesis can be induced or augmented exogenously, neural progenitor cells may provide a substrate for repair in the adult brain and dramatically change therapeutic approaches towards the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Neurodegenerative Diseases</field><field name="subject">neurogenesis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1492</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teacher-Learners&#8217; Conceptions of Learning: The Impacts of Further Formal Study</field><field name="creator">Cliff, Alan Frank</field><field name="description">This thesis reports the results of a longitudinal study of the conceptions of their own learning of a group of educators (n=14) involved in further formal study at graduate level. Previous studies of conceptions of learning from the perspective of the learner him/herself have been conducted in a wide variety of contexts. This present study was an attempt to explore this phenomenon from the perspective of a group of New Zealand educators individually representing early childhood, primary, secondary and tertiary education sectors. The study had two aims: (1) the exploration of the phenomenon of learning conception at different points during and after these educators' engagement in graduate study; and (2) the investigation of change and stability in these learning conceptions, as well as those academic context features that might be said to be associated with that change or stability. The current study was substantively based on previous descriptive classifications of learning conception, derived from a phenomenographic methodology. Abstract classifications of learning conception using phenomenography have typically identified two discrete categories of conception, namely quantitative and qualitative conceptions. These categorisations have been viewed as hierarchically related to one another. The present study was directed towards the exploration of maximal variation in learning conception amongst this particular group of educators. Findings from this study suggest that there are complex inter-relationships between quantitative and qualitative conceptions, and that these conceptions are constitutive of cognitive, affective, social and moral dimensions. Furthermore, the findings suggest that change in conception is most powerfully influenced by courses in which course presenters adopt radical approaches towards content, methodology and assessment. However, change in conception does not necessarily result in change to these educators' professional practice. The conclusion to this thesis addresses the extent to which findings from this study might be said to be unique to this group of learners as adult learners. The conclusion also suggests that the manner in which learners' conceptions are viewed may be influenced by the particular paradigmatic view that the researcher adopts in exploring the phenomenon. Finally, the study concludes that the degree to which change in conception might be said to be long-lasting depends upon the relationship between the learning context and the work context in which the particular learners are operating.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/852</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characteristics of Nitrogen- and Iron-Limited Growth in the Diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum, and in Natural Phytoplankton Populations.</field><field name="creator">Grant, Coral M.</field><field name="description">The biochemical pathways involved in nitrogen (N) utilisation by marine phytoplankton have received considerable attention over the last forty years, but our understanding of these processes, and how they are affected by environmental change is still far from complete. This study investigates N metabolism in marine phytoplankton in both a controlled laboratory environment (using the coastal marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricomutum), and in the open ocean (e.g. Jellicoe Channel and the Subtropical Convergence Zone, New Zealand). Although the characteristics of ammonium uptake have been extensively studied in marine phytoplankton, comparatively little information exists on rates of assimilation. In this study, a robust method for measuring the rate of ammonium assimilation after a transient addition of ammonium is described. The method relies on the measured ability of the protonophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) to release unassimilated ammonium from the cell and prevent further assimilation. There was little or no correspondence between the rate of ammonium assimilation and rates of ammonium uptake or maximum glutamine synthetase (GS) activity in Phaeodactylum tricomutum. Moreover, in N-limited cells maximum GS activity was a poor measure of N incorporation under steady-state conditions. However, GS activity did provide reliable information on N status (e.g. increased GS activity with increased N-limitation). Comparisons of the effects of varying N-source suggest that nitrate-grown cells are not disadvantaged under conditions of N-limitation due to the extra costs associated with nitrate reductase (NR) and nitrite reductase (NiR) activity. The metabolic costs of growth on nitrate may be significantly increased under iron (Fe)-limitation, as both NR and NiR require Fe. Fe-limited chemostat cultures excreted nitrite and ammonium when grown on nitrate. This release is probably a response to insufficient photoreductant under Fe-limited conditions. However, under Fe-limitation cellular N and C was similar to that of Fe-replete cells, suggesting that the N-source used for growth (nitrate or ammonium) did not influence N-assimilation (i.e. that nitrate-grown cells were able to secure the extra reductant required to support growth) under Fe-limited, light saturating conditions. The Gln:Glu ratio (an index of the cellular N-status) was significantly reduced under N-limitation, but not under Fe-limitation. Measurement of several biochemical indicators of the physiological state of phytoplankton cells (e.g. Gln:Glu ratio, GS activity, and Fv/Fm ratio) permitted the nutrient status of phytoplankton populations to be investigated during the NIWA Ocean Fronts programme over the Subtropical Convergence Zone, New Zealand. Low Gln:Glu ratios suggested that phytoplankton in both Subtropical and Subantarctic waters were N-limited, with a marked increase in this ratio when Fe was added to Subantarctic phytoplankton. The temporal utilisation of N by neritic phytoplankton was also investigated in Jellicoe Channel, northeastern New Zealand. Again, several biochemical indicators (e.g. Gln:Glu ratio, GS activity, and Fv/Fm ratio) were used to identify the N-status of this neritic phytoplankton assemblage both during bloom and non-bloom periods.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/909</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Learning about Multiplication: An Interpretation of a Transition</field><field name="creator">Ell, Fiona Ruth</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/919</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Rock of Ages or the Winds of Change? The Impact of World War Two on the Anglican Church in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Haworth, Geoffrey M. R.</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the impact of World War Two, a period of dislocation and turbulence, on the Anglican Church in New Zealand. It does so in terms of the tension between a desire to defend and preserve the Church's assumed identity and role, and a positive acceptance of the possibilities for change that the war brought. This tension, between "holding the line" until peacetime, and welcoming changes that might benefit the Church's role and image in the community and witness to the "unchurched" is examined in a number of key areas of the Church's life. Wartime brought both challenge and opportunity to the Church in the areas of leadership, military chaplaincy, the Church Army, the role of women in Church and society, ecumenical initiatives, the regular life of parishes and other ministry units, pacifism, and endeavours to reflect theologically. In each area, the Church was facing questions about its identity, and therefore about its role in society. This thesis examines the thematic tension between the forces of stasis and of change with regard to the social backdrop of contemporary New Zealand society, where wartime was stimulating both a climate of change, and an attitude of resistance to change. Voices within the Church echo this ambivalence. Comparisons are also made with the wartime Church in England, which to most Pakeha New Zealand Anglicans was still the "Mother Church", and to some extent with the Church in Australia. Part of an emerging debate within the Church concerned whether it should continue with its self-identification as a quasi-English ecclesiastical outpost, or become a Church with a distinctive New Zealand identity, able to acknowledge and value its bi-cultural nature. This thesis concludes that, during the war and in the five years afterwards, the voices promoting stability and "business as usual" in existing structures and functions usually prevailed over those advocating structural and attitudinal change. Like the rest of the country, the Church was reacting to more than a generation of instability. After two world wars and the Great Depression, for the most part the Church wished to present itself as a "Rock of Ages", symbolising continuity, authority, and close identification with the political status quo. This self-image was challenged by those eager to see wartime developments become part of long-term change. When the war ended, the Church was not ready to fully face the implications of these factors for change. Until the 1960s and 1970s, an era of social upheaval, the Church wished to expand its existing operations to cope with population increase, rather than to question and redefine its own structures and identity.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/915</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Function of Reciprocity in the Histories of Herodotus</field><field name="creator">Paterson, Daphne</field><field name="description">This thesis is an inquiry into the function of reciprocity in the Histories of Herodotus of Halicarnassus. It examines the complex ways in which the historian weaves reciprocity into his stories of kings and tyrants, citizens and slaves, city-states and empires, men and gods. It investigates the way he records relationships of personal, political and religious reciprocity, positive, negative and retaliatory reciprocity to illustrate his themes, explain the cause of events and characterise individuals and city-states. And it explores how he uses language to emphasise the significance of the obligation of reciprocity in his Histories. Herodotus explains the cause of events in terms of the personal obligation of reciprocity. He moves his narrative forward through interlinking chains of reciprocal action and reaction to show that the obligation to take revenge and repay favours is a catalyst for historical action. Herodotus uses reciprocity for the purpose of characterisation. He characterises individuals through his stories of their observance or transgression of the obligation of reciprocity, he contrasts good men with bad by recording their actions of reciprocity, and he characterises city-states through his accounts of the reciprocal actions of their people. Through this use of reciprocity, Herodotus imposes upon his audience a picture, either positive or negative, of the men, women, and city-states whose stories he tells in his Histories. This thesis is an examination of reciprocity in literature. It is a study of reciprocity as it is presented by a master story-teller whose literary representation of reciprocity is more complex and more interesting than reciprocity as it is presented in the writings of behavioural scientists. It is an investigation into the way reciprocity functions in the work of a man whose stories have entertained and charmed his readers for centuries.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/914</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genetic Engineering: The New Zealand Public&#8217;s Point of View</field><field name="creator">Gamble, Joanna</field><field name="description">In order to understand the New Zealand public's perceptions and attitudes towards genetic engineering of plants and plant-based products, an integrated set of seven studies was conducted with a total of 1158 people between March 1998 and May 2000. The first four studies concentrated on gaining qualitative, in-depth information that could be built on in later quantitative studies. Studies 1-3 involved focus groups conducted with the 'general consumer', Buddhists, and the environmentally concerned. Issues of concern included food safety, the desire for choice, failure of genetically modified products to offer benefits to the consumer, lack of trust in corporate and government motives and deep-seated moral objections to the technology. Study 4 involved attending a hui with Ngati Whatua of Orakei to explore Maori attitudes towards the technology. The relationship Maori had with food and the land, and the need to be consulted over issues to do with genetic modification were the two key areas that differentiated these people from the previous focus groups. Drawing on the belief that genetic engineering had nothing to offer to the consumer, study 5 explored the relative importance of price, benefit and technology on the purchase decision of consumers using conjoint analysis. Price was a key issue for many consumers. However, a significant segment had moral concerns about genetic engineering and their choices influenced by the technology used to produce the product, regardless of product category, price or benefit. For the most part, none of the health benefits played a role in the purchase decision for any of the consumers, but one segment of environmentally conscious consumers responded to pesticide-free tomatoes. One final segment of consumers could be described as relatively neophobic, preferring specific guarantees that the product was not genetically modified. A survey was distributed throughout New Zealand, based on Fishbein's multiattribute attitude model, and Azjen's theory of planned behaviour. The approach aimed to determine the important factors involved in acceptance of genetic engineering in food production, and predict likelihood of purchase of genetically modified tomatoes or jeans made from genetically modified cotton. Behavioural intention could be seen as requiring a two dimensional understanding: assessment of the risk-benefit trade-off involved in determining acceptance of genetic engineering in food production (influenced by general attitudes towards nature, and perceptions of own and authority's knowledge); and a measure of the social pressure and moral obligations associated with avoidance or purchase of a genetically modified product. Finally, the impact of information provision and debate on psychology students' acceptance of genetic engineering was assessed using a repeated measures intervention study. Although students who participated in the debate became more accepting of the benefits the technology could offer, little impact was made on perceptions that the technology was 'natural' or 'interfered with nature' &#8211; an interesting finding given those drawn from the previous study that revealed the importance of the moral dimension in determining acceptance. Students who were exposed to debate became more confident in their answers, while those who did not became less confident. They were also more likely to discuss the topic with family and friends, and become more aware of articles on the topic. The findings overall suggest that New Zealand consumers are currently unaware of, or disbelieving in, the benefits that genetic engineering can offer. Educating the public about these benefits will not necessarily make people more positively inclined towards the technology overall however. Rather, applications that will prove more universally acceptable will be those that either offer benefits that compensate for perceived risks and moral concerns of the application, or address those moral concerns directly.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/863</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Unit Standards and the University</field><field name="creator">Curzon-Hobson, Aidan</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the possible effects of the NZQA unit standard approach on the pursuit of higher learning. Through a critical examination of the debate concerning this issue, an argument is mounted that the key questions were left unanswered about the implications of unit standards. This is because the NZQA and the academic community failed to clearly define and defend a notion of higher learning, and in turn, why its pursuit should or should not be considered an integral practice and responsibility of universities in New Zealand. The initial focus of this thesis is a critical examination of the debate emanating from NZQA's decision to include unit standards in universities. In working through these issues within this debate, this thesis engages with the broader issue of how we ought to conceptualise the notion of higher learning, the role, ideals and values of a university, and the pedagogical implications of such a position. This discussion critically engages with the work of Ronald Barnett, Paulo Freire and Martin Buber. It develops and defends a notion of higher learning and elucidates why this form of learning is, and ought to be, considered a role and responsibility of contemporary universities. The key aim of this notion of higher learning is the development of a critical stance or critical being which is oriented towards all realms of experience. Thus it is a pedagogy that seeks to challenge students to understand their interrelationships with one another, knowledge and the world, and is underpinned by a critical, dialogical learning environment. It is a learning process that continually challenges students and teachers to confront the becoming, unfinished nature of reality, and perceive and create in the milieu of fragility and potentiality. Given this notion of higher learning, and having established its presence and role within universities in the New Zealand context, the thesis then examines what effects unit standards might have had upon its pursuit. It is argued that the inclusion of unit standards would have restricted key facets of this learning pursuit.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/711</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Choice Behaviour: Short- and Long-Term Effects of Reinforcers</field><field name="creator">Landon, Jason</field><field name="description">Behaviour was analysed at a number of levels in two series of concurrent-schedule experiments. In the first, six or seven concurrent-schedule components, each of which could have a different reinforcer ratio in it, were arranged in each session. In the canonical arrangement these components were separated by l0-s blackouts. Across conditions, the reinforcer ratios arranged in components were varied. The overall rate of reinforcement was constant throughout, and each condition was in effect for 50 sessions. The second series of experiments used a conventional switching-key concurrent-schedule procedure in which a single reinforcer (or reinforcer-magnitude) ratio was in effect for 65 sessions. Experiment 1 showed that behaviour adjusted very quickly to the rapidly changing contingencies. Sensitivity to reinlbrcement reached higher levels when the range of reinforcer ratios arranged was greater. More detailed analyses suggested that the variables controlling behaviour operated at a number of levels. First, each individual reinforcer had an effect on subsequent behaviour. Second, successive reinforcers obtained at the same alternative ("confirmations") had cumulative effects that were evident when behaviour was examined as a function of time since reinforcement (i.e., the change in behaviour after the third successive confirmation at the left alternative was greater than that after the second). Third, when these sequences of confirmations occurred more frequently, their behavioural effects were again increased. Finally. "disconfirmations" (a reinforcer obtained from the other alternative following a sequence of confirmations) had comparatively very large effects, and returned preference to levels controlled by the molar or sessional reinforcer ratio. Experiment 2 showed that the local effects of reinforcers evident in Experiment 1 were also present in steady-state data. Effects of individual reinforcers on behaviour were evident, as were longer-term effects of aggregations of reinforcers. Preferences were again more extreme in response to sequences of confirmations when those sequences occurred more frequently. Similarly, disconfirmations had comparatively very large effects, and returned behaviour to levels controlled by the molar reinforcer ratio. Moreover, these local effects of reinforcers were similar when either the reinforcer-frequency ratio or the reinforcer-magnitude ratios were varied. The present data question the commonly held assumption that behaviour is controlled by large aggregations of reinforcers. Control was evident at a number of levels, and attempts to model concurrent-schedule data are likely to require processes operating at multiple levels. The present data also suggest that the frequency with which sequences of confirming reinforcers occurred was central, and longer-term processes might be updated with the delivery of a disconfirmation. Moreover, different concurrent-schedule arrangements might result in these frequencies differing substantially with the same reinforcer ratio arranged. An increased focus on detailed data collection using relatively standard manipulations of reinforcer frequency, magnitude, and other independent variables that are known to affect choice, is recommended.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/912</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Different Realities: Challenging Conventional Ways of Conceptualising Delusions and Hallucinations</field><field name="creator">Aschebrock, Yasmin</field><field name="description">Delusions and hallucinations are typically regarded in contemporary Western societies as signs of serious mental illness - that is, as essentially meaningless surface expressions of a biological process, that are almost invariably distressing and harmful to those experiencing them. However, these conventional ways of conceptualizing delusions and hallucinations are increasingly being contested (by critical psychologists and by some of those who experience these kinds of phenomena). As part of this trend, this thesis highlights the need to move beyond traditional ways of construing delusions and hallucinations and to open up new ways of thinking about them. In Part One, I present analyses from an international survey of 58 mental health practitioners and researchers, which I conducted to investigate their understandings of delusional and hallucinatory content. I explore their views concerning the importance of attending to the content of delusions and hallucinations, and a possible relation between gender and the content of these phenomena. In Part Two, I present analyses of interviews with 11 women who have experienced delusions and hallucinations. I explore the linguistic resources available to those who experience delusions and hallucinations for talking about these kinds of phenomena, and the ways in which they may attempt to make sense of such experiences. I illustrate some of the challenges to traditional ways of conceptualising delusions and hallucinations by drawing upon the accounts of five of the women I interviewed. I aim, in this thesis, to question and disrupt conventional understandings of delusions and hallucinations and to increase the availability of some alternative (marginalised) ways of construing them. I emphasise the need to consider (and critically examine) the potential practical and moral implications of various ways of conceptualising delusions and hallucinations.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/916</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Partially Supervised Texture Segmentation and Retrieval</field><field name="creator">Yu, Linjiang</field><field name="description">Partially supervised texture segmentation/retrieval aims to detect regions similar to a given texture in an arbitrary background. Such one-class texture detection has many important practical applications to identify regions of interest in remote sensing, medical diagnostics, industrial vision, or content-based image retrieval (CBIR). At the same time it differs from and cannot be performed with conventional supervised or unsupervised segmentation/retrieval techniques. This thesis develops a novel partially supervised approach to segmentation and retrieval based on an original local-to-global texture descriptor. This latter exploits a distribution of distances between local and global frequencies of particular texture features. The empirical frequency distribution of the feature collected over the whole training texture globally characterises the texture. The similar distributions but collected within a moving window of a fixed size centred at each particular position in the image describe its local characteristics. The local-to-global distance distribution over a training texture provides a natural self-similarity threshold for separating the desired texture from each arbitrary background. The thesis investigates capabilities of characteristic translation invariant pair-wise interactions of pixel-wise colours as the texture features. The interactions are analysed using a generic Gibbs random field (GGRF) image model that produces a set of characteristic colour co-occurrence histograms (CCH) as generalised texture features. These latter are compared experimentally to other known features such as the marginal colour histogram (CH), the coordinated clusters representation (CCR), and the Tamura's features popular in image retrieval. Experimental investigation of the proposed approach was conducted with large large texture databases (e.g. the CUReT database containing more that 200 images for each of 61 natural textured surfaces, MIT Vis Tex database with more than 165 textured images, and Brodatz's texture database with more than 100 images). These experiments confirm effectiveness of our approach for different types of textures. Moreover, the proposed local-to-global texture descriptor can be easily used with different features. This allows for selecting most appropriate pixel-wise features ensuring better performance in each particular application problem relating to single texture segmentation or retrieval.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/918</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular Genetics of Type 2 Diabetes in New Zealand Polynesians</field><field name="creator">Poa, Nicola</field><field name="description">The risk of developing type 2 diabetes is four fold higher in New Zealand(NZ) Polynesians compared to Caucasians. Hence diabetes is more prevalent in Maori (16.5% of the general population) and Pacific Island people (10.1%) compared to NZ Caucasians (9.3%). It is generally accepted that type 2 diabetes has major genetic determinants and heterozygous mutations in a number of genes have previously been identified in some subsets of type 2 diabetes and certain ethnic groups. The high prevalence of diabetes in NZ Polynesians, when compared with NZ Caucasians, after controlling for age, income and body mass index (BMI), suggest that genes may be important in this population. Therefore, the prevalence of allelic variations in the genes encoding amylin and insulin promoter factor-1 (IPF-1), and exon 2 of the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1&#945; (HNF-1&#945;) gene in NZ Polynesians with type 2 diabetes was determined. These genes are known to produce type 2 diabetes in other populations. The genes investigated were screened for mutations by PCR amplification and direct sequencing of promoter regions, exons and adjacent intronic sequences from genomic DNA. DNA was obtained from 146 NZ Polynesians (131 Maori and 15 Pacific Island) with type 2 diabetes and 387 NZ Polynesian non-diabetic control subjects (258 Maori and 129 Pacific Island). Sequences were compared to previously published sequences in the National Centre for Biotechnology Information database. Allelic variations in IPF-1 and exon 2 of the HNF-1&#945; gene were not associated with type 2 diabetes in NZ Polynesians. However, in the amylin gene, two new and one previously described allele was identified in the Maori population including: two alleles in the promoter region (-132G&gt;A and -215T&gt;G), and a missense mutation in exon 3 (QlOR). The -215T&gt;G allele was observed in 5.4% and l% of type 2 diabetic and non-diabetic Maori respectively, and predisposed the carrier to diabetes with a relative risk of 7.23. The -215T&gt;G allele was inherited with a previously described amylin promoter polymorphism(-230A&gt;C) in 3% of Maori with type 2 diabetes, which suggests linkage equilibrium exists between these two alleles. Both Q10R and -132G&gt;A were observed in 0.76% of type 2 diabetic patients and were absent in non-diabetic subjects. Together these allelic variations may account for approximately 7% of type 2 diabetes in Maori. These results suggest that the amylin gene maybe an important candidate marker gene for type 2 diabetes in Maori.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321207 Indigenous health</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/692</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mujer, Historia Y Sociedad: La Dramaturgia Femenina De La Espana Contempor&#225;nea</field><field name="creator">Zaza, Wendy-Llyn</field><field name="description">This study examines contemporary Spanish women's theatre through three main inseparable themes: woman, history and society. Written from a feminine perspective, the works discussed contest a canonical History which marks the dawning of western civilization. It is then that the Judeo-Christian religion and ancient Greek thought create foundational "sins" which relegate woman to a condition of inferiority. Within a patriarchal structure, she is confined to a private sphere of action. Consequently, a public female presence implies adopting "masculine" values and any possibility of an autobiographical life is thus sacrificed. The woman who dares oppose patriarchal authority becomes, in the context of twentieth-century Spain, a symbol of a people in ideological confrontation with the authorities in power and condemned to a real or figurative death. The prologue to the Civil War is grounded in a conflict of class, with rural areas pitted against central government and proletariat against bourgeoisie. The war itself, together with the postwar period until General Franco's death, constitute an ideological confrontation portrayed through the principal foci of action and from within the prison. The end of the conflict only comes with the restoration of democracy in Spain, a period which coincides with an increasing sociocultural awareness regarding the situation of women. On the one hand, the works analysed reflect this awareness of woman as a class in accordance with Marxist-feminist thought. On the other hand, they are witness to an internal process, which the woman experiences as an individual, and through which she gradually becomes an autonomous subject. The political changes wrought in Spain in 1975 bring about new concerns, arising particularly from irreconcilable differences between the manner in which the country presents itself and its daily reality. The works pertaining to post-Francoist society denounce a resistance to change on the part of State and cultural structures. This study analyses these concerns within the context of sociopolitical hopes and aspirations leading up to the threshold of the twenty-first century.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">es</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/694</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka: obstacles to the peace process</field><field name="creator">Edirippulige, Sisira</field><field name="description">The complexity and magnitude of the Sri Lankan conflict have grown over the last five decades, making it one of the most protracted and devastating conflicts in the world today. With the prolongation of conflict, the chances for establishing peace have become distant, the gap between the two communities has widened, and new elements have been introduced to the conflict. The impediments to the establishment of lasting peace on the island encompass both domestic and external factors. Among the large variety of such factors, this study has focused on but a few. The analysis of the domestic factors dwells on the nature of the existing political structure, the characteristics of devolution, and the sources of violence. The examination of the external factors addresses the significance of geopolitics, the role of the Sri Lankan diaspora and the role of the international community. The exploration of the failure of the peace process in the island points to a combination of internal and external factors that impede the establishment of a liberal democratic political structure. Despite its reputation as a Third World democracy, the Sri Lankan polity has, since independence, increasingly developed into an illiberal democracy. Although possessing nominal features of a democracy, the Sri Lankan political system is saturated with highly undemocratic elements. Amongst these elements, the ethnocisation of the society, confrontational politics and violence are specifically addressed by this study. Moreover, this study contends that the deepening ethnic crisis is a direct result of the failure of outside actors to promote democracy in the island. Having been a victim of the Cold War neglect, Sri Lanka's continued isolation in the post Cold War era is largely due to its geopolitical position. Finally, the study identifies the contemporary role of diaspora communities as a severe hindrance to a lasting peace in the country. Apart from material contributions, the divided diaspora communities are a major source of illiberality, and this reflects upon the peace process in various ways. Thus the analysis concludes that lasting peace in the island is possible only through the promotion of genuine liberal democracy, both within and from the outside. Now more than ever before, the new realities of the post-Cold War era provide an atmosphere conducive to such a process.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360100 Political Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/723</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Robert Goodin&#8217;s green theory of value and the politics of fishing and the aquatic environment in New Zealand: an explanation as to how and why fisheries-related policy fails to meet Goodin's public policy and moral criteria for the maintenance of natural resources</field><field name="creator">Pickett, Lance</field><field name="description">The proposition of this thesis is that, policy and legislation pertaining to natural resources, specifically the fisheries and the aquatic environment of New Zealand, do not meet Robert Goodin&#8217;s public policy and moral criteria for successful maintenance of such resources in accordance with his green theory of value. This proposition is derived from an assessment indicating a policy tradition in New Zealand resulting in failure to ensure ecological sustainability in accordance with this country&#8217;s international obligations to biodiversity and futurity. This thesis urges change from the prevailing narrowly economistic political agenda to one based upon Robert Goodin&#8217;s green theory of value. Such a political agenda would be promoted by a third force over and above the traditional parties of the Left and Right, arguably, The Greens: the Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand. The argument for change is based upon an analysis of fisheries related policy and legislation in New Zealand to April 2000. The analysis is organised into successive historical periods, beginning with the arrival of the first Polynesians and ending with the outcome of the 1999 general election. These periods include the development of the common property subsistence fishery of the Maori and its commercial open access Pakeha successors, the institution of an export industry involving in turn delicensing, rationalization, privatization, corporatization, and the process of devolution of fisheries management to industry. It is argued the cumulative outcome is impoverishment of natural resources, the capitalization of Nature and the theft of the &#8220;people&#8217;s right of fishery&#8221;. Goodin&#8217;s green theory of value is carefully stated, developed, analyzed, and compared and contrasted with the prevailing economistic argument. The validity and desirability of the green theory of value and the political agenda to which it gives rise is established. This political agenda is found similar to that of green parties. The political and social milieu in which The Greens must presently operate is analysed. Current environmental policy in general, and fisheries related policies in particular are analysed and found incompatible with Goodin&#8217;s criteria. The outcome of policies and legislation affecting aquatic ecosystems-maintenance is examined in case studies covering major fisheries and the aquatic environment, and found to be generally disastrous. Alternative policies are proffered, based upon a green political agenda arising from a philosophy similar to that explicated in Goodin&#8217;s green theory of value.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360100 Political Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/742</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Cross cultural study of scholastic achievement and selected determiners</field><field name="creator">Lovegrove, Malcolm N.</field><field name="description">In recent years considerable emphasis has been placed upon the education of the Maori.

FFH vegetation is found throughout the Central North Island, in locations where surrounding topography causes cold air to pool on clear, still nights. This increases frost severity and -due to the low frost tolerance of most woody New Zealand plant species - frosts are severe enough to prevent the establishment of most plant species which are common in the surrounding forest vegetation. The majority of work was carried out at four study sites. Rangitaiki is a large (c.2600 ha) remnant of FFH vegetation on a flat, pumice filled, basin. The other three study sites (Tahau, Waione and Pouakani) are much smaller (c.56 ha, c.35 ha, and c.61 ha respectively) basins where cold air is dammed by downstream river gorges. Vegetation change was examined along permanent transects established perpendicular to the FFH/ forest ecotone. Vegetation changed (over l0 - 20m) from a monoculture of Dracophyllum subulatum heathland (= FFH) to more diverse forest or scrub vegetation (= forest). A DCA ordination of the transect data showed that vegetation associations on either side of the ecotone diverged over time. That is, there was a more rapid change in the species composition of vegetation across the FFH/ forest ecotone in older sites. While seed rain density is low in FFH vegetation, it is sufficient, particularly around emergent focal trees, to allow forest to invade FFH. Frost severity increased dramatically across the ecotone in all seasons, at all sites, and the extreme ground frost minimums recorded suggest that it is low temperatures which exclude most forest species from FFH vegetation. Microclimate variation was high at all study sites, and locations with favourable microclimates in FFH vegetation were more likely to support (ephemeral) populations of forest tree seedlings. The most important determinants of variation in microclimate were overhead cover of vegetation and microtopography. The survivorship of 2,270 planted Leptospermum scoparium seedlings - a frost tolerant pioneer species which is important in forest vegetation at all study sites - was examined on transects perpendicular to the ecotone at three study sites. The most important determinant of seedling survivorship was distance from the ecotone, although the distance at which seedling survivorship dropped to zero was site and transect specific. Changes in seedling weight and height growth rate over the study period showed that many seedlings which survived the study period, would not have survived in the long term. There were no significant changes in soil profiles dug along transects perpendicular to the ecotone at all study sites. This suggests that edaphic factors are not the cause of the current ecotone position. The size-age structure of L. scoparium and D. subulatum stems in FFH and forest vegetation was examined using basal disks (n=627) collected on tansects perpendicular to the ecotone. These data suggest that the current ecotone position was set soon after the large scale disturbances which initiated vegetation associations at the four study sites. A short section of the site perimeter at the Waione study site has not been disturbed as recently as the other sites, and age structure data suggests that the ecotone at this location has been stable for at least 100 years. Transect position has no influence on the diameter growth rates of L. scoparium stems, which suggests that it is frost mortality, rather than a growth rate limitation due to lower temperatures, which is preventing this species colonising FFH vegetation. Stem age data also suggested that the scattered L. scoparium shrubs which manage to colonise FFH vegetation are killed by severe irregular climatic events, the most recent of which occurred in the summer of 1972/73. The same events probably also affected the species composition in forests surrounding the FFH study sites. Historical meteorological data suggests the most likely cause of the 1972/73 climatic disturbance was a severe summer drought, combined with a series of moderately severe summer frosts. A severe winter frost in 1978 had no observable effect on indigenous vegetation at the four study sites. The restricted distribution of two key cold tolerant indigenous woody species - due to increased fire frequency - has almost certainly resulted in a longer term dominance of some sites by FFH vegetation. Phyllocladus alpinus (not present at any of the study sites) and Halocarpus bidwilli (very restricted distribution at one study site only) have cold tolerances and life history characteristics that allow them to invade FFH. The preceeding results suggest that the composition and structure of both FFH, and surrounding forest vegetation, is a direct result of the unique abiotic environment and vegetation history of each site. Protecting vegetation covering the widest possible range of variation in edaphic and environmental conditions should therefore ensure greatest variation in different plant communities, and genotypes of different plant species, is conserved. The ecotone transitions studied in this thesis are clearly identifiable, and appear to represent the true distributional limits of most indigenous woody forest species. FFH/ forest ecotones may therefore be useful as sites for monitoring the future effects of climate change on plant communities. The varied responses of vegetation at the four study sites to the 1972/73 climatic event suggests that monitoring transects should be established at as many different sites as possible, and at different locations within each study site.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/797</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Plankton of the Hauraki Gulf</field><field name="creator">Jillett, John B.

However, the management of skid resistance of road surfacings continues to be difficult due to the inherent and sometimes random variation in skid resistance levels over time.  This study is an investigation and analysis of seasonal and short term variation of measured skid resistance in two phases.  Phase 1: Regular field monitoring was undertaken using the GripTester and the Dynamic Friction Tester measurement devices on seven sites in the Auckland and Northland Regions of New Zealand was undertaken over a three year period.  The effects of temperature, rainfall, contaminants, new surfacings, geometric elements and aggregate properties were analysed to investigate factors that initiate changes in the measured skid resistance of pavement surfacings.  Phase 2: Laboratory prepared samples were constructed for accelerated polishing and skid resistance testing of four different aggregates (two greywackes, a basalt and an artificial iron-making melter slag aggregate).  The samples were polished in an accelerated polishing machine to an &#8216;equilibrium skid resistance&#8217; level (Stage 1 polishing).  Contaminants were then added to the accelerated polishing process to determine the effect of varying additive, particle size and hardness in an attempt to simulate seasonal and/or short-term variations that occur in the field.  The results have demonstrated that significant and previously unpredictable variations (greater than 30%) in measured skid resistance can occur over short time periods.  These variations cannot be explained by any one factor. They are the result of a number of inter-related factors, including the geological properties of the aggregates and the contaminants themselves, the previous rainfall history, the road geometry, the calendar month of the year and (depending upon the measurement device), the temperature during testing.  The laboratory tests demonstrate that accelerated polishing tests of aggregate samples could be prepared for testing by the Dynamic Friction Tester and that significant variations in measured skid resistance could be simulated on various aggregates in the laboratory by the addition of contaminants.  The results of the testing and addition of contaminants on various aggregates resulted in significant behavioural differences which were related to the geological properties of the aggregates themselves, as well as the contaminants used in the accelerated polishing process. The findings of the research have specific relevance to three areas of industry; Road Controlling Authorities who are primarily interested in skid resistance policy, standards and management,  Road Asset Managers who operate, maintain and manage condition level and the safety aspects of the road network and Crash Investigators who collect and analyse crash data primarily for legal proceedings. All three of these industry organisations need to clearly understand the inherent variability of skid resistance, the factors involved and the effects that geological and environmental variations have on skid resistance measurement.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Skid resistance, Road safety, Surfacing aggregates, Vehicle / tyre friction, Detritus</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1432</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Surrealism: the spirit and the letter in twentieth-century English poetry</field><field name="creator">Jackaman, Robert, 1945-</field><field name="description">Surrealism is dead.

In the New Zealand region, up to 30-50% of skua territories may be occupied by trios or larger groups. This study examines its occurrence at the Chatham Islands, east of New Zealand. Here 16% of territories are occupied by trios and 2% by groups. All members of skua trios and groups participate in sexual and other breeding activity, and the associations arc thus communal. Sexual discrimination of breeding birds by morphometric measurements shows that all communal groups known since 1978-79 have been polyandrous. These groups are long-lived associations, some of which are known to have persisted for at least 14 years. Trios are as long-lived and stable as pairs, and birds on communal territories do not move from them even when an appropriate-sex space becomes available on an adjacent pair territory. The members of trios are not close kin. All members of communal associations participate in territorial defence and chick rearing. In trios, the males appear to be equals, although in any one year the actual paternity of offspring may reside with only one of them. Overall reproductive success for Chatham Island skuas is high, for both pairs and communal groups, compared with other populations. However, communal trios and groups have lower reproductive success than pairs even over a l0 year period, particularly when considered on a per adult basis. Furthermore, no improvement in chick &#8216;quality&#8217; is discernible. Unusually for skuas, the breeding population at the Chatham Islands is non-migratory. Skuas are present on their breeding territories during the winter, and exhibit characteristic territorial and agonistic behaviours, albeit at lower intensity than during the breeding season. It is suggested that communal breeding in this skua population is not adaptive per se, but a secondary consequence of year-round residence. This is a departure from the conventional resolution of communal breeding. Residence is facilitated by benign climatic conditions and year-round prey availability. When territory space becomes available outside the breeding season, in a small number of cases more than a pair of skuas are able to establish themselves. Thereafter, trios and larger groups persist and behave in the same manner as pairs. The flux between trios and pairs when birds are lost is determined, in part, by the sex of that bird. Thus a trio which loses its one female will &#8216;acquire&#8217; a replacement female and persist as a trio, whereas a trio which loses one of its two males will thereafter continue as a pair.

Surveys of 4 no-take marine reserves of different ages and 4 unprotected control sites confirmed that J. edwardsii increase in mean size and abundance within protected areas. Total lobster density was estimated to increase by 6.1% per year of protection. The relationship between age of reserve and the density of lobsters above the legal size limit (&gt;100 mm carapace length) was complicated by depth related interactions between reserves, due to seasonal changes in the depth distribution of lobsters and differences in the timing of surveys among locations. However, density increases in legal sized lobsters were greater than those of the overall population. Mean size of protected lobsters increased in a non-linear fashion, reflecting the asymptotic growth characteristics of the species. Mean carapace length of lobsters increased by 11.24 mm after 3 years of protection and only by 16.25 mm after 2l years of protection. Corresponding increases in biomass (kg.500 m-2) and egg production (eggs.500 m-2) were estimated to be 7.4% and 6.6% respectively per year of protection. A tag recapture program indicated that the limited scale of movements and relatively high site fidelity of mature J. edwardsii aided the recovery of lobster populations in protected areas. Of 737 lobsters tagged in and around the Leigh Marine Reserve,212 were subsequently resighted. Seventy percent of resighted lobsters were relocated less than 250 m along the shore from their initial site after a mean period of liberty of 146 (se = 13.42) days. However, seasonal offshore movements took lobsters beyond the seaward boundary of the reserve where they were susceptible to capture. Of the 521 lobsters tagged on inshore reefs within the Leigh Marine Reserve. l.9% were caught over the seaward boundary by commercial fishers, and 14.4% of the 181 lobsters tagged over the seaward boundary were resighted on inshore reefs within the reserve. Movements into or out of the reserve across the longshore boundaries were also recorded for 7 out of the 27 lobsters moving further than 250 m along the shore. Acoustic tracking confirmed that J. edwardsii have a high site fidelity, with tracked lobsters spending a median of 84% of their time at their home site. Twenty one percent of the 26 lobsters fitted with acoustic tags never left their tagging site and, of those that did leave 56% eventually returned. Lobsters moved up to 3.1km away from their home sites but managed to find their way back after periods of 1 to 103 days away. Five lobsters had strong associations with two separate sites and made repeated movements between these alternate home sites. The straight line distance between alternate home sites ranged from 200 m to 1.3 km, and the period between visits to their primary or secondary home sites ranged from 1 to 93 days. Movement activity varied throughout the year, and seasonal patterns differed between males and females. Females displayed one peak in movement activity per year, around the time of larval release in September-October. Males displayed a summer peak centred on January, and a winter peak centred on July. The onset of high movement activity was often accompanied by a shift to deeper water and l0 of the 14 lobsters tracked for over 6 months spent periods away from the inshore reef system. Exposed groups of lobsters were observed aggregating in offshore areas of sand and low lying patch reef during the day. Offshore aggregations were observed over 7 months of the year and lobsters within the aggregations displayed behaviour consistent with the use of mutual defence. The sexual composition of the aggregations reflected seasonal patterns in male and female movement rates. Male J. edwardsii dominated the aggregations in winter and summer; times when peak feeding rates of males held in captivity were also recorded. Females dominated the offshore aggregations in September-October when larvae are released. Seven of the 26 lobsters fitted with acoustic tags moved over the boundaries of the Leigh Marine Reserve and Tawharanui Marine Park during offshore movements. Despite the fact that there is no fishing access to inshore reefs within the Leigh Marine Reserve, no significant difference was detected between the catch per unit effort (kg.trap haul-1) of lobsters caught around the reserve, nearby coastal Leigh or Little Barrier Island. However, catches around the marine reserve contained fewer (P=0.0009) but larger lobsters than at Little Barrier Island. The catch characteristics of lobsters from coastal Leigh were intermediate between the other two sites. As access to inshore reefs around the Leigh Marine Reserve was limited to a small area at either end of the reserve, traps tended to be set in offshore locations and the sexual composition of the total catch around the Leigh Marine Reserve reflected the seasonal movements of males and females into, and out, offshore areas. At coastal Leigh and Little Barrier Island the location of traps was not restricted and greater use was made of coastal fringing reefs. As a result the sexual composition of the catch at these locations did not reflect the movement of various components of the lobster population into and out of specific habitats or locations. Overall, the results of this study suggest that relatively small (~ 5 km2) no-take marine reserves increase lobster biomass and egg production, without adversely affecting catch rates in the surrounding fishery. Marine reserves may therefore represent a viable management tool, which if used in conjunction with other management regimes, could provide a more precautionary approach to the management of the J. edwardsii fishery at minimal cost to the industry.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/995</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ensemble learning by data resampling</field><field name="creator">Goebel, Michael</field><field name="description">We investigate ensemble learning methods that construct a classifier ensemble by repeatedly sampling the original training data and building a member classifier from each subsample. We find that the performance of standard Bagging can frequently be improved upon by simple variations of the sampling scheme, such as varying the sample size, or sampling without replacement instead of sampling with replacement. For all methods tested, the ensemble performance is greatly dependent on properties of the problem domain and the data sample. We try to explain the observed performances of the various ensemble methods qualitatively and quantitatively, and find that current ensemble analysis methods such as margin distributions, Error diagrams, bias-variance decomposition etc. are not well suited for this task. We postulate that the primary explanation for the performance of ensemble methods is to be found in their effects on accuracy of the ensemble members on one side and diversity among them on the other side, two contradictory goals which necessitate a compromise, or trade-off. This motivates the presentation of a precise yet general definition of what diversity is and how it is to be measured. This definition has the desirable property that it is applicable to all single-stage voting ensembles, under any given loss function. We then study the mathematical relationships between ensemble loss, mean member loss, and diversity. For squared loss, we show that our definitions lead to the well known ensemble loss decomposition, and extend this decomposition to the case where the ensemble members, instead of a real number, return a probability distribution over R. For the case of 0-1 loss, we derive the exact mathematical relations between ensemble loss, mean member loss, and diversity. Studying those relations provides some valuable insights into ensembles behavior, and produces some unexpected hence interesting results. These results are also confirmed by the experimental observations. Turning our attention back to the performance of Bagging variants, we show how the loss decomposition can be used to reduce the number of parameter settings which have to be tried out experimentally in order to find a well-performing ensemble method for a given particular problem.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/996</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Non-ICT executive perceptions of, and attitudes towards, ICT infrastructure projects : do they influence the outcomes of such projects</field><field name="creator">Reid, Gillian Anne</field><field name="description">There are many issues involved in implementing Information and Communications Technology (ICT) projects in general, and infrastructure (ICT/I) projects in particular.  Failures are still common despite advances in project management tools, and increased ICT sophistication.  Executive sponsorship and support is acknowledged to make a difference to the success or failure of these kinds of projects. Little has been written on the views of non-ICT executives about the issues they have with ICT/I projects, which have particular challenges because of their highly technical nature.  This research sought to develop a theory not only about what the issues are, from the non-ICT executive perspective, but also how these issues appear in, and may affect the outcomes of, such projects. An interpretive study using single units of analysis within multiple cases, to build an inductively derived theory, was the approach chosen for this research. An adapted grounded theory analysis, following the original Glaser and Strauss (1967) philosophy, was used to analyse data extracted from interviews with fifteen chief executives or equivalents.  Three themes arose out of this process: Executive Perceptions of ICT/I;	Strategic Alignment of ICT/I projects;ICT/I Project Outcomes  The themes had quite strong connections between them.  Jargon Barriers between ICT staff and these executives, affected the executives perceptions of ICT/I and were strong contributing factors for a poor strategic alignment between ICT/I projects and business goals. The poor alignment was primarily caused as a result of low levels of executive engagement with these projects, because they couldn&#8217;t understand the &#8220;techno-speak&#8221; of their ICT people.  The consequence was consistently low satisfaction with ICT/I project life cycle outcomes. There was a very real difference between the satisfaction levels of executives who had made definite efforts to overcome, or deal with, the ICT/I jargon barriers, and those who hadn&#8217;t.   there was a very real difference between the satisfaction levels of executives who had made definite efforts to overcome, or deal with, the ICT/I jargon barriers, and those who hadn&#8217;t.  The substantive theory developed from this work is that: Jargon barriers created by ICT staff generate poor relationships between ICT staff and their executives, which in turn can cause low levels of executive engagement with their infrastructure projects, and consequently affect executive perceptions about the outcomes of these projects.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ICT Infrastructure Projects</field><field name="subject">Executive perceptions &amp; attitudes towards ICT</field><field name="subject">Grounded Theory data analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1656</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reading Lapita in near Oceania : intertidal and shallow-water pottery scatters, Roviana Lagoon, New Georgia, Solomon Islands</field><field name="creator">Felgate, Matthew Walter</field><field name="description">Lapita is the name given by archaeologists to a material culture complex distributed from Papua New Guinea to Samoa about 3000 years ago, which marks major economic changes in Near Oceania and the first settlement by humans of Remote Oceania. Those parts of Solomon Islands that lie in Near Oceania, together with Bougainville, comprise a large gap in the recorded distribution of Lapita, which the current research seeks to explain. At Roviana Lagoon, centrally located in this gap, scatters of pottery, stone artefacts, and other stone items are found in shallow water in this sheltered, landlocked lagoon, initially thought to be late derivatives of Lapita. This research seeks method and theory to aid in the interpretation of this type of archaeological record. Intensive littoral survey discovered a wider chronological range of pottery styles than had previously been recorded, including materials attributable directly to the Lapita material culture complex. A study of vessel brokenness and completeness enabled sample evaluation, estimation of a parent population from which the sample derived, assessment of the state of preservation of the sample, and systematic choice of unit of quantification. Studies of wave exposure of collection sites and taphonomic evidence from sherds concluded that the cultural formation process of these sites was stilt house settlement (as found elsewhere in Near Oceania for Lapita) over deeper water than today. Falling relative sea levels and consequent increasing effects of swash-zone processes have resulted in high archaeological visibility and poor state of preservation at Roviana Lagoon. Analysis of ceramic and lithic variability and spatial analysis allowed the construction of a provisional chronology in need of further testing. Indications are that there is good potential to construct a robust, high-resolution ceramic chronology by focussing on carefully controlled surface collection from this sort of location, ceramic seriation and testing/calibration using direct dating by AMS radiocarbon and Thermoluminescence. Data on preservation and archaeological visibility of stilt house settlements along a sheltered emerging coastline allows preservation and visibility for this type of settlement to be modeled elsewhere. When such a model is applied to other areas of the Lapita gap, which are predominantly either less favourable for preservation or less favourable for archaeological visibility, the gap in the distribution of Lapita can be seen to be an area of low probability of detection by archaeologists, meaning there is currently no evidence for absence of settlement in the past, and good reason to think that Lapita was continuously distributed across Near Oceania as a network of stilt village settlement. This finding highlights the need for explicit models of probability of detection to discover or read the Lapita archaeological record.

Fairburn (1904-1957)</field><field name="creator">Trussell, Denys John</field><field name="description">This thesis is a literary biography. It incorporates material that is often outside the scope of scholarly or academic writing: the detail of an individual's day-to-day life. It also spans several disciplines: the fine arts, their history and theory, literary history and criticism, ecology, philosophy, classical music and general history. The discussion involved these because the biographical subject had an active interest at times an active involvement in them. There has been an attempt to follow through themes and patterns that were enduring in the life of A.R.D. Fairburn. He is shown as a man who saw the world in vitalistic and metaphysical terms, rather than in terms of their opposites &#8211; mechanism and materialism. These views he represented consistently in a secular society that had a predominantly scientific world view. He is treated as a Romantic/Modernist where his poetry is discussed, and as a pivotal figure in New Zealand's literary history; one who helped make the transition from Victorian, Edwardian and Georgian poetic idioms to those of a regional Modernism, within which he developed a unique style. The biography has implicit in it an 'argument', though not one that is developed in an abstract way: namely that Fairburn, his grandfather Edwin and his great-grandfather, William, were peculiarly representative figures in our history. Their active New Zealand presence lasts from l8l9-1957. Two of them played direct roles in establishing a settler culture here; the third was acutely aware of the tensions and contradictions of that culture. Though A.R.D. and Edwin Fairburn were eccentric in the social milieu of New Zealand, their lives touched it in so many ways that they, along with their missionary forebear, William Thomas Fairburn, are personifications in an historical narrative. The line of their lives traces much in the history of the country since the early nineteenth century.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420200 Literature Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1010</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bolshie Women: Resisting State Reform in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Bedggood, Janet Lindsay</field><field name="description">This thesis looks at the way the historical oppression of women in capitalist society is reproduced through a continuing gender division of labour at home and in the workplace. Women's primary responsibility for domestic labour in the home both defines and disadvantages them in the labour market. I argue that changing women's inferior status under capitalism depends on women organising for equality in the labour market. I develop the argument around women's status by looking at the way state activity shaped the conditions for social reproduction in the post-war period of capitalist growth followed by the onset of economic decline and state restructuring in New Zealand. I take a classical Marxist political economy approach to explain the end of the post-war boom as a 'structural crisis' of falling profits requiring the state to act for capital by establishing the conditions for the market to 'restructure' production to restore the conditions for profitability. The thesis focuses on the reduction of state welfare provision which impacted on women both as domestic labourers and wage labourers. These measures generated opposition. First, government's proposal for domestic purpose beneficiaries to undertake 'workfare' signaled a (failed) attempt to propel these women into work as a reserve army of labour and out of their primary role as domestic labourers supported by the state. Second, reducing state spending on the 'social wage' impacted directly on women workers in state sector areas of education and health. I interviewed women teachers who were active in their unions in resisting the pressures of reform and defending their jobs. The most politically conscious teachers were Marxists who agitated to advance workers from a trade union consciousness to a class consciousness. They understood that the union struggle was a class struggle of workers against a capitalist class on the offensive. They challenged union bureaucrats in accommodating to this. In their interventions, these women demonstrated the possibilities for overcoming gender inequality not through separatist strategies or liberal reforms that leave capitalist structures intact but through the transformative potential of union struggle for the 'socialist project'.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370100 Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1021</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Career Communities</field><field name="creator">Parker, Heather Lynette Polly</field><field name="description">Careers link the inner, subjective, world of self with the outer, objective, world of institutions and society. As society increasingly reflects turbulence and fragmentation, people may still seek the sense of community that the old career arrangements were expected to provide. Taking inspiration from "new science" ideas of self-organising, and "intelligent career" ideas of individual learning, this thesis posits a new concept of "career communities". These are presented as an alternative organising structure through which the inter-dependence of career experiences and the environment in which they unfold is recognised. The thesis is focused around three questions. The first question relates to the application of intelligent career theory at a group level of analysis. Its exploration links three intelligent career "ways of knowing' to recent conceptions of communal learning. The second question concerns enhancing our understanding of career growth through career communities, and the learning and social opportunities these communities provide. The third question - in keeping with the tenets of new science - asks how career communities function as attractors in the way careers self-organise into collective work arrangements. The methodology adopted in this research advances an explicit theoretical connection between the (individual) subjective and (communal) inter-subjective worlds. The approach begins with an application of the 'intelligent career card sort' (ICCS) which elicits data on an individuals' subjective career according to three interdependent "ways of knowing". The results for the career community under consideration are then aggregated to provide input data for the elicitation of inter-subjective meaning through focus group discussions. This data is then analysed by reference to a typology of ten "pure types" of career community developed as part of this thesis. The thesis comprises four empirical studies. A preliminary pilot study of management consultants was conducted to ascertain the appropriateness of the methodology. Study#1 involved all workers in a non-for-profit organisation focused on rehabilitation of victims of sexual abuse. This group was expected to hold a strong ideological attachment to the work they performed. Study#2 involved Leased Executives, selected to represent the growing proportion of people experiencing contingency employment, and also because of their apparently high sense of professionalism in their work. Study#3 involved a group of Pacific Island professionals, predominantly from the public sector. This group was selected because they represent an ethnic minority whose cultural traditions are inherently collective rather than individual in orientation. The results communicate the inter-subjective meanings elicited at the group level of analysis. The patterns, which emerged from the interplay among the three ways of knowing, were analysed according to the typology of career communities previously developed. Each empirical study showed that in reality a hybrid of career community types was evident rather than any pure type. A comparison across the groups illustrates the principal differences among the groups in the career issues that they faced. The results provide support for the concept of career communities as an alternative organising principle behind people's careers, and one that extends beyond any single employment setting.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1029</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New Zealand friendly societies, 1842-1941</field><field name="creator">Carlyon, Jenny,1951-</field><field name="description">This thesis studies Friendly Societies of New Zealand from 1842, when the first lodge was established, to l94l when the Social Security Amendment Bill, allowing for the implementation of the general medical benefit, was enacted. It is the study of how, through the formation of mutual aid societies, a significant group of working people protected themselves against hardship. At the same time, it is the study of how Friendly Societies, by means of social activity and ritual, bonded their members together and synthesised their welfare role with the values of respectability, thrift and independence. The establishment of lodges throughout the nineteenth century is explored and it is shown how lodges, as well as providing for their members' welfare needs, were also effective community institutions of social integration, facilitating the adaptation of immigrants to their new environment. By the twentieth century very few New Zealand settlements were without a lodge. As an integral part of their communities, they were cross-class institutions, drawing together and mixing people from different classes, occupations and social groups. Traced also is the transformation of Friendly Societies from small, financially insecure, local lodges, combining conviviality with limited welfare benefits, to the large financially sound consolidated Societies of the 1930s providing their members with access to modem health care. Effective insurance became the primary focus of Friendly Societies. Although social life remained active, as the twentieth Century progressed, people increasingly joined lodges only for the health and medical benefits offered. Because of their wide range of benefits and because there was little else in the way of welfare relief at the time, Friendly Societies were relevant and significant suppliers of welfare. The state recognised this role and supported them with legislation and help, at least until 1910. However, as the state increasingly ventured into the welfare arena its support for the Societies waned, until finally friendly Society sickness benefits were replaced by the 1938 Social Security Act and their medical benefits by the Social Security Amendment Act of 1941. Friendly Societies were sidelined. Because welfare historiography has tended to focus on the state, it has neglected Friendly Societies. This study intends to redress the balance, and show that welfare did not start with tie state - that many people were making effective provision against sickness, disability and death for themselves long before the introduction of the welfare state.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::430000 History and Archaeology::430100 Historical Studies::430101 History: New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1033</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Computational Statistical Inference for Molecular Evolution and Population Genetics</field><field name="creator">Drummond, Alexei James</field><field name="description">This research aims to develop new methods and software for evolutionary inference. The focus will be on two challenges that analysis of molecular data in the genomic age provides: (1) measurably evolving populations and (ii) evolution of RNA secondary structure. Molecular sequence data is increasing in length, and also acquiring a depth in the rime dimension (for example, HIV-1, human influenza A, and ancient mtDNA). This has provided an innovative research direction, for which explicit evolutionary inference methods are required. The first aim of this research is to provide new statistical methods and new bioinformatic tools (software packages) to assist in tackling this new problem in evolutionary biology. Both maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference methods are developed for the purpose of estimating substitution rates and concerted changes in the substitution rate. In addition, with the rapid succession of newly sequenced full genomes, researchers can no longer use simple molecular sequence similarity to infer homology. Knowledge of molecular structure needs to be incorporated into evolutionary inference methods. The evolutionary relationship between sequence and structure is still poorly understood and the new wealth of data provides an exciting opportunity to guide theoretical developments. The second major objective of this research is to use the wealth of sequence data available to explore the role and impact of RNA secondary structure on evolution. To this end, empirical studies and simulations are undertaken to explore the role of RNA secondary structure in the evolution of 16S-like rRNA-encoding genes. Finally the inference of spatially resolved populations from gene sequences is briefly investigated. This research project has both computational and conceptual objectives. In both cases, the concrete result of these objectives will be new statistical models and computer software for evolutionary inference and a better understanding of the action of molecular and population processes during evolution.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1053</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transhumanism and the imago Dei: narratives of apprehension and hope</field><field name="creator">Garner, Stephen Robert</field><field name="description">The development of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality generate narratives of apprehension within contemporary Western technoculture. Transhumanist narratives declare that humanity is now upon the brink of seizing technological control of its own evolution, and creating a brighter and better posthuman future. For many, this leads to human technological capability being seen with both a sense of wonder at its potential, and a sense of dread of that same potential. Theologically, this raises two key questions: Firstly, why are human beings technological? Secondly, how should human technological agency be pursued? In this thesis, the motif of the imago Dei, the theological assertion that human beings are somehow made in the image and likeness of God, is employed to explore technological narratives of apprehension, and to answer these key questions. It is argued that the imago Dei, interpreted through the metaphor of the created co-creator, provides significant insight into the question of human technological inclination. The created co-creator, as a metaphor of hybridity, also intersects with similar transhumanist visions of the hybrid or cyborg, where the boundary between human persons and technology is ambiguous. Such visions of the hybrid prove disconcerting, for they blur traditional categories used to organise the world. Moreover, such visions also comprise elements of technological eschatology that provide meaning and hope, and stand in possible conflict with theological equivalents. The thesis concludes by considering how the metaphor of the created co-creator can draw upon the richness of the Christian traditions of social concern and hybridity to engender narratives of hope. These new narratives enlarge upon the theological understanding of human technological creativity and purpose to supplement the narratives of apprehension. In doing so, they provide impetus for wholesome and hopeful technological agency.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2251</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cellular trafficking of rotavirus NSP4 in epithelial cells</field><field name="creator">Bugarc&#780;ic&#769;, Andrea</field><field name="description">Rotavirus is a non-enveloped dsRNA virus that belongs to the family Reoviridae and is associated with severe dehydrating diarrhea in infants and young children throughout the world. Rotavirus targets the fully differentiated epithelial cells lining the tips of the small intestinal villi. Although different aspects of the rotavirus replication cycle have been researched extensively, the mechanism underlying the assembly of mature viral particles and the precise method by which rotavirus is able to induce diarrheal disease have not been fully elucidated. The rotavirus replication cycle involves budding of immature progeny virus particles, termed DLPs, from the site of replication and assembly into the lumen of ER via an interaction of the particle with the cytoplasmic domain of a virally encoded non-structural protein, NSP4. Recent studies confirm subcellular localisation of this protein in distinct membrane lipid microdomains at the later stages of the viral replication cycle in polarised epithelial cells and further classify these structures as a final assembly location for mature viral particles. Overall aim of the study presented in Chapter 3 was to characterise the domain of NSP4 responsible for such interaction and to further elucidate the significance of proposed interaction in the context of the rotavirus replication cycle. In order to assess this interaction in vitro, separate domains of the NSP4 protein, expressed by several different recombinant protein expression systems, were applied to a Caco-2 cell lysate and examined by floatation gradient and subsequent Western blot analysis. The NSP4-lipid microdomain interaction was mapped to a part of a coiled-coil domain including amino acids 85 to 122. The potential involvement of NSP4 in translocation progeny DLPs to the site of final viral assembly was also examined. Recent studies suggest involvement of this protein in the pathophysiology of rotavirus-induced diarrhea by acting as an enterotoxin. To mediate enterotoxic effects in vivo, NSP4 needs to be secreted or released from rotavirus-infected cells in a soluble form, but studies indicate that this is a transmembrane glycoprotein located in the ER membrane. Overall aim of the studies outlined in Chapter 4 was to identify and further characterise secretion of NSP4 from rotavirus-infected fully polarised Caco-2 cells. These studies reveal that NSP4 is actively secreted into the culture medium of polarised, but not non-polarised cells. The secretion was detected preferentially from the apical surface and was found to be dramatically inhibited by addition of BFA and monensin, suggesting a Golgi-dependent pathway is involved in release of this protein. In accordance with this finding, the secreted NSP4 isoform was found to undergo additional post-translational modification and is partially resistant to deglycosylation by EndoH and PNGaseF. Furthermore, apical secretion was not blocked by addition of glucosidase- or cholesterol- inhibitors, and no evidence was found that NSP4 was packaged in exosomes for its release. Taken together, these studies outline the pool of NSP4 that is able to actively participate in an assembly of mature progeny virus particles through its interaction with lipid microdomains and further identify a novel, soluble form of NSP4 secreted from rotavirus-infected polarised cells.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1980</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Relationship Between Importance and Time Allocation: Conceptualisations and Conditions in Learning, Social and Spiritual Domains</field><field name="creator">Lai, Mei Kuin</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1064</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Enhanced wind tunnel techniques and aerodynamic force models for yacht sails</field><field name="creator">Hansen, Heikki</field><field name="description">Accurate prediction of performance is an important aspect of modern sailing yacht design and provides a competitive advantage on the racecourse and in the marketplace. Although wind tunnel testing of yacht sails is a common tool for obtaining input data for Velocity Prediction Programs, its results have not been validated against aerodynamic full-scale measurements as quality full-scale data is rare. Wind tunnel measurements are conducted at the Twisted Flow Wind Tunnel of The University of Auckland and are compared to the full-scale aerodynamic force measurements from the Berlin Sail-Force-Dynamometer. To realise this comparison wind tunnel techniques and aerodynamic force models for yacht sails are enhanced; this in turn also improves the accuracy of Velocity Prediction Programs.  Force and surface pressure measurements were conducted demonstrating that the interaction of the hull/deck with the sails has a significant effect on the side force and the force perpendicular to the deck plane, and that this should be considered in aerodynamic analysis of sails and the performance prediction of yachts.  The first Real-Time Velocity Prediction Program for wind tunnel testing has been developed and implemented as an additional module of FRIENDSHIP-Equilibrium. Model sails can now be trimmed based on the full-scale performance of the yacht, and at the correct heel angle, which makes the trimming process in the wind tunnel much more similar to the real life situation.  Improved aerodynamic force models have been developed from realistically depowered sail trims obtained with the Real-Time Velocity Prediction Program. An empirical model that describes the force and moment changes due to depowering in detail has been developed and implemented. The standard semi-empirical trim parameter model, which expresses depowering in a more generic way, has been enhanced based on aerodynamic principles and validated against the wind tunnel results.  Utilising the enhanced wind tunnel techniques and aerodynamic force models, a generally good qualitative and quantitative agreement with the full-scale data is achieved. Remaining challenges associated with full-scale and wind tunnel tests are however also highlighted and, based on this work alone, a conclusive judgement that scaling effects are negligible cannot be made.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Engineering</field><field name="subject">Sail aerodynamics</field><field name="subject">Wind tunnel testing</field><field name="subject">Full-scale sail force dynamometer</field><field name="subject">Trim parameters</field><field name="subject">Real-Time Velocity Prediction Program</field><field name="subject">Hull forces</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1759</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quasi-Markets and Contracting for Health Services</field><field name="creator">Ashton, Toni</field><field name="description">ln 1993, the New Zealand health system was radically restructured. Area health boards, which were responsible for both purchasing and providing health services, were replaced by a quasi-market system in which public and private providers compete for public funds via contracts with purchasers. This thesis employs transaction cost economics (TCE) to examine the theory, the policy and the practice of the emerging quasi-market for health services in New Zealand. The main hypothesis which emerges from TCE is that contractual arrangements, which differ in their costs, will be aligned with transactions, which differ in their attributes, in a way which minimizes the sum of production and transaction costs. If services involve specific assets, or are difficult to measure and monitor, the transaction costs of contracting are likely to be high. The structure of the New Zealand health system prior to and after 1993 are described and analysed. Features of the emerging quasi-market include monopsonistic regional purchasers, a highly concentrated market for hospital services, weak budget constraints for CHEs, and a lack of competitive or political neutrality. All of these factors tend to dilute any incentives for efficiency. The TCE framework is used to examine the early contracting experiences and contractual relationships for four different health services: rest homes, primary health clinics, surgical services and mental health services. The selection of these four services was based upon a profiling of the characteristics which, according to TCE, are likely to influence the cost of transactions. The results support the central argument of the thesis. That is, that the costs of contracting are higher for some services than for others because of inherent differences in the attributes of different health services. A blunt policy instrument which forces a split between the roles of purchaser and provider for all health services fails to recognise these differences and may prohibit the development of organizational structures which might otherwise be selected as means of economizing on the transaction costs. Efforts must now be made to encourage a more discriminating approach to contracting in which a classical or neo-classical style of contracting is retained for those services where potential efficiency gains are high and the transaction costs of contracting are relatively low while longer-term relational contracts are developed for services where transaction costs are high.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1099</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The negotiation of meaning by advanced ESL learners: the effects of individual learner factors and task type</field><field name="creator">Bitchener, John</field><field name="description">During the last two decades, SLA researchers have given much attention to investigating the role that negotiated interaction plays in second language learning. Empirical research has demonstrated that the negotiation of meaning that occurs when communication difficulties arise may provide learners with opportunities to receive comprehensible input, provide feedback on form and meaning, and assist them in their production of modified output. While the short-term and long-term effects of negotiation on SLA are currently being examined, there is considerable evidence to suggest that the negotiation of meaning can facilitate the language learning process. From a pedagogical perspective, numerous studies have shown the effect that individual learner, task and context variables can have on promoting opportunities for negotiation. While some attention has been given to the effects of individual learner variables like ethnicity, gender and pairing, and to task and contextual variables on L2 negotiation, their effect on advanced learners has been little researched. This study examined the effect of three individual learner variables (ethnicity, gender and pairing) and certain communication tasks (free conversation and decision-making) on the way in which advanced ESL learners (Japanese and Korean males and females in monoethnic and interethnic dyads) repair communication problems and use the process of negotiation in their language learning. The study revealed that task was the only variable to affect the amount of negotiated repair: free conversation produced more negotiation than the decision making tasks. While monoethnic dyads provided more target language feedback than interethnic dyads, monoethnic and male dyads modified fewer trigger utterances than interethnic and female dyads. Korean subjects, particularly Korean males, modified more of their utterances when responding to feedback than the other subject groupings. Factors that may have accounted for the limited effect of the three individual learner variables include the insufficiently differentiated sociocultural and sociolinguistic background of the subjects and their perception of appropriate behaviour in L2 interactions. On the other hand, motivational and contextual factors appear to have resulted in the significant effect produced by the task variable.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1100</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The health of yellowbelly flounder (Rhombosolea leporina) from the Waitemata Harbour</field><field name="creator">Nenadic, Ajrin</field><field name="description">This study focuses on an assessment of the health status of the yellowbelly flounder (Rhombosolea leporina) from two estuarine locations (site 1 &#8211; the mouth of the Henderson Creek; site 2 &#8211; the mouth of the Whau Creek) in the Waitemata Harbour. This harbour borders the highly urbanised and industrialised Auckland City metropolitan area. Whangaparaoa Peninsula, located approximately 30 km north of the other two collecting sites (away from the main urban area), was chosen as a reference site for comparative purposes. Physico-chemical analyses revealed differences in water quality at the sampling sites. A lower pH, oxygen deficiency and higher temperature were recorded in both the Waitemata Harbour locations in comparison with the reference site. Histopathological analyses revealed significantly higher prevalences and severity of pathological changes in the gills, blood, liver, kidney and gonads of the yellowbelly flounder from both harbour locations in comparison with fish from the reference site. ln addition, some types of lesions (eg. neoplasms) were observed in fish from the two harbour locations only. Abnormalities in the gill structure of fish from both harbour sites included: epithelial swelling (hyperplasia and hypertrophy), necrosis, and lifting with oedema; the fusion of secondary lamellae; aneurysms; filamental deformities; mucous cell proliferation, and infestation by Trichodina. The abnormalities found in the blood of these fish were manifested as: polycythaemia; erythrocytosis; erythroblastosis; leucocytosis (increased neutrophils); poikilocytosis; anisocytosis and an increased prevalence of erythrocytes undergoing necrosis. Vacuolar degeneration of the hepatocellular parenchyma due to lipid or glycogen accumulation was the most prominent liver change observed in fish from all sampling sites. The other liver abnormalities observed in flounder from the two harbour sites included: foci of cellular alterations (clear, basophilic and necrotic), congestion of the sinusoids, infestation by nematodes, and anaplastic growths (cholangiocellular carcinoma and teratoma). Pathological changes found in the kidneys of flounder collected at both harbour sites were classified as glomerular abnormalities (atrophy and dilatation of the glomerular tuft; enlargement of Bowman's space) and tubular vacuolar degeneration and necrosis. The presence of myxosporean parasites was also a common finding in the kidneys of harbour fish. Follicular atresia was the most prevalent change observed in the ovaries of flounder from the two harbour sites. Biochemical analysis of plasma proteins and electrolytes of flounder from the three sampling sites revealed hyperbilirubinaemia, hypoalbuminaemia and uraemia in those inhabiting both harbour sites. In addition, the concentration of total liver microsomal proteins was significantly depressed in flounder from harbour sites 1 and 2 when compared to that of fish from the reference site. Concentrations of heavy metals in the livers of flounder from different sampling localities were found to decrease in the order: site 2 &gt; reference site &gt; site 1, and did not correlate with the prevalences of liver abnormalities. Significantly more prominent pathological changes were thus observed in fish from both estuarine harbour sites in comparison with those from the reference open water site. The pathological changes noted are believed to occur in response to environmental changes. Contamination by different xenobiotics in the Whau and Henderson Creeks, which have been recorded in previous studies, suggest the possibility of direct toxic effects of the water contaminants on flounder from the estuarine parts of these creeks. In addition, the relatively high temperature, low pH and low oxygen levels recorded at the two sites in the Waitemata Harbour are believed to have induced oxygen deficiency-related tissue hypoxia which could then have led to the expression of a variety of diseases of which some have been detected in this study. However, the possibility that some unknown and unmeasured causal factors may have produced the observed pattern of flounder diseases cannot be eliminated.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1104</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors related to the pricing of audit services in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Neale, Ann Yvonne</field><field name="description">Listed companies in New Zealand appoint an auditor, first, in compliance with statute mandatory appointment) and, second, to monitor agent (management) performance compared to principal (shareholder)preferences. The monitoring requirements of the audit contract should be reflected in the audit fee. In this thesis, I use Simunic's (1980) fee model to investigate three questions regarding the determinants of audit pricing. First, auditors have the incentive to earn fee premiums (quasi-rents) by developing specialised monitoring skills that address the needs of industries with a differentiated demand for monitoring. Three classifications of differentiated monitoring are developed to investigate whether fee premiums are earned on those audits. Fee premiums are shown to be earned by Big Seven auditors over non-Big Seven auditors, but the null hypothesis that industry specialist auditors do not earn fee premiums over non-specialists is not rejected. The incentive to earn quasi-rents in future fees provides a rationale for auditors to bid a reduced audit fee in order to gain incumbency (DeAngelo, 1981a). The second research question uses a sample of audit fees from the first financial statements after listing to test for reduced fees on initial audits. Results indicate that audit fees for the first financial statements after listing are lower than the level of audit fee for existing companies. Negotiation of audit fees may be affected by professional regulation. The third research question investigates whether abandonment of a fee scale by the professional accounting body in New Zealand influenced the general level of audit fees. The results fail to reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference in fees before and after abandonment of the fee scale. The incentive to develop industry-specialised monitoring skills may be replaced, in a small country, by alternate audit practice development strategies; for example, diversification of an audit portfolio in order to spread risk. Auditor brand name, reflecting technical skills, may thus earn a fee premium in preference to industry specialist skills. A final limitation of this work arises from the time period of interest (1985-87), a time of change in New Zealand's business environment, in which audit fee determinants may be subject to effects not captured in this thesis.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1105</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Parenting after assisted conception by in vitro fertilisation, gift or donor insemination</field><field name="creator">Adair, Vivienne</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1108</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influence of children in family purchase decisions: the development and use of an observational scale as a method of measuring influence</field><field name="creator">Lee, Christina Kwai-Choi</field><field name="description">Although the influence of children in the family decision making process has been accepted as a force which neither academics nor practitioners can ignore, the degree and nature of this influence has not been satisfactorily established. This hiatus in the body of marketing knowledge provides the topic for this thesis. A conceptual model linking the variables that affect household purchase decisions was formulated by surveying the relevant literature. This model serves both as a pedagogical framework within which to discuss the literature, and as a guide to the formulation of a set of research hypotheses for the work reported here. Eighty-nine observations of family interactions during a simulated decision situation were recorded in the families' homes, using a video camera. The videotapes were later content-analyzed by three independent judges. Self-report data about perceived influence structures were collected at the same time. The development of the Observed Influence Scale (OIS) takes primacy here. The scale was tested for reliability and validity and the results using the scale were compared to those generated by the self-report scales. The OIS was then applied to provide data, over three stages of the decision process, to test the series of hypotheses about family decision-making mentioned above. Multivariate analysis of variance was performed for each family role player, using the three stages of the influence process as the dependent variables and Social class, Sex-role orientation (SRO), Wife's occupation, Involvement, Decision styles and Gender composition of the children as the independent variables. Several patterns of behaviour emerged. Significant effects were found for all the variables tested, although not all the research hypotheses were supported in the expected manner. The effects upon influence of Social class, SRO and Wife's occupation are interactive, the other three variables stand alone. It was found, inter alia, that mothers and elder sons, and fathers and elder daughters work together to gain influence in the family decision.

While a focus is maintained on the fifteen year period between the appearance of the first issue of Phoenix in March 1932 and the advent of Landfall, the thesis examines several magazines whose issue runs extend well outside that period. The thesis is divided into two volumes, the first of which, in Chapters Two through Five, provides a detailed survey of the four most important periodicals published entirely within the period selected for this study: Phoenix (1932-1933), Tomorrow (1934-1940), Book (1941-1947), and New Zealand New Writing (1942-1945). Chapter Six concludes Volume One with a survey of the numerous university based periodicals, including several published entirely outside the focal period of the study. In Volume Two, Chapters Seven to Nine discuss, in order, the Auckland family magazine the Mirror (1922-1963), the national magazine of the arts Art in New Zealand (1928-1946), and the travel journal the Near Zealand Railways Magazine (1926-1940). All three of these publications are of significance as early sites for the development in New Zealand of the popular fiction genres of romance, adventure and mystery. Chapter Ten deals with a range of minor little magazines, including the New Zealand Mercury (1933-1936), Quill (1934-1948), Anvil (1945-1946), Chapbook (1945-1950), Oriflamme: A Literary Journal (1939-1942), and those edited, printed and published by Noel Farr Hoggard: Spilt Ink (1932-1937), New Triad (1937-1942), Letters (1943-1946), and Arena'(1946-1972). Appendix I supplies an annotated bibliography of the fifty-two periodicals discussed in the body of the thesis. These annotations are supplemented with author indexes for those periodicals not already indexed by earlier researchers. Appendix II compares the text of Allen Curnow's 1939 prose and poetry sequence Not in Narrow Seas with an early version of the sequence published in Tomorrow between June 1937 and August 1938.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1146</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The archaeology of Maori occupation along the Waihou River, Hauraki</field><field name="creator">Phillips, Caroline</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370300 Anthropology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1159</field></doc><doc><field name="title">About our father's business: fatherhood in New Zealand 1900-1940</field><field name="creator">Frank, Timothy</field><field name="description">Early twentieth-century New Zealand fathers have commonly been regarded as distant figures in their children's lives, minimally involved in child care, and expressing their parenting in breadwinning terms. Although the numbers of men who married and had families steadily increased between 1900 and 1940, it is generally accepted that little changed in terms of men's parenting participation in the home. This thesis tests the veracity of these assumptions by comparing the private experiences of fathers with official and public records of fatherhood. It also examines the degree to which the culture of fatherhood and fathering practices 'modernised' during this period. Fathering between 1900 and 1940 was significantly impacted by the fact that mothers were regarded as the primary care givers in- New Zealand homes during that period. By 1900 social expectations of fathers were relatively well defined, although some important new directions in social thinking about fathers were also developing (Chapter one). However, the socially-constructed parameters defining fatherhood did not mean all fathers fathered alike. A wide variety of parenting attitudes and practices characterised fathering in private (Chapter Two). Yet fathering was always subject to public and official scrutiny, and Chapter Three examines politicians' efforts to encourage and improve fathering responsibility prior to the First World War. Ironically, these efforts succeeded-in diminishing some of the domestic patriarchal authority fathers exercised over their children (Chapter Four). This patriarchal/paternal authority was challenged at the same time the state and the Plunket Society helped entrench an increasingly mother-prioritised culture of child care in New Zealand society (Chapter Five). In the interwar years, fathers faced significant threats to their idea of themselves as breadwinners, some of them falling foul of the state and its determination to tackle the 'errant parent' as a result (Chapter Six). But fathers and fatherhood did not stand still, and by the 1930s some essential differences separated them from their 1900s predecessors. The culture of fatherhood was impacted more than fathering practice by 'modernising' attitudes to child care and the new relational paradigms influencing parent-child interaction at this time. But attitudes influence conduct, and although a mother-prioritised parenting culture remained intact into the 1940s, fathers were learning to understand their parenting place in the home and their interaction with children in significantly new ways (Chapters Seven and Eight).</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::430000 History and Archaeology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1222</field></doc><doc><field name="title">O le A'oa'oina o le gagana, faitautusi ma le tusitusi i le a'oga a le faifeau: Ekalesia Faapotopotoga Kerisiano Samoa (EFKS) = Literacy education, language, reading and writing in the pastor's school: Congregational Christian Church of Samoa (CCCS)</field><field name="creator">Tanielu, Lonise Sera</field><field name="description">This study is about an educational experience, which encompasses a range of educational knowledge and skills. It is an experience that is relatively unknown in educational research terms.

The Pastor's School (A'oga a le Faifeau) system teaches children to read and write, employing both Palagi and Fa'a Samoa frameworks. The study is also a positive response to the critical and sometimes negative historical treatment of the church and the Fa'a Samoa, especially in their role in the Samoan child's critical literacy experiences. In the light of the underachievement of Samoan children (especially in literacy-reading and writing), this thesis makes two arguments. They are: i) The Pastors' Schools are an important educational system that have escaped attention but which have profoundly significant educational content and impacts. ii) There is a literacy problem in New Zealand that the A'oga a le Faifeau could address for the reported underachieving Samoan children. The content of the A'oga a le Faifeau syllabus for example, includes the teaching of reading, writing, arithmetic, religious and general knowledge, and the Fa'a Samoa This knowledge forms part of the semantic resources, and literacy skills and expertise, which could prepare children for school because some of those knowledge and skills have spans to school-based literacies.

The Introduction gives reasons for the thesis' focus on Maaori women and outlines three major influences which have determined the approach to close-readings and analyses of waahine characters in the body of the thesis: an early Paakehaa representation of Maaori women, an increase of Maaori dramatists and the emergence of Maaori women's feminism. The thesis comprises a further six chapters. Chapter One contextualises the play analyses which appear in Chapters Four Five and Six by describing a Maaori theatre and drama whakapapa that stakes a significant and influential place for waahine theatre practitioners. Chapters Two and Three explore tino rangatiratanga/sel-determination and marae-concept theatre (respectively), arguing that between 1980 and 2000 these aspects of content and form have created theatrical conditions which facilitate Maaori women's representation. Chapters Four, Five and Six show that, as Maaori women such as Renee' Rena Owen, Riwia Brown, Roma Potiki and Briar Grace-Smith have become more active in the Maaori theatre whakapapa, contemporary representations of Maaori women have become more complex and diverse. A set of bibliographic appendices provides detailed lists of first productions of plays mentioned in the thesis. Throughout, the thesis maps the increased visibility and presence of Maaori women on the New Zealand stage, showing how in the years 1980-2000 the theatre has become a potent site for expression and exploration of Maaori cultural identity.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1420</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Concepts and techniques in software watermarking and obfuscation</field><field name="creator">Zhu, William Feng</field><field name="description">With the rapid development of the internet, copying a digital document is so easy and economically affordable that digital piracy is rampant. As a result, software protection has become a vital issue in current computer industry and a hot research topic. Software watermarking and obfuscation are techniques to protect software from unauthorized access, modification, and tampering. While software watermarking tries to insert a secret message called software watermark into the software program as evidence of ownership, software obfuscation translates software into a semantically- equivalent one that is hard for attackers to analyze. In this thesis, firstly, we present a survey of software watermarking and obfuscation. Then we formalize two impor- tant concepts in software watermarking: extraction and recognition and we use a concrete software watermarking algorithm to illustrate issues in these two concepts. We develop a technique called the homomorphic functions through residue numbers to obfuscate variables and data structures in software programs. Lastly, we explore the complexity issues in software watermarking and obfuscation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">computer science</field><field name="subject">software security</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1511</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Augmented reality visualisation for mobile robot developers</field><field name="creator">Collett, Toby H. J.</field><field name="description">Developer interactions with robots during the testing and debugging phases of robot development are more complex than and distinct from general software application development. One of the primary differences is the need to understand the robot's view of the environment and the inconsistencies between this and the actual environment. Augmented reality (AR) provides an ideal way to achieve this, allowing robot program data to be displayed in context with the real world. This allows for easy comparison by the developer, highlighting the cause for any bugs in the robot behaviour. An AR debugging space is created in this work that allows the developer to have this enhanced understanding of the robot's world-view, thus improving developer efficiency.  Over the past decade robots have begun to move out of industrial assembly lines and into environments that must be shared with human users. Many of the tasks that we wish robots to perform in these environments require close interaction and collaboration with human users. The move away from the constrained environment of a production line means that the tasks required of robots are more varied, their operating environment is far more complex and unpredictable, and safety can no longer be achieved through isolation of the robot. The result of these influences has been to change robot programming from a simple task of instructing the robot to perform a sequence of steps to an open ended challenge of specifying dynamic interactions that robot developers are still coming to terms with. Robot development is more than just design and code entry and a broader approach to improving robot development is needed. One of the founding principles of this thesis is that robot development should be approached as a human-robot interaction issue, this particularly applies to the testing and debugging phases of the development.  The nature of the robot platform, the tasks the robot is required to perform and the environments that robots work within are significantly different from those of the desktop application. Hence robot developers need a tailored tool chain that focuses on this unique combination of issues. Current robot programming research is dominated by robot APIs and frameworks, leaving support tools to be developed in an ad hoc manner by developers as features are required. This leads to disjointed tools that have minimal feature sets; tools that generally have poor portability when applied to other robot developments. This work examines the needs of the developer in terms of a general purpose robot visualisation tool.  One of the fundamental requirements of a general purpose robot visualisation tool is that a set of stock visualisations must be available for the developer. A prerequisite to providing these is to have a set of standard interfaces to provide the visualisations for. The open source robot framework Player/Stage was used throughout this work to provide standardised access to robot hardware. As part of this research the author has contributed heavily to the Player/Stage project, particularly as one of the key developers of the 2.0 release of Player. This new release simplifies Player development and increases the ease of maintenance of Player drivers and the efficiency of the server core.  To evaluate the benefits of AR visualisation an intelligent debugging space was developed, which runs as a permanent installation in a robotic development lab providing an enhanced view of the robot's behaviour to the developer. The space is capable of automatically detecting the presence of robots and displaying visualisations of the standard interfaces of the robot, such as its sensors and effectors. The debugging space also allows the developer to create custom renderings, leveraging the developer's ability to determine the most salient items of their code and display these.  A set of representative case studies was carried out using the debugging space for testing and debugging. These studies showed that AR provides an opportunity to understand the type of errors that are encountered during debugging. Debugging is essentially a process of elimination and by understanding the type of error developers can quickly eliminate large sets of potential bug sources, focusing on the sections of code that are causing the bug and therefore substantially reducing debugging time. The implemented system also shows that AR provides an important stepping stone between simulation environments and the real world.  This thesis contributes the novel approach of applying AR to developer interactions with robots. The use of AR has been shown to have significant benefits for the robot developer, enhancing their understanding of the robot's world-view and hence reducing debugging time. As part of the work a flexible AR visualisation tool was developed with close integration to the Player/Stage project. This tool creates an intelligent debugging space where developers can exploit the benefits of the AR visualisation with minimal overhead.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Robotics</field><field name="subject">Augmented Reality</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1510</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A toolkit for the visualization of tensor fields in biomedical finite element models</field><field name="creator">W&#252;nsche, Burkhard Claus</field><field name="description">Medical imaging is an essential tool for improving the diagnoses, understanding and treatment of a large variety of diseases. Over the last century technology has advanced from the discovery of x-rays to a variety of 3D imaging tools such as magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, positron emission tomography and ultrasonography. As a consequence the size and complexity of medical data sets has increased tremendously making it ever more difficult to understand, analyze, compare and communicate this data. Visualization is an attempt to simplify these tasks according to the motto "An image says more than a thousand words". This thesis introduces a toolkit for visualizing biomedical data sets with a particular emphasis on second-order tensors, which are mathematically described by matrices and can be used to express complex tissue properties such as material de-formation and water diffusion. The toolkit has a modular design which facilitates the comparison and exploration of multiple data sets. A novel field data structure allows the interactive creation of new measures and boolean filters are introduced as a universal visualization tool. Various new visualization methods are presented including new colour mapping techniques, ellipsoid-based textures and a line integral convolution texture for visualizing tensor fields. To motivate the design and to assist in the use of the toolkit, guidelines for creating effective visualizations are derived by using perceptual concepts from cognitive science. A new classification for visual attributes according to representational accuracy, perceptual dimension and spatial requirements is presented and the results are used to derive values for the information content and information density of each attribute. A review and a classification of visualization icons completes the theoretical background. The thesis concludes with two case studies. In the first case study the toolkit is used to visualize the strain tensor field in a healthy and a diseased human left ventricle. New insight into the cardiac mechanics is obtained by applying and modifying techniques traditionally used in solid mechanics and computational fluid dynamics. The second case study explores ways to obtain in vivo information of the brain anatomy by visualizing and systematically exploring Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) data. Three new techniques for the visualization of DTI data are presented: Barycentric colour maps allow an integrated view of different types of diffusion anisotropy. Ellipsoid-based textures and Anisotropy Modulated Line Integral Convolution create images segmented by tissue type and incorporating a texture representing the 3D orientation of nerve fibers. The effectiveness of the exploration approach and the new visualization techniques are demonstrated by identifying various anatomical structures and features from a diffusion tensor data set of a healthy brain.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291500 Biomedical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1225</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of Christology from a tribal perspective: with special reference to Mizoram, northeast India</field><field name="creator">Lalpekhlua, L. H.</field><field name="description">This thesis seeks to interpret Christology from the perspective of tribal people in Mizoram, northeast India, with an objective to help them and their churches to understand Jesus Christ in a way meaningful to them. In this study, historical and socio-theological analysis is used to show that Christology and culture are always related, and that different Christologies have been developed in different cultural contexts. This analysis in turn helps identify the issues that must be addressed in the construction of a contextual Christology for Mizoram context. In this study, Mizo culture and experience are taken into account as essential theological source. The first chapter discusses the need for a contextual Christology and examines the basic issues and methodological approaches surrounding the construction of contextual Christology. In the second chapter, the context of tribal people in Mizoram is analysed. Among the major issues that must be addressed in Christological construction, the thesis identifies the growing disparity between rich and poor within the state and the socio-economic alienation of Mizos from mainland India. The third chapter surveys the Christological tradition in Mizoram from its beginning to the present. It finds that the Christological heritage in Mizoram is largely irrelevant to Mizo people because of its uncritical application of Western theology to this very different historical and cultural context. The idea of Christ introduced into Mizoram is basically individualistic, otherworldly and dualistic. Neither missionaries nor native church leaders have taken the local culture seriously into account in doing Christology. The fourth chapter attempts to recover some major liberating cultural traditions of the Mizos as sources for Christology, including their concepts of pasaltha, humanity, land, God and spiritual beings, and life after death. The study reveals that, despite the Western overlay, there is a significant continuity and influence of traditional culture in Mizo Christianity. On the basis of these findings, the fifth chapter seeks to reinterpret the significance of Jesus Christ in the Mizoram context, using a Mizo conceptual framework. It argues that the idea of the pasaltha incorporates much of the New Testament portrait of the person and work of Christ, Jesus' self-giving life and ministry, incarnation, suffering and death on the cross, can all be seen as manifesting the principle of tlawmngaihna, which is an essential characteristic of the pasaltha. Jesus' resurrection and exaltation can be seen as God's response to Jesus' person and work precisely as pasaltha-tlawmngai. Similarly, the kingdom of God, which defined and summed up Jesus' message and mission, can be perceived in the Mizoram context as exhibiting the qualities of a communitarian society.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::440000 Philosophy and Religion	::40200 Religion and Religious Traditions::440204 Christian theology (incl.

The first chapter following the introduction is concerned with modeling partial consumer participation in the context of two-way interconnection in telecommunications. Partial consumer participation is introduced into the model of competition between telecommunications networks developed by Armstrong (1998), Carter and Wright (1999) and Laffont et al (1998a). It is shown that the result that firms are indifferent over the access charge under two-part tariffs no longer holds when there is partial consumer participation. Under some additional simplifying assumptions, it is shown that firms prefer that the access charge is set equal to the marginal cost of termination. Without these additional assumptions the model is analytically complex and numerical simulation results are presented which shown that firms prefer the access charge to be less than marginal cost, while the socially optimal access charge is above cost. The next chapter considers competition between two-sided networks. Firms with two-sided networks facilitate connections or transactions between two distinct populations of consumers. This chapter analyses the behaviour of such firms where there are no intrinsic benefits to consumers other than the network effects, examples of which include employment agencies, real estate agents and videogame platforms. The modelling framework encompasses both matching service and platform business models and allows for subscription or per-transaction pricing. Three different market structures are considered: monopoly, and duopoly with and without compatibility. Comparisons of prices, profits, consumer surplus, and welfare are made between the three regimes. It is shown that one side of the market generally pays a lower price than the other, and the conditions under which one side of the market is charged a zero price are derived. It is also shown that duopoly with compatibility is socially preferable to the other regimes, while monopoly is socially preferable to duopoly without compatibility. The final chapter examines the reputation systems that are increasingly accompanying network businesses. This chapter explores the trade-off between the short-term benefits of false quality advertisements by sellers in a market with asymmetric information against the longer term costs of reputation damage. A directed search model is constructed in which submarkets are created by the advertisements and reputations of sellers. A reputation system links misleading advertisements in the present period to a lower reputation in the next period. It is shown that a reputation system always increases the prices of high quality products and directs search more accurately towards the sellers with such products. It is also shown that buyers are hurt by a reputation system if the market is thin - has few sellers &#8211; because the equilibrium increase in prices is greater than the equilibrium increase in the quality of trade. On the other hand, it is shown that submarket creation by a reputation system always increases total welfare because buyers' search is directed more accurately and the number of quality adjusted matches increases. Finally, it is shown that a reputation system which screens for honesty increases social welfare by making sellers more truthful, however, a reputation for honesty is not always highly valued and an alternative reputation system which screens for type can be more effective.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1284</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation and detection of viruses (Cucumovirus, Potyvirus) infecting vanilla in R&#233;union Island and Polynesian Islands</field><field name="creator">Le Roux, Karin, 1974-</field><field name="description">Natural vanilla (Vanilla planifolia, V. tahitensis) is economically important for a number of producing countries, but viral diseases are prejudicial to its successful cultivation. Techniques are required to detect viruses in vanilla plants in order to establish quarantine procedures and sources of virus-free planting material. This study contributed to the progress in managing viral diseases of vanilla by firstly identifying Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV, cucumovirus) as causing severe distortion, stunting, sterility and sometimes death of vanilla plants. Vanilla CMV isolates from French Polynesia (Pacific Ocean) and R&#233;union Island (Indian Ocean) were classified in CMV subgroup IB, adding to the short list of subgroup IB isolates detected outside of Asia. Two isolates were putatively classified in subgroup IA, suggesting that CMV in vanilla is still evolving and/or that vanilla is infected from different sources. Subgroup II CMV from New Zealand was also experimentally infectious to V. planifolia, showing that vanilla crops should be protected from all potential sources of CMV inoculum. Existing serological and molecular detection rests were performant for the detection of CMV directly from vanilla tissue. Secondly, this study provided the first coat protein sequence information for Vanilla mosaic virus (VanMV, Potyvirus). A Cook Islands isolate (VanMV-CI) and a French Polynesia isolate (VanMV-FP) had distinctly different coat proteins. The VanMV-FP CP N-terminus contained a stretch of amino-acid repeats (GTN) typical of natively unfolded proteins. This GTN stretch was located downstream of a DVG motif (which replaced the more common aphid transmission DAG motif), suggesting a role in improving aphid transmission, or regulating formation of the HC-virus complex. CP core nucleotide sequence identities indicated VanMV-CI and VanMV-FP were strains of Dasheen mosaic virus (DsMV). In contrast, CP amino-acid sequence homologies between VanMV- CI and DsMV were intermediate between strains and species, and CP amino-acid homologies between VanMV-FP and DsMV were typical of distinct species. In addition, VanMv-CI and VanMv-FP had characteristic 3'NTR sequences and NIb/CP cleavage sites, and only infected vanilla. Hence, it is proposed that VanMV-CI and VanMV-FP are considered new Potyvirus species and named Vanilla mosaic Cook Islands virus and Vanilla mosaic French Polynesia virus. Alternatively, the two isolates may be grouped under the name Dasheen mosaic virus-Vanilla (DsMV-V) and distinguished from Dasheen mosaic virus-Dasheen(DsMV-D). Primers to VanMV-CI and VanMV-FP were designed and permitted RT-PCR detection of the viruses directly from vanilla tissue. VanMV-Cl and VanMV-FP could be differentiated from DsMV and Watermelon mosaic virus (WMV-Tonga), and differentiated from each other by comparison of amplicon size. Long-term specific potyvirus diagnosis is however expected to be difficult due to potyviral variability in vanilla. Future research should concentrate on techniques such as microarrays to permit simultaneous detection combined with specific identification of potyvirus species. Such techniques would be beneficial to viral disease management in vanilla and many other crops.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1289</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A claim to truth: documentary, politics, production</field><field name="creator">Goldson, Annie</field><field name="description">The following thesis examines how documentary texts, in particular those that are associated with the tradition of political documentary, negotiate their way into being. For this purpose, I use a series of documentary case studies, each one structured around a work of my own. The five documentaries I examine were made through the decade 1990-2000 and, although these works address a range of specific cultural and political issues, they were produced either out of the US or New Zealand, the two countries within which I have lived while a documentary maker. My methodological approach is two-fold. First, I place each documentary within a framework designed by Bill Nichols as a way of defining documentary. Nichols, a major presence in the field of documentary studies, looks at documentary as constructed through a matrix of factors: the interplay of possible documentary modes and styles, pressures brought to bear through the institutional context surrounding documentary production, such as funding and distribution, the expectations of the genres' audiences, and the dialogue and influences generated by a community of documentary practitioners and their films and videos. In following Nichols' model, I offer up a modal and textual analysis for each of my own works cited, and examine, through a mixture of anecdote and theory, how funders, distributors, audiences and my fellow makers shaped my documentaries. In carrying out this examination, I also highlight certain debates that raged through the decade, particularly around documentary realism and identity politics, that were to have considerable impact on my work. My second methodological approach is to situate each work within a history of "political documentary". In Chapter One of this thesis I have attempted to categorize the various formulations of the sub-genre, which have developed since the inception of film over a century ago. In the ensuing chapters I examine how each of my documentaries draws on that history. My own body of works of course was produced in a relatively short period, but even within this time the historical changes the world has undergone are immense. Documentary is ever sensitive to its context and I chart the impact of political change on the texts being scrutinized. Although the focus, my own work, may appear narrow, the thesis draws on the tradition of participant observation and seeks, by analyzing the complexities of production within a series of case Studies, to cast light on contemporary documentary practice generally.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410300 Cinema, Electronic Arts and Media Studies::410301 Film and video studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1246</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dynamics of benthic invertebrate communities in a northern New Zealand kauri forest stream ecosystem</field><field name="creator">Towns, D.

In a series of experiments I investigated the question of hemispheric asymmetries in the AB. Experiment 1 was a simplification of the experiment by Raymond et al. (1992) to determine whether the particular stimuli and task conditions of my study would produce an AB. In Experiments 2 and 3, two RSVP streams were presented in parallel, one in each visual field. The AB occurred only when participants both identified and located the target, and not when they simply located it. When targets and probes were both presented in the right visual field (RVF), the typical AB pattern was obtained, sparing probes in the first post-target location ("lag 1 sparing"). However, the AB was greatly attenuated when both target and probe were in the left visual field (LVF). When target and probe were in different spatial locations, there was a strong decrement in detecting the probe in the first post-target position-again more marked in the RVF. Cross-stream decrements may reflect the transient effects of shifting attention, while the AB itself appeared to be largely restricted to within-stream sequences, and to processing by the left cerebral hemisphere. Experiment 4 was a further behavioural study, in which I examined differences in functional cerebral asymmetries modulated by gonadal steroid hormones during the menstrual cycle in women. Twenty-one right handed women, with regular menstrual cycle, were tested with a double RSVP task (one stream in each visual field) during the low steroid menses and the high steroid midluteal phase. An AB was obtained bilaterally in the midluteal phase, while during menses the probe detection deficit was evident only in the RVF. Low steroid levels appeared to stabilize functional cerebral asymmetries. In contrast, high levels of estradiol and progesterone in the midluteal phase appeared to reduce functional asymmetries due to a selective enhancement of the AB in the right hemisphere. In Experiment 5 and 6 I recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) to examine the temporal course of the AB. probe-related ERPs were compared between the control condition and the experimental condition when the probe was presented in the blink period (post-target position 2-4) and in the no-blink period (post-target position 6-8). In the control condition in which the subjects were told to ignore the target, there was a negative peak around 300 ms following the probe, regardless of whether the probe was presented during the blink phase or during the no-blink phase. The same peak was found for the experimental condition when the probe was presented during the no-blink phase, but was missed for probes presented during the blink phase. This finding provides strong evidence that the AB reflects an impairment in a postperceptual stage of probe processing, probably at the stage of working memory. I replicated the finding (Vogel, Luck, &amp; Shapiro, 1998) that the AB and the P3 elicited by the target component are related. Source localisation of electrophysiological activities using low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA; Pascual-Marqui, Michel, &amp; Lehmann, 1994) revealed reduced activation during the AB in the left cerebral hemisphere when letters were used as stimuli, whereas the right hemisphere showed reduced activation when symbols were used.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1266</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Refocussing: the development and definition of the theory and its therapeutic practice with critical analysis and illustrative case studies</field><field name="creator">Divett, Diane Rosina</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1277</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The deployment and performance of indoor/outdoor DS-CDMA systems with multiuser detection</field><field name="creator">Pais, Adrian Victor</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the deployment and performance of indoor/outdoor DS-CDMA systems assuming both conventional receivers and multiuser detection receivers at the base stations. In the first part of this thesis, measured propagation data and a DS-CDMA system performance testbed (based on a Monte Carlo analysis) are used to quantify both the downlink and uplink outage probabilities for a variety of deployment scenarios: (a) indoor-only systems; (b) interfering indoor/outdoor systems; and (c) interfering indoor systems located adjacent to each other. The results reveal that optimal indoor deployment strategies are heavily dependent on both the location and strength of interference emanating from outdoors. Indoor base station deployment strategies that are optimal in the absence of outdoor interference are often suboptimal if outdoor interference is present.  In the second part of this thesis, two simple multiuser detection techniques are chosen for implementation in the DS-CDMA system performance testbed: successive interference cancellation (SIC) and parallel interference cancellation (PIC). The performance estimation results show that orders-of-magnitude improvements in uplink outage probability are possible with both SIC and PIC. The extent of these improvements is dependent on the deployment strategy used, the fractional residual interference cancellation error, and the uplink power control algorithm (for the case of SIC). If perfect interference cancellation is assumed, it is evident from the results of this thesis that the cancellation of signals in parallel (PIC) provides no additional benefit to system performance than ranking and cancelling the signals sequentially (SIC).</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1491</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Indoor wireless communication system performance enhancement via environmental modification</field><field name="creator">Lee, Derek C.

Frequency reuse in buildings can be enhanced by modifying the environment. However, the potential benefits of environmental modification need to be evaluated systematically to justify the related costs. This thesis reports the methods, the deployment strategies and the resulting system performance improvement of in-building environmental modification. In the investigation, coordinated deployment of a wireless communication system with multiple base stations is considered in several single-floor office environments. The base stations, each servicing a cell, are assumed to operate at the same set of frequencies thus adjacent interference results. Two modification methods, namely, metal reflectors and metal shields, are considered to enhance desired signals and mitigate adjacent interference, respectively. Significant impact of both methods on the propagation channel is experimentally observed. The potential benefits of deploying structural shielding to control interference are considered. The levels of adjacent interference are estimated for different shielding strategies by an experimentally-validated ray-model, and the outage probabilities are computed with an interference-limited DS-CDMA system model. Deployment of structural shielding is shown to be most effective in drywall-partitioned environments and when the operating frequency is in the vicinity of 5 GHz. The average outage probability is shown to be reduced by approximately 94% and 90% at 1.8 GHz and 5.24 GHz, respectively, for a drywall-partitioned office environment after shielding 14% of the internal wall length. In open plan offices, the effectiveness of structural shielding is observed to diminish as the partition height reduces. Alternatively, considerable interference control is shown to be achieved by highly-reflective reflectors installed on the ceiling above the base stations. In the presence of a significant centrally-located environmental obstacle, the cost effectiveness of structural shielding deployment is shown to increase as the obstacle acts as an effective interference attenuator. If frequency selective surfaces (FSSs) are used instead of metal shields, a good shielding performance is shown to be achievable as long as the FSS stopband attenuation is maintained at above 20 dB for incident angles smaller than 50 degrees.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1487</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors that influence General Practitioner diagnostic decision-making and a comparison with other stakeholders</field><field name="creator">Callaghan, Kathleen Suzanne No&#235;lle</field><field name="description">Abstract  Background  An analysis of Accident Compensation Corporation claims shows &#8220;inconsistent and inadequate diagnoses&#8221; by health care providers.   Diagnostic performance is a result of two independent parameters, namely discrimination (accuracy) and decision (bias).  Bias is related to the medical practitioner&#8217;s perception of the costs and benefits of making one choice over another.  Bias may be statistical, sociological, political, biological or psychological in nature.   This study investigated the factors that potentially bias diagnostic decision-making by general practitioners and the subjective value placed on these factors by different stakeholder groups in society. Methods  Phase 1 of the study used focus groups of standard setters for general practitioners to identify factors that influenced diagnostic decision-making in general practice.  These factors were evaluated for importance and desirability using standard Delphi methodology and Rasch analysis.  Phase 2 of the study evaluated the importance and desirability of the factors identified in Phase 1 for influencing decision making as judged by significant health care stakeholder groups in New Zealand.   Participant response was via questionnaire analysed by the Rasch Model. Results  Thirty-nine factors were identified that potentially biased diagnostic decision-making in general practice.  The measurements of, particularly, desirability have high reproducibility across stakeholder groups and high positive loading for the first principal component consistent with construct validity.  No stakeholder group identifies factors consistent with Bayes&#8217; theorem of diagnostic reasoning as being the only desirable influence on diagnosis. There is considerable categorical homogeneity between the stakeholder groups GP, GPACC, P, RACCSLT and RACCSST.  Conclusions  The findings of this and other studies challenge the current biomedical paradigm, indicating a less than Bayesian approach to medical decision-making.  A social constructivist model, incorporating non-Bayesian factors into the definition of &#8220;illness&#8221; versus &#8220;disease&#8221;, may be more representative of reality.  A social constructivist model of medicine is incompatible with the current legislatory and administrative framework within which the Accident Compensation Corporation and a number of other medical organisations operate.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Human Factors</field><field name="subject">Diagnostic decision-making</field><field name="subject">Error management</field><field name="subject">Values</field><field name="subject">Accident compensation</field><field name="subject">Medicine</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1907</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Splat-substrate interactions in high velocity thermal spray coatings</field><field name="creator">Trompetter, W. J.</field><field name="description">Thermal spray coatings applied with high velocity techniques produce dense, industrial quality coatings with strong adhesion and minimal decomposition. This thesis reports on investigations of splat-substrate interactions for both solid and molten splats. Specifically, individual particles were studied to see how the particle is altered during the spray coating process, how they bond to the substrate and the role of surface oxides. Investigations of NiCr particles high velocity air fuel (HVAF) thermally sprayed onto different materials found that soft substrates predominantly had deeply penetrating solid particles, whereas harder substrates resisted particle penetration and had a higher percentage of molten splats. This effect is caused by particle kinetic energy converted into heat during plastic deformation. The percentage of particle kinetic energy converted into heat is proportional to substrate hardness. It was also discovered that during the coating process the oxide is not removed or altered in composition, but becomes redistributed over a larger surface area due to the plastic deformation of the substrate. During this process, small scale redistribution and penetration of the oxide material by the incoming particle occurs. These results support the idea that successful bonding can occur only when the surface oxide on the substrate and on the coating material has been disturbed (for solid splats) or disrupted (for molten splats).  To date, our knowledge of solid splat bonding processes within thermal spray coatings has been very subjective where mechanical and chemical bonding has been expected to contribute. In this thesis, the splat-substrate interface was investigated with focused ion beam (FIB) microscopy, cross-sectional SEM and cross-sectional TEM. For solid NiCr splat HVAF coatings, the discovery of interfacial formations, together with no evidence of chemical bonding across the particle-substrate interface suggest that mechanical bonding is the dominant bonding mechanism for solid splat coatings; where as chemical bonding only plays a role when splats and/or substrate become molten.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Thermal Spray coating</field><field name="subject">Interface</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291300 Metallurgy::291301 Process metallurgy</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291400 Materials Engineering::291402 Composite materials</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1758</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparative limnology of six hydroelectric dams on the Waikato River, New Zealand (1970-72)</field><field name="creator">Magadza, Christopher H.

It emerges from Lake Taupo, which lies near the centre of the North Island, and flows in a northerly direction for approximately 322 km to discharge into the Tasman Sea at Port Waikato on the west coast. It falls about 366 m during its course, the greater part of which occurs in the first 200 km after it leaves the lake. Ridall (1967) has treated the Waikato river as originating between Ruapehu mountain and the Kaimanawa ranges, but considering, the multitude of other streams which flow into Lake Taupo and account for nearly 56% of the discharge from that lake into the Waikato, the question of the origin of the Waikato river upstream of Lake Taupo seems to be more academic than practical.</field><field name="date">1973</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1409</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multimodal (im)politeness: the verbal, prosodic and non-verbal realization of disagreement in German and New Zealand English</field><field name="creator">Stadler, Stefanie Alexa</field><field name="description">The present study takes a multimodal approach to speech act analysis. It investigates the disagreeing behaviour of Germans and New Zealanders exhibited during televised panel discussions on a verbal, prosodic, and non-verbal level. More specifically, the present study aims to uncover whether there are differences in the use of prosodic and non-verbal cues between the two groups and if potential differences influence how polite a disagreement is perceived to be. The investigation showed that, on a verbal level, Germans have a preference for more concise disagreements, with a more direct and explicit disagreeing style, producing a large number of strengthening devices, while New Zealanders produce more indirect disagreements, containing a large number of softening devices. Prosodically, the Germans differ from the New Zealanders by using audibly loud and fast speech significantly more frequently, while the two groups&#8217; use of mean pitch, pitch range and intensity range differs little. On a non-verbal level, Germans produce significantly more non-verbal cues during disagreements than their New Zealand counterparts. The main difference between the two groups, however, lies in how their disagreeing behaviour differs from their non-verbal behaviour in neutral speech. While Germans use significantly fewer non-verbal cues in neutral speech than in disagreements and also use a much more limited range of non-verbal cues, the New Zealanders&#8217; non-verbal behaviour in disagreements differs little from their behaviour in neutral speech. In order to test the effect of these differences on the perceived level of politeness, two questionnaires were developed; one prosodic questionnaire testing the effects of loud and fast speech in disagreements on the perceived level of politeness and one non-verbal questionnaire testing the effect of a large number of non-verbal cues on the perceived level of politeness. The results show that fast and loud speech has a negative effect on politeness, as perceived by New Zealanders. A large number of non-verbal cues only appear to have a negative effect on the level of politeness, as perceived by New Zealanders, when disagreements exhibit a high level of involvement and emotion. Overall, it appears that German disagreeing behaviour is likely to be perceived negatively by New Zealanders.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1766</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Images and appraisals of New Zealand 1839-1855: a cognitive-behavioural approach to historical geography</field><field name="creator">Johnston, Judith Anne</field><field name="description">This dissertation considers the images and appraisals of New Zealand in the period 1839 to 1855. The expectations of British emigrants were examined in terms of the information available about New Zealand, the nature, accessibility and dissemination of information, and the images about the new environment created in the accessible sources of information. These expectations, largely drawn from the images, are compared with the appraisals made by the emigrants after arrival and settlement. The dissertation was developed at three levels: as an historical geography using a cognitive-behavioural approach, being concerned with the relationships between information, images, and appraisals, and examining a specific process - emigration to New Zealand from 1839 to 1855. In light of the recent anxiety and pessimism over the future and direction of historical geography, the use of new concepts and methodologies has been regarded as a necessity. While there are many problems and complexities inherent in the use of a cognitive-behavioural approach to historical geography, the concepts of perception, image, and appraisal offer much to the understanding of how man evaluated and behaved in the world of the past. It is suggested that the use of relevant cognitive-behavioural ideas broadens the areas for research by offering a new perspective to the past and by encouraging the use of much previously unused material. The second concern was the relationship between information and image and between image and appraisal. The role of information was found to be most important in the development of images about the new environment. The appraisals also reflected the information contained within the images. It was suggested that it is impossible to reconstruct images of the environment in their totality but that it is possible to reconstruct simpler sub-images of specific features in the environment. It is in this manner that the historical geographer can make a major contribution to the understanding of man&#8217;s behaviour, in relation to the geography of past times. The third concern was with the process of emigration to New Zealand in the period 1839 to 1855. Although much information about New Zealand was available, the intending emigrants had access only to limited sources of information, much of which was promotional in nature. The images of the physical environment were largely drawn from these sources. These images appear to have been the basis of the expectations of most of the emigrants. The later appraisals made of the physical environment showed a close relationship to the images, although several discrepancies occurred. These discrepancies reflected the distortion of information, the role of imagination and the personal evaluations of different sources of information. Emigration to New Zealand in the period 1839 to 1855 was, therefore, examined in terms of the images and appraisals made of the new environment. While general satisfaction with the new homeland was expressed, few of the emigrants considered New Zealand to be an &#8216;Eden of the South Seas&#8217;.</field><field name="date">1975</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370400 Human Geography</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1424</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Formation, Transformative Learning &amp; Theological Education</field><field name="creator">Sorensen, Christine Alison</field><field name="description">This research applied Mezirow&#8217;s transformative learning theory to theological education, in particular in situations where theological education is concerned with the purpose of formation. A field study among minority Christian women attending a Bible school in Pakistan found that the transformative pedagogy contributed to the formational aspects of the theological education programme and helped to integrate the fragmented curriculum, and the separation of theology and spirituality. Students&#8217; epistemological, theological, and personal assumptions were identified at the beginning of the course and changes in these assumptions tracked over the year of study. Five areas of formation, namely relationship with God, thinking theologically, communicating the gospel, relationships with others, and self-understanding, were identified as a way of assessing how changes in assumptions impacted on formational change. Transformation occurred over the range of assumptions and areas of formation. Students&#8217; assumption change was found to be idiosyncratic, responding to the transformative environment created by the teachers, according to particular developmental and formational needs students had. Fostering reflective ability, and the inclusion of reflection activities, as well as mentoring, contributed to students&#8217; formation in the use of transformative learning pedagogy. Transformative learning proved effective even among students with less developed cognitive ability. The South Asian earthquake of 2005 was a significant trigger event which impacted on student formation in developing care and concern, understanding ministry, theodicy, and in developing epistemological complexity. Implications for further research on the use of transformative learning in different theological education settings, and to compare changes over a longer term are also considered.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Theological education</field><field name="subject">transformative learning</field><field name="subject">Formation</field><field name="subject">Pakistan</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2127</field></doc><doc><field name="title">High-Wire Dancers: Middle-Class Pakeha and Dutch Childhoods in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Tap, Relinde</field><field name="description">In contemporary New Zealand discourses the 1950s, 1960s and the early 1970s are seen as the era of the &#8216;Golden Weather&#8217;.  This time came to an end when social change on an unprecedented scale took place from the end of the 1960s onwards.  During the 1980s and 1990s the changes became very rapid due to transformations as part of the neoliberal reforms.  Neoliberalism established new ways of governing the self through discourses of personal reflection, flexibility and choice as well notions of uncertainty, instability and risk.  Risk discourses can be found at different junctures in New Zealand&#8217;s history, but contemporary discourses surrounding the self and childhood have shifted risk discourses in new ways.  This has led to new regimes of rationality and practices of childhood and an increased governance of children and their families.  This research documents the contexts and the interrelationships which influenced the new regimes of rationality and governance of childhoods in New Zealand.  It also discusses the way a range of contradictory and conflictual cultural repertoires are negotiated and reproduced in the middle classes. In the last decades Pakeha and Dutch middle-class families in New Zealand have faced the prospect of declining fortunes.  They have therefore adopted a cultural logic of childrearing which stresses the concerted cultivation of children.  These regimes of concerted cultivation include risk discourses which affect everyday relationships and practices.  This more global middle-class regime coexists with a local regime based on the New Zealand narrative of the time of the &#8216;Golden Weather&#8217;.  Within this local repertoire a &#8216;typical&#8217; New Zealand childhood is seen as safe and quite relaxed.  This perceived childhood space is filled with beaches and other activities associated with nature which give children the opportunity and freedom to explore and develop a distinct Kiwi self.  This local figuration is in contradiction with the often hectic pace of concerted cultivation and the anxieties surrounding risk discourses.  Dutch middle-class parents in New Zealand also use concerted cultivation and they have adopted some of their host country&#8217;s figurations surrounding childhood and the outdoors.  However, there is a difference in emphasis as Dutch parental narratives of self are more focussed on relationships with people rather than nature.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand, Childhood; Cultural Repertoires; Class; Governance, Neoliberalism; Risk</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1517</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Attentional responses during discrimination learning by retarded children</field><field name="creator">Singh, Nirbhay Nand</field><field name="description">In Experiment I, eight mentally retarded children were trained on a simultaneous two-choice discrimination problem and a series of discrimination-shift problems. Subjects performed overt observing responses to produce elements of the discriminative stimuli, making it possible to measure directly changes in attention to different aspects of stimuli during learning. The patterns of change in observing responses were generally in line with descriptions of attentional changes derived from two-process theories of discrimination learning; for example, the frequency of irrelevant observing responses was high during the pre-solution period during extradimensional shifts but was low during intradimensional shifts. Contrary to current theories, extradimensional shifts caused an immediate increase in irrelevant responses, and intradimensional shifts caused an increase in relevant observing responses. Subjects responded to later shift problems by initially increasing both relevant and irrelevant observing responses, then withholding irrelevant observing responses. Experiment II examined the effects of three variables, the provision and non-provision of a mechanical observing response, the stimulus dimensionality, and degrees of relevance of the irrelevant stimuli, on the discrimination learning and transfer performance of sixteen mentally retarded children. The subjects were trained on simultaneous two-choice discrimination problems using complex stimuli containing either dimensional stimuli or mixed- &#8216;dimensional stimuli. Subjects were then tested on either intradimensional or extradimensional shifts. When dimensional stimuli were used, intradimensional shifts were easier than extradimensional shifts but when mixed-dimensional stimuli were used, the relative difficulty of the intradimensional and extradimensional shifts depended on whether observing-response buttons were provided. When observing-response buttons were provided, intradimensional shifts were again easier than extradimensional shifts but when these buttons were not provided, intradimensional shifts were harder than extradimensional shifts. The relative ease of intradimensional over extradimensional shifts was found to be further affected by the degree of relevance of the less-relevant dimension. The superiority of the intradimensional over extradimensional shift performance was progressively reduced and then eliminated as the degree of relevance of the irrelevant dimension was gradually increased. Subproblem analysis showed that subjects typically treated subproblems independently, even though there was some degree of dimensional analysis of stimuli, and intradimensional shifts were usually easier than extradimensional shifts. This finding is inconsistent with the usual interpretation of the relative ease of intradimensional over extradimensional shifts as an indication of non independence of subproblems.</field><field name="date">1978</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1450</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ecology of two New Zealand opisthobranch molluscs</field><field name="creator">Willan, R. C. (Richard Cardew)</field><field name="description">An intertidal population of the anaspidean Aplysia dactylomela Rang was followed for three consecutive years at the Leigh Marine Reserve, North Auckland, New Zealand. Field assessments were made of recruitment, growth (by recapture of tagged individuals), density, crawling rate, gonad index and mortality. These data allowed monthly estimates of the entire population within the entire study area (2.76 ha) to be made. Complementary laboratory studies investigated acceptable foods and an energy budget including data on energy of the food, growth rates, egestion, respiration and assimilation efficiency were also obtained in the laboratory. In conjunction with these studies, field work on the algal food of A. dactylomela (species of Laurencia) elucidated the entities present, their separate yearly changes in biomass and the causes. From this information, data on food requirements for A. dactylomela.ha-1 month-1 are contrasted with standing crop estimates for Laurencia spp. in the same units to permit consideration of the theoretical grazing effects of A. dactylomela. Several lines of evidence show this environment to be suboptimal for A. dactylomela. storms account for the greatest mortality, but some losses are due to predation by the asteroid Coscinasterias calamaria (Gray). Few individuals reach reproductive maturity and the population is not self-recruiting. An intertidal population of a second opisthobranch, the Cephalaspidean Haminoea zelandiae (Gray in Dieffenbach) was followed for three consecutive years at Motukaraka Island, Hauraki Gulf, New Zealand. Field determinations of growth, annual abundance and reproductive cycles were made. The cryptogamic flora at Motukaraka Island has been characterised and annual patterns of cover and distribution presented for five major seasonal components. The relationship between Haminoea zelandiae and these algae is considered. Additional studies on two less-common anaspideans were carried out. Field data on breeding, growth and density are given for Aplysia parvula M&#246;rch which exists in separate, spatially-isolated intertidal and subtidal populations at Goat Island Bay. For these two populations differences exist in diet, colouration, size distribution, growth and survivorship. The intertidal habitat is marginal whereas the subtidal is close to being optimal. Bursatella leachii Blainville shows variable annual recruitment to the cyanophyte Lyngbya majuscula intertidally at Motukaraka Island. Growth rates have been determined for field and laboratory populations. In the field a deliberate offshore migration takes place whilst L. majuscula is still abundant. Speculations on the possibilities and causes for migrations amongst opisthobranchs are discussed. A taxonomic revision of the New Zealand Anaspidea follows as an appendix. There are eight sea hares authentically recorded for New Zealand: Aplysia (Pruvotaplysia) parvula M&#246;rch 1863; A. (Varria) dactylomela Rang 1828; A. (V.) keraudreni Rang 1828; (V.) extraordinaria (Allan 1932); A. (Aplysia) juliana (Quoy &amp; Gaimard 1832); Bursatella leachii Blainville 1817; Stylocheilus longicauda (Quoy &amp; Gaimard 1825); Dolabrifera dolabrifera (Cuvier 1817).

Some data suggest attending to such errors can have inappropriate effects on learning. A conceptual framework was developed to examine the effects of error attention on the acquisition of proficient reading responses. Analyses of reading behaviour employed concepts and data from 'structural' accounts of reading. These concepts provided details of the components of response systems. Acquisition of proficient reading was seen to involve trends towards accurate integrated responding which becomes self controlled. Error attention was conceptualised as having motivational and informational properties which could directly affect acquisition trends. The first experiment (Chapter Three) demonstrated that under appropriate conditions oral reading behaviour was facilitated by error attention. Eleven year old readers in a Learning Disabilities classroom were measured in their usual reading setting. Two readers received extra tutoring with error attention procedures. A further two readers acted as a contrast for the effects of increased opportunities to respond. These readers received extra practice tutoring with minimum levels of praise. A third subject received no extra tutoring during the course of the experiment. Results indicated that both practice and error attention produced substantial increases in accuracy and correct rates. Accuracy levels were higher for error attention subjects suggesting error attention can have important learning outcomes. Additionally, predictions concerning the error attention dimensions of modeling and prompting were tested. Prompts were found to be more effective with the more proficient reader while models were more effective with the less proficient reader. The second experiment (Chapter Four) examined specific predictions about timing of error attention. Six, 6 year old normal readers received daily sessions of either delayed or immediate attention to errors. Every second day the subjects also read a text on which they were not tutored. Results showed that delayed attention increased the percent of errors self corrected for five subjects in both the tutored and non tutored texts. Increases in self corrections were consistently associated with increased accuracy. The data supported both the predictions and the proposed model of self correction behaviour as having a tutorial or self instruction function. Both experiments were discussed in terms of the functions of error attention in facilitating acquisition of proficient reading. Methodological issues in the behaviour analysis of oral reading were also discussed and implications from the studies for instruction in learning to read are drawn. The usefulness of concepts from 'structural' accounts of reading for a predictive 'functional' account of error attention is examined in a concluding section.</field><field name="date">1978</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1464</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The interaction between nerve and muscle during metamorphosis of the Waxmoth Galleria mellonella</field><field name="creator">Ward, Clare</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the interaction between the nervous system and muscles during the metamorphosis of the waxmoth Galleria mellonella. The mesothoracic dorsolongitudinal muscles of the waxmoth arise from dorsal muscles in the larval mesothorax. Several of these dorsal larval muscles begin their transformation shortly before the larva-pupa ecdysis when: they break down to be replaced by presumptive myoblasts. These appear to arise from the nuclei of the larval muscle. In the 60-72 hours pupa all three mesothoracic dorsolongitudinal. (2dl) muscles are made up of the characteristic number of fibres and the first dorsolongtudinal muscle (dl1) has its characteristic adult shape. From the 82 hour stage onwards the muscle fibres increase in diameter until the 168 hour stage when the muscles have achieved the adult condition. Cautery of the first thoracic ganglion of the larva or section of the nerve cord between the first two thoracic ganglia leads to an adult in which most of the 2dl muscles are absent. Only the dorsal part of 2dl1 is present as normal. Up until the 24 hours pupa cautery of the first thoracic ganglion has the same results as cautery of the larva. Cautery of the 25-30 hours pupa results in an adult in which the ventral fasciculae of 2dl1 are represented by a few tiny muscle fibres. At this stage there is no sign o f 2dl2 or 2dl3 except for a few small cells which are about the same size as presumptive myoblasts. Cautery of the 40 hours pupa leads to an adult in which all of the 2dl1 fasciculae are present as smaller versions o f the normal case. Up until the 108 hours pupa cautery of the first thoracic ganglion leads to an adult in which the 2dl1 muscles are smaller than normal. An ultrastructural investigation of the small cells found in the denervated adult in the place of the 2dl muscles showed these to be similar to presumptive myoblasts. It therefore appears that the nervous system affects the ability of the presumptive myoblasts both to differentiate and then to grow as normal. Denervation of the fifth and sixth instar larvae by section of one of the connectives between the first two thoracic ganglia has the same effect on the operated side as denervation of the last larval instar. Cobalt staining of the nerve supplying the dorsal muscles of the larva shows that the motor neuron complement in both the fifth and seventh in star larvae is very similar. Cobalt staining of the nerve to the 2dl muscles of the adult reveals cell bodies which are similar in position and size to those found in the larva. The interaction between nerve and muscle during development in insects and vertebrates is discussed. From this work it is hypothesized that the nervous system affects muscle development by preventing mitosis in the presumptive myoblasts. It is also hypothesised that the adult muscles are served by the same motor neurons which were present in the later instars of the larva.</field><field name="date">1977</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology::270505 Entomology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1474</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Psychology of environmental attitudes: a cross-cultural study of their content and structure</field><field name="creator">Milfont, Taciano Lemos</field><field name="description">Environmental attitudes (EA) are a psychological tendency that is expressed by evaluating perceptions of or beliefs regarding the natural environment, including factors affecting its quality, with some degree of favour or disfavour. Research on EA has been critised as being noncumulative and atheoretical. This thesis addresses these critics by taking a systematic approach to the study of the psychology of EA, and had three specific objectives. First, it sets out to investigate the cognitive structure of EA, that is, what kind of perceptions or beliefs regarding the natural environment people have, how these perceptions or beliefs can be operationalized in terms of dimensions, or psychological constructs, and how these dimensions relate to each other. Second, it sets out to investigate the nomological network of EA, that is, to test causal models of antecedents and consequences of EA by investigating their relationships with socio-demographic (e.g., gender, religiosity), psychological (e.g., social desirability, authoritarianism) and environmentally related variables (e.g., ecological behaviour, inclusion with nature). And finally, it sets out to examine the value/threat&#8211;attitude&#8211;behaviour causal model, in which EA are deemed to fully mediate the influence of values and perceived environmental threat on ecological behaviour. Three cross-sectional empirical studies were carried out, involving a total of 2,150 student and general population participants. Study 1, conducted in New Zealand, tests the dimensionality and hierarchical structure of EA. Study 2a, also conducted in New Zealand, involves the development of a new culture-general and fully-balanced tool, the Environmental Attitudes Inventory (EAI), for measuring EA. Study 2b, a Web-based survey conducted in Brazil, assesses the validity and reliability of the EAI in this different cultural context. Study 2c, also a Web-based survey conducted with participants from more than fifty countries, describes the development of a short-form of the measure (EAI-S) and assesses its validity and test-retest reliability in this diverse sample. Study 3 tests the validity, reliability and measurement invariance of the EAI-S across samples from Brazil, New Zealand and South Africa. This cross-cultural study also investigates iii causal models of antecedents and consequences of EA, and the value/threat&#8211;attitude&#8211;behaviour causal model across these cultures. Taken together, these studies demonstrated the following: (1) EA are a multidimensional construct organized in a hierarchical fashion, with first-order factors either loading on a secondorder factor (i.e., Generalized Environmental Attitudes) or loading on either one of two correlated second-order factors (i.e., Preservation and Utilization). (2) Individuals with pro-EA are those who are older, female and members of an environmental organization, who attribute greater importance to self-transcendence, biospheric and altruistic values, who conserve the environment by performing ecological behaviours, who feel connected with nature and concerned about threats from environmental problems, and who support sustainability principles. Individuals with anti-EA, in contrast, are those who are Judeo-Christians, who have higher levels of religiosity and beliefs in the Bible, who support economic liberalism and political conservatism, and who attribute greater importance to traditional and self-enhancement values. (3) Altruistic values, perceived environmental threat (both positively), and self-enhancement values (negatively) are strong predictors of EA, and EA fully mediates the influence of values and threat on ecological behaviour. Overall, this research has a number of implications. These include (1) the development of a research framework for the study of EA that considers their contents in both their horizontal and vertical structures, (2) the development of the EAI for measuring these contents and structures, (3) the indication that pro-EA still tends to be limited to certain groups within society, which would tend to constrain the resolution of environmental problems, (4) the confirmation of the relevance of both human values and perceived environmental threat in the formation and determination of EA, and (5) support for the mediating role of EA on the influence of values and threat on ecological behaviour.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1712</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sexual abuse investigation and criminal court processes: doing justice to the child?</field><field name="creator">Davies, Emma</field><field name="description">This thesis has contributed to the international literature on child sexual abuse investigation and criminal justice processes by conducting a programme evaluation of these processes in Auckland, New Zealand. In the first part of the study, 51 child complainants and 124 primary carers were interviewed about their perceptions of social work investigation, evidential interviewing, access to counselling services, police investigation, medical examinations and, for some, criminal court proceedings. Although participants were predominantly satisfied with early interactions with professionals, both children and primary carers highlighted the need for better interagency collaboration, reduced time delays throughout the process, earlier access to support services, more information and increased involvement in decision making. With specific reference to criminal court, participants indicated a need for better pre-court education and debriefing. The second part of this research involved analyses of criminal court transcripts on the ways that children are questioned by evidential interviewers and lawyers in court. The transcript analyses showed that some cross-examination strategies are reliant on prejudicial stereotypes of children and false assumptions about the dynamics of sexual abuse. In combination, the interviews and transcript analyses, indicate that Judges could usefully ensure that children are asked questions in terms they understand. The thesis revealed deficiencies within agency practices and, to a lesser extent, agency policies which impact negatively on children and their families during the sexual abuse investigation and criminal justice processes. It was shown that in practice these processes do not fully comply with Article 3(1) of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, in that the best interests of the child are not always 'of primary consideration'. Recommendations to address some of these deficiencies were proposed.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1764</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Population dynamics of the scallop Pecten novaezelandiae in the Hauraki Gulf</field><field name="creator">Morrison, Mark Andrew</field><field name="description">The population biology and ecology of scallops in Greater Omaha Bay (a semi-oceanic bay) and Kawau Bay (a estuarine bay) was quantified by observation and experiment. Information was collected to extend the knowledge base on northern New Zealand scallop population dynamics, and for application to potential scallop enhancement in the region. Contagious scallop population organisation was found at all spatial scales examined, ranging from bay wide through to individual bed patchiness, down to the scale of inter-animal distances. Such clumping has strong implications for a range of population processes, including fishing susceptibility and fertilisation success. Monitoring of adults found two main spawning events to occur; in late October and in mid January. Changes in the gonado-somatic index (GSI) were well synchronised between individuals within populations. Subsequent monitoring of spat-fall in artificial collectors documented two main recruitment events, probably the outcomes of the two local spawning events. These spat-fall events occurred on collectors separated by 1Os of km. However, substantial density variations occurred between sites, indicating that local hydrodynamics may have played a significant role in modifying local spat-fall intensities. Smaller spat-fall events were also present between the two major events. The number of spat collected at a number of combinations of site and time were sufficient to support commercial spat catching operations, although problems were encountered with spat detaching at sizes too small to be retained by the collectors. In the 1993/94 summer a large algal bloom event completely eliminated scallop recruitment to collectors for the first three months of that season. Mass mortality events were a major contributor to overall benthic scallop population mortality. Probable causes included intensive scallop harvesting (commercial and recreational), a major storm episode, and a large algal bloom. These effectively eliminated scallop populations from Greater Omaha Bay. The adjacent Kawau Bay was not affected by any of these particular events, but populations there did not survive long after reaching adult sizes. Estimates of M (natural mortality) were higher for all scallop populations than have been previously documented in New Zealand studies. Growth trajectories were reasonably consistent in waters shallower than 19 m, but a progressive decline occurred in both maximal size reached and average growth rates with increasing depth after this point. Food limitation may have been the mechanism involved, which is likely to vary significantly for other locations depending on local environmental conditions. Average time to recruitment to the fishery (100 mm shell width) was three years for the shallower populations. A slight reduction in average size of adults at higher densities was found for some populations, indicating a possible density-dependent effect. Examination of a high density scallop bed found animals to display distinctive substratum preferences over small spatial scales, with higher abundances occurring on coarser materials such as shell gravel, marl and grit. Mud was not favoured as a habitat type. Movements of tagged animals at this location were spatially limited to within the particular habitat patch in which an individual was tagged and released, i.e. at a scale of 1s to 1Os of metres. No animals moved between adjacent patches of similar habitat (100 m scale). A B.A.C.I type experiment was undertaken to assess incidental mortality effects of commercial scallop dredging on undersize scallops, at the spatial scale of beds. Significant negative effects were quantified, with the number of undersize animals killed per legal animal harvested estimated at 1.7 and 2.8 : 1, depending on the size frequency structure of the fished bed. Modelling of likely improvements in the number of animals surviving at the end of fishing, given a reduction in the minimum legal size from 100 to 90 mm, indicated improvements of 20 to 41% of the original population remaining after fishing, depending on animal size and assumed dredge efficiencies, A 90 mm MLS has subsequently been adopted by the Coromandel Scallop Fishery. The results from this work provide detailed population based estimates of parameters required for successful management and optimal harvesting strategies of Hauraki Gulf scallop populations. The large variability in parameters such as mortality, and strong abundance correlations with habitat type, has strong implications for such activities. This work also provides essential information for the undertaking of locally based enhancement operations, such as the spatial and temporal magnitude and variability of spat-fall events, and growth rates with respect to habitat features (i.e. depth).</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1706</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vincent Ward: the emergence of an aesthetic</field><field name="creator">Read, Lynette</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the work and career of New Zealand director, Vincent Ward, focusing on the emergence of his distinctive aesthetic. It places this aesthetic in the context of local and European artistic and filmic traditions (in particular, certain forms of Romanticism and Expressionism) that have influenced Ward's work. It also explores how his childhood and education may have shaped his approach, and examines what his aesthetic has meant in practice, in the process of making each of his major films, as well as in the formal characteristics of the completed films. The study focuses to a greater extent on his early (New Zealand) films as case studies that help us to understand the development of his practice and theory. The career of Ward as a filmmaker who has had a significant influence on the development of the New Zealand film industry is also explored in the light of what may differentiate his approach from that of other local filmmakers and the extent to which it is useful to think of him as a "New Zealand filmmaker". This thesis draws from extensive primary research in the form of interviews with the director, his family, associates and collaborators (cameramen, editors, co-writers, producers and so on). Textual study has involved the viewing New Zealand and Expressionist films and art-works, and the examination of archival and unpublished material. Secondary research has included coverage of European and local artistic and filmic traditions and, the relatively limited body of criticism of Ward's films. While this thesis takes an essentially auteurist approach - identifying characteristic themes, visual motifs and stylistic tendencies - it also seeks to expand and reposition such an approach by taking into account intellectual and cultural history, the contributions of Ward's collaborators, and the complex industrial conditions in which his films were produced. To do so has necessitated a close examination of the filmmaking process. By examining the aesthetic of such a director - known for his heightened individualism, perfectionism, and unusual methods - this study has sought to reveal the strengths and limitations of classic auteur theory, suggesting ways in which this approach can be modified and re-invigorated. The thesis also provides a case study in the difficulties faced by a director of this kind in finding a satisfactory base within the contemporary film industry. The alignment of local and global interests and investments is still a highly complex business.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1509</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of mycoviruses in the plant pathogenic fungus, Botrytis cinerea</field><field name="creator">Howitt, Robyn L.J.</field><field name="description">ln recent years a lot of interest has focussed on the role of mycoviruses (fungal viruses) that confer reduced pathogenicity to their fungal hosts. In several plant pathogenic fungi viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) elements have been shown to be the agents responsible for this attenuation of virulence. In New Zealand and other temperate climates the plant pathogenic fungus, Botrytis cinerea is an important pathogen of many horticultural crops. Control of this grey mould disease still relies heavily on the use of fungicides to augment cultural practices- Consequently, there is now increasing interest in the use of biological control as an alternative means of control. This study reports the first large-scale survey of dsRNA elements in B. cinerea. Analysis of 200 New Zealand isolates from a range of hosts revealed 72% contained dsRNA, with high variation in dsRNA profiles, both within and between groups of fungal isolates from different hosts. DsRNA has been associated with isometric particles in many different fungi. In this study virus-like particles (VLPs) were observed in three of five dsRNA-containing isolates examined. Morphological types included isometric particles of varying size classes (approx' 30, 35, 40 and 45 nm) and bacilliform parricles (approx. 25 x 63 nm). In five isolates apparently lacking dsRNA no isometric or bacilliform particles were found but flexuous rods with a modal length of approx. 7ZO nm were detected in one of these isolates. Total RNA extraction of the various partially purified VLP preparations gave similar profiles to those obtained from mycelial dsRNA extractions of the same isolates, suggesting that the VLPs comprise encapsidated dsRNA. Comparison of 12 dsRNA-containing and 12 dsRNA-free isolates indicated slight differences between the two groups in radial growth rate, virulence on bean leaves and sclerotial number, but the differences were minor. ln summary, while dsRNA was found to be common among B. cinerea isolates in this study, the evidence did not reveal any marked phenotypic effects of dsRNA presence. The putative flexuous rod-shaped virus particles rn B. cinerea were studied further. Similar particles have been observed in fungi before but none have been characterised at the molecular level. This study reports the first complete nucleotide sequences of two such mycoviruses, Botrytis Virus F (BVF) and Botrytis Virus X (BVX), and also the first molecular characterisation of viruses infecting B. cinerea. The mycoviruses, which were both present in the same B. cinerea isolate, were similar in size and morphology to ssRNA plant viruses of the family Potexviridae. BVF and BVX contained ssRNA genomes af 6827 and 6966 nucleotides respectively, excluding poly(A) tails. Computer analysis of the genomic cDNA sequence of BVF revealed three potential open reading frames (ORFs) encoding putative proteins of 20 kDa (ORFI),212 kDa (ORFZ) and 32 kDa (ORF3). ORFI, which overlapped ORF2 by 467 nt, did not reveal significant homology with known protein sequences.O RF2, which showed significant sequence identity to the replicase proteins of the plant virus families Tymoviridae and potexviridae, contained a putative opal readthrough codon intermediate between the helicase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) regions. ORF3 shared amino acid homology with coat proteins of the family Potexviridae. A putative defective RNA (D RNA) of 829 nt was also detected which consisted of a 5' region of the parental genome fused in-frame to the terminal 3' end, complete with poly(A) tail. BVX revealed five potential ORFs encoding putative proteins of 158 kDa (ORFl), 30 kDa (ORF2), 44y,Da(ORF3), 14 kDa (ORF4) and l4kDa (ORFs). ORFI showed significant amino acid sequenceid entity to the replicase proteins and ORF3 to the coat proteins of the potexviridae. The remaining ORFs did not reveal significant homology with known protein sequences. This is the first report of sequence similarities between mycoviruses and the plant virus families Potexviridae and Tymoviridae. Comparisons of sequence and genome organisation suggest that the mycoviruses BVF and BVX may each belong to a new as yet unassigned genus in the plant virus family Potexviridae. An unexpected result from this study was the high level of identity observed between the derived amino acid sequences of the mycoviruses and plant viruses including a region of -7O% for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) region of BVX and similar regions in several potex-like viruses of AIIium spp. This high level of interviral homology has not previously been reported between the plant and fungal kingdoms and is possibly indicative of a recent divergence from a common ancestor. These results suggest that horizontal gene transfer between the plant and fungal kingdoms may occur more frequently than has been appreciated to date. If so it may play a significant role in viral evolution. In addition to providing novel phylogenetic information on the relationship between these morphological types of viruses in fungi and in plants, characterisation of these mycoviral genomes provides a possible strategy for incorporating genes into Botrytis using viruses as vectors. In this context Botrytis strains infected with modified viruses could provide a new approach for the biocontrol of grey mould.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1765</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spat production of the Greenshell&#8482; mussel Perna canaliculus in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Buchanan, Samuel J.</field><field name="description">The research presented in this thesis was undertaken in order to develop an understanding of the biology of Perna canaliculus sufficient to allow for commercial hatchery based production of Greenshell&#8482; mussel spat. Hatchery production is an alternative to unreliable and inconsistent wild spat collection. In a Perna canaliculus population followed for one year spawning occurred in early spring and late summer. Three quantitative histological measures of gonad maturity utilising image analysis technology and a qualitative classification system were compared. Measuring the relative surface area comprised of gametes on histological sections was found to be the most reliable method. A practical gonad visual index to determine the reproductive condition of adults for the selection of broodstock was developed and found to be highly effective as a means of predicting induced spawning success. Serotonin was not effective for inducing spawning of Perna canaliculus. Temperature shock and the use of stripped gametes was however found to be a reliable spawning induction method. Relative gamete concentration, gamete age, temperature, sperm half life and gamete contact times were all found to have effects on fertilisation success for Perna canaliculus. Sperm concentration and the conditions of sperm aging were particularly important. Fertilisation kinetics of Perna canaliculus gametes modelled using the Vogel-Czihak-Chang-Wolf method suggested that 5% of sperm-egg contacts lead to successful fertilisation. Broodstock management protocols that could be used to condition the adult of Perna canaliculus were investigated in order to enhance and prolong the natural reproductive season. Research suggested that for successful broodstock conditioning animals should already have begun gametogenesis at the time conditioning is commenced. Successful conditioning of Perna canaliculus was achieved at temperatures between l0 and 16&#176;C over a period of about 50 days. A diet ration above 2-3% of the dry meat mass per day is suggested. A trial examining non-algal diet supplements suggest a mixture of yeast and lipid emulsion may have some potential value. Photoperiod manipulation did not effect the reproductive condition of Perna canaliculus. The yield of veliger larvae was significantly enhanced if embryo culture water was treated with 1.0 mg/l EDTA. Veliger yield was not significantly affected at densities below 50 embryos/ml. Perna canaliculus larvae grew most rapidly and survived well at the salinity of 35 ppt. Larvae grew most rapidly when cultured at low densities. Experiments suggest that early larvae can be cultured at 5-10/ml, however late stage larvae grew most rapidly when cultured at l/ml. Perna canaliculus larvae displayed best growth and good survival if fed a mixed flagellate-diatom diet comprising Isochrysis galbana (T-Iso) and Chaetoceros calcitrans. The optimal diet ration, as a function of larval size, increased from about 20 cells/&#956;l Isochrysis galbana (T-Iso) to around 150 cells/&#956;l through the larval development period. Thyroxine between the concentrations of l0-5 and l0-8 M did not have an observable effect on larval developmental rate or eye spot development. Down welling settlement systems were found to be generally successful for Perna canaliculus lanrae. L-DOPA was also demonstrated to enhance the settlement and metamorphosis of Perna canaliculus pediveligers.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1707</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ordinary Men and Uncommon Women : A History of Psychiatric Nursing in New Zealand Public Mental Hospitals, 1939-1972</field><field name="creator">Prebble, Catherine Mary (Kate)</field><field name="description">This social-cultural history explores the changing context, culture, and identity of psychiatric nurses working in New Zealand public mental hospitals between 1939 and 1972. Primary documentary sources and oral history interviews provided the data for analysis. The thesis is divided into two periods: 1939 to 1959 when asylum-type conditions shaped the culture of the institutional workforce, and 1960 to 1972 when mental health reform and nursing professionalisation challenged the isolation and distinct identity of mental hospital nurses. Between 1939 and 1959 the introduction of somatic treatments did not substantially change nursing practice in mental hospitals. Overcrowding, understaffing and poor resources necessitated the continuance of custodial care. The asylum-type institutions were dependent on a male attendant workforce to ensure the safety of disturbed male patients, and the maintenance of hospital farms, gardens, and buildings. Although female nurses provided all the care and domestic work on the female side, the belief that psychiatric nursing was physically demanding, potentially dangerous, and morally questionable, characterised the work as generally unsuitable for women. Introduction of psychiatric nursing registration which was a move toward professionalisation did little to change the dominance of a male, working-class culture. From 1960 to 1972 psychiatric nurses&#8217; identity was contested. New therapeutic roles created the possibility of the nurses becoming health professionals. Their economic security and occupational power, however, was tied to an identity as unionised, male workers. As psychiatric nurses were drawn closer to the female-dominated nursing profession through health service changes and nursing education reform, both men and women acted to protect both their working conditions and their patients&#8217; welfare. To achieve these ends, they employed working-class means of industrial action. By accepting the notion that psychiatric nurses&#8217; identity was socially constructed, this thesis provides an interpretation that goes beyond the assumption that nursing is a woman&#8217;s profession. Instead, it presents psychiatric nursing as a changing phenomenon shaped by contested discourses of gender, class and professionalisation. Nursing in public mental hospitals attracted ordinary men and uncommon women whose collective identity was forged from the experience of working in a stigmatised role.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321204 Mental health</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1516</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Positive and negative perfectionism: two sides of the story: a global or domain-specific construct?</field><field name="creator">Haase, Anne Marie</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1711</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Accelerated iterative blind deconvolution</field><field name="creator">Biggs, David S.C.</field><field name="description">This thesis considers the problem of restoring an image distorted by a linear spatially-invariant point spread function (PSF) and corrupted by noise. A principle aim is to develop techniques that are practical and require a minimum amount of prior knowledge. The process of deconvolution is attempted using least-squares and maximum-likelihood iterative algorithms. A survey of the literature introduces the main techniques for deconvolution when the PSF is known, and various approaches for achieving blind deconvolution &#8211; estimating both the PSF and the underlying object from the blurred observation. The two main areas of focus for this thesis are accelerating iterative image restoration algorithms, and developing blind deconvolution methods for extended objects.  The first main contribution is the development of an acceleration technique to speed the rate of convergence of iterative algorithms that use successive approximation. The acceleration uses a vector extrapolation approach which eliminates the need to compute the gradient of an objective function, or to perform a line search optimization. The performance is comparable to that of conjugate gradient optimization, and an example maximum-entropy restoration reduces the number of iterations from 1,000 to 27. A simple modification to the extrapolation allows the acceleration of the Richardson-Lucy (RL) iteration while implicitly imposing the positivity constraint.  The second contribution is the development of blind deconvolution algorithms that do not require spatial or spectral constraints to produce a solution, and can be used on extended objects. The key to achieving this is to recognise that the image and PSF estimates may required different amounts of restoration. By appropriately weighting the update of the image or PSF estimate a suitable result can be produced. Methods for achieving this using both joint- and alternating-variable optimisation are discussed. Issues regarding scaling of the variables are also addressed.  An iterative blind deconvolution method employing the RL algorithm, vector extrapolation, and different numbers of image and PSF iterations, is used to restore a variety of simulated and real images from terrestrial telescopes, the Hubble Space Telescope, multiframe speckle imaging, 3D wide-field fluorescence and confocal microscopes, and scanning electron microscopes. Methods for coping with Poisson noise corruption, and image boundary artifacts are also discussed.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1760</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Archaeology of a military frontier: Taranaki, New Zealand, 1860-1881</field><field name="creator">Prickett, Nigel</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the archaeology of the European military frontier in the province of Taranaki, New Zealand, in the years 1860-1881. In this period a series of four campaigns resulted in the expansion of European settlement at the expense of the indigenous Maori people. The First Taranaki War (1860-61) did not resolve the fundamental conflict over land and the imposition of British law. The passage of the New Zealand settlements Act in late 1863 brought European military strategy into line with political reality. Henceforth the land of 'rebel' tribes was to be confiscated, the military frontier providing a bulwark for an expanding European farming frontier. The Second Taranaki War (1863-66), the white Cliffs Scare (1869) and the Parihaka Campaign (1880-81) resulted in successive areas of Maori land in Taranaki being brought under European control. The present work is divided into two parts. In the first (Volume 1), the geography and archaeology of the European military effort in Taranaki is described; the fortifications and frontier organization are compared with those of earlier periods of imperial expansion elsewhere in the world, and the techniques employed in New Zealand are shown to be by no means unusual. The second part (Volume 2) reports the results of excavations at two European fortifications of the period. These serve to describe further the archaeology of the Taranaki frontier and also, through the recovered material culture, to demonstrate the dependent relation of the military frontier in New Zealand to the economies of the northern hemisphere.</field><field name="date">1981</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370300 Anthropology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::430000 History and Archaeology::430100 Historical Studies::430101 History: New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1514</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The question of learning to read and write</field><field name="creator">Koefoed, Blair</field><field name="description">This thesis is an investigation into learning to read and write. It is also an investigation into how learning to read and write is investigated. THE PRESENTING PROBLEM Despite literacy being highly valued by every member of a modern society and the immense personal and social effort directed towards bringing it within the grasp of all, its universal occurrence, it remains an elusive goal. INVESTIGATING LITERACY As with many other valued human endeavours, science, with its refined and disciplined way of looking, is enlisted to help improve the achievement of ends, and research is designed and undertaken with the aim of increasing our control over its manifestation in the world. Yet it is the claim of this thesis that by leaving uninvestigated the nature of learning to read and write itself the gains will never be complete. PHILOSOPHICAL INVESTIGATIONS To open different lines of investigation, into things themselves, questioning must free itself of socially driven exigencies and the patterns of the established disciplines of thought and become self-reflexive. Self-referential questioning is traditionally and essentially philosophical and insight is sought from three well known modern representatives of the field. - Heidegger offers reflections on the importance of how questioning is undertaken, and, with his discussions on the nature of truth and how with 'revealing' comes 'concealing' hints at the darker side of literacy as a activity that 'opens' the world. - Wittgenstein's intense thought on language/world relationships potentially clarifies the dissension so characteristic of literacy acquisition research and provides a construct of language that would allow misrepresentations of literacy to occur. - Foucault's historical analyses provide concepts useful when considering the origins of literacy, and 'power' becomes a better explanation for the literacy fervour than the production of finer human beings. THE FINAL QUESTION Finally their amalgamated insights are used to discuss the phenomenon of illiteracy as it is portrayed in a recent novel by Bernard Schlink, The Reader. In this study of post-war Germany, the way literacy is deeply entwined into our social structures becomes clear, but more crucially we learn this about illiteracy - the highly destructive, exaggerated, and excessive reaction to its occurrence has no ready explanation.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1709</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"A Colonial Tale of Fact and Fiction": Nineteenth-Century New Zealand Novels by Women</field><field name="creator">Mackay, Morag</field><field name="description">This thesis plots the emergence and development of the nineteenth-century New Zealand women's novel. Previously silenced in favour of a masculinist nationalist tradition, a renewed interest in our earliest literary foremothers has arisen as a result of feminism. Arguing for their acknowledgement as part of our literary history, this thesis examines the significance of these novels in the recording and formulation of a New Zealand culture and literature. The body of the thesis is constructed of three chapters, each representing a different literary from used by these novelists. The earliest is the adventure story, showcasing New Zealand's flora and fauna for the British reading public, and providing excitement in the from of the New Zealand wars, cannibalism, whaling and natural disasters. Second comes the romance, which portrays the developing colonial society and begins to define what it means to be a "New Zealander". Part B of this chapter discusses the treatment of Maori in these women's novels. It examines a group of romances with part-Maori protagonists, in which the novelists address the issue of the place of Maori in the new society. Last are the didactic novels, in which temperance, religion and women's rights are argued for. This thesis considers the characteristics of each of these forms of novel and examines the social and political contexts that gave rise to these choices. Through their novels these women communicate what it meant to be a colonial New Zealand woman - revealing their views on such issues as colonisation, relationship with Maori, the new "classless" society, marriage, and opportunities for women. They reveal a concern with the development of "the New Zealander", a New Zealand literature and culture, and evidence a developing sense of national identity.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1641</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"The English of this wildernesse:" Aspects of early New England&#8217;s literary inheritance, as illustrated by the works of Anne Bradstreet and Edward Taylor</field><field name="creator">Waller, Jennifer Robyn</field><field name="description">"'The English of this wildernesse': aspects of early New England's literary inheritance, as illustrated by the works of Anne Bradstreet and Edward Taylor." Since the late 1920's, the literature of early New England has been increasingly studied in the context of the development of American history, literature, and mythology. Without denying the usefulness of such a context, I want to redress the balance by setting selected aspects of two writers in particular, Anne Bradstreet and Edward Taylor, in the context of their English origins, and to study them specifically as English provincial writers who exemplify the important phenomenon of cultural lag in a community distant from but crucially attached to a changing metropolitan culture. Part of the originality of my approach is the new look I give to the implications of colonial and provincial literature. Chapter one outlines a detailed historical and critical context for my study. As well, I discuss some of the roots and presuppositions of modern literary scholarship of Early New England, and using T. S. Eliot's distinction between "aesthetic" and "merely historical" criticism, I stress the need for an evaluative context for the early New England poets to complement any discussion of historical perspective. In my second chapter, I tackle crucial and inadequately examined aspects of the influence of Puritanism on New England poetry, concentrating especially on the theological distrust of the imagination and (especially important for Taylor) the literary implications of eucharistic theology. Having developed the major strands of my approach, I then turn to Bradstreet (chapters three to six) and Taylor (chapters seven to nine). Chapter three discusses Anne Bradstreet in the context of Renaissance attitudes to women, in order to show what expectations and possibilities existed for a woman in her position to write poetry. Chapters four and five gradually move from an historical to an evaluative perspective - chapter four to deal with her public poetry, chapter five with her domestic verse and chapter six, her religious poetry. Chapters seven to nine are devoted to selected aspects of Taylor's work. Chapter seven attempts to make a new evaluation of his contribution to the Metaphysical literary tradition; chapter eight explores the implications of his religious beliefs for his poetic practices and especially his constant sense of literary inadequacy. In chapter nine, the crucial question of the relative importance of "historical" and "critical" contexts is again faced as I look at Taylor's poems on the Canticles, not in order to examine his sources, but rather to show the ways in which his poetical imagination responded to and transformed his sources. There is a brief concluding chapter. Throughout the study, I have responded to the great amount of critical and scholarly work done in recent years, and I have therefore concentrated on particular aspects of the topic which, if in no case providing me with totally untouched territory to map, at least have offered the chance of meaningful and original exploration. I also hope that I am offering my explorations within an original and provoking cultural and critical context.</field><field name="date">1974</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420200 Literature Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1571</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Treaty of Waitangi: a study of its making, interpretation and role in New Zealand history</field><field name="creator">Orange, Claudia</field><field name="description">From 1840 to the present, the Treaty of Waitangi has been a subject of some significance in New Zealand &#8211; a distinctive but subtle thread running through the fabric of the country&#8217;s history and shaping attitudes to race relations.

The origins and relationships of the freshwater harpacticoid fauna are considered, together with its ecological and geographical distribution within New Zealand.</field><field name="date">1980</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1599</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The form and function of the digestive and respiratory systems of the marine pulmonate, Siphonaria zelandica</field><field name="creator">Wong, Pat Shun Patsy</field><field name="description">The marine pulmonate limpet Siphonaria Zelandica is commonly found in the mid-eulittoral zone in shallow pans or rock pools with dense algal growth. Though it resembles a true limpet externally, it is active when emersed during the ebbing of the tide browsing on small succulent algae, rather than grazing the surface film. The structure and function of the digestive and respiratory systems of Siphonaria were studied, particularly in relation to its adaptations to the intertidal mode of life. The digestive system is relatively simple consisting of a large buccal mass with paired salivary glands, a spacious esophageal crop, a slightly muscular stomach with two digestive diverticula and a simple intestine-rectum. The arrangement of the 28 muscles of the buccal mass and the odontophore is typical of patelliform pulmonates. The radula is a broad sheet with 144 &#177; 31 rows of teeth, each row having a tooth formula of (18&#177;4) + (18&#177;3) + (1) + (18&#177;3) + (18&#177;4). The radular teeth are continuously produced at a rate of 4.9 rows per day similar to those of active feeding herbivorous gastropods. The characteristics of the teeth and the movement of the mouth and the feeding traces showed that the feeding processes do not involve rasping of a hard substratum but browsing and scooping of soft lush algal growth. The whole alimentary tract is lined by ciliated columnar cells of a basic form but with slight structural variations in different region. Those in the oesophagus and stomach contain apical vesicles and lysosome-like bodies indicating involvement in intracellular digestion, while those in the intestine contain various amounts of lipid and glycogen, functioning in active absorption and storage. The ciliated cells of the post-intestine, having a much folded basal plasma membrane are apparently involved in osmoregulation. The proteinaceous secretory cells in the crop and mid-intestine and the glycoprotein cells in the pro-intestine are either producing enzymes for extracellular digestion or secreting the faecal-binding sheath. Mucous cells interspersed among the ciliated cells of the oesophagus intestine and rectum produce mucoid material for lubrication and transport of food particles. The cuticular strip in the anterior chamber of the stomach, probably a vestigial gastric shield consists of tall non-ciliated cells with thick microvilli embedded in a dense fibrous matrix. The salivary gland contains six cell types: grain cells, duct mucocytes, mucocytes I and mucocytes II, duct ciliated cells and undifferentiated cells. The first four are secretory, the grain cell being serous secretory and the other three muciparous, with varying amounts of mucopolysaccharides. The tubules of the digestive gland are made up of five cell types, acinous digestive cells, neck digestive cells, crypt cells, vacuolated cells and undifferentiated cells. Both types of digestive cells participate in absorption and digestion. The high lipofuscin content in the neck digestive cell suggests its possible role in lipid digestion. The crypt cell with elaborate GER whorls and proteinaceous globules is apparently secretory, producing enzymes for extracellular digestion. Apocrinal secretion of the globules from the crypt cells was observed for the first time. The vacuolated cells appear to be degenerated crypt cells with an excretory function. The digestive gland tubule was found to undergo cyclic changes, correlated with the feeding activity which is related with the tides. Enzyme assays showed the presence of various carbohydrases, proteolytic and lipolytic enzymes in the different region of the digestive system. The digestive gland is the main site of enzyme production. The pH optima of amylase, laminarinase and sucrase from various regions of the digestive tract were found to be within the pH range of the alimentary tract. The activities of various enzymes in the salivary gland and the oesophagus but not digestive gland were synchronous and correlated with feeding. When emersed, Siphonaria respires atmospherically with the pneumostome wide open, and the mantle cavity functioning as a lung without any active ventilatory movements. When submerged, the mantle cavity is filled with water, a strong water current through the gill being created by the ciliated dorsal and ventral raphe behind the gill. The available respiratory surfaces include the sides of the foot, the anterior mantle roof and the single plicate gill. All these are lined by a thin epidermis with large blood spaces beneath it the non-ciliated epidermal cells in different regions carry different lengths of microvilli, apparently related to the degree of their protective role. The respiratory physiology of Siphonaria was also studied. No tidal or diurnal rhythm in oxygen consumption was revealed. In unagitated conditions the aerial respiratory rate was much higher than the aquatic rate but with agitation, the aquatic rate increased to near the aerial rate. Cutaneous respiration constituted about 25% of the total. The respiratory rate varied with body weight, the coefficient b being temperature-independent (0.791 &#177; 0.122). Both aerial and aquatic respiratory rates increased with temperature. The highest temperature-sensitive range was 10-25&#176;C in winter and 15-30&#176;C in summer which coincided with the normal environmental temperature. No seasonal temperature acclimation was found within the normal thermal range. Respiratory pigments haemocyanin and myoglobin were detected in the blood and buccal mass respectively. Their characteristics were studied and their role in oxygen transfer system was postulated. The reverse Bohr shift of the haemocyanin may facilitate oxygen uptake in the lung during burses of activity at low tide. A high oxygen-combining capacity of the buccal mass myoglobin (21.2 vol%) indicated a role of oxygen storage during bursts of feeding activity. The distribution of carbonic anhydrase in various tissues was consistent with a transfer system facilitating the release of metabolic CO2 from the buccal mass. Finally the phylogenetic relationships of Siphonariidae with other groups of marine pulmonates were discussed. The unspecialised digestive system, the advanced form of nervous system and the possession of a secondary gill suggest that Siphonariidae, as a family, may not be an advanced derivative of any of the more primitive living basommatophoran groups, but could represent, along with the Gadiniidae, a specialized group which has originated directly from a primitive pulmonate stock and are adapted to life on exposed rock shores.</field><field name="date">1980</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1601</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rural population growth and institutional response: Thames-Coromandel district</field><field name="creator">Bedogni, James Andrew</field><field name="description">Rural population growth has emerged in the 1970s as an important trend in many developed countries, including New Zealand. Increasing emphasis is also currently being accorded to the consideration of institutions and institutional factors in geographical research. This thesis develops the themes of population growth and institutions in rural areas and isolates institutional response as a relevant component in the overall growth process. Analysis of rural population growth in the study area of Thames-Coromandel provides the background context to the investigation of response by health, education and statutory planning institutions. The analysis itself reveals the dominance of inward migration in the growth process, the nucleated nature of much of the growth and major explanations relating to retirement and recreation development together with agricultural intensification and alternative lifestyle and craft industry development. Institutional response by the Hamilton Education Board and Thames Hospital Board is shown to be embedded in a complex web of constraints and determinants. However a definite expansion of services and facilities is clearly evident in the context of the demonstrated growth. Conversely the statutory planning response by the Thames-Coromandel District Council has tended to display a general lack of adequacy to date in the proper management of growth and development in the study area. Overall, the study provides both theoretical and practical insights into population growth and institutional response in rural areas and presents a basis for further research in this contemporary field of geographical study.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370400 Human Geography</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1609</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The governal of health</field><field name="creator">Kiernander, Adrian Rodney Dixie</field><field name="description">The Governal of Health is a text of historical and linguistic interest, having been printed by William Caxton about 1489, thus being the earliest medical work printed in English. No other detailed study of the text has been made, and it has not been used in the compilation of the Oxford English Dictionary or Kurath and K&#252;hn's Middle English Dictionary. The principal objective of this edition has been to establish a clear and accurate text based on a detailed study of the eight located manuscript versions of the treatise, with constant reference to the Regimen Sanitatis of which it is a translation. One good manuscript version (from B.M. Add. MS. 29301) was selected as a base and freely emended from the other versions wherever it was clear that errors or omissions had been made. The introduction to the text contains descriptions of the eight manuscripts which have been located containing texts of The Governal of Health, together with notes on manuscripts containing versions of the Regimen Sanitatis, and on the surviving copies of Caxton's edition and other printed editions and facsimiles. (A discussion of the state of Caxton's text is found at the beginning of Appendix A). A study of the language of the text is included, concentrating particularly on the vocabulary, with an account of those words which are used with meanings not recorded in the Oxford English Dictionary or the Middle English Dictionary and those words which predate the first examples quoted in those dictionaries. Finally in the Introduction there are notes on the authorship and date of the text. The precise date of the text remains uncertain; however it is established as a result of this study that the treatise, previously ascribed variously to John de Bordeaux and Bartholomeus, was written by John Mirfeld at St Bartholomew's Priory. Transcriptions of Caxton's edition and of the Regimen Sanitatis (from BM. MS. Harley 3) are appended, and a full Glossary of all forms in the text is provided.</field><field name="date">1980</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1567</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contentious Birds: The Owl and the Nightingale and Other Poems in a Singular Middle English Verse Tradition</field><field name="creator">Parker, Cynthia Margaret</field><field name="description">This thesis considers the use of birds in medieval English poetry as reflections of humans and human society. I look especially at some of the ways in which medieval animals are used to comment satirically on the frailties and foibles of the human animal, man. Birds and beasts configured as humans present particular problems of identity and alterity that lend themselves well to the composition of recreational verse, and the fact that they are both so similar to humans and so different is particularly conducive to their use as vehicles of parody and satire. Also considered here are some of the early works in which animals are studied both as themselves and in comparison with humans, especially the texts of such classic natural historians as Aristotle and Pliny. I also glance, if only briefly, at the second-century Physiologus, which incorporates the work of Pliny and his followers together with biblical texts and Christianized moralizations. This seminal work, in the form of its direct descendants the medieval bestiaries, is a major source for writers of animal narrative in the Middle Ages. My study is organized in two parts. Part One contains the material outlined above together with some discussion on different kinds of satire&#8212;in particular, the satire of incongruity, so important in the context of animal impersonation of humans. It also considers the use of birds in various comic-satiric genres, especially in recreational texts such as the clerk and knight d&#233;bats, liturgical parodies and, above all, the peculiarly English genre of bird debate. The vernacular literary tradition represented in the eight bird poems in this section&#8212;ranging from the thirteenth to the early sixteenth century, some dialogic, some not&#8212;virtually constitutes a minor genre in which even a major poet like Chaucer was happy to work. Part Two contains four chapters devoted to a close reading and textual analysis of a single poem, The Owl and the Nightingale, probably the earliest and certainly the best of all the Middle English two&#8212;party bird debates. (My title&#8212;Contentious Birds&#8211;is derived from the descriptive title of thirteenth century poems in this particular debate tradition: The Thrush and the Nightingale, for example, appears in MS Digby 86 under the heading, "Ci commence la cuntent parente le Mauuis &amp; la russinole&#8221;). A spirited dispute of nearly eighteen hundred lines, The Owl and the Nightingale dates from the late twelfth or thirteenth century, and is remarkable above all for its freshness and originality, and its sheer, delightful ease of writing. A final chapter looks at conclusions in the debates and other poems in this study; at the question of the disputants' usefulness to man, particularly in The Owl and the Nightingale, and at the fluctuating nature of the boundaries that separate human from animal. Principal concerns in my thesis are the nature and the variety of the literary relationships constructed in the Middle Ages around these dividing lines between humans and birds or beasts (in this case, birds), and the ways in which these precarious lines of demarcation can be put especially, to recreational literary use.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1640</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Britain and Europe: a study of attitudes in Britain towards Britain's post-war relationship with Western Europe 1942-45</field><field name="creator">Malone, Judith (nee Elphick)</field><field name="description">I was drawn to this topic of research by my interest in the European movement its evolution over the past thirty odd years and, in particular the British response to these developments. A great deal has been written in this field for the 1950s, 60s and 70s, but there is almost nothing on the war period itself. This seemed an important gap, for the war was the context within which the nations of Western Europe became open to the possibility of a radically new ordering of the economic and political life of the Continent. And it was in the context of the war that Britain rose to a position of unparalleled prestige vis-a-vis her European allies who looked to her to provide the leadership essential for such an ambitious undertaking. I have taken the period from 1942-3 when the tide of war turned against the Axis Powers and Allied victory was certain, to the end of 1945, when the period of flux was ending and the first outlines of the Cold War were already apparent.

It is a period in which writers sought to make literature serve the larger political end and often artistic merit is a function of the success the writer had in accommodating in his work the demands of outside pressures. It is always difficult to detach a period of history from the longer continuum but there is, nevertheless, a case to be made for viewing the years from about 1930 to around 1950 as a relatively homogeneous unit in New Zealand's literary history, distinct in important respects from what came before and from what followed. The new generation of writers in England in the thirties, particularly Auden and the group around him influenced young New Zealand writers both technically and in the attitudes they adopted to the relationship between the artist and society. The prevailing left-wing ethos emphasised the political and public responsibilities of the writer. Retreat into private, esoteric, literary modes was seen as an abdication of these responsibilities. The major themes of this period in New Zealand writing were social realism and nationalism; the literary products of the pressures exerted by political and economic forces. For the young writers the political awareness and sense of social commitment generated by the depression, together with the crusade to inhabit the land imaginatively, provided a sense of literary direction. These writers and their contemporaries accepted responsibility in both these areas seeing themselves as crusaders for social justice and creators of the imaginative understanding necessary to achieve a sense of belonging to this country. Such an understanding would be reached not through seeing it as offspring of England, nor as a picturesque, innocent new society; but by exploring it honestly and creating the terms and vocabulary for describing it. This study documents the careers of John Mulgan, Frank Sargeson, R.A.K. Mason, A.R.D. Fairburn and Allen Curnow in the period, roughly, 1930 to 1950, and looks at the ways each responded to the public demands they perceived were placed upon them. In their different ways these writers went about the business of changing New Zealand society, broadening its understanding of itself, creating an atmosphere conducive to artistic and literary development. Despite the fact that the degree of success in accommodating these demands varies considerably from writer to writer, the literary output of the period as a whole generated the confidence and energy that were a prerequisite to the development of an indigenous literature. During this period there developed an acceptance, albeit highly critical, of New Zealand and a feeling that the tradition which had been established in the thirties and forties could be extended by succeeding generations of artists and writers.</field><field name="date">1980</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420200 Literature Studies::420201 New Zealand literature in English</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1633</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reproductive biology and pollination ecology of Feijoa Sellowiana</field><field name="creator">Stewart, Anne Margaret</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1728</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Distribution patterns of fish during the planktonic period of their life history</field><field name="creator">Kingsford, Michael John, 1955-</field><field name="description">The static and dynamic distribution patterns of ichthyoplankton were investigated over a 4 year period (1981 - 1985) off the coast of Leigh, on the northeastern coast of New Zealand. Emphasis was given to horizontal and vertical distributions, and these were described on scales encompassing broad areas of the outer Hauraki Gulf and smaller areas of 1 - 100m. The ages of these small fish were also investigated by examining daily increments in the otoliths, and this allowed a more complete interpretation of distribution patterns. Sampling that was carried out at different distances from the mainland identified major differences in the distribution patterns of individual species. For example, pilchards were caught in high densities right across the continental shelf, whereas morid cod were restricted to the outer edge of the shelf. The most intensive investigations were carried out over the Summer months and these revealed large differences in the abundances of species. For instance, few bothids and triglids were captured in December, while large numbers were caught in January. The spawning activity of adults and broad scale differences between water masses were probably responsible for these distance and time related patterns. Large differences in the densities of ichthyoplankton were found at different localities within each area of the continental shelf (e.g. close to the mainland). Furthermore, detailed investigations of abundances at a single locality over a three day period showed large changes. These changing distribution patterns were related to the dynamics of localized hydrological features (e.g. tidally induced gyres). The presence of islands over the continental shelf also influenced the distribution of small fish. Some species were only found near land, regardless of the distance from the mainland. From ichthyoplankton hauls and direct observations made using SCUBA, it is argued that the behaviour of ichthyoplankton may have a strong influence on their distribution patterns. For example, tripterygiids and gobiesocids of a variety of ontogenetic forms were observed to aggregate and maintain their position in the shallow areas of rocky reefs. Large differences were found in the vertical distributions of fish and this was true in water columns from 1 - 40m in depth. Ichthyoplankters of a number of species had different depth distributions. Some species were consistently found near the surface (e.g. hemiramphids &amp; mugilids) or near the bottom (e.g. eleotrids). For species found throughout the water column during the day, it was suggested that biological and physical stratification (e.g. thermoclines) strongly influenced relative densities at each depth stratum. Some species (especially engraulids &amp; scombrids) migrated toward the surface at night. Migration patterns varied for each species and among times. The latter patterns were related to ambient light levels which changed with the phase of the moon. Small scale structure in the pelagic environment influenced the distribution of fish. Large numbers of fish were found around drift algae and when experimental algae were left to drift, small fish of several species (e.g. Monacanthids) were quickly attracted to it. A number of species were abundant in surface waters, but did not associate with drift algae (e.g. engraulids). For fish that were found around drift algae, the association may be important as a source of shelter and food. There was considerable seasonality in the occurrence of fish species around algae, and the abundance of total drift algae. Drift algae were most abundant over Spring and early Summer. The movements and accumulation of algae are discussed in relation to the potential influence it has on recruitment patterns of fish in nearshore environments. The distribution patterns of small fish were strongly influenced by the surface slicks of internal waves. Densities of small fish, drift algae, and zooplankton were higher in slicks than in rippled water adjacent to them. Slicks moved at 0.5 - 1.25 km per hour in the direction of shore. A consequence of aggregation in slicks, therefore, is that small fish may be transported onshore. It is suggested that the accumulation of zooplanktonic food in slicks may be important for the feeding of ichthyoplankters. Many of the fish found in surface waters, be it in open water or around drift algae, had adult fin-ray counts and were not considered to be larvae, according to current definitions. From information on the age and size of these fish it is suggested that the capacity of fish to settle at a variety of ages and sizes has probably been underestimated. Furthermore, the occurrence of physical processes such as slicks may influence the duration of the planktonic phase and subsequent settlement rates of fish into nearshore environments. The major findings were used to provide an overall picture of what happens during the planktonic phase of some species (Chrysophrys auratus, Parika scaber &amp; tripterygiids), and these case histories are discussed in relation to current hypotheses concerning the ecology of ichthyoplankton.</field><field name="date">1986</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1752</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of topoisomerase II in amsacrine resistance</field><field name="creator">Rattray, Sandra J.(Sandra Jean)</field><field name="description">Restricted Item. Print thesis available in the University of Auckland Library or available through Inter-Library Loan. 1. Antitumour agents from many different chemical classes including acridines, have been shown to induce topoisomerase II-associated DNA breaks both in cultured mammalian cells and in vitro in the presence of purified mammalian DNA topoisomerase II. However, mechanisms linking these protein-associated DNA breaks with drug cytotoxicity are poorly understood. Whether this type of DNA damage is responsible for drug cytotoxicty was investigated using a number of acridine derivatives belonging to the sane chemical class but with varying potency in vivo. The modulation of topoisomerase II-mediated DNA breaks in whole L1210 cells, isolated nuclei and nuclear extract systems correlated with drug-induced cytotoxicity, at least for the drugs belonging to the amsacrine lineage. In contrast, there was no direct relationship between the inhibition of topoisomerase II strand-passing activity and the cytotoxic action of topoisomerase II-specific anticancer drugs. It was concluded that drug-induced formation and stabilization of the topoisomerase II-DNA cleavable complex rather than inhibition of its formation or of strand-passing functions, is responsible for DNA strand breakage and cell death caused by antitumour acridines such as amsacrine. 2. Two tissue culture systems (CHO-AA8 cells or P815 cell cycle mutants) were used as models to study the involvement of topoisomerase II in the resistance of non-cycling cells to amsacrine. Plateau-phase CHO-AA8 cells with a GO/Gl DNA content are resistant, to amsacrine and contain fewer DNA breaks than log-phase cells after drug treatment. (Robbie et al., 1988). The observations of Robbie et al. (1988) were further investigated in this thesis. The phage P4 DNA unknotting activity in CHO-AA8 cell nuclear extracts decreased 2-fold when the cells entered plateau-phase, but there was no difference in the sensitivity of unknotting to amsacrine between log- and plateau-phase nuclear extracts. Furthermore, drug stimulation of protein-DNA complex formation was similar in whole cells, isolated nuclei and nuclear extracts from either log- or plateau-phase cells. However, stimulation of complex formation in cells, nuclei or nuclear extracts was approximately 4-fo1d lower in plateau-phase than in log-phase. These results suggested that drug-enzyme interaction was altered in plateau-phase and there was a good correlation between the proliferative state of cells, amsacrine sensitivity DNA breakage and topoisomerase II-DNA complex formation. The second system used to study the effect of amsacrine was the cold-sensitive (proliferating at 39.5&#176;C; reversibly arrested in Gl-phase at 33&#176;C) cell-cycle mutant 21-Fb of the murine mastocytoma cell line, P815- The sensitivity of arrested 21-FB cells to amsacrine decreased &#8211;less than two-fold in cell survival experiments when compared to proliferating cells. In contrast, DNA breakage and stimulation of protein-DNA complex formation in intact cells, lysed cells or isolated nuclei was reduced approximately 10-fold in amsacrine-treated arrested cells and DNA-topoisomerase II activity in arrested cells was only 5% of the activity in proliferating cells. Thus in contrast to the CHO-AA8 cell system, there was no correlation between cell survival and DNA damage or DNA topisomerase II activity in drug treated 21-Fb cells. The exact reasons for the differences in amsacrine sensitivity in growth arrested CHO and 21-Fb cells were not resolved. However, it was concluded that a complex relationship exists between amsacrine-induced DNA breakage, topoisomerase II-DNA complex formation, topoisomerase activity and drug cytotoxicity. Moreover, a very complex set of parameters can influence drug-induced topoisomerase II-mediated lesions and cytotoxicity in different cells or even a single type of cell under different growth conditions. 3. Extracts of K21 murine mastocytoma cells were found to contain a factor that, enhances formation of amsacrine-induced topoisomerase II-DNA complexes (PDC) when added to isolated K21 nuclei. The PDC enhancing activity was reduced in extracts from 2 or 6 h cycloheximide- or cordycepin-treated cells, implying that continuous protein synthesis is required to maintain the factor. Preliminary characterization showed that the factor was heat labile and proteinase-sensitive suggesting the factor was a labile protein which was distinct from the two known classes of topoisomerase. The protein factor was present in at least four other cell lines and was substantially reduced in cells induced into a G1 state by temperature arrest or serum deprivation, Human Jurkat cells selected for resistance to amsacrine and displaying cross-resistance to other topoisomerase II-targeted drugs also exhibited significantly reduced PDC enhancing activity. These results suggested a contributing role for the PDC enhancing factor in mediation of drug resistance. Fractionation of mouse mastocytoma cell cytoplasmic extracts by salt precipitation, DEAE-cellulose chromatography and SDS-PAGE resulted in a 3571-fold purification of the PDC enhancing activity. The PDC enhancing activity was shown to reside in a 70 kDa protein kinase with specificity for a casein kinase II substrate and sensitive to heparin and anti-casein kinase II antiserum. This appears to be the first direct evidence of a protein factor that modulates amsacrine induced topoisomerase II action possibly by phosphorylating topoisomerase II or proteins associated with topoisomerase II.</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320300 Medical Biochemistry and Clinical Chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1892</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Traumatic brain injury rehabilitation outcomes across cultures</field><field name="creator">Faleafa, Monique</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380107 Health, clinical and counselling psychology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321207 Indigenous healt</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1890</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Operational forest harvest scheduling optimisation: a mathematical model and solution strategy</field><field name="creator">Mitchell, Stuart Anthony</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the Operational Harvest Scheduling (OHS) problem and develops an algorithm that solves instances of the problem. The solution to an OHS problem is an Operational Harvest Schedule (OHS). An OHS: &#178; assigns forest harvesting crews to locations within a forest in the short-term (4-8 weeks); &#178; instructs crews to harvest specific log-types and allocates these log-types to customers; &#178; maximises profitability while meeting customer demand. The OHS problem is modelled as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP). The formulation given in this thesis differs significantly from previous literature, especially with regard to the construction of the problem variables. With this novel formulation, the problem can be solved using techniques developed in previous work on aircraft crew scheduling optimisation (Ryan 1992). These techniques include constraint branching and column generation. The concept of relaxed integer solutions is introduced. A traditional integer solution to the OHS problem will require harvesting crews to move between harvesting locations at the end of a week. However, a relaxed integer solution allows crews to move at any time during a week. This concept allows my OHS model to more effectively model the practical problem. The OHS model is formulated for New Zealand and Australian commercial forestry operations,though the model could be applied to other intensively managed production forests. Three case studies are developed for two companies.

The first study focused on the role of settlement events in the origin and maintenance of community structure and involved investigation of factors affecting dispersion, settlement and recruitment of sponge propagules. The second examined how natural gradients in ambient physical conditions, in the absence of disturbance, affected size structure and species interactions within the community. Settlement events were examined on a reef flat which was covered by a shallow sediment overlayer. The distribution and abundance of established sponges was found to be highly correlated with sediment regimes. The sponge community was shown to be stable over time and able to resist disturbance by storms because of the presence of turfing algae. Sponge settlement was inhibited by the sediment overlayer. Established sponges were found clumped into oblong groups orientated east-west and there were many instances where sponges were found closely associated. Adjacent areas were characterised by deeper unstable sediments and fewer sponges. Storms contoured sediments into ripples and scoured oblong east-west orientated patches of basal rock. Sediments were also sorted during storms such that particles of large grain size were left around the edges of ripples and over the scoured rock patches. The basal reef of both the stable and unstable areas was covered in a mosaic of encrusting algal and sponge species which tolerated the sediment overlayer. This assemblage was also exposed during storms. Sponges reproduced in a number of ways, but asexual propagules were the most successful. Sponges from several orders produced buds which developed in a complex manner. Buds adhered to rock and shell fragments of large size which acted as anchors, or attached to other buds irrespective of genotype. The change in weight and shape increased the likelihood that buds would gravitate into the scoured patches of basal rock. Bud loss off the reef was minimal. Buds were able to settle onto the basal rock patches and did so almost exclusively onto bare rock. A high degree of 'selectivity' of settlement site by buds was imparted by altering developmental rate during the settlement process in response to the substrate type. Polymastia granulosa buds exhibited an additional developmental sequence not previously reported for any colonial organism. Buds either settled directly in suitable conditions, or developed further along a different pathway. Buds which did not come into contact with basal rock elongated and appeared to be capable of digging into sediments. The elongated bud then broke up along its length into smaller particles, termed 'beads', which were capable of movement and invariably settled onto gravel fragments. Sponges were shown to settle onto scoured rock patches during storms and were eventually covered by sediments. Subsequent survivorship and recruitment depended species specifically on sediment depth and quality. Settlement patterns matched the observed dispersion patterns of established sponges and suggested a mechanism whereby the community had originated and how structure was maintained. These hypotheses were tested experimentally in situ and in the laboratory. The importance of asexual modes of reproduction, and settlement mediated by physical disturbance appears to be a common formula for recruitment by colonial marine organisms. Recruitment events were found to explain the distributional patterns of the established population. The structure of populations of thin encrusting species on vertical reef walls was examined in a novel manner whereby the mean size and density of individuals was quantified and related to gradients in the ambient physical environment. This was achieved by examining the benthic communities on a range of subtidal reef walls of uniform slope and aspect, but which were subject to natural gradients in physical conditions. The species composition of each of the six reefs studied was similar but the size structure of communties changed within each reef system in response to gradients in light intensity and water movement. Fish and urchin disturbance was shown to be unimportant and there was no indication that storms disrupted communities. The implications of changes in size structure of populations on interactions between component species in different ambient conditions were examined. The eastern wall of two cave, archway and open reef systems was surveyed according to a stratified sampling design where each reef was divided by depth and distance along the wall. Different taxonomic/morphological groups were found at particular positions on reef walls. Thin encrusting algal species were found to be one of the most abundant groups. It was assumed that the individual size of encrusting species at each wall position reflected long term ambient environmental conditions as well as the ability of each species to maintain itself against overgrowth by neighbours. By relating the population size structure of different taxa with indices for light intensity and water movement recorded at each wall position within each reef, it was shown that community structure varied markedly on the same reef wall as a function of ambient physical conditions. Changes in proportional species composition, notably from thin encrusting algal dominated assemblages to sponge characterised assemblages, with decreasing light intensity were accompanied by changes in the individual size structure of populations. At each wall position all species exhibited similar individual size. Individual size decreased and density of individuals of all species increased with decreasing light intensity. In conditions where light levels were not sufficient to support algae, individual size of encrusting fauna increased with increasing water movement. The implications of these observations on competitive interactions between encrusting species was examined. The outcome of competitive interactions between the same species was found to vary depending on wall position.</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1740</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on chemically modified cytochromes Cl2</field><field name="creator">Mathews, Antony James</field><field name="description">Tuna and Horse cytochromes c were purified and chemically modified with the water soluble carboxyl group modifying reagent 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC), using the method of Timkovich (1980). The time-course of modification was followed by visible spectroscopy and by functional measurements. Both methods indicated that disruption of the haem crevice regions of the proteins was largely complete within 10-15 minutes exposure to EDC. The EDC modified Tuna and Horse proteins (THC* and HHc* respectively) showed essentially identical functional properties to those described by Timko-vich (1980) for THc*. These include a typical methionine coordination to the haem iron, as shown by the absence of the 697nm visible absorption band from the spectra of the oxidized derivatives, and a pH dependent high spin - low spin transition for the derivatives in this oxidation state. In the reduced forms, THc* and HHc* show reactivity with carbon monoxide and oxygen indicating the haem crevice regions of these proteins is disrupted compared to those of the native proteins. The tryptic peptides of native Tuna and Horse cytochromes c were mapped by HPLC and identified by amino acid analysis. Examination of the tryptic digests of THc* and HHc* by gel filtration and HPLC revealed the presence of trypsin indigestible material indicating the presence of EDC promoted intramolecular cross-links within the modified proteins. Failure to extract the haem groups from THc* and HHc* after cleavage of the protein-haem thio-ether bonds, indicates cross-linking of the exposed haem propionate groups to the proteins. Labelling of the native and EDC modified proteins with glycine methyl ester showed that THc* and HHc* contain several covalently modified carboxyl groups. The results of Timkovich (1980) for THc* are discussed with respect to these findings. The reduction of THc*3+ and HHc*3+ by L-ascorbic acid and by the strong inorganic reducing agent sodium dithionite, was studied using stopped flow spectrophotometry. The kinetics of reduction of the modified proteins by these reagents could be accounted for by mechanisms similar to those proposed for the reduction of the native proteins by these reagents (Myer et al, 1980; Lambeth and Palmer, 1973). The effect on the reactions, of chemical modification of the proteins, is discussed. The reaction of the reduced derivatives with carbon monoxide was studied by stopped flow spectrophotometry, flash photolysis, and by equilibrium binding measurements. The reduced derivatives have a high affinity for carbon monoxide. Flash photolytic studies indicated very low quantum yields for photo-dissociation of the reduced protein CO complexes. The reduced derivatives formed complexes with oxygen which were unstable, decaying to form the oxidized protein. The rate of conversion to the oxidized protein was dependent on the solution pH. It was found that in the presence of excess reducing agent, THc*2+ and HHc*2+ could catalytically reduce oxygen. Steady state kinetic measurements were carried out to determine the dependence of the rate of oxygen reduction on various parameters. Similarities to the reactions of reduced carboxymethylated cytochrome c with oxygen are discussed.</field><field name="date">1985</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1744</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The mirror: a selection from Corpus Christi College, Cambridge MS.282</field><field name="creator">Morgan, Gregory E.</field><field name="description">Corpus Christi College, Cambridge Ms 282 dates from the late fourteenth century and contains one of the six copies of the Mirror. The Mirror is an English translation of the Miroir, a series of Anglo-Norman verse sermons for Sundays and other liturgical occasions. The Miroir was written by one Robert of Gretham, probably during the early part of the thirteenth century. Excerpts from the Miroir and the Mirror have been published; for the Anglo-Norman there are a book length study and an edition of eight sermons, and for the English there is an unpublished edition of the introduction and first twelve sermons (Hunterian MS). We need complete editions of the Anglo-Norman and English works; it is unlikely that a critical edition of the English Mirror would be base upon, or even draw heavily upon, the Corpus Christi MS, and I have thought it worthwhile to examine at least part of that MS because it is one of the texts which preserve an early London-type dialect. This edition presents a reader&#8217;s edition of eight sermons. Notes and a glossary accompany the text; the notes make limited use of one of the MSS of the Miroir. The introduction considers such matters of palaeography etc. as it is possible to discuss when one is working from a microfilm copy; it then covers language (aspects of phonology, morphology, syntax, and vocabulary) and cites some analogues to the Miroir/Mirror. The introduction and the bibliography survey what has been written about the English work and its Anglo-Norman original.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420100 Language Studies::420101 English</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1776</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Photoperiodic control of development in the New Zealand leafroller moth Planotortrix octo Dugdale (Lepidoptera, Tortricidae)</field><field name="creator">Morris, Michael Charles</field><field name="description">The aim of this study is to test for photoperiodic control of larval and pupal development in the New Zealand moth Planotortrix octo Dugdale. The photoperiodic response curves for larval and pupal development and especially for instar number at 17&#176;C and 21&#176;C indicate that a photoperiodic mechanism is involved. Superimposed on this response is the suggestion that daylength affects development rate directly, with larvae and pupae developing faster under longer photophases. This effect is especially strong for pupal development (Chapter 3). The effects of thermophotoperiods (Chapter 4), night interruption and resonance experiments (Chapter 6) provide further evidence for photoperiodic involvement. The response to resonance experiments suggests the involvement of an hourglass rather than a circadian mechanism. Larvae reared under short days accumulate significantly more lipids in the 5th and 6th instars than larvae reared under long days (Chapter 4). This finding, combined with the suppressed development rate and higher instar number under short days, suggests that a weak form of diapause may be present in this insect. This is significant in being the first recorded incidence of a photoperiodically induced diapause in a phyllophagous New Zealand insect for which a year round food supply is available (Chapter 1). By transferring insects from long to short days I found that long days have more influence than short days on larval development (Chapter 7). An attempt was made to measure juvenile hormone titres under long and short days using a Galleria bioassay. The test used was not sensitive enough however to measure any significant amounts of juvenile hormone (Chapter 8). Simulations of the experimental results were performed using a damped circadian oscillator model (Chapter 9). This model was considered the most appropriate to use, based on the experimental results and on a review of the literature (Chapter 2). Simulations showed good similarities with experimental results in most cases, but could not account for resonance responses.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology::270505 Entomology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1825</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A model minority?: Chinese youth and mental health services in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Hauraki, Jennifer</field><field name="description">The 'model minority' label given to Chinese populations in New Zealand and other Western countries have made it difficult to truly comprehend the difficulties faced by some Chinese ethnic minorities. Despite comparable rates and types of mental health problems to their European counterparts, identifiable barriers have led to Chinese ethnic minorities underutilising mental health services. The present study investigated the mental health service utilisation in native- and foreign-born Chinese youth in New Zealand, paying particular attention to barriers to service utilisation and viable solutions for these difficulties. It consisted of three individual projects and explored the views of Chinese community and mental health professionals and Chinese university students, comparing their perspectives to university students of other ethnicities. Findings showed that despite a willingness to seek help from their family and mental health professionals (e.g., psychologists, school counsellors), respondents identified a myriad of obstacles to the help seeking of Chinese youth. These included physical barriers (e.g., financial and transport constraints), personal barriers (e.g., stigma, problems accepting their difficulties), service barriers (e.g., paucity of knowledge regarding mental health problems and available services) and family barriers (e.g., obstruction from family members). Family and service barriers distinguished the difficulties faced by Chinese in comparison to European youth, particularly with regards to the adherence of professionals to stereotypes of Chinese youth, a unique finding of this study. In order to reduce such barriers, the Chinese university students and professionals advocated for greater education regarding mental health problems and services in the Chinese community, education for Chinese parents regarding adolescent issues, an increase in the number of practicing Chinese professionals that is coupled with improved cross-cultural training for non-Chinese professionals, as well as individual assessment and treatment approaches with Chinese youth and their families.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380107 Health, clinical and counselling psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1876</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Computer aided modelling of sheet metal forming</field><field name="creator">Templer, Richard Geoffrey</field><field name="description">The work described by this thesis presents several new methods of the computer modelling of sheet metal forming. In particular it focuses on the design steps of sheet metal forming; blank shape prediction, part design, die design and part applications. This work concentrates on developable surfaces, which are the tangent surfaces of space curves and include cones and cylinders. Developable surfaces are so called, because they can be rolled out (developed) onto a plane without stretching, tearing or creasing. A folded developable is formed when a developable surface is folded about a curve. Since folded developables are formed only by folding they are ideally suited to being constructed from sheet metal. New theories are presented that accurately predict the surface that will be formed if a general developable surface is folded about a general curve. The theories have been developed into a computer program, 3FD, that allows the rapid and accurate design of folded developables. Several different folded developables have been designed using the program and compared with physical results, with excellent geometric correlation. An improved method of computer aided blank shape prediction has been developed. The method can be applied to both folded developables and to general sheet metal components. The method uses new boundary conditions to increase the accuracy of the predicted blank shape. The method also indicates possible areas of forming problems. A pressed automobile component is used to illustrate the increased accuracy of the new method. The design program can also generate the geometry necessary to create the die set to form a folded developable. Such a die set has been created and a folded developable formed from it. The formed folded developable closely matches the computational model. The design program has also been used to investigate the kinematics of folded developables. The mechanism of a simple folded developable has been determined and the implications and possible applications of this are discussed.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1900</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influence of reef-associated predators on adjacent soft-sediment communities</field><field name="creator">Langlois, Timothy John</field><field name="description">&#8216;Infaunal haloes&#8217; of either decreasing or increasing abundances of individual soft-sediment species with distance from reefs have been suggested to be caused by reef-associated predators. A large-scale mensurative experiment was used to investigate the distribution of two size classes of macrofauna with distance from the reef edge across three locations in northeastern New Zealand. The role of reef-associated predators, the snapper (Pagrus auratus Sparidae) and rock lobster (Jasus edwardsii Palinuridae), was investigated using established marine reserves at each location. Consistent patterns were found in a few large-bodied fauna. The hermit crab Pagurus novizelandiae occurred more frequently near the reef edge, whilst the heart urchin Echinocardium cordatum and bivalve Dosinia subrosea were more abundant further away from the reef. Dosinia subrosea and another bivalve, Myadora striata, exhibited lower biomass at sites with higher densities of snapper and rock lobster. In contrast, small-bodied macrofauna showed no consistent patterns with distance from the reef or among sites with different predator populations. It was hypothesised that predation was driving the distribution of large bivalves. An experiment was done to investigate this model using D. subrosea. Equal densities of this bivalve were established in plots either with or without cages at sites either inside or outside of reserves. Significant predation was detected, but only inside reserves. Much of this mortality could be specifically attributed to predation by large rock lobsters, given the distinctive marks on the valves of dead D. subrosea. Inside reserves, predators are not only more abundant but also larger. It was hypothesised that different size classes of predators would result in different levels of predation. Laboratory feeding experiments were used to investigate this model. Lobsters of all sizes chose D. subrosea over the heavier shelled D. anus. Small lobsters chose to prey on small D. subrosea and large lobsters more frequently chose larger prey. The distributions of these two bivalve species at protected (large predators) and fished sites (small predators) reflected the feeding choices observed in the laboratory. Results suggested that rock lobster populations are capable, where their size structure is not truncated by fishing pressure, of controlling population-level dynamics of bivalve communities adjacent to reefs.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1894</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Failure of sandwich honeycomb panels in bending</field><field name="creator">Staal, Remmelt Andrew</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates failure in sandwich panels due to bending, specifically localised buckling or wrinkling, a predominant failure mechanism for thin gauge honeycomb sandwich panels loaded in bending or compression. Over the past 60 years, considerable work has been devoted to understanding wrinkling and trying to predict failure loads in damaged and undamaged panels accurately. Existing wrinkling expressions were shown to over-estimate failure loads by over 100%. Discrepancies between wrinkling expressions and experimental failure loads were previously attributed to imperfections and irregularities in the structure. The aim of this thesis is to investigate this problem and try to accurately predict failure loads and understand the underlying failure mechanisms in damaged and undamaged panels, using a combination of numerical and analytical techniques. Classical wrinkling models use a continuum core to model complex cellular honeycomb cores. This type of model reduces complex cellular geometry to a series of effective properties that provide constant support to the face sheet. In reality, honeycomb cores provide support around the periphery of the cell walls and not across the entire surface of the face sheet. Due to the nature of wrinkling and the size of the wavelength, incorrect representation of the core could affect the failure loads and model. This study made direct comparisons between linear buckling loads of a discrete-cored sandwich panel and a continuum-cored sandwich panel. Discrete properties were converted to continuum properties within a Finite Element package. The result conclusively showed that both models predict the same linear failure loads, disproving the theory that the core representations contribute to the difference between experimental and analytical models. It was also shown that existing wrinkling models can accurately predict linear wrinkling loads. These linear model loads do not necessarily match the collapse strength of the physical panel and in most cases predict a significantly higher value.  The research then moves on to developing expressions to convert cellular geometry into continuum properties accurately. Expressions are developed for honeycomb structures with fillets in their junctions. Both out-of-plane and in-plane modulus properties are reviewed and the models are verified against Finite Elements models and experimental results. Studies showed that the restrained in-plane modulus can be up to ten times stiffer than the commonly used free modulus value. This has a significant effect on the wrinkling stress. By using the correct value, the discrete model and continuum models predict the same loads. The classical wrinkling expressions also predict the same wrinkling stress as the Finite Element models. After establishing that the core representation is not the cause of the prediction error, the thesis turns to non-linear Finite Element models to predict failure loads and failure mechanism of thin-gauge sandwich honeycomb structures loaded in bending. A continuum three-dimensional non-linear Finite Element model, with bilinear plasticity, is compared with a set of experiments that use different types of Nomex cores and face sheets. The models show that the panels fail prematurely due to core crushing because of wrinkles forming in the face sheets. Experimental results indicate similar trends. The final section examines the affect of impact damage in honeycomb sandwich structures. Due to the thin face sheets and thick cores used on many aircraft and marine components, sandwich panels offer little resistance to impact events. Resulting damage usually consists of a layer of crushed core and a shallow dent in the face sheet. This type of damage often leads to a significant reduction in the load-carrying capacity of the panel through a full range of damage sizes. Finite element and analytical models were developed to accurately predict and capture the localised wrinkling failure mechanism which occurs in the impacted area. Models were directly compared to experimental results, with a high degree of correlation. The numerical and analytical models showed that impact damaged panels were failing due to wrinkling instability and not due to premature core crushing, which is the case with undamaged panels. They showed that two factors influence the wrinkling failure load: damage depth and damage diameter.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290200 Aerospace Engineering::290203 Aerospace structures</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1906</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of the pathogenesis and treatment of secondary osteoporosis</field><field name="creator">Bolland, Mark Jonathan</field><field name="description">Background: Osteoporosis commonly affects older men and women. Frequently, it is caused or exacerbated by a disease or treatment (termed secondary osteoporosis). The aim of this thesis is to explore aspects of the pathogenesis and treatment of three conditions that may cause or contribute to osteoporosis: human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), and vitamin D insufficiency. Each of these conditions is potentially linked to bone metabolism via associations with nutritional status, which in turn is a key regulator of bone mass and fracture risk. Methods: Eight studies were performed: 1. Cross-sectional comparison of bone mineral density (BMD) in HIV-infected men and age-matched controls. 2. Two-year randomised controlled trial of the effects of annual zoledronate on BMD in HIV-infected men. 3. Longitudinal comparison of the change in BMD over two years in HIV-infected men not receiving skeletal therapy and controls. 4. Meta-analysis of body weight in patients with PHPT. 5. Cross-sectional analysis of the relationship between parathyroid hormone and body weight in post-menopausal women. 6. Cross-sectional analysis of the determinants of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) in post-menopausal women and middle-aged and older men. 7. Cross-sectional analysis of the effects of fat mass and seasonal variation on diagnosis of vitamin D sufficiency. 8. Cross-sectional analysis of the relationship between vitamin D binding protein and body weight in older men and women. Results: 1. HIV-infected men were 6.3 kg lighter than controls, and after adjustment for this weight difference, did not have lower BMD than controls. 2. Annual intravenous zoledronate caused substantial increases in BMD in HIV-infected men over two years. 3. HIV-infected men did not have accelerated bone loss over time compared to controls. 4. Patients with PHPT are on average 3.1-3.3 kg heavier than age-matched controls. 5. Fat mass is an important determinant of parathyroid hormone levels. 6. The major determinants of 25OHD levels in men and women are surrogate measures of ultraviolet-B exposure, and fat mass, but men have higher 25OHD levels throughout the year than women. 7. Thresholds for diagnosis of vitamin D sufficiency vary by season and amount of fat mass. 8. Vitamin D binding protein does not mediate the relationships between 25OHD and age, gender or weight.  Conclusions: Uncomplicated HIV infection is not associated with low BMD at baseline or accelerated bone loss over time. There are important relationships between body weight and PHPT, and among fat mass, parathyroid hormone and 25OHD that have significance both for the pathogenesis of PHPT and vitamin D sufficiency, and for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of these conditions.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Osteoporosis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Liberty, peace, and friendliness: the political ideas of Auberon Herbert</field><field name="creator">Edyvane, Valda</field><field name="description">The political ideas of Auberon Herbert are usually associated with the late Victorian Individualist thinkers primarily influenced by the philosopher Herbert Spencer. Although Herbert derived his political philosophy of Voluntaryism from Spencer&#8217;s thinking it also owed much to J. S. Mill. Voluntaryism was based on a Lockean-Spencerian conception of individual natural rights that asserted self-ownership and the moral obligation for individuals to respect the rights of other people. Rights protection against force and fraud constituted the primary purpose of government. Herbert, aptly describing Voluntaryism as the system of liberty, peace and friendliness, applied these principles to a range of situations from street maintenance, to collective property purchase, and, finally, to the voluntary support of the state. Voluntary taxation was the most controversial component of Herbert&#8217;s theory, emphasising its distinctiveness. Although Herbert resisted socialist and new liberal attempts to expand the role of the state, his reasons for doing so shared little in common with conservative critics of this direction. Herbert, a republican and democrat, repeatedly attacked privilege, seeking widespread change including land reform and universal suffrage. His position represented that of a radical reformer seeking to promote Voluntaryism as the basis for friendly co-operation among free individuals at home and abroad. An internationalist, Herbert opposed aggressive imperialism, but also supported national self-determination, including Irish Home Rule. The notion of the voluntary state has led to claims of Herbert&#8217;s anarchism, but research indicates a greater complexity to his political ideas. Overall, Herbert was an extreme libertarian who never completely lost sight of the state, although he greatly limited its role. While Herbert&#8217;s political theory was idealistic, it avoided the social prescription usually associated with utopianism. Herbert&#8217;s commitment to an ethos of radical progressivism was one he shared with other contemporary socialist and anarchist thinkers who, like Herbert, attempted to live the politics they espoused. For his political philosophy and activism, Herbert warrants acknowledgement as one of the most prominent English libertarians of the nineteenth century.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Co-Operation; Individual freedom; Individual rights; Individualism; Libertarianism; Liberty; Natural rights;</field><field name="subject">Voluntary taxation; Voluntaryism</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360100 Political Science::360104 Political theory and political philosophy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1908</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Veiled threats? Islam, headscarves and religious freedom in America and France</field><field name="creator">Salton, Herman</field><field name="description">For a variety of historical, cultural and political reasons, the Islamic headscarf has become an increasingly controversial matter in Europe. This is particularly the case in France, where the Parliament passed, in March 2004, a piece of legislation that prohibits students from wearing the Muslim veil&#8212;together with any other &#8216;conspicuous&#8217; religious sign&#8212;in the classroom. Although Statute 228/2004 proved highly controversial and attracted unprecedented media attention, it was overwhelmingly supported by French MPs as a response to popular opposition towards religious insignia at school and was heralded as a &#8216;liberating&#8217; piece of legislation that faithfully reasserted the beloved French principle of la&#239;cit&#233;. Overseas, the new law was less favourably perceived and was often accused of being discriminatory and of violating the students&#8217; freedom of religious expression. This thesis compares the French and American attitudes towards religious symbolism in general and the Islamic veil in particular. As in other matters, at first sight these two countries seem to adopt a very different&#8212;if not opposite&#8212;approach to religion and the Muslim veil, and so much so that their positions are often described as &#8216;irreconcilable&#8217;.  This thesis will argue that this is hardly the case. Indeed, it will show that, at least before the passage of Statute 228-2004, the French and American legal systems adopted a substantially similar approach that appeared respectful of a veiled student&#8217;s right to wear religious insignia. This, the work will also suggest, is not surprising, for contrary to popular belief, the American conception of secularism is in many respects stricter than the French idea of la&#239;cit&#233;, with the result that French &#8216;exceptionalism&#8217; on matters of religion is hardly a convincing ground for justifying the new piece of legislation. The fundamental value of a Franco-American comparison, this work will suggest, ultimately lies with the fact that such a comparison demolishes a good portion of the popular myths surrounding the affaire des foulards: that the French legal system is fiercely secular; that the American one is strongly &#8216;religious&#8217;; and that France was, in 2004, confronted with a veritable &#8216;veil emergency&#8217; that rendered the passage of the new statute all but inevitable.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">islam, religion, religious freedom, US first amendment, free exercise clause, french constitutional law, french religious history, american religious history, religious garb, religious clothing</field><field name="subject">islamic headscarf, muslim veil, france, america, conseil d'etat, religious discrimination, statute 228/2004, french law on religious signs at school</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::390000 Law, Justice and Law Enforcement::390100 Law</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2317</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The institutionalisation of data quality in the New Zealand health sector</field><field name="creator">Kerr, Karolyn</field><field name="description">This research began a journey towards improved maturity around data quality management in New Zealand health care, where total data quality management is 'business as usual" institutionalised into the daily practices of all those who work in health care. The increasingly information intensive nature of health care demands a proactive and strategic approach to data quality to ensure the right information is available to the right person at the right time in the right format, all in consideration of the rights of the patient to have his/her health data protected and used in an ethical way. The work extends and tests principles to establish good practice and overcome practical barriers. This thesis explores the issues that define and control data quality in the national health data collections and the mechanisms and frameworks that can be developed to achieve and sustain good data quality. The research is interpretive, studying meaning within a social setting. The research provides the structure for learning and potential change through the utilisation of action research. Grounded theory provides the structure for the analysis of qualitative data through inductive coding and constant comparison in the analysis phase of the action research iterative cycle. Participatory observation provided considerable rich data as the researcher was a member of staff within the organisation. Data were also collected at workshops, focus groups, structured meetings and interviews. The development of a Data Quality Evaluation Framework and a national Data quality Improvement Strategy provides clear direction for a holistic and 'whole of health sector' way of viewing data quality, with the ability for organisations to develop and implement local innovations through locally developed strategies and data quality improvement programmes. The researcher utilised the theory of appreciative enquiry (Fry, 2002) to positively encourage change, and to encourage the utilisation of existing organisational knowledge. Simple rules, such as the TDQM process and the data quality dimensions guided the change, leaving room for innovation. The theory of 'complex systems of adjustment' (Champagne, 2002; Stacey, 1993) can be instilled in the organisation to encourage change through the constant interaction of people throughout the organisation.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321215 Health care administration</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1899</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ecological parasitology of the Polynesian rat (Rattus exulans) on Tiritiri Matangi Island</field><field name="creator">Roberts, Mere</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a descriptive and a functional analysis of the ecology of an island host-parasite system consisting of the Polynesian rat, Rattus exulans (Peale) and its gut helminths. The results, which include an historical perspective, are presented in the form of 7 papers or sections. Each of these examines a particular aspect of this host-parasite relationship. A review of the origin and an update of the theorised dispersal of this rat from Southeast Asia to New Zealand is given in the first section of chapter one. Previous theories have derived the New Zealand populations from a line which passed through Micronesia. In accordance with new information from the Lapita cultural assemblage, this rat is now theorised to have accompanied these "Lapita" peoples through the Bismarck Archipelago and Solomon Islands, arriving in the Tonga- Samoa region about 3600-3000 Before Present (B.P.). From here, the Proto- Polynesians then dispersed further east, taking with them the commensal R. exulans, pig, dog, and chicken. This rat is thus thought to have arrived in New Zealand, the most southern and last-settled landmass in Polynesia, in the canoes of the Maori about 1000 years ago. Information on the ecto- and endoparasites of the Polynesian rat from throughout its geographical range is collated and presented in section two. This includes the results of the two surveys (one being part of this thesis) done on the parasites of this rat in New Zealand. All populations of R. exulans sampled in these two surveys came from offshore islands, to which this rat is almost totally confined, and where, on many, it is the only rodent species present. In contrast, most of the populations sampled beyond New Zealand are now sympatric with other rodent species. For the New Zealand populations only, it was also possible to identify those parasites only accidentally associated with this host; these are listed as "transients". In section three, an attempt is made to determine the probable biogeographical origins of parasites recorded from populations of this rat on "exulans only" offshore islands of New Zealand. Such a study was possible only because of the archaeologically documented commensal relationship between rat and Polynesian man. This information, detailed in section one, together with the parasitological data base assembled in section two, provided the material for this analysis. Several "heirloom" species are identified, theorised to have been inherited by this rat during speciation somewhere in Island Southeast Asia. Parasites acquired during dispersal are divided into "old" and "new souvenirs"; the former are thought to have been acquired from sympatric rodent species in Near Oceania sometime prior to 3000 B.P., and the latter from R. rattus, R. norvegicus or Mus musculus introduced in the last 200 years during European settlement in New Zealand. The conclusions further suggest that some at least of the "new souvenir" species have been acquired by R. exulans on "exulans only" offshore islands of New Zealand by cross-transfer from other rodent species which have temporarily gained access to these islands. This theory is examined in more detail in the fourth section, and reports of such accidental colonizations of offshore islands are presented as supporting evidence. In Chapter two, the influence of habitat on the population demography of the host is investigated. Nearly 1000 rats were trapped and necropsied over a 17 month period in three different habitats on Tiritiri Matangi, an "exulans only" island at the entrance to the Auckland harbour. Rank grassland which covers most of this island formed one habitat; a second consisted of forest remnants confined to gullies, and the third consisted of the small, inhabitated, lighthouse station and farmed area at one end of the island. Between-habitat differences were observed in diet, adult longevity, mean weight of immatures, the time of onset of sexual maturation, and annual reproductive output. These results suggested several modifications to existing models of this host's demography in New Zealand. Shelter in particular appears to play an important role in the demography of this species in temperate latitudes. The effects of parasitism on potential fitness parameters e.g. reproduction, and adult mortality/survival, are examined in chapter three. Based on the results obtained in chapter two, a number of hypotheses were developed, and the predictions arising from these were tested. Few significant results were obtained; these revealed habitat and some sexual interactions with the level of infection, at certain times of the year. However, no causal relationship could be established between these effects and host reproduction or mortality. It is concluded that the helminth parasites of this rat on this island have little or no effect on these host parameters, and support the suggestion that these species constitute a depauperate and well-adapted rodent parasite fauna. The last chapter presents the results of an analysis of the effects of habitat, season, host age, and sex on the distribution and abundance of the helminths of this rat on this island. Together, the graphs and the statistical analyses demonstrate that habitat has the most important influence, significantly affecting all 7 species; this effect is of greater magnitude than the other 3 variables on 5/7 of these species. Season and age also have important effects, while sex had no apparent influence. Explanations for the observed patterns are sought in known aspects of the biology of the host in the three habitats described in chapter two, and in the life cycles of the parasites. In total, this thesis provides a comprehensive account of the ecology of the Polynesian rat and its helminth parasites on Tiritiri Matangi Island. It also identifies gaps in the existing data base, formulates certain hypotheses, and makes a number of predictions all of which will hopefully stimulate further interest in this rat and its parasites.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1902</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Microstructure and properties of zinc oxide nano-crystalline thin films and composites</field><field name="creator">Lee, Jim, 1963-</field><field name="description">Zinc oxide (ZnO) is a II&#8211;VI compound semiconductor with a wide direct band-gap of 3.3 eV and a hexagonal structure. ZnO is often used in the paint, paper, rubber, food and drug industries. It is also a promising material in nanotechnology applications, for example in nano-electronics and nano-robotic technology. With its wide band-gap, high exciton binding energy and high breakdown strength, ZnO can be utilized for electronic and photonic devices, as well as for high-frequency applications. To produce such optoelectronic devices, control of electronic properties, such as the nature of conduction and carrier density, is required. However, such control has proved difficult for ZnO. Much research has been done to pursue p type ZnO using different processing techniques, however, there are few reports addressing the relationships of microstructure on optical and electrical properties, ion implantation doping of ZnO and nano-ZnO polymer composites. The objectives of this project are to study the processing, composition, microstructure, electronic, optical, UV and electromagnetic shielding properties of ZnO thin films and composites; to explore ion implantation as a method to dope Al, Ag, Sb, Sn and TiN into ZnO thin films or single crystals; to develop conducting, transparent oxide films and/or p-type semiconductor for potential device applications; and to study the relationships of doping, microstructure and electro-optical properties of ZnO thin films and nano-ZnO polymer composites. The experimental work included annealing, characterizing and implantation of magnetron sputtering ZnO thins films and ZnO single crystals. Ion implantation was employed to dope ZnO thin films or single crystals with Ti, N, Sb, Al, Sn and Ag. The diffusion behaviour of implanted and annealed ZnO and the ellipsometry of implanted ZnO thin films were investigated. The relationship of microstructure and properties of as-deposited, annealed and implanted ZnO was studied. The results show that compared to direct current (d.c.) sputtering, the films produced using radio frequency (r.f.) have significantly lower resistivity, porosity and stress. The residual stress can change the band gap of ZnO thin films. Conductivity experiments suggest that the conduction mechanism of sputtered ZnO thin films involves charge transport in the conduction band and electronic hopping between the nearest neighbour donor levels. Furthermore, the optical transmission of ZnO thin films is high in the visible, with excellent UV absorption properties. It is also found that annealing alters the grain size and composition, and reduces the stress of ZnO thin films. Moreover, ion implantation causes partial amorphousness of ZnO films in the implantation zone and introduces stress and interstitial dopants. Transport of Ions in Matter (TRIM) modelling and Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometer (SIMS) analysis confirm that lighter elements implant deeper than heavy elements. The implanted ZnO shows some p type tendency and evidence of photoluminescence. Lastly, the nano-ZnO and polymer composites show excellent mechanical, good UV barrier properties.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290900 Electrical and Electronic Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2136</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New Zealand and the search for security 1944-1954: 'a modest and moderate collaboration'</field><field name="creator">Barrington, Brook</field><field name="description">In the decade which followed the Second World War, New Zealand foreign policy was preoccupied with issues of national security. The war had revealed not only that New Zealand could be threatened by Asian hostility, but also that British power could no longer be relied upon for protection. Successive New Zealand governments therefore looked for ways to reinforce the security of New Zealand. Their central objective was to seek a modest and moderate collaboration with key allies. As a result of this search for security, New Zealand foreign policy was transformed in the decade 1944-1954. Not only did politicians and officials engage in an ever-increasing round of international meetings and conferences, but the formal international obligations of the Dominion grew at a remarkable rate. New Zealand began the decade signing the Australian - New Zealand Agreement, and ended the decade a member of the South East Asia Collective Defence Treaty. In the intervening years the Dominion had become party to the ANZAM arrangement and the ANZUS treaty, and had joined the Colombo Plan. New Zealanders also played a not insignificant part in the formation and operation of the United Nations, the occupation of Japan, the Japanese peace treaty, and the Korean war. This rapid growth in the complexity of New Zealand foreign policy sprang from two sources. The first was the policy of collaboration, which involved the Dominion in a range of international activities at which New Zealand leaders would have balked had they not been in the company of key allies. The second source was a sense of institutional confidence and growing expertise. New Zealand officials and politicians had learned diplomatic skills and acquired international recognition during the Second World War, and the creation of the Department of External Affairs in 1943 meant that Dominion had both the experience and the machinery to take a much wider interest in world affairs. By 1954, links with the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth, although cherished and still very important, were no longer predominant. New Zealand's main strategic commitment remained in the Middle East, but the shifting frontiers of the cold war and the prospect of regional rather than global conflict had forced New Zealand policymakers to take greater account of events in the Pacific. This was reinforced by New Zealand's traditional policy of collaboration: both the United Kingdom and the United States had also become more involved in Pacific affairs. And as the focus of New Zealand foreign policy shifted increasingly to the Pacific region, so the relative importance of the United States as an ally increased. But New Zealand's interests remained world-wide, and this was reflected in the policy of collaboration. There was never any question of reducing links with the United Kingdom and Europe in favour of those with the United States and the Pacific. Instead, in what was sometimes to prove a delicate balancing act, New Zealand policymakers looked to accommodate both old allies and new as they adapted to the succession of the United States to Britain's position of pre-eminent world power.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1909</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Distributional relationships among subtidal algae, sea urchins and reef fish in northeastern New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Cole, Russell Gavin</field><field name="description">Interactions among large brown macroalgae, sea urchins, and fishes were investigated in northeastern New Zealand during the period 1988 - 1993. The Cape Rodney to Okakari Point Marine Reserve was the site of many of these investigations. The patterns of abundance of large brown macroalgae and urchins down depth gradients over a wide geographic range were compared with those reported from earlier studies, and 3 major trends were identified. First, the fucoid alga Carpophyllum flexuosum now occurs at many sites which are exposed to wave action, in contrast to earlier studies. This alga occurred most abundantly on urchin-grazed coralline flat areas. Second, at four sites in the Marine Reserve, the densities of the echinometrid urchin Evechinus chloroticus decreased with increasing depth, rather than reaching maximal densities at mid-depths, as had previously been described. Finally, at sites of decreased exposure to wave action, the coralline flats habitat did not occur at all, and dense stands of. C. flexuosum occurred, in conjunction with the ubiquitous laminarian alga, Ecklonia radiata. Following the discovery of this new algal component to exposed rocky reefs, a more detailed study of its population characteristics was initiated. The population size structure of C. flexuosum on coralline flat areas was markedly different from that of the same species in sites sheltered from wave action. These differences occurred at both offshore islands and sites near Leigh, suggesting that it was a general pattern. C. flexuosum plants on coralline flats were smaller than those from sheltered sites, and had a greater number of smaller laminae, heavier stipes, and a greater degree of branching. There was some evidence of temporal change in the morphology of C. flexuosum from coralline flats. Comparisons between a site with C. flexuosum and a site with coralline flats suggested that the activity of fish was 75% lower in the vegetated than in the unvegetated site, and the feeding rate in the vegetated site was less than 50% that in the unvegetated site. I speculate that future effects on fish activity of the invasion of C. flexuosum into a habitat which previously lacked macroalgal vegetation may depend on changes in the morphology of plants. An investigation of many aspects of the biology of E. chloroticus in different habitats was undertaken. Analysis of the body dimensions of E. chloroticus suggested that this species was relatively tall compared to other echinometrids (average ratio of test height: test diameter = 0.54), Comparisons among habitats with differing amounts of vegetation revealed only small differences in the relationship between test diameter and test height. Small E. chloroticus (&lt;40 mm test diameter) lived in crevices, while larger individuals grazed freely over the substratum. In vegetated habitats, the crevice-dwelling habit was maintained at test diameters about l0 mm greater than in unvegetated habitats. Very small (&lt;20 mm test diameter) E. chloroticus frequently covered themselves with shell. Population size structures of E. chloroticus within the Cape Rodney to Okakari Point Marine Reserve were bimodal; other localities had unimodal populations. Modal sizes varied among localities, with smallest modes (50-60 mm TD) being found at Inner Hauraki Gulf sites, and largest modes at the offshore Mokohinau Islands (70-80 mm TD). Habitat did not predictably affect population size structure. A bimodal population structure was maintained at Waterfall Reef rock flats throughout the 5-year study period. Gonad size showed seasonal fluctuations at several sites, being greatest in summer. There were few consistent differences in gonad size between biological habitats. Gonad colour varied among sites and habitats, with orange gonads generally being more prevalent in vegetated habitats, and black gonads being represented more in unvegetated habitats. Smaller urchins had greater proportions of orange gonads, while larger urchins had greater proportions of brown and black gonads. Although highly variable among individual urchins, movement of E. chloroticus was greater at unvegetated sites (0.7 m per 5 days) than at vegetated sites (0.4 m per 5 days), in the Marine Reserve. Feeding of E. chloroticus was studied at a number of sites in the Marine Reserve. Urchins frequently consumed drift algae, particularly E. radiata. C. flexuosum was consumed at less than half the rate of other macroalgae in several laboratory feeding experiments, and was chosen least frequently in a field assay of feeding preferences among 8 species of macroalgae. Boosting densities of E. chloroticus in stands of E. radiata to 60 m-2 led to destructive grazing of plants over a 2 month period - at lower densities, the urchins dispersed. Densities of C. flexuosum were effectively unchanged when urchin densities were increased to these elevated levels. As a result of these observations I speculate that feeding preferences of E. chloroticus may have a role in allowing C. flexuosum to survive on coralline flats. In a laboratory experiment, urchins from a feeding aggregation did not graze algae at higher rates than individuals from outside aggregations. Diets of both E. radiata and C. flexuosum consistently produced similar gonad volumes in urchins held in the laboratory, although gonad volumes produced were low. A preliminary experiment suggested that C. flexuosum from exposed sites was consumed at lower rates than C. flexuosum from sites which were sheltered from wave action. These differences in palatability are mirrored in the formation of stable borders between coralline flats and C. flexuosum of the sheltered morphology, and the ability of C. flexuosum of the exposed morphology to survive in the coralline flats habitat. The fish fauna of the Cape Rodney to Okakari Point Marine Reserve was shown to be different from that of a nearby area. A number of species were more abundant within the Marine Reserve. Subsequent surveys showed that there were differences in abundances of 3 large carnivorous fishes among sites within the Marine Reserve, and that population size structure and the distance within which divers could approach one species, (Pagrus auratus), clearly varied between areas within the Marine Reserve. Mean standard length of P. auratus in the central marine reserve was 40% larger than that of P. auratus outside the central marine reserve, and the average minimum approach distance was 70% less in the central marine reserve. Feeding of fish by humans in the central part of the Marine Reserve was suggested to be the main cause of the differences in responses to divers. Population size structure of, and crevice occupancy by, E. chloroticus, clearly differed between the Marine Reserve and an adjacent area, with bimodal population size structures and a 10 mm greater size of crevice occupancy occurring in the Marine Reserve. The implications of these findings for extrapolating from experiments done in one area to other areas are discussed. The major biological components of rocky reef habitats identified in this study were broadly similar to those identified in previous studies in northeastern New Zealand, and have parallels in overseas studies. Long term changes to the flora of rocky reefs in northeastern New Zealand have occurred, and appear to persist by a mechanism which had previously been discounted. Similar processes to those observed in overseas studies appear to maintain habitats (consistent recruitment of algae or urchins to habitats which they dominate), or cause them to change from one habitat state to another (e.g. grazing outbreaks by urchins). However, the predictability of the persistence of these habitats at a particular site appears to be low. Further, the precise mechanisms whereby habitats may change from one to another may also be unpredictable. I argue that there is little scope for general statements concerning the spatial and temporal occurrence, or mode, of habitat transitions on temperate subtidal reefs. This study emphasises the value of repeated descriptions of patterns of abundance, and highlights problems of extrapolation and generalisation in marine ecology. Insufficient information exists at present to comment adequately on the persistence of subtidal habitat types. This may in part stem from the types of information which have been collected in the past. Methodological problems with the use of quadrats to sample densities of organisms in areas of differing topography are therefore addressed. In conclusion, it is suggested that sampling protocols which incorporate a variety of information, gathered over as wide an area, and as intensively as possible, should be used in future research of this type.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1912</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Adolescent Mother and her Child: Determinants of Maternal Parenting Behaviour and Infant Development</field><field name="creator">Dixon, Robyn S.</field><field name="description">Despite having the second highest teenage pregnancy rate in the developed world, there has been an absence of New Zealand research investigating outcomes for the adolescent mother and her child The present study was designed as a first step toward redressing this situation. The aim of the study was twofold, to provide a descriptive profile of a sample of New Zealand women giving birth to their first child during adolescence, the primary aim being to identify psychosocial variables associated with maternal parenting behaviour and infant cognitive, motor and social development. One hundred and twenty, first time mothers aged between 15 years 6 months and 19 years and 9 months were interviewed in the post natal wards of Waitakere Maternity Unit in West Auckland. In addition to gathering extensive demographic data, measures of mothers' social support system, perceived stress, locus of control and knowledge of child development were taken. The second phase took place in the homes of the 80 subjects who were successfully located and agreed to further participate in the study. Again as part of this interview, demographic data were collected and, in addition to repeating the measures of social support and perceived stress, mother's satisfaction with her role as a parent was measured. Infant development was assessed using Bayley Scales of Infant Development. Finally, a 10 minute videotape was made of mother-infant interaction. During this time mothers were asked to change the infant's nappy, and then to play with their baby using a selection of age appropriate toys provided by the researcher. Following analysis of the descriptive variables, multiple regression analysis was used to identify variables associated with maternal parenting behaviour and infant outcomes. This resulted in the development of a model of adolescent parenting which suggests that social support, particularly the size of a mother's supportive network and the availability of emotional support, has a direct effect on maternal psychological status, which in turn impacts on maternal parenting behaviours. A mother's satisfaction with parenting being especially important. As expected maternal parenting behaviour is associated with infant interaction behaviour. Moreover, social support and maternal psychological status both had a direct impact on infant mental development scores. Furthermore, the results of the study have highlighted the importance of including measures of parenting satisfaction in models of adolescent parenting, a variable which up until now has been missing in research in this area. Finally, the implications of the findings for education and health professionals, and policy makers, concerned with the well being of these young women and their children are highlighted, and directions for further research identified.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1914</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Automata-Theoretic Models for Computational Complementarity</field><field name="creator">Calude, Elena</field><field name="description">The purpose of this Thesis is to study, from the mathematical point of view, a new type of questions about finite automata, questions motivated by looking at automata as toy models of physical particles. Working along the line of research initiated by Moore, two computational complementarity principles are studied, (for finite-deterministic, complete or incomplete, nondeterministic-automata with outputs but no initial states) both theoretically and experimentally; they mimic the physical complementarity and the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen effect. Automata are studied via simulations (informally, the automaton A is simulated by the automaton B if B can perform all computations A can execute and produces the same outputs; two automata are equivalent in case they simulate each other). A new type of minimization problem will be solved and the solution is proved to be unique up to an isomorphism; the minimal automaton equivalent to a given automaton can be constructed only in terms of outputs for deterministic complete or incomplete automata, but one needs the whole internal machinery for nondeterministic automata. It happens that minimal automata are exactly the automata which may feature computational complementarity. Even if the original motivation will remain only metaphorical, the physical motivation was good to suggest new definitions and constructions (simulation, universality, complementarity) leading to new mathematical results (existence of universal finite automaton, solving in a new way the minimalization problem for nondeterministic automata).</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1915</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biochemical and Molecular characterisation of Trichoderma species.</field><field name="creator">Dodd-Wilson, Sarah Louise</field><field name="description">The growing importance of many Trichoderma strains as biological control agents and producers of valuable metabolites and enzymes has made their distinction from other Trichoderma isolates essential. However, the use of morphological and cultural characters alone to differentiate individuals within the genus Trichoderma to a level that is most informative has proved difficult due to a lack of reliable characters. In this study, alternative biochemical and molecular techniques were assessed for their ability to differentiate between isolates of the genus Trichoderma. Fifty isolates representing the Trichoderma species T. atroviride, T. hamatum, T. inhamatum, T. koningii, T. virens, T. viride and five morphological sub-groupings of the T. harzianum species were examined. ITS sequence data, RAPD PCR and the ability of an isolate to produce the metabolite 6-pentyl-&#945;-pyrone (PAP) were all used to differentiate between morphologically indistinguishable isolates. Altogether four levels of variation were recognised. The greatest level of resolution was achieved with the RAPD PCR technique, followed by both morphological characters and sequence data from the ITSI region of the ribosomal gene complex. Sequence data from the ITS2 region provided the third level of resolution. The fourth level of resolution was achieved with both sequence data from the second variable region (D2) of the 28S-like ribosomal gene and determination of an isolate's ability to produce the metabolite PAP. Based on these results, it was proposed that a new taxonomic system be established in which individuals of the genus Trichoderma are distinguished by a combination of morphological, cultural. biochemical and molecular characters. Sequence data and RAPD PCR data were also tested for their reliability in estimating the phylogeny of Trichoderma. Sequence data from the ITSI region proved to be the most reliable for predicting the phylogeny of morphologically defined species, whereas RAPD data was most useful for predicting the unrooted phylogeny of strains of morphologically identical isolates (i.e. isolates with less than 10% nucleotide divergence). None of the data employed in the present study were able to resolve all the species tested. It was concluded that additional sequence from a more variable region would be required to achieve this. In addition to the characterisation and phylogenetic studies, two approaches were undertaken in an attempt to isolate a gene(s) vital to the production of the antifungal metabolite PAP, a metabolite believed to be important in the biological control activity of a number of the isolates under investigation. Both attempts were unsuccessful and additional studies undertaken to determine how important PAP is in the biological control activity of Trichoderma isolates were inconclusive. Nevertheless, a natural PAP deficient mutant was identified among the 50 isolates under investigation. Furthermore, synthetic PAP was found to inhibit the infection of lentil seedlings by Sclerotium rolfsii when 10 mg was added to a pot containing six seedlings and three viable sclerotia of the pathogen. The metabolite did not appear to have any detrimental effects on the growth and development of the seedlings.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1916</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Paraplegic Bodies: Self and Society</field><field name="creator">Sullivan, Martin Joseph</field><field name="description">In this dissertation it is argued that humans constitute themselves as subjects in a complex of interrelationships between body, self, and society, The effects of these interrelationships are examined through the ways in which traumatic paraplegics constitute themselves as subjects following their accidents.

Knowledge transfer costs are higher when decisions must be made on the basis of idiosyncratic knowledge scientific knowledge or assembled knowledge. Control costs are higher when there is a greater need for top management to coordinate the decisions of managers lower in the organisation. Decentralisation is more likely to take place when knowledge transter costs are high and control costs are low. Christie et al. (1993) find evidence(in the private sector) consistent with these predictions. This thesis suggests that knowledget transfer costs and control costs have a similar effect on public sector decision rights. This is evident through greater accountability. Knowledge transfer costs in the public sector are similar to those in the private sector. Control costs also have an effect in the public sector, and are higher when there is greater political visibility. There is a greater need for top decision-makers to coordinate decisions about issues that have high political visibility, and therefore less decentralisation in these circumstances.I hypothesise that the presence of high knowledge transfer costs and low political visibility in the New Zealand public sector leads to decentralisation and is associated with the use of audited financial statements. The evidence is consistent with my predictions and is robust to alternative ways of measuring explanatory variables.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1918</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dealing with dilemmas: a critical and collaborative approach to staff appraisal in two schools</field><field name="creator">Cardno, Carol E.M.</field><field name="description">central intent of 'Tomorrow's Schools' reforms in New Zealand was to make schools more accountable for improving the quality of teaching by devolving responsibility for staff appraisal to principals. The researcher sought to discover what kind of dilemmas arose for two principals in the context of implementing staff appraisal policy and how their theories of practice constrained their ability to resolve complex problems. Further questions were asked about how viable it would be to mount a critical and collaborative intervention to alter practice, how the impact of the intervention could be evaluated, and what the implications of this research might be for training principals. The research shows that appraisal activity poses leadership dilemmas arising out of tensions between concern to meet organisational goals and concern for relationships among individuals. The principals responded by suppressing these dilemmas and avoiding threat with consequent ineffectiveness in the resolution of problems. Intervention within a framework of action research involved teaching the participants how to discover, critique and alter the values and beliefs which governed the defensive strategies that were counterproductive to their intentions to be open and inclusive. The result of the intervention was that the schools developed appraisal policies that disclosed purposes related to both accountability and staff development. At the Interpersonal level the principals' attempts to counter unilaterally controlling and protective tendencies in their behaviour were blocked whilst in dialogue with others by their inability to articulate the conflict in values which was at the source of their appraisal dilemmas. The research illustrates the complexity and challenges inherent in learning the theoretical and practical curriculum in order to recognise conflict, respond to it, and develop critical dialogue skills. The research concludes that training programmes for school leaders should accord significance to the expectations held of principals to perform a dual role as evaluators and developers of staff. A problem-based, interventionist form of training is recommended. Such training should focus on developing competence in critical and collaborative approaches for dealing with appraisal dilemmas.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1920</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hypermedia Support for University Activities</field><field name="creator">Schneider, Achim</field><field name="description">Hypermedia has become one of the most dynamically developing and widely pursued fields of computer science. The range of applications of hypermedia systems - in many academic and non-academic areas - is continually growing. This thesis addresses hypermedia support for university activities. During the last few years. many universities have started to build up a large campus-wide information system (CWIS) based or a networked hypermedia system connected to the Internet. In this thesis a more advanced form of CWIS, the so-called University Transaction, Information, and Communication System (UTICS) is introduced. UTICS is based on the distributed hypermedia system Hyper-G and additional stand-alone hypermedia systems. UTICS was designed to serve as framework for a collection of research efforts, aiming at exploring advanced applications for hypermedia systems in universities. The research covered in this thesis includes the following areas: (i) advanced hypermedia presentation systems for public relations exercises, including virtual walk/fly-throughs and interactive telewatching, (ii) automated preparation and updating of hypermedia documents, (iii) support for teaching, in particular the authoring and distribution of interactive courseware, (iv) publishing of electronic reference material, (v) hypermedia support for the organization of conferences, and (vi) future evolution of large-scale hypermedia systems.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1922</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Second language writing from sources: an ethnographic study of an argument essay task</field><field name="creator">Wolfersberger, Mark Andrew</field><field name="description">Writing from sources is a common academic task for L2 students in higher education. It is a task that requires the orchestration of numerous skills such as reading source texts, incorporating information from the source texts within the written text, and reading the rhetorical context to interpret the task. Being such a complex activity, it has received relatively little attention. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the complexity of a writing-from-sources task within an L2 environment.  Using an ethnographic design, I examined the writing of four Chinese (L1) students with varying levels of English (L2) proficiency completing an argumentative writing-from-sources essay task for a required writing class. The task spanned two and a half weeks and required the participants to cite five sources within a 1500-word essay. Over the course of writing, I interviewed each participant several times about their writing process, observed the participants during class, and collected all notes, drafts, and reading materials.  The results revealed the complexity of the writing-from-sources task. Constructing a suitable cognitive representation of the task was one key to success and there were a number of personal and contextual factors that influenced the creation of the participants&#8217; task representations, factors such as individual background experiences, the writing process, and information from and interactions with the teacher and other people within the writing context. These factors varied in the strength of their influence from the beginning to the end of the essay assignment, and I present a tentative theory of task representation to explain the points at which these influencing factors had the greatest impact within the writing process.  Low L2 proficiency constrained the writing performance of some of the participants. This resulted in one participant avoiding elements of the writing task requirements in order to earn passing marks and two other participants producing plagiarized texts and receiving failing marks on the assignment. The two participants who plagiarized showed no ill intentions and, consequently, felt receiving zero marks for their writing efforts was unjust.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">second language writing</field><field name="subject">writing from sources</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2364</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of the mechanisms of chemical cleaning of milk protein fouling deposits using a model material (whey protein concentrate gel)</field><field name="creator">Xin, Hong</field><field name="description">It is crucial to understand the fundamental mechanisms of cleaning milk protein fouling to optimise Cleaning-in-place (CIP) process. Using Whey Protein Concentrate (WPC) gel as a model material and a rapid ultraviolet (UV) spectrophotometry, a comprehensive laboratory study on the cleaning of the WPC gel deposits from hard surface with alkaline cleaning solutions has been conducted. The kinetics of the cleaning process has been established and mathematical models have been developed in order to elucidate the influences of various parameters on cleaning process. This study has provided sound evidence that whey protein concentrate gel is a reliable simulation of the whey protein fouling deposits used in most milk protein fouling and cleaning studies. Based on treating denatured whey protein gels as biopolymers, a chemical reaction controlled polymer dissolution cleaning mechanism has been proposed. The polymer dissolution plays a major role of removing proteinaceous deposits when treated with alkaline solutions under the flow conditions tested. Similar to the diffusion of cleaning chemicals and chemical reactions, the reptation (induction) is also one of essential steps for the dissolution of WPC gels in alkaline solutions. The disengagement of intermediate reaction products (altered protein molecules) from a gel-solution interface and subsequent mass transfer of these reaction products to the bulk cleaning solutions are the rate-limiting steps for the cleaning process. The typical dissolution cleaning rate curve of WPC gels in alkaline solutions includes swelling, uniform and decay cleaning stages. This study on cleaning kinetics shows that increasing the cleaning temperature can improve the cleaning efficiency. The apparent activation energy for these three stages is 32.6, 40.5, and 38.3 kJ/mol, respectively, which is in agreement with previous research works. Increasing flow velocity enhances the cleaning process. However, this effect could be reduced when and the cleaning process gradually changes from a mass transfer-controlled process to a disengagement-controlled process, where the flow velocity is very high. The introduction of the hydrolysis, &#946;-elimination reactions and some competing chemical reactions have highlighted the complex of chemical reactions involved in cleaning of proteinaceous fouling using alkaline solutions. The changes in molecular mass distribution and SH content of WPC gel dissolved at various temperatures observed has confirmed the assumption that all these chemical reactions are temperature dependent. The investigation on the swelling, microstructural and mechanical properties of WPC gels treated with alkaline solutions also illustrates the concentration dependency of these chemical reactions. The mechanical property studies demonstrate that the chemical treatment could make WPC gel weaker and easier to be destroyed. However, the relationship between the mechanical properties and the cleaning process needs to be further studied. Based on the polymer dissolution and mass transfer theory, a mathematical model of chemical cleaning has been proposed. Various parameters, such as tr (reptation time), Rm, (constant cleaning rate), mc, (the critical mass), &#958; (rate constant in swelling stage), kA (rate constant in decay stage) and &#936; (a dimensionless parameter) have been used to characterise the whole cleaning process. Among the parameters used in the cleaning model, the constant cleaning rate (Rm) is the most important one and determines the overall efficiency of a cleaning process, which has been further predicted and expressed as a product of mass transfer coefficient and solubility of disengaged protein molecules. The successful model formulations for the cleaning rate and cleaning time under various operation conditions are a good outcome of the rational mechanisms proposed for the removal of proteinaceous fouling. This research has provided a good foundation for further fundamental research in this area and for optimising the cleaning processes.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290600 Chemical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1928</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Coronary flow mechanics: an anatomically based mathematical model of coronary blood flow coupled to cardiac contraction</field><field name="creator">Smith, Nicolas Peter</field><field name="description">Coronary blood flow through the ventricular contraction cycle has been investigated in this thesis using an anatomically accurate computational model. Using Strahler ordered morphological data and an avoidance algorithm a three dimensional finite element model has been constructed of the largest six generations of the coronary arterial network within an anatomically accurate finite element model of the left and right ventricles. Segment radii, lengths and connectivity are consistent with the literature, local network branch angles are consistent with the principle of minimum shear stress at bifurcations, and an even spatial distribution of vessel segments throughout the myocardium has been achieved. A finite difference collocation grid has been generated on the coronary finite element mesh. The Navier Stokes equations governing blood flow through elastic vessels have been reduced to one dimension and are solved on this finite difference grid using the two step Lax Wendroff method. Blood flows at bifurcations are calculated using an iterative method ensuring conservation of mass and momentum. The microcirculation networks are modelled using a lumped parameter model incorporating the nonlinear variation of resistance and compliance with pressure by fitting results from published anatomical data. The venous network is assumed to parallel the generated arterial model. The calculated blood flow through the network model demonstrates physiological pressure drops, flow rates and a regional distribution within the ventricular geometry consistent with experimental data. The intramyocardial pressure (IMP) exerted on the coronary vasculature during contraction is calculated from quasi-static solutions of the equations of finite deformation applied to the ventricular model with a nonlinear anisotropic constitutive law. IMP is found to vary approximately linearly between ventricular pressure at the endocardium and atmospheric pressure at the epicardium. IMP and vessel stretch are included in the transmural pressure radius relationship to model the effect of myocardial deformation on coronary flow. The calculated coronary blood flow through the contraction cycle shows that arterial flow is predominantly diastolic while venous flow is significantly increased during systole. Calculated time varying velocity profiles in the large epicardial vessels compare well with published experimental results. Regionally averaged velocities in small vessels show that arterial inflow is most significantly impeded at the left ventricular endocardium. Furthermore, the large time constant associated with the capillary and venule networks limits the filling of these vessels during diastole particularly at the endocardium. An increase in heart rate, modelled by reducing the time for diastole causes an increase in small vessel epicardial blood flow and a decrease in blood flow through small vessels within the myocardium. The decrease in flow is most pronounced at the left ventricular endocardium.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291500 Biomedical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1949</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Deep hydrology of the geothermal systems in the Taupo Volcanic Zone, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Kissling, Warwick M.</field><field name="description">This thesis is a study of the large scale flows of water and heat which give rise to the geothermal fields in the Taupo Volcanic Zone (TVZ), New Zealand. To carry out this study, a super-critical equation of state module has been developed for the geothermal simulator TOUGH2, which can describe the flow of water at the conditions expected deep in the TVZ. The code is used to simulate the behaviour of a range of idealised TVZ models in 2D and 3D settings. Hydrothermal plumes which remain stable for periods comparable to the lifetime of the TVZ can occur when there is a contrast between the high permeability of the inner TVZ 'infill' region and the lower permeability exterior region. In this case, downflows of cool surface fluid in the inner TVZ 'sweep' the geothermal heat across the TVZ at depth to the permeability barrier, where the heated fluid ascends to the surface in discrete plumes. This behaviour occurs in 2D models, where separate plumes form at each side of the high permeability infill region, and also in 3D models of caldera-like structures, where perhaps four hot plumes can form around the perimeter of the caldera. This notion is then applied to the complete TVZ hydrological system, where a permeable &#8216;envelope&#8217; is defined by the location of the Taupo Fault Belt and the currently known volcanic centres in the TVZ. The permeability within this envelope varies spatially according to the geothermal heat flux, and the region outside has relatively low permeability. The spatial variation of the geothermal heat flux is obtained by summing the measured heat flows from the geothermal fields for a number of areas across the TVZ. In this model, the geothermal fields form about the boundary of the envelope, as in the TVZ, and bear a striking resemblance to the actual TVZ geothermal fields. Finally, a new simulation code, NaCl-TOUGH2, is developed to provide a tool for future modelling involving the commonest chemical species in the TVZ - salt. The code incorporates the complete phase diagram for salt-water mixtures and involves liquid, vapour and solid phases over a wide range of temperatures, pressures and salt concentrations. The code is used to solve a number of simple geothermal and mathematical problems.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1951</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structural studies of the fibrillar architecture of normal and softened bovine articular cartilage</field><field name="creator">Chen, Min-Huey</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291400 Materials Engineering::291499 Materials engineering not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1938</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The De Saint-Venant equations in curved channels</field><field name="creator">Nalder, Guinevere Vivianne</field><field name="description">After introducing the subject of curvilinear flow, particularly in the context of meandering natural channels, this thesis then describes the three conventional models for unsteady flow in open channels, namely kinematic, diffusion and dynamic. These descriptions are in terms of the straight channel de Saint-Venant equations. The discussion also considers some aspects of the diffusion model which raise questions as to the appropriateness of the usual engineering approach to this model. As to date, these models treat curvature cursorily, if at all, the models are then expanded to incorporate curvature in a more systematic manner. This is done by deriving the de Saint-Venant equations in terms of curvilinear coordinates. The models are then presented in terms of the curvilinear mass-conservation and various forms of the curvilinear momentum equation. The new models are found to be expressed by equations of the form 'linear model + curvilinear correction' thus allowing the engineer to estimate the size of any curvature effect. The derived dynamic model is compared with a laboratory study, and the results indicate that the new curvilinear model is a reasonable description of dam-break flow. Subsequent calculations, based on field data, of the celerity of the dynamic wave illustrate how big the corrections can be.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290800 Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1936</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Artificial intelligence in a hybrid system with an industrial application</field><field name="creator">Cammell, Geoffrey Martin</field><field name="description">This dissertation introduces the Artificial Computer Expert (ACE), a system designed to assist non-computer skilled personnel utilise complex computer software through the use of artificial intelligence in the creation, selection and execution of programs.

A review of the existing literature is presented along with an analysis of the strengths and limitations of various attempted solutions. The diversity of model evident in recent papers is noted. The difference is explained between a strategic model that sets long-term harvesting goals in terms of total area to be cut each year, and a tactical model that produces a short-term schedule of actual blocks. Special attention is devoted to the development of FRI&#8217;s Forestry-Oriented Linear Programming Interpreter, FOLPI, which is currently used to formulate an LP model of the strategic planning problem. Reasons are presented for the desirability of an integrated model, embracing both strategic and tactical decisions, which is capable of optimisation. Accordingly the project then proceeds to a thoughtful and detailed construction of such a model. Particular care is taken to examine the status and function of FOLPI within this model. A column generation algorithm is then developed to solve the relaxed linear program formulation. Finally powerful constraint branching techniques are utilised to obtain the desired optimal solution to the integrated model.

Continuous turning of round composite bars, using polycrystalline diamond (PCD) inserts has been selected as the test method. The test conditions included cutting speeds varying from 75 to 700m/min and feed rates from 0.1 to 0.4 mm/rev with constant depth of cut of 0.5 mm. The main wear mechanism of machining these Al MMC materials is abrasion by the reinforcing particles and the primary type of tool wear is flank wear. Linear regression techniques has been used to derive Taylor equations to describe the tool performance. The results show that the time required to reach the tool wear limit decreases with increased speed and feed rate. However, the volume of material removed before reaching the wear limit actually increases with the higher feed rate. This apparent anomaly has been reconciled in a modified Taylor equation. As for surface finish, the feed rate is found to be a more dominant factor than cutting speed. The higher the feed rate is, the worse the surface finish becomes. The surface finish is found to improve with tool wear at early stage because of the increase of tool nose radius; after that it starts deteriorating as a consequence of excessive tool wear. The change of feed rate is also more influential on the variation of machining forces than that of cutting speed. Using the same regression techniques, the general machining force-tool wear equations are derived. The results show that the equation derived from the feed force is better suited to monitor tool wear than that derived from the cutting force. The general relationship between tool wear and power consumption has also been established. The chip forming mechanism while machining DURALCANTM MMC has also been studied by using an explosive charged "quick-stop" device. The primary chip forming mechanism involves the initiation of cracks due to the high shear stress, followed by the decohesion of particles and matrix material within the chip due to the stress concentration on the edge of the particles. The crack propagation is enhanced through the microvoid coalescence within matrix material. The fracture and the sliding of material then follow to form semi-continuous "saw-toothed" chips.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1959</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Methods and techniques for parameter and distribution function estimation in cascaded digital channels with and without memory</field><field name="creator">Berber, Stevan M.,1950-</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290900 Electrical and Electronic Engineering::290901 Electrical engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1958</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantitative near-infrared imaging spectroscopy of fruit</field><field name="creator">Martinsen, Paul</field><field name="description">In this work the development and construction of a new near-infrared imaging spectrometer utilising inexpensive components is presented. The instrument is applied to measuring the distribution of constituents in fruit, in particular, soluble solids and dry matter in kiwifruit. The spectrometer, designed for collecting spectral-images of fruit, uses a diffraction grating for spectral dispersion, a scanning slit system for spatial resolution and a CCD detector to allow images of samples to be examined in different wavebands. The system described has a spectral range of 650 nm to 1100 nm at a resolution of better than 5 nm. Each spectral-image contains 150 x 242 pixels on the spatial plane and 755 pixels for the spectral ads. An interchangeable imaging lens enables investigation of samples at different scales. With a 58 mm camera lens objects up to 50 mm x 50 mm may be imaged at a spatial resolution of up to 2 line-pairs per millimetre (0.5 millimetre). One difficulty with calibration using spectral-images is that the independent measurements of concentration often come from areas much larger than a pixel. For spectral-imaging to be useful it is important that the calibration can estimate concentration at the pixel level. In effect this means estimates calculated using the model are more accurate than the independent measurements used in calibration. Using synthetic spectra and an investigation of the principal component regression algorithm, the ability of a calibration, from spectral-images, to estimate these pixel level concentrations has been demonstrated. To calibrate the instrument for measuring soluble solids concentration and dry matter content in kiwifruit, reflectance spectra from 650 nm to 1100 nm were collected from cut sections of 200 fruit. A near-infrared calibration was obtained by recording the soluble solids concentration and dry matter content of plugs extracted from thin slices of the fruit and relating these to the spectra collected. A prediction error of 1.2 &#176;Brix over a range of 4.7 - 14.1 &#176;Brix was achieved. It was not possible to obtain a useful model for estimating dry matter due to interference from specular reflections off free juice in the fruit. The models developed were used to show the spatial distribution of soluble solid concentrations over cut sections of fruit.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::299900 Other Engineering and Technology::299901 Agricultural engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1945</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation on diffuser augmented wind turbine design</field><field name="creator">Phillips, Derek Grant</field><field name="description">Diffuser Augmented Wind Turbines (DAWTs) are one of many concepts to have been proposed to reduce the cost of renewable energy. As the most commercially viable, they have been the focus of numerous theoretical, computational, and experimental investigations. Although intimated in these studies to be able to augment the power output of a wind turbine, the extent of this power increase, or augmentation, the factors influencing DAWT performance, the optimal geometric form and their economical benefit remained unanswered. It is these issues that have been addressed in this investigation. In reviewing historic investigations on DAWTs it has been identified that excessive wind tunnel blockage, inappropriate measurement technique, varied definitions of augmentation, and the inclusion of predicted performance based on incorrect assumptions have in general led to the overstatement of DAWT performance in those studies. In reassessing the performance of the most advanced of those DAWT designs, Grumman's DAWT 45, it has been calculated that the actual performance figures for the 2.62 exit-area-ratio and 0.488 length-to-diameter ratio DAWT were an available augmentation of 2.02, a shaft augmentation of 0.64 and a diffuser efficiency of 56%. By contrast, the development of the Mo multi-slotted DAWT in this investigation has yielded a design whose shaft augmentation of 1.38 was achieved by a diffuser with exit-area-ratio of only 2.22 and overall length-to-diameter ratio of 0.35. Such performance improvement has been obtained by gaining both an understanding of the flow characteristics of DAWTs and the geometric influences. More specifically it has been shown that: the velocity across the blade-plane is greater than the free-stream velocity and increases towards the rotor periphery; that the rotor thrust or disc loading impacts upon diffuser performance by altering the flow behaviour through it; and that DAWTs are able to maintain an exit pressure coefficient more negative than that attainable by a conventional bare turbine. The net result is that DAWTs encourage a greater overall mass-flow as well as extract more energy per unit of mass-flow passing through the blade-plane than a conventional bare turbine. The major drivers of DAWT performance have been shown to be the ability of the design to maximise diffuser efficiency and produce the most sub-atmospheric exit pressure possible. Parametric investigation of the various DAWT geometric components has shown peak performance to be obtained when: the external flow is directed radially outward by maximising the included angle of the external surface in conjunction with a radially orientated exit flap; by applying boundary-layer control to a trumpet shaped diffuser via a pressurised cavity within the double-skin design of the multi-slotted DAWT; having an exit-area-ratio of the order of 2.22; and by employing an inlet contraction with inlet-area-ratio matched to the mass-flow passing through the DAWT under peak operating conditions. To translate the available augmentation into shaft power a modified blade element method has been developed using an empirically-derived axial velocity equation. The resulting blade designs whose efficiencies reached 77%, twice those of Grumman, highlight the accuracy of the modified blade element method in calculating the flow conditions at the blade-plane of the multi-slotted DAWT. It was also noted that the rotor efficiencies remain below 'best practice' and therefore offer the potential for further increases in shaft augmentation. However, in order to achieve such gains, a number of limitations present in the current method must be addressed. In assessing the likely commercial suitability of the multi-slotted DAWT a number of real-world influences have been examined. Shown to have little if any effect on DAWT performance were Reynolds number, ground proximity and wind shear. Turbulence in the onset flow on the other hand had the beneficial effect of reducing separation within the diffuser. Finally, DAWT performance was assessed under yaw misalignment where it was shown that the multi-slotted DAWT performed favourably in comparison to that associated with a conventional bare turbine. The major drawback identified in the DAWT concept by this investigation was its drag loading and the fact that drag and augmentation were interdependent. The result is that the cost of a conventional DAWT is dictated by the necessity to withstand an extreme wind event despite the fact that augmentation is only required up to the rated wind speed. The overall conclusion drawn was that in order to optimise a DAWT design economically, and therefore make the DAWT concept a commercial reality, a creative solution that minimises drag under an extreme wind event would be required.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290500 Mechanical and Industrial Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1940</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bridge abutment scour countermeasures</field><field name="creator">Van Ballegooy, Sjoerd</field><field name="description">The use of riprap and cable-tied blocks as scour countermeasures at bridge abutments is investigated. Riprap is the most common armouring scour protection method used at bridge abutments and approach embankments. Despite the widespread use of riprap protection, the guidelines for its use at bridge abutments are based on limited research. The aim of the experimental study was to determine the requirements of riprap and cable-tied block apron countermeasures to protect bridge abutments from scour damage, and to produce design guidelines for their use. The two types of bridge abutments used in the experimental study were a spill-through abutment situated on the floodplain of a compound channel, and a wing-wall abutment sited at the edge of the main channel. The spill-through abutment experiments were run under clear-water conditions, and the variations in the scour hole geometry were measured for different abutment and compound channel geometries, apron widths and apron types. The wing-wall abutment experiments were run under live-bed conditions, and the settled apron geometries were measured for different flow depths, flow velocities, apron widths, apron types and apron placement levels. The flow fields around the abutments were also measured for both abutment types. The clear-water spill-through abutment results show that the protection aprons do not significantly reduce the scour depth at abutments, but instead deflect the scour hole further away from the abutment, protecting it from scour failure. The experiments also show that cable-tied block aprons allow the scour hole to form much closer to the abutment compared to equivalent riprap aprons. Equations were developed to predict the scour hole position and size, and the minimum apron extent required to prevent the scour hole from undermining the abutment. For the live-bed wing-wall abutment experiments, the troughs of the propagating bed-forms undermined the outer edges of the aprons, causing them to settle. Equations were developed to predict the settled apron geometry at the equilibrium scour conditions. The predicted scour hole depth and position for clear-water scour conditions, or the predicted apron settlement geometry for live-bed scour conditions can be used in a geotechnical stability analysis of the abutment. The geotechnical stability analysis forms the basis of the abutment scour countermeasure design procedure, which was developed from the experimental study. Further experimental work is required to increase the robustness of the bridge abutment scour countermeasure design procedure and make it applicable to a wider range of situations.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290800 Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1944</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nonlinear structural analysis using strut-and-tie models</field><field name="creator">To, Nicholas Hin Tai</field><field name="description">Increasing popularity of the strut-and-tie methodology among research communities and practising engineers is due to its rational analytical approach and its superiority, compared to the conventionally employed empirical methods for analysing disturbed regions in structural systems. Nevertheless, this analysis methodology is not used as a routine procedure in design offices, primarily because of the perceived ambiguity and complexity involved in appropriate model formulation. In addition, until recently application of the strut-and-tie methodology has been limited to the prediction of strength, with utilisation of this modelling technique to capture nonlinear structural deformation being rather minimal [ACI Bibliography (1997)]. The research project reported herein represents an original contribution to the development of the strut-and-tie methodology by providing a systematic approach for applying this modelling technique to nonlinear structural concrete analyses. The study proposes a orginally developed computer-based strut-and-tie model formulation procedure that permits prediction of the nonlinear monotonic and cyclic response of structural systems with distinct reinforcement details. The procedure being presented in this thesis is a refined version of that reported previously [To et al. (2001 &amp;.2002b)]and the accuracy of the analytical modelling is verified using experimental data. Several issues pertaining to model formulation are thoroughly investigated. These issues include the strategy of model formulation for Bernoulli (or beam) and disturbed regions of structural systems, the satisfactory positioning of model elements, the appropriate stress-strain material models for concrete and reinforcing steel, the suitable effective strength of model elements, the inclined angle of diagonal concrete struts in beam and column members, and the concrete tension carrying capacity and associated tension stiffening effect. In addition, the seismic response of various prototype structures when subjected to the experimentally employed cyclic forces and the time-history earthquake loadings was predicted using the originally developed cyclic strut-and-tie models. A summary encapsulating the findings of this project and recommendations for future research work in the area of nonlinear strut-and-tie modelling is also presented.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290800 Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1952</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The oxidation reactions of heterogeneous carbon cathodes used in the electrolytic production of aluminium</field><field name="creator">James, Bryony Joanne</field><field name="description">A technique has been developed that allows the gasification reaction rates of representative samples of carbon-carbon composite materials to be examined. The technique involves heating the sample in a controlled and monitored environment; the product gases of the reaction are then analysed by a mass spectrometer, allowing their identification and quantification. The technique was used to characterise the oxidation reactions of cathode carbons. These materials are composites and so the oxidation reactions of their constituent raw materials were also examined. Surface area was determined for each sample, allowing specific rates of reaction to be determined, normalising surface area effects. The anodes, cathodes and sidewalls of aluminium smelting cells are made of composite carbon materials comprising filler materials (such as coke, anthracite and graphite) and a binder (almost exclusively coal tar pitch). Whilst the oxidation of anode carbons has received extensive study the oxidation reactions of cathodes have been neglected largely because they have not been a cause of smelting cell failure. However, with the longer lives now being achieved from smelting cells the long term degradation reactions, such as oxidation, will have to be considered. Oxidation of cathodes in the area of the collector bar will increase resistance and affect the heat balance of the cell. Gasification reactions of carbon materials are frequently characterised using techniques such as thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). These techniques are accurate for examining such reactions when the sample is of small size and a single carbon type. To characterise composite carbons correlations have been made between the overall oxidation resistance (determined by weight loss) and the ignition temperature of one of the constituent materials (determined by TGA). The results obtained using the new technique of product gas analysis (PGA) revealed an exponential dependence of oxidation rate on temperature for the carbons examined. At higher rates the limiting condition appeared to be mass transfer through the pores of the sample. Arrhenius plots of reaction rates allowed the activation energy of oxidation to be determined for each material. When the rate was controlled by the chemical reactivity of the material the activation energies determined agreed well with values obtained from the literature. The two graphites examined had activation energies of 164 and 183 kJ.mol-1, Ea of graphite has been measured in the range 175-281 kJ.mol-1, the latter figure being for a highly pure graphite. For the two anthracites Ea was ll3 and 118 kJ.mol-1, literature values have it between 100 and l5l kJ.mol-1. The pitches, used as binders of cathode carbons, had Ea equal to 112 and 123 kJ.mol-1, values from the literature range from 121-165 kJ.mol-1. Activation energies were determined for the cathode materials, and were clearly influenced by the reactivity of the constituent materials. An amorphous cathode carbon, having nominally 30% graphite, had an activation energy of 121 kJ.mol-1. A semigraphitic cathode material comprising 100% graphite in a pitch binder had an activation energy of 123 kJ.mol-1. The similarity of these values to those for Ea of the pitch and anthracite indicates that the binder phase is having a strong influence on cathode reactivity. These values of Ea accord well with values determined for similar samples, reported in the literature ranging from 114 to 138 kJ.mol-1. A semigraphitised cathode material had an activation energy of 176 kJ.mol-1 in the same range as that of graphite. This sample oxidised significantly less rapidly at all temperatures. The variation in reactivity of the constituent materials of cathode carbons accounts for the highly selective oxidation behaviour observed in these materials. Porosity development is rapid as binder matrix is preferentially oxidised, leading to an acceleration of oxidation rate with increasing burnoff. The rate begins to decelerate once all the binder matrix has been oxidised, the residue being less reactive than the starting material. The structure of the materials was quantified using X-ray diffraction (XRD). A peak ratio method was employed, comparing the intensify of the 4oz peaks of cathode carbons and a standard electrographite. Once effects of cathode porosity had been normalised an excellent correlation between increasing peak intensity ratio and increasing oxidation resistance was found.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290600 Chemical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1935</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Auckland child pedestrian injury study: a case-control study</field><field name="creator">Roberts, Ian Gray</field><field name="description">Pedestrian injuries are the leading cause of death in New Zealand children between the ages of one and fourteen years. Although child pedestrian mortality rates are declining, mortality rates in New Zealand are substantially higher than those of comparable motorised countries. For the children who survive pedestrian-motor vehicle collisions, the injuries are often particularly severe. Pedestrian injuries are a leading cause of severe brain injury in childhood, with high levels of long term disability. However, very little is know about the risk factors for child pedestrian injury and as a consequence there are few well established prevention strategies.  The Auckland child pedestrian injury study is a population based case-control study designed to identify and assess the contribution of potentially modifiable risk factors for pedestrian injuries in childhood. In particular the study was designed to examine the risks associated with traffic volume, vehicle speed, parked vehicles and the availability of safe areas for children&#8217;s play.  The study was conducted between 1 January 1992 and 1 November 1993. Cases were all children, younger then fifteen years, killed or hospitalised as a result of a pedestrian-motor vehicle collision in the Auckland region. Both motor vehicle traffic and motor vehicle non-traffic (driveway related) pedestrian injury cases were included. controls were a random sample of the child population. Two controls were selected for each traffic pedestrian injury case and three for each non-traffic pedestrian injury case. Controls for school aged cases were randomly selected from school rolls. Controls for preschool cases were selected by first randomly selecting a school aged child and then, using the street address of this school aged child as the starting point, visiting homes until an eligible pre-school control child was found.  The parents of 600 children participated in the study, the parents of 200 cases and the parents of 400 controls. Of the 200 cases, 156 were injured on public roads and 38 were injured in residential driveways, the remaining 6 children were injured in car parks and public parks. The response rate in the case group was 97%, the response rate in the control group was 99%. Exposure information was collected by way of interviewer administered questionnaires and the direct measurement of environment factors.  High traffic volume is a major risk factor for child pedestrian injury. Children living in neighbourhoods with the highest traffic volumes had close to ten tines the risk of pedestrian injury. There was a dose response relationship with a steady increase in the magnitude of the risk as traffic volume increased. Vehicle speed was also a strong risk factor for child pedestrian injury and may be particularly important in residential streets. Having a street with a mean vehicle speed of over 40 kph within 500 metres of the home increased the risk of child pedestrian injury six fold.  A high density of on street parking was associated with a fourfold increase in risk of pedestrian injury. Children from homes without a fenced play area were at a significantly increased risk of pedestrian injury, although the prevalence of this risk factor in the Auckland population was very row. Children from homes where the play area was unfenced were at a significantly increased risk of injury, close to twice the risk of children from homes where the play area was fenced. For driveway related pedestrian injuries, children from homes where there is no fence separating the driveway from the play area had twice the risk of injury.  The Auckland child pedestrian injury study has provided, for the first time, information on the aetiology of child pedestrian injury in a large population based sample in New Zealand. In addition the study has provided the opportunity to examine a number of methodological issues in this comparatively new sphere of epidemiologic inquiry.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1943</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Control and optimisation of coagulant dosing in drinking water treatment</field><field name="creator">Edney, Daniel B.

The primary aim of the research was to examine the nature of the relationships between young people's responses to televised alcohol advertising and drinking-related behaviours. The research was based on two surveys, one with l0 to 17 year olds and one with 18 to 29 year olds. The l0 to 17 survey involved 500 randomly selected face-to-face interviews in New Zealand's three largest urban areas. The 18 to 29 survey involved 1012 interviews. Respondents were randomly selected from throughout New Zealand and interviewed using a computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) system. Both surveys asked about responses to specific alcohol advertisements, which were ones these age groups had been more exposed to. One of the two key response measures identified how frequently they recalled having seen the advertisement; this was labelled recalled exposure. Positive response to the advertising was measured by liking of the advertisement. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was used for the analyses, but this was preceded by correlation and regression analyses. On the basis of factor analyses that preceded the structural equation modelling, most of the modelling was based on the responses to the three beer advertisements in each study. 10 to 17 year old survey: The findings from the structural equation modelling were consistent with the hypothesis that positive responses to beer advertising (as measured by liking) were contributing to an increase in expected frequency of future drinking. The data were also consistent with the beer advertising contributing to an increased frequency of current drinking, although the relationship was just under the 0.05 level of significance. There was some limited evidence that recalled exposure may be associated with the drinking status of 10 to 13 year olds but, because of the small number of drinkers in this age group, this result needs to be interpreted with caution. The regression analyses indicated that recalled exposure was a predictor of 10 to 17 year olds' perceptions of how often their age/gender group drank and how accepting their friends were of drinking and occasional drunkenness. Other survey responses were also indicative of an influence of alcohol advertising on young people. Alcohol advertising was an important source of information about drinking, particularly for the 10 to 13 year old males. Almost half of these younger males accepted the portrayals in alcohol advertising as realistic and almost two thirds of them felt that alcohol advertising does encourage teenagers to drink. 18 to 29 year old survey: This study provided support for the hypothesis that more positive responses to televised beer advertisements resulted in larger quantities of alcohol being consumed on typical drinking occasions by 18 to 29 year old New Zealanders. It did not provide support for the hypothesis that drinking larger quantities of alcohol led to more positive responses to beer advertisements. The model showed that positive responses to beer advertisements had both a direct influence on quantity and an indirect influence, via its influence on positive beliefs. This study also provided support for the hypothesis that more positive responses to beer advertising were associated with increased alcohol-related problems. As with the 10 to 17 year olds, recalled exposure was related to perceptions of peer influence and behaviour. It was a significant predictor for female perceptions of peer quantities consumed and male and female perceptions relating to peer approval of drunkenness. The regression analyses also identified that recalled exposure was a predictor of males saying they were drinking more than the year before, however a SEM that specified reciprocal paths between these two variables found neither path to be significant. Discussion and implications This research has identified the importance of examining positive responses to alcohol advertisements. This acknowledges the active recipient of advertising who responds positively to advertising that offers valued outcomes. It also emphasises the importance of considering emotional/affective responses to advertising. However, the study also indicates that the weight of advertising is important, as reflected in the cognitive measure of recalled exposure. This appears to be having most influence on perceptions of what is normative behaviour. The results of the SEMs must be viewed as tentative, given the exploratory nature of the analyses and the limitations of cross-sectional surveys. However, as for all the previous studies, relationships have been identified between measures relating to alcohol advertising and those relating to alcohol consumption. While it is not possible to make definitive statements about directions of influence between these variables, these studies have all provided data that are consistent with the theory-based hypothesis that alcohol advertising does have an influence on alcohol consumption by young people.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321216 Health promotion</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1960</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The application of support vector machines to compression of digital images</field><field name="creator">Robinson, Jonathan</field><field name="description">Methods exploring the application of neural networks to still image compression are detailed in both the spatial and frequency domains. In particular the sparse properties of Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning are exploited in the compression algorithms. A classic radial basis function (RBF) neural network requires that the topology of the network be defined before training. An SVM has the property that it will choose the minimum number of training points to use as centres of the Gaussian kernel functions. It is this property that is exploited as the basis for image compression algorithms presented in this thesis. Several novel algorithms are developed applying SVM learning to both directly model the colour surface and model transform coefficients after the surface has been transformed into the frequency domain. It is demonstrated that compression is more efficient in frequency space. The Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) is used to transform the colour surface into the frequency domain. A counter-intuitive result is shown where mapping the DCT coefficients to a 1-dimensional function for SVM modelling produces better results than SVM modelling of the 2-dimensional transform surface. Results are presented in comparison to the JPEG image compression algorithm. In the frequency domain, results are superior to that of JPEG. For example, the quality of the 'Lena' image compressed 63:1 for JPEG is slightly worse quality than the same image compressed 192:1 with the RKi-1 algorithm presented in this thesis. Due to the commercial value of the algorithms detailed in this thesis, a patent has been filed.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::299900 Other Engineering and Technology::299999 Engineering and technology not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1937</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecological dynamics of the green-lipped mussel, Perna canaliculus, at Ninety Mile Beach, northern New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Alfaro, Andrea Casandra</field><field name="description">The New Zealand green-lipped mussel, Perna canaliculus, is farmed by an aquaculture industry (&gt; NZ$ 150 million/year) that is dependent on mussel juveniles (spat) collected from unpredictable and unreliable wild sources for more than 80% of its mussel seed requirements. Most wild-caught spat is collected from the surf zone at Ninety Mile Beach, northern New Zealand, where unique environmental conditions cause the accumulation and transport of spat attached to drift algae, which arrive to the shore in great quantities (up to 100 tonnes at once). This study is the first to investigate the ecology of mussels at Ninety Mile Beach throughout their life history, including reproductive behavior, micro-scale settlement patterns on filamentous macroalgae, accumulation and transport of mussel spat to the shore, colonization of the rocky intertidal, and adult population dynamics. Histologic investigation of 4 intertidal and 2 subtidal populations revealed that females and males were well-synchronized throughout their reproductive cycles, with a prolonged spawning season from June to December, when temperatures were lowest and rising. Comparisons of gonad indices and maximum shell length indicated high productivity in certain populations, which likely contribute to the high larval availability of the area. Experiments showed that mussel spat preferentially settled on fine-branching natural and artificial substrata, with correlation evident between mussel shell size and degree of branching. Furthermore, greater numbers of mussels settled on node versus internode areas within natural and artificial substrata. Chemical cues for mussel settlement also were studied using phytogel plates spiked with algal extracts, which were preferred over control plates by mussel larvae/post-larvae in the field, and by hatchery-reared larvae in the laboratory. Three intertidal populations were investigated at different temporal and spatial scales. Mussel concentrations in seawater were higher after spawning for both small mussels (&lt; 0.25 mm) in August, and for larger mussels (&gt; 0.5 mm) in March. Settlement patterns within quadrats cleared of mussels in 2 habitats (adult mussel bed and adjacent areas covered with algae) were studied from July 1999-March 2001. Primary settlement (mussels &lt; 0.5 mm) was found to dominate the algal habitats at the beginning of the spawning season in August, while secondary settlement (mussels &gt; 2.0 mm) was higher in the adult mussel bed late in the spawning season (November-March). Monthly surveys of undisturbed quadrats indicated that a peak in new recruitment coincided with a peak in adult mortality in August. At Scott Point, massive mortality for 2 years in August was followed by a dramatic re-colonization of the empty spaces by juveniles. Settlement patterns of mussels on suspended ropes in the water column were investigated at 3 water depths inside and outside Ahipara Bay during 2 spawning seasons (1999-2000). Mussel settlement was higher for small mussels (&lt; 0.49 mm) in shallower water (2 m water depth) in August, and higher for larger mussels (&gt; 1.0 mm) at greater depths (18 m water depth) in September-December. Mussels found on shallow-water ropes may have settled directly from the plankton, whereas mussels on ropes near the bottom (18 m) may have transferred from macroalgae tumbling on the seafloor. Environmental conditions associated with mussel spat arrival to the beach (spatfall events) were studied by statistical analysis (1990-1998; daily, monthly, inter-annually) of wind speed/direction, tidal range, water temperature, swell height/direction, and records of spatfall events/amounts. Spatfall events/amounts were more abundant during days of strong offshore winds. Swell height in the onshore direction was significantly correlated with spatfall events/amounts. Storm events (wind speeds &gt; 20 m/s) were most frequent between May-August; spatfall events/amounts were more numerous 4 months later (September-October). Years with more storm events (El Ni&#241;o/La Ni&#241;a episodes) were associated with significantly higher spatfall events/amounts.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1953</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Amyloid in Huntington Disease: identification, purification and partial characterisation of protein constituents</field><field name="creator">McGowan, Daniel P.</field><field name="description">Huntington disease (HD) is a progressive, autosomal dominantly inherited, neurodegenerative disease that is characterised by involuntary movements (chorea), cognitive decline and psychiatric manifestations. HD is one of a number of late-onset neurodegenerative diseases caused by expanded glutamine repeats, with a likely similar biochemical basis. It has been suggested that the disease-causing mechanism in Huntington disease (and the other polyglutamine disorders) is the ability of polyglutamine to undergo a conformational change that can lead to the formation of very stable anti-parallel &#946;-sheets; more specifically, amyloid structures. This hypothesis is supported by evidence that polyglutamine forms amyloid-like protein aggregates in vitro, which stain with Congo red (a histological stain for amyloid) and exhibit green birefringence under polarized light. Further support for this hypothesis is provided by evidence of Congo red staining with green birefringence, of purified aggregates from HD brain captured on cellulose acetate filters. This study describes the first finding of amyloid-like inclusion bodies in situ, in HD brain. Inclusions possessing an amyloid-like structure were identified by Congo red staining and polarized-light microscopy in the cortex and striatum of HD brain, but these were absent in both normal control brains and Alzheimer's disease brains. Amyloid-like inclusions were of a similar size to the immunohistochemically-detected neuronal inclusions reported by other investigators, however the frequency of the former was far lower than the latter and the relationship between the two types of inclusion is uncertain. Efforts to purify and characterise the amyloid-forming protein(s) in HD utilised the methodologies used to purify amylin from amyloid plaques in the diabetic pancreas, with a number of refinements. Internal fragments of three different proteins, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), histone H3 and hypothetical protein FLJ20623 were co-purified with the amyloid component of HD brain based on their increased abundance relative to control brains, and subsequently characterised. The role of these proteins in HD is investigated and discussed. In addition, an ~4285 dalton protein was co-purified with the amyloid component of HD brain; this protein was noticeably absent in control brain and displayed unusual biochemical properties, however an amino-acid sequence could not be determined. Interestingly, a protein of the same approximate size, and displaying similar properties, was purified from poorly soluble protein aggregates formed in polyglutamine-expressing cultured cells. SDS-PAGE and Western analysis of sub-cellular fractions of HD and control brain revealed a novel pattern of proteolysis at the N-terminus of huntingtin in HD relative to control, that is supported by recent literature. Myelin basic protein was demonstrated to co-migrate with an N-terminal huntingtin-positive peptide, with apparent molecular weight of ~20 kDa, using tryptic in-gel digestion and protein sequencing. This N-terminal huntingtin-positive peptide and the ~4285 dalton protein described above were both purified from amyloid-containing fractions and both resisted N-terminal protein sequencing. Due to the aberrant migration of polyglutamine-containing proteins in polyacrylamide gels, a possible identity between these peptides is proposed. Laser capture microscopy and tandem mass spectrometry were investigated as potential methods for the purification and characterisation of amyloid-forming proteins in HD and the further development of these techniques may enable the realisation of these aims in the future. The major contribution of this study has been the finding of amyloid-like inclusions in Huntington disease brain. This finding places HD and by association the other polyglutamine disorders into the category of amyloid diseases, and suggests that strategies to prevent amyloid accumulation, a focus of Alzheimer's Disease research, may be of much wider application to glutamine repeat disorders such as HD or vice versa.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320700 Neurosciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1933</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cardiovascular disease risk factors in Pacific adolescents: the Auckland high school heart survey</field><field name="creator">Schaaf, David</field><field name="description">Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality in New Zealand. The most current evidence indicates that the burden of cardiovascular disease is greatest among Maori and Pacific peoples and Pacific peoples have the highest mortality rate for cerebrovascular disease [1]. There is substantial scientific evidence that cardiovascular disease has its origin early in life and that a person's risk of cardiovascular disease is determined by the synergistic effect of all the cardiovascular risk factors over time. The Auckland High School Heart Survey (AHHS) is an epidemiological survey designed to determine the prevalence of risk factors for cardiovascular disease in an adolescent high school population in New Zealand. It takes a 'lifecourse' and primary prevention approach to reducing the incidence of cardiovascular disease. The aims of the study were to determine cardiovascular risk factor levels in, and compare the cardiovascular and diabetes risk factor levels between, Pacific and European students and the main Pacific communities (Samoan, Cook Islands, Tongan, and Niuean). The AHHS was a school-based cross-sectional survey of 2,549 adolescent students, across 10 Auckland High Schools. A cluster sampling technique was used to obtain the target of 1000 Pacific participants, to enable Pacific ethnic-specific analysis. The study specifically aimed to determine ethnic-specific differences in lifestyle, intermediate and outcome variables that have been established as cardiovascular risks. Lifestyle variables included: smoking, alcohol consumption, leisure-time physical activity (LTPA), television exposure and sun exposure. The intermediate variables analysed included: body mass index (BMI), waist to hip ratio (WHR), percentage body fat (PBF) and physical work capacity 170 (PWC170). The outcome variables included: total cholesterol (TC), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC), ratio of total cholesterol to high density lipoprotein cholesterol (TC:HDLC), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC), triglycerides (TG), fasting blood glucose (FG), urinary micro albumin (UA), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP &amp; DPB). Demographic variables analysed included: sex, age, ethnic group, school, socio-economic status and growth development and maturation. The AHHS study results showed that demographic variables were strongly associated with both intermediate and outcome variables. The findings showed that there were significant ethnic variations between the four main ethnic groups (Pacific, Maori, Asian and European) in risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Pacific participants had the highest BMI and PBF. Pacific participants had the lowest levels of PWC170. With regard to outcome variables, Pacific adolescents had lower levels of TC, HDLC and LDLC compared to Europeans. However, Pacific participants had higher levels of TC:HDLC, FG, TG and DPB. To a lesser degree, lifestyle variables were also associated with other variables. However, the weaker association was likely due to measurement error. The findings of the AHHS study show that ethnic differences present in the adult population are already established among adolescents [2]. Some significant differences were also found between the Pacific ethnic groups (Samoan, Cook Islands, Tongan and Niuean). Among Pacific participants, Cook Islands participants also had the highest level of adjusted mean PWC170. With regard to outcome variables (lipids, fasting glucose and blood pressure), Tongan participants had lower TC, LDLC and TC:HDLC compared to Samoans. However, Tongan participants had significantly higher levels of TG compared to Samoans. For Pacific participants, Cook Islands participants significantly differed from Samoan in smoking, alcohol consumption and PWC170. Cook Islands participants were more likely to have tried smoking for the first time and at an earlier age. They were also more likely to smoke daily and to smoke higher amounts than the other Pacific ethnic groups. Cook Islands participants were more likely to have tried alcohol and at an earlier age. They were also more likely to be drinking alcohol weekly or more often when compared to Samoans. The AHHS study is one of the first pieces of epidemiological research undertaken in New Zealand that provides evidence that there are significant differences between Pacific ethnic groups for this age group. The AHHS study was also able to identify the determinant that explains ethnic differences in outcome variables. BMI was the most significant variable in determining the ethnic differences in outcome variables (lipids, blood pressure and fasting glucose). The AHHS study results showed that Pacific participants had the highest BMI levels of all the ethnic groups, followed by Maori. Television watching was the one lifestyle risk factor that was positively associated with BMI. The most effective variable in terms of decreasing mean difference in BMI was PWC170. PWC170 was significantly lower in Pacific, Asian, and Maori participants compared with European participants. Pacific participants had the lowest levels of PWC170 compared to all other ethnic groups. The AHHS findings support early interventions and programmes targeted to adolescents to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular disease. The findings which show that there are significant differences between Pacific ethnic groups for this age group, may warrant some specific public health initiatives being targeted directly to Pacific ethnic-specific groups. In addition, interventions and programmes that target reducing BMI and improving physical fitness should have an impact on a number of important cardiovascular risk factor outcome variables in adolescents, including: blood pressure, lipids and fasting glucose.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321207 Indigenous health</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1947</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mental disorders in general practice</field><field name="creator">Khin, Natalie R.</field><field name="description">Background: There is a high rate of mental disorders among general practice attendees that is associated with substantial morbidity, disability and global burden. As a consequence GPs play a pivotal role in ensuring that patients with mental disorders are recognised and optimally treated. While there is little doubt of the role GPs play in managing mental illness in general practice the literature suggests a proportion of patients will go unrecognised or else be inadequately diagnosed and in some instances inadequately treated by their GP. The known problems of under diagnosis of mental disorders has been seen until recently to be a problem of GP knowledge and skill, which has led to the close scrutiny of GP performance in this field. In response to this close scrutiny has been the development of a wide range of physician education programs aimed to improving the clinical performance of GPs. However, more recently it has been acknowledged that reasons for low recognition and inadequate treatment of mental disorders in general practice is not only the GPs lack of skill and knowledge, but instead involves a complex interplay of GP, patient and systemic factors unique to GPs, their patients and the general practice setting. Therefore there is a growing interest in research to not only explore ways to improve the clinical performance of GPs, but to also gain a better understanding of the range of issues that GPs are confronted with when managing mental disorders in general practice. Aim: There were two aims of this research: 1) examine GP attitudes, reported confidence and behaviour pertaining to the detection, diagnosis and management of mental illness in general practice (Study One); and 2) describe the epidemiology of depression in general practice and investigate symptom attribution styles as it relates to depression (Study Two). Methodology: In Study One 800 randomly selected rural and urban GPs in the North Island were invited to complete the Attitudes, Reported Confidence and Behaviour Questionnaire Revised (ARCBQ-R). The ARCBQ-R had been previously piloted and reliability and validity issues addressed and published elsewhere. In Study Two, 15 general practices were randomly selected from a database of Auckland General Practices, of which 35 consecutive general care attendees were recruited from each of the 15 general practices. Consenting patients completed a self report questionnaire on mood and health and a computerised version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) questionnaire (depression module only). Results: Study One: Four hundred and sixteen (52%) GPs completed the ARCBQ-R. GPs are confronted with a wide range of mental disorders in their day-to-day practice, with a predominance of depression and anxiety. GPs were most confident in detecting, diagnosing and treating depression and were most confident in prescribing antidepressants, particularly SSRIs for depression and anxiety. GP confidence in detection, diagnosis and treatment of mental illness was influenced by a number of GP factors such as: interest in mental health, previous mental health training, gender and exposure to mental disorders in their practice. Systemic and patients factors were also reported to influence the way in which GPs recognise and manage mental disorders in their practice. Only a small proportion of GPs reported to use solely DSM-IV or ICD-10 classifications when making a diagnosis, and the majority relied on informal ways to diagnose mental disorders in their patients, which raises questions about the appropriateness of formal diagnostic classifications in general practice. Training needs for this group of GPs involved both treatment and diagnostic issues pertaining to more complex disorders. GPs believed that shared care of mental disorders is the most effective way to provide optimal care for patients. However a number of issues pertaining to availability and assessibility of secondary mental health services along with structural issues such as cost, time and extended consultations in general practice must be addressed before this model of care can work to its full potential. Study Two: A total of 475 general practice attendees agreed to take part in this study. Approximately 20% of general practice attendees met DSM-IV criteria for major depression in the last 12 months and 12% for major depression with a recency of '1 month to less than 2 weeks'. Just under 5% of the sample met DSM-IV criteria for dysthymia, of which 80% had comorbid major depression. A greater proportion of participants who were divorced or separated, unemployed or looking for work, younger in age, of Maori ethnicity and had a history of mental illness met criteria for DSM-IV major depression. Compared to non-depressed participants, depressed participants in this study reported significantly more missed work or social activity in the last year due to emotional problems. With the aid of two screening questions for depression, GPs in this study accurately identified 75% of depressed general practice attendees. The most common attribution style amongst general practice attendees was a normalising attribution style. Patient attribution styles was not found to influence the level of depression detection by GPs, instead past and current illness profiles influenced GP detection rates of depression. Conclusion: The current research findings report figures and trends consistent with overseas studies, not only demonstrating the high prevalence of mental illness, particularly that of depression present in general practice attendees, but the many issues that shape mental health care in general practice. Inline with Klinkman's 'Competing Demands Model' GPs perform three important functions: 1) to identify mental disorders in the community; 2) directly provide mental health care to patients; and 3) a referral agent to secondary mental health services. Like Klinkman's model, results derived from the two studies suggest GPs attitudes towards mental health will shape the level of involvement across these three functions. Results derived from 'Study One' and 'Study Two' extends on Klinkman's model to incorporate 'shared care' as a potential model for managing more severe complex disorders. However, before such a model of 'shared care' can be implemented it is essential that accessibility and communication channels between primary and secondary sectors are improved, and structural funding arrangements including the appropriate remuneration for GPs time is addressed. In reality not all GPs will be interested in managing mental illness in their practice and therefore will not have the motivation to acquire and maintain a level of knowledge sufficient to work with patients with mental illness, whether it be in the capacity of 'shared care' or solely the responsibility of the GP. However, it is not unreasonable to expect GPs to have the necessary skills and ability to at least detect and diagnose mental illness in their patient population, and if necessary refer patients on to secondary mental health services. Prerequisite training in mental health, training in diagnostic classifications along with considerations around their appropriateness in general practice, a sound knowledge of patient risk factors for mental illnesses and established networks with secondary mental health services is necessary before GPs can successfully fulfill these roles.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321204 Mental health</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1929</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Money and the constitution</field><field name="creator">Mikkelsen, Adam</field><field name="description">In the past ten years, the world has witnessed a transformation in the relationship between governments and the supply of money. A number of countries, including the United Kingdom, New Zealand and the 11 European countries participating in EMU, have made their national central banks 'independent'. Inflation is at a post World War II low, and there a general recognition that inflation cannot, in the long term, create employment or boost economic growth. The economic consensus is that the best monetary policy is the pursuit of price stability. However, these changes to monetary regimes have been a pragmatic response to the problem of high inflation. There has been little recognition of the constitutional implications of the supply of money. I argue that this pragmatic approach is constitutionally dangerous. Upon examining the history of money, it is clear there are fundamental property rights associated with the issue of money. There is a strong need for monetary arrangements to be identified as constitutional issues, and for constitutional rules to be developed and applied in relation to the issue of money. This thesis analyses the appropriate relationship between governments and money from a constitutional perspective. Chapters II-VI examine the following issues: &#8226; the constitutional principles which should guide the behaviour of any government in relation to money; &#8226; the historical development of money and its theoretical qualities; &#8226; the difference between 'commodity' and 'fiat' money and the constitutional implications of their respective monopoly supply by governments; and &#8226; the constitutionally ideal monetary regime. Chapters VII, VII and IX then examine the existing monetary regimes in New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and in the European Union, and I compare these regimes to the constitutionally ideal monetary order identified in Chapter VI. The penultimate chapter examines electronic payment systems over the Internet, and assesses the possible impact these will have on governments' monetary monopolies in the future. The fundamental conclusion of the thesis is that adherence to constitutional principles demands that money be supplied on a private competitive basis. Notwithstanding that many central banks are now 'independent', the way money is supplied today - by governments possessing monetary monopolies - is contrary to the principles of constitutionalism.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::390000 Law, Justice and Law Enforcement::390100 Law::390103 Constitutionalism and constitutional law</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1956</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of contaminants on Austrovenus stutchburyi - using biomarkers to detect sublethal stress</field><field name="creator">De Luca-Abbott, Sharon B.</field><field name="description">This thesis examines sublethal stress responses in the common New Zealand estuarine bivalve, Austrovenus stutchburyi (cockle). The approach used throughout this thesis is a refinement of the biological indicator approach of Adams (1990), in which biomarker data are collected primarily at the individual and sub-organismal levels, but with additional measurements at the population and community levels. In this research several biochemical and physiological biomarkers are used to assess effects of contaminants on energetics, fecundity and growth of cockles. Adenylate energy charge (AEC) and total adenylate nucleotide pool (TANP) are biomarkers that have previously not been used with A. stutchburyi, and provide new information on energy cycling for this species. RNA concentration has also not previously been used with cockles, and this biomarker is correlated with growth. Glycogen concentration and condition indices are used to indicate reproductive potential and overall health. In order to fully investigate the utility of this comprehensive suite of biomarkers, their performance in laboratory and field situations was tested. Temporal variability in AEC, TANP and glycogen was analysed over two years for two populations of cockles in a northern harbour. The results indicated seasonal patterns for all biomarkers, with AEC reaching a maximum value in spring, TANP being lowest in winter, and glycogen concentration being high over spring and summer. Variability in biomarker response between cockles sampled at low tide and high tide was analysed in a laboratory experiment simulating exposure to air during low tide. Adenylate energy charge was found to be significantly lower in cockles after exposure to air for 4 hours, highlighting the importance of standardised collection protocols. These initial patterns, as well as spatial variability in biomarker response, were further investigated at several sites within a second harbour south of Auckland. There was little among site difference in glycogen concentration, and the data suggested that differences in site characteristics, such as sediment quality and type, were driving the mixed response patterns of AEC, TANP and condition. Because of inherent variability in field conditions, a series of laboratory experiments was then undertaken to assess responses under carefully controlled conditions. Cockles were challenged with PAHs, chlordane and tributyltin at two different doses, and biomarker response (AEC, TANP, glycogen and RNA) measured. One trial examined the effects of a one-off pulse of contaminant, in which sediment containing cockles was dosed at the outset of a 14-day experiment with a high concentration of contaminant. A daily dose of this same concentration of contaminant was supplied to the sediment for 14 days in a second trial to assess effects of a more continuous discharge. There were virtually no significant differences in biomarker response between treatments and controls for either trial, suggesting that the experimental setup may have been causing sublethal stress in some way. Finally, in order to maximise experimental control whilst maintaining environmental realism, a manipulative field experiment was undertaken in which cockles were transplanted from an uncontaminated site to a series of uncontaminated and contaminated sites in one of Auckland's major harbours. Biomarker response (AEC, TANP, glycogen and RNA) was measured in the transplanted and the autochthonous populations two weeks and eight weeks after transplantation. An ability to regulate adenylate nucleotides was detected, as cockles transplanted to contaminated sites had reduced TANP but maintained AEC levels. There were significant differences in glycogen and RNA among sites, with highest levels detected in cockles transplanted to an uncontaminated site. This suite of biomarkers showed great utility for use in environmental quality assessment. It is recommended that an approach such as that used in the Mussel Watch programme in the United States be employed for cockles, in order to monitor estuarine ecosystem health in New Zealand. The transplantation of cockles to estuaries where there are concerns about environmental quality, and the use of TANP, glycogen and RNA concentration to assess sublethal stress, has potential as a sensitive and cost-effective environmental monitoring technique for estuaries in New Zealand.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1955</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Microbiological aerosols in drainage systems</field><field name="creator">Walls, Kelvin L. (Kelvin Leonard), 1950-</field><field name="description">Drainage codes exist to provide appropriate and safe means of disposal of effluent from buildings. If it is seen that those codes may not be written in a way which leads to an assured appropriate outcome, then they need to be questioned. Accordingly, this thesis follows up on the author's concerns regarding the approach taken to the layout of drainage under today's building regulatory regime. Under the New Zealand Building Code any standards may be used or any approach may be taken to methods of building, drainage and plumbing, providing the approach used can be justified as complying with the non-prescriptive objectives and performance requirements of the Building Code. Under this approach drains are now being installed more often under buildings with their maintenance access points within the building. This situation, and the consequent likely emission of microbiological aerosols, are cause for concern: that is the airborne release of microscopic particles. The "Report of the Departmental Committee - Intercepting Traps in House Drains" of 1912 from the UK, parts of which are quoted in Section 7.0, reinforced these concerns of the author. But these concerns were not shared by many others who have a major influence on the form and shape of our buildings, and it was assumed that current code requirements may not have been based on any significant research. Based on a relatively widespread lack of knowledge, there was a scenario of doubt and denial as to whether or not there were shortcomings in current code requirements in New Zealand. This provided incentive for the research project within this thesis, on the basis that there may be encouragement for future code requirements to be based on even more research in order to confirm their validity. This thesis demonstrates that the ambiguity in existing approved methods of compliance with current building codes fails to adequately protect the populace from adverse potential health effects.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building::310100 Architecture and Urban Environment::310101 Architecture</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1931</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Investigation into 'Public Choice' Theory and its Implications for Education in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Devine, Nesta</field><field name="description">'Public Choice Theory' is defined by its proponents as 'the application of economics to politics'. This thesis attempts to describe Public Choice Theory in its component parts and as a coherent and potent contemporary factor in the political and educational scene. The methodologies used are Foucauldian 'genealogy' and 'immanent critique', that is, the theory is examined in its historical context and in terms of its own logic. The process by which this theory has affected the educational situation in New Zealand is examined, and set in the context of the wider application of economics to politics in this country generally. Some of the major policy documents concerning Education are read closely in order to identify the extent of the Public Choice Theory influence on them, Whilst Public Choice Theory is commonly associated with the 'New Right' it is also the key element of 'analytic Marxism'. Whether from 'left' or 'right,' Public Choice Theory, as a basis for the content or organisation of education is presented as a historically contingent theory, making dubious claims to scientific validation, and bringing about consistent changes in the nature of education and the construction of persons engaged in it.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1962</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reacting to a &#8216;Discovered&#8217; Social Problem Through Organisational Adaptation: Case Studies of Child Sexual Abuse Investigation of Seven New Zealand Police Districts</field><field name="creator">Burgering, Wendy Helen Miller</field><field name="description">Organisations operate in an environment buffeted by social change. Child sexual abuse became publicly recognised as a social problem from 1986. The first part of this thesis examines public awareness of, and interest in child sexual abuse, how child sexual abuse arose in New Zealand, the influence of international "moral entrepreneurs" in shaping this recognition and the activities of local "moral entrepreneurs"' including some police officers, in assisting the move of child sexual abuse from the private to the public arena. The second part of this thesis examines organisational change and whether the causes for organisational change are environmentally or managerially driven. Or is it, as this thesis suggests a combination of both. This thesis takes these theoretical arguments and applies them to the process of organisational change that occurred in the New Zealand Police Department, from the development and implementation of the National Abuse Policy for the investigation of child sexual abuse and serious physical abuse. The third part of this thesis examines the interlinking between the main theoretical foci, organisational change and the construction of a social problem. The results of an investigation from key staff, Police and other agency personnel, from seven New Zealand Police Department Districts, interviewed in three waves over a two and a half year period, are reported. The total number of key staff from each wave was 93, 80 and 68. The results of the first part of the thesis is that through effective lobbying by the women's movement and child protection groups child sexual abuse has become a recognised social problem. In the second part of the thesis the following were found to be crucial factors in the shaping of organisational responses to child sexual abuse: The role of middle managers in the implementation of organisational change policies in assigning or not assigning appropriate resources. The role of the top management in the ownership of organisational change policies the procedures. Continual staff turnover and the policy of staff rotation limited the successful implementation and continued support for the National Abuse Policy. This factor, staff turn over and/or rotation, will impact on the success of any organisational change policy. The extent of the training provisions for police officers at all levels within the organisation and the maintenance of that training at a national and district level. Acceptance of the multidisciplinary investigative approach which differed from more traditional policing approaches. The internal and external pressure on the Police to implement and maintain a high profile response in the child sexual abuse field. The results of the third part of the thesis is that the Police Department played a role in the public recognition of child sexual abuse as a social problem and as a result had to implement an operational response through the development of a National Abuse Policy.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370100 Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1963</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"Underconsumption" of Alcohol as a Form of Deviance &#8211; Minimum Drinking Norms in New Zealand Society and the Implications of their Production and Reproduction During Social Occasions</field><field name="creator">Paton-Simpson, Grant R.</field><field name="description">The deviance and alcohol literatures do not theorise expectations about minimum levels of alcohol consumption in any significant detail. Nor do they develop the notion that drinking less than is expected can be defined as a form of deviance. In response to this gap in the literature this thesis introduces and elaborates the concept of "underconsumption", defined briefly as the violation of minimum drinking norms. The thesis is also concerned to describe the key processes through which minimum drinking norms are produced and reproduced in social occasions' to demonstrate the public health significance of minimum drinking norms, and to provide evidence for the reality of "underconsumption" as a form of deviance in New Zealand society. Empirical research relied on face-to-face interviews, phone interviews, and postal surveys of 113 men - most of them abstainers or "light" drinkers. The main rationale was that likely violators of minimum drinking norms would be the most likely to have noticed and remembered the expression of minimum drinking norms. Transcripts and questionnaires were analysed with the assistance of qualitative database software. An important finding was that minimum drinking norms are in evidence throughout a broad cross-section of New Zealand society. It was also concluded that two of the main processes through which minimum drinking norms are produced and reproduced - people's reactions to abstention and lighter drinking styles and alcohol-centred hosting practices - continue to be in evidence. The relevant reactions and practices were also identified in a wide range of social groups. Furthermore, the case was presented that minimum drinking norms have potentially negative consequences for both individual "underdrinkers" and for societal levels of alcohol-related problems. These findings have important implications for the public health community and it is suggested that reference to a developed theory of "under-consumption" may have potential benefits for the planning of public health strategies and for public health policy. This research can also be seen to contribute to the alcohol literature, the deviance literature on alcohol, and the broader sociological literature on deviance. In the latter case, the analysis of "underconsumption" is most valuable by virtue of its status as "beneficial deviance".</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370100 Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1964</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The molecular response of wheat roots to aluminium stress</field><field name="creator">Snowden, Kimberley Cathryn</field><field name="description">Aluminium (Al) toxicity to plants is a significant problem, limiting agricultural production in up to 40% of the world's arable soils. In spite of a large amount of research, there is still no consensus on the physiological mechanisms of Al toxicity in plants. In addition, very little is known about the molecular response of plants to Al stress. This body of research was aimed at identifying the changes in gene expression that occurred in the root tips of plants that had been stressed with Al. A cDNA library made from the root tips of Al-treated wheat (Triticum aestivum L., cultivar Warigal) plants was differentially screened to identify clones whose expression was induced by Al stress. Seven cDNA clones, representing five different genes were identified as being induced in the presence of Al. Initial sequencing and northern analysis revealed that none of the clones isolated were full-length, and that some contained multiple cloning adaptors at their 5' ends. A new cDNA library was then constructed from the root tips of Al-treated Warigal plants, and homologues to each of the original five genes were isolated. These five clones were named wali1 to wali5 (for wheat aluminium induced). Northern analysis showed that wali1, -3 and -5 were induced 24 to 96 h after Al treatment, and their expression declined when the Al was removed. wali4 had a similar pattern of expression with a transient increase in expression also observed after 0.5 h of Al stress. Each of these four genes was induced by inhibitory concentrations of Al in two wheat cultivars - Warigal, an Al-sensitive cultivar, and Waalt, an Al-tolerant cultivar, - and also in two inbred lines of wheat, RR (Al-tolerant) and SS (Al-sensitive). The fifth gene (wali2) had a bimodal pattern of induction, and was induced by Al only in the Al-sensitive Warigal and the Al-tolerant RR. The nucleotide sequence of each of the wali clones was determined, and the databases were searched for homologous sequences. Wali1 was found to be homologous to a group of metallothionein-like proteins (MLPs) from plants, and wali4 was homologous to phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL). wali3 and wali5 encode related, cysteine-rich proteins with homology to Bowman-Birk proteinase inhibitors, and wali2 encodes a novel protein with a repeating motif of cysteine amino acids. The induction of the wali genes was investigated in response to a number of other stresses through northern analysis. The expression of wali1, -3, -4 and -5 was induced in root tips of wheat after 2 d treatments with toxic levels of all other metals tested (Cd, Fe, Zn, Cu, Ga, In and La). The expression levels of wali1, -3, -4, and -5 also increased in the root tips of plants grown in the presence of low levels of Ca (10&#956;M). The transcript levels of wali1, -3 and -5 increased in wounded leaf and root tissue, whereas the transcript levels of wali4 increased only in wounded leaves. The expression of wali2 was greatly reduced by low concentrations of Ca, and showed no induction, or a variable response with most of the other treatments. The site of expression of wali1, -2, -3 and -5 in root tips (and wali1 also in leaf tissue) was identified using in situ hybridisation. Wali1 was expressed predominantly in the meristematic tissue of the root tip, while wali3 and wali5 were expressed predominantly in the cortical tissue of the root. wali2 expression was detected primarily in the epidermis and root cap. Some changes in the site of expression of these genes were evident in the roots of Al-treated plants. In leaf tissue, wali1 expression was found in the mesophyl1 layer of cells. The coding sequences for wali1,-2,-3 and -5 were each cloned into the bacterial expression vector pGEX-2T. The resultant fusion proteins between glutathione S-transferase (GST) and the walis were then successfully purified from E coli. Antibodies were made to the wali1-GST fusion protein and purified by immunoaffinity chromatography. However, when used in western analysis, no specific bands corresponding to the native wali1 protein were identified. The wali2-GST protein was used in a south-western procedure to determine if the protein was capable of binding DNA, but no DNA binding to this protein was detected under the conditions tested. The wali3 and wali5 fusion proteins were tested in proteinase inhibitor assays, where no inhibition of either trypsin or chymotrypsin was detected. It is possible that the native wali3 and wali5 proteins may not function as proteinase inhibitors, or that the lack of activity detected for the fusion proteins may be due to incorrect folding or processing in the bacterial system. This research constitutes the first identification of plant genes whose expression is increased by Al stress. The genes identified are also induced in response to other environmental and nutrient stresses, indicating that they form part of the plant's general response to stress.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1967</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Midwifery and maternity services in transition: An Examination of change following The Nurses Amendment Act 1990</field><field name="creator">Abel, Sally</field><field name="description">The Nurses Amendment Act 1990 enabled midwives in New Zealand/Aotearoa to care for women throughout normal childbirth on their own responsibility, without the supervision of a medical practitioner, as had previously been the case. The Act brought about significant changes to midwives' scope of practice, pay and status which had important implications for women's care, midwifery, the relationship between midwifery and medicine and the structure of maternity services. Three years after the passage of the Act, in July 1993, major restructuring of the health system along market principles began. From this time, consultation began for new maternity services arrangements, which fitted within the philosophy and structure of the new health system and which aimed to rectify some of the perceived problems resulting from the initial implementation of the 1990 Act. The consultation process was to take three years. This thesis describes and critically analyses changes to midwifery and maternity services, particularly in the greater Auckland region, in the six years from the passage of the Nurses Amendment Act in August 1990 until the official introduction of the new maternity structure in July 1996. This was a period in which midwifery was establishing itself in a medically-dominated domain while, simultaneously, a significant ideological shift was occurring in the philosophy and structure of the health system. Using an ethnographic approach, which included extensive key informant interviews and participant observation at a range of meetings over a period of three years I investigated in depth both the process of change and the relations of power between interest groups (consumer representatives, midwifery, medicine, hospital managers and regional health authorities) within local and national maternity services arenas. These findings were analysed using Foucault's later work on power and his concept of governmentality. A range of factors, including some of the trends occurring within the public sector, weakened the medical profession's control of normal childbirth and facilitated midwifery's entry as a competing provider of maternity care. Strategies used by midwifery representatives to maintain and develop the occupation's autonomous status were often effective, albeit constantly challenged. Despite ongoing conflict and some polarisation between medicine and midwifery, in general, relations of power between the various interest groups in both local and national settings were found to be complex and contestable with unstable alliances forming around particular issues. However, the fluidity of these power relations and the gains made by midwifery operated within constraints imposed by the influence of neo-liberal policies on the development of the new maternity structure. This gave the government's agents, the regional health authorities, the controlling influence on maternity services policy. Although the professed aim of the new structure was a more women-centred service, there were limits to consumer influence on maternity services policy and fiscal imperatives took precedence over some consumer interests.

Because of the pesticide regulations in some of the countries to which New Zealand exports fruit, total protection from Botrytis stem end rot with current dicarboximide fungicides is not possible. The aim of this thesis was to investigate biological control measures for Botrytis stem end rot and Sclerotinia diseases of kiwifruit. More than 1000 microorganisms, isolated from the leaves and flowers of kiwifruit during spring and autumn, and selected from BCAs reported to be effective against B. cinerea and./or S. sclerotiorum, were tested in vitro for their antagonistic ability against B. cinerea and S. sclerotiorum. Successful antagonists were those that, in dual culture on agar plates, produced a zone of inhibition, an area of browning of the pathogens, or grew rapidly over the pathogens and inhibited their growth. The fifty most promising isolates from the initial screen were tested on fruit for their ability to reduce Botrytis and Sclerotinia fruit rots. Mature kiwifruit were artificallv wounded and dual inoculated with a spore suspension of one of the fifty test organisms and either a conidial suspension of B. cinerea or a mycelial suspension of S. sclerotiorum. Following 8-12 weeks incubation in a cool store, fruit were assessed for Botrytis or Sclerotinia induced rot. Isolates of Bacillus spp., Epicoccum purpurascens, Pseudomonas sp. and Trichoderma. spp. reduced, Botrytis fruit rot from 92% (inoculated control) to 0%.Isolates of Alternaria spp., pestalotia sp. and a non-sporulating isolate also reduced the number of fruit rotting to some extent. Similarly, isolates of Bacillus spp., E purpurascens and Trichoderma spp. reduce d Sclerotinia fruit rot from 100% (inoculated control) to 0%. Isolates of Alternaria spp., Myrothecium verrucaria and Pestalotia sp. were also successful at reducing the level of Sclerotinia fruit rot. It was considered undesirable if potential biological control agents (BCAs) were able to colonize kiwifruit that were to be marketed for human consumption. In order to determine if microorganisms, shown to be effective in preventing Botrytis or Sclerotinia fruit rot, were capable of themselves colonizing fruit, isolations were made from fruit dual inoculated with B. cinerea, S. sclerotiorum and/or one of several BCAs. Strains of the BCAs Bacillus spp., Pseudomonas sp. and E. purpurascens were not found to be saprophytic on fruit. Isolates of Alternaria sp., Bacillus sp., E purpurascens, pestalotia sp., Pseudomonas sp. and T. harzianum significantly inhibited germination and germ tube elongation of B. cinerea conidia in vitro in a nutrient solution, over a 24 h period. For example, the presence of Alternaria alternata A6 spores in a nutrient solution reduced germination of B. cinerea conidia from 100% to 20%. The presence of E purpurascens A77 spores inhibited B. cinerea conidial germ tube elongation from &gt;840 pm (in control conidia) to 27 &#181;m. The presence of any one of the BCAs tested prevented germination of B. cinerea conidia in a non-nutrient water solution, in comparision to germination of up to 86% in controls. A spore or cell suspension of each of the isolates Bacillus sp.M60, E. purpurascens A77 and T. harzianum C65 were spray inoculated onto kiwifruit blossoms produced in vivo in the glasshouse, immediately prior to inoculation of the blossoms with a condial suspension of B. cinerea. Application of the BCAs were completely effective in preventing colonization of blossoms by B- cinerea conidia. The effectiveness of each of the isolates E. purpurascens A77,T. harzianum C65 and either Bacillus sp.M60 or M53 to reduce the viability of sclerotia of B. cinerea and S. sclerotiorum was tested in soil punnets. A spore or cell suspension of each respective BCA was applied to the surface of replicated punnets that were seeded with either B. cinerea or S. sclerotiorum. Following 8 weeks incubation, punnets were harvested and viability of sclerotia assessed. T. harzianum C65 and Bacillus sp. M60 significantly reduced the viability of B. cinerea sclerotia from 8 sclerotia/punnet (control) to 4 sclerotia/punnet. T. harzianum C65 and E. purpurascens A77 caused a significant reduction in apothecia production of S. sclerotiorum, from 2.7 apothecia/punnet (control) to 0.7 apothecia/punnet. Bacillus sp.M8 and E purpurascens A77 were tested for their ability to reduce Botrytis stem end rot and Sclerotinia field rot in a kiwifruit orchard. The isolates tested did not successfully reduce either disease. Possible explanations for this are discussed. In order to monitor the survival of particular isolates of BCAs in the field, a technique was developed to distinguish between individual strains of a BCA species. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was utilized to identify DNA polymorphisms within the genome of T. harzianum C65, in comparison with other strains of Trichoderma spp.. A sequence of polymorphic DNA was cloned, sequenced and used as a hybridization probe in southern blotting to enable T. harzianum c65 to be distinguished from other strains of Trichoderma spp.. From the results obtained in this study, it was considered that Bacillus M60, E purpurascens 477 and Pseudomonas M30 were the best isolates for the biological control of Botrytis stem end rot on kiwifruit. Further work to enable application of these isolates as postharvest BCAs is discussed. Of the isolates tested in this study, T. harzianum C65 was considered the best isolate for use against Sclerotinia diseases on kiwifruit. Methods of selecting more effective BCAs against S. sclerotiorum are discussed.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany::270403 Plant pathology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1971</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Constructing a woman: gender, genre, and subjectivity in the autobiographical works of Sibilla Aleramo</field><field name="creator">Jacobs, Susan (Susan Mary)</field><field name="description">Both Sibilla Aleramo (1876-1960), one of Italy's most renowned and controversial women writers, and autobiography, as a generic minefield for debates on theories of the subject, have received a good deal of critical attention over the past fifteen years. The uncompromisingly autobiographical nature of Sibilla's work has been, at various times, revered and reviled, be it for what she says, or how she says it. My focus is precisely on the different forms she uses to write her self in four texts - a fictional autobiography, lyrical novel, epistolary novel and a diary - and how these construct, modify and deconstruct her self-representations in a continual process of intertextual reading and revising. Yet her texts resist easy classification. While sometimes confirming boundaries of genre and gender, they also constantly call them into question by exposing their limits, their intersection with fictional norms, and their shifting discursive affiliations. Because Sibilla was all her life concerned with gender, and the relationship of femininity to her writing, many aspects of her work appear relevant today. I explore how they anticipate feminist theories on the construction of female subjectivity in a combination of theory and autobiographical practice which highlights the interrelationship of the two. Here Sibilla's focus on the maternal is particularly indicative of this tendency, where it is woven into the generic structures of her texts as well as being an important focus of the autobiographical "story". Furthermore, her texts challenge the notion of self defined by male bias, and present opportunities for critical testing of autobiographical theories themselves by offering not one, but several, works for examination.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::379900 Other Studies In Human Society::379901 Gender specific studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1972</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reading readings: some current critical debates about New Zealand literature and culture</field><field name="creator">Paul, Mary</field><field name="description">This thesis examines contemporary interpretations of a selection of important texts written by New Zealand women between 1910 and 1940, and also a film and film script written more recently (which are considered as re-readings of a novel by Mander). The thesis argues that, though reading or meaning-making is always an activity of construction there will, at any given moment, always be reasons for preferring one way of reading over another-a reading most appropriate to a situation or circumstances. This study is motivated by a desire to understand how literary criticism has changed in recent years, particularly under the influence of feminism, and how a reader today can make a choice among competing methods of interpretation. Comparisons are drawn between various possible readings of the texts in order to classify methods of reading, particularly nationalist and feminist reading strategies. The over-all tendency of the argument is to propose a more self-critical and self-conscious approach to reading, and to develop a materialist and historical approach which I see as particularly important to the New Zealand context in the 1990s.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420200 Literature Studies::420201 New Zealand literature in English</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1974</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Further insight into the Lewis histo-blood-group system as revealed from study of Polynesian and Caucasian plasma and erythrocyte glycosphingolipids</field><field name="creator">Henry, Stephen Michael</field><field name="description">This project involved the study of Lewis and related blood group glycosphingolipid isolated from individuals with normal and aberrant Lewis/secretor phenotypes. The objective was to find a biochemical basis for the unusual expression of Lewis and secretor phenotypes in Polynesians and to use this information to shed light on the "normal" expression of Lewis antigens. By using purified glycolipids, presenting them in the cell free environment of thin layer chromatography to Lewis antibodies and by determining structures by mass spectrometry it has been shown that: l. The Lec epitope is a terminal Gal&#946;1-3Gal sequence, and not an internal branch as proposed by Hanfland (Hanfland et a1.,1986). 2. Lec or H-5-1 are present in Lewis negative phenotypes and their consequent consumption by the Le and ,Se transferases resulting in the known Lea and Leb antigens can be seen in the Lewis positives. 3. Phenotypically Le(a-b-) individuals have small amounts of Lewis antigens. This clearly demonstrates that although the Lewis negative phenotype exists at the crude serological level, this phenotype is not an "all-or-nothing" phenomenon at the chemical level. This also allows it to be postulated that the le gene is probably partially active. 4. Le(a+b+) individuals have both Lea and Leb glycolipids in the erythrocyte membrane and in plasma. Observed phenotyping anomalies appear to be related to there being quantitatively less Leb-6 in the Polynesian Le(a+b+) erythrocyte membrane than in the Le(a-b+) membrane. 5. The Le(a+b-) phenotype of Polynesians is actually the Le(a+b+) phenotype but with serologically undetectable Leb. This allows it to be postulated that the nonsecretor gene (se) is absent in Polynesians. 6. Extended structures are present in most of the Polynesian samples which is in support of a postulated weak secretor gene (Sew). It now appears that the difference between the extended Lewis glycolipids of Caucasians and Polynesians is quantitative. The postulated, Sew transferase appears to be inefficient and allows for increased formation of elongated glycoconjugates (polyglycosylceramides) to result. 7. Reduced fucosyltransferase activity allows increased elongation of the precursor chain to occur, which allows it to be postulated that fucosylation of the precursor prevents, or at least markedly reduces, chain elongation. It is speculated that, as almost everyone is either Lewis and/or secretor positive, perhaps the prevention of chain elongation is a biological reason as to why the Lewis and Secretor polymorphisms exist. 8. Differences in ceramide patterns of Lewis active glycolipids suggests that the small intestinal tract is not the only origin of plasma glycolipids, or there is differential absorption. 9. There is no plasma glycolipid-based reason for there being increased H type 2 antigen reactivity in the Polynesian erythrocyte membrane, nor a reason for the H antigen association with the Le(a+b+) phenotype.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1975</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Population dynamics of juvenile snapper (Pagrus auratus) in the Hauraki Gulf</field><field name="creator">Francis, Malcolm, 1954-</field><field name="description">The population dynamics of juvenile snapper, Pagrus auratus, were investigated in the Hauraki Gulf, north-eastern New Zealand, between 1982 and 1990. Attention focused on age and growth, temporal and spatial variation in abundance, and recruitment. Daily increment formation was validated in the sagittae of snapper up to about 160 days old. Increment width varied with time of year, and snapper age, and increments were not resolvable with a light microscope during winter. Increment counts inside a prominent metamorphic mark showed that larval duration was 18-32 days, and was inversely related to water temperature. Spawning dates were back-calculated from increment counts in settled juveniles, and ranged from September to March with a peak in November-January. The onset of spawning was temperature dependent. Fast-growing snapper had smaller sagittae than slow-growing snapper, indicating an uncoupling of otolith and somatic growth. Snapper gonads differentiated first as ovaries during the second year of life, and then some juveniles changed sex to become males during their third year. Sex change occurred before maturity, so snapper are functionally gonochoristic. Growth was slow during the larval phase, but increased rapidly after metamorphosis to about 0.6-0.9 mm.day-1. From the first winter, growth followed a well-defined annual cycle, with little or no growth during winter, and linear growth of 0.16-0.43 mm.day-1 during spring-autumn for 0+/1+ and 1+/2+ snapper. Snapper grew faster at higher temperatures. Trawl catch rates were affected by numerous gear and environmental factors, but probably provided reasonable estimates of snapper relative abundance. Recommendations are made for improving snapper trawl survey procedures. There was a strong annual abundance cycle in the Kawau region, peaking in spring, and declining to a minimum in winter. Snapper were patchily distributed at a spatial scale of 1-2 km, probably because of preference for specific micro-habitats. Year class strength of 1+ snapper varied 17-fold over seven years, and was strongly positively correlated with autumn sea surface temperature during the 0+ year. The strengths of the 1991 and 1992 year classes are predicted to be below average, and extremely weak, respectively.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1976</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multiple textual and graphical views for interactive software development environments</field><field name="creator">Grundy, John (John Collis)</field><field name="description">Diagram construction can be used to visually analyse and design a complex software system using natural, graphical representations describing high-level structure and semantics. Textual programming can specify detailed documentation and functionality not well expressed at a visual level. Integrating multiple textual and graphical views of software development allows programmers to utilise both representations as appropriate. Consistency management between these views must be automatically maintained by the development environment. MViews, a model for such software development environments, has been developed. MViews supports integrated textual and graphical views of software development with consistency management. MViews provides flexible program and view representation using a novel object dependency graph approach. Multiple views of a program may contain common information and are stored as graphs with textual or graphical renderings and editing. Change propagation between program components and views is supported using a novel update record mechanism. Different editing tools are integrated as views of a common program repository and new program representations and editors can be integrated without affecting existing views. A specification language for program and view state and manipulation semantics, and a visual specification language for view appearance and editing semantics, have been developed. An object-oriented architecture based on MViews abstractions allows environment specifications to be translated into a design for implementing environments. Environment designs are implemented by specialising a framework of object-oriented language classes based on the MViews architecture. A new language is described which provides object-oriented extensions to Prolog. An integrated software development environment for this language is discussed and the specification, design and implementation of this environment using MViews are described. MViews has also been reused to produce a graphical entity-relationship/textual relational database schema modeller, a dialogue painter with a graphical editing view and textual constraints view, and various program visualisation systems.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1978</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lepidopterous pests on vegetable brassicas in Pukekohe, New Zealand: their seasonality, parasitism, and management</field><field name="creator">Beck, Nancy Gunther</field><field name="description">The vegetable brassicas of cabbage, broccoli, and cauliflower are grown in Pukekohe for the Auckland fresh-produce markets. These brassicas are attacked by three major lepidopterous pests: diamondback moth (DBM) (Plutella xylostella (L)) (Yponomeutidae), white butterfly (WB) (Pieris rapae (L.)) (Pieridae), and soybean looper (SBL) (Thysanoplusia orichalcea (F.)) (Noctuidae). Current grower strategy to combat these pests is calendar-scheduled insecticide applications. The goal of this thesis is to develop pest management alternatives. The seasonality of these three pests is discussed. DBM and WB are each under biological control by a larval and a pupal parasitoid, but this natural control is not sufficient to allow economic harvests in cabbage and was not synchronized. No parasitoids of SBL were found. The importation of additional natural enemies is discussed. A scouting system of the percent of cabbage plants infested coupled with an action threshold of. 15%-20% infested plants, resulted in good yields in field trials and allowed up to a 50% reduction in insecticide applications over the growth period when compared to a 14-day calendar schedule. Implementation of the 15% infested threshold in commercial cabbage fields resulted in up to an 83% reduction in insecticide applications with no yield decrease in quality or quantity. Application of this 15% infested plant threshold to broccoli and cauliflower decreased insecticide applications by 40% and 17%, respectively. Study of larval biology indicated that all of the lepidopterans preferentially fed on leaves; timing of the first insecticide application in broccoli and cauliflower to coincide with floret initiation decreased insecticide applications by 80% and 67%, respectively. Laboratory and field trials comparing DBM oviposition preference, larval survivability, and parasitism rates between cabbage, broccoli, and cauliflower are discussed. Knowledge of lepidopterous pest seasonality and biology, linked to careful timing of insecticide applications to coincide with threshold levels of pests, can take full advantage of natural enemies and reduce insecticide input in the vegetable brassicas of cabbage, broccoli, and cauliflower with no decrease in crop quality.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology::270505 Entomology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1982</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Central auditory processing in children with a history of neonatal jaundice</field><field name="creator">Greville, K. A.</field><field name="description">An experimental group (Group A) of 22 children around 7 years of age who had normal hearing for pure tones but who had experienced neonatal jaundice with peak bilirubin levels of at least 300 &#181;mol/l was tested on a range of audiological tests selected to assess aspects of their central auditory processing. Children who had not been tested for bilirubin level were selected as control subjects (Group B); they were matched on the variables gender, race, gestational age, birthweight, Apgar scores and occurrence of respiratory problems. A smaller experimental group, Group C (n=7), with peak bilirubin levels between 250 and 299 &#181;mol/l but with perinatal complications was also studied. The experimental groups had higher mean acoustic reflex thresholds and lower mean reflex amplitudes than the control group. Acoustic reflex threshold patterns of abnormality consistent with central dysfunction occurred in two children from the main experimental group and two children in the control group. None of the children from Group C showed abnormal reflex thresholds. Acoustic reflex amplitude patterns of abnormality consistent with central dysfunction were present in six children from Group A and two children from Group C, compared with three children from the control group. Masking level differences were absent in five subjects from Group A and three children from Group C, compared with three control subjects. No group differences were evident for ABR latency or amplitude measures, but poor morphology or repeatability of wave V was observed in ten subjects from Group A and three children from Group C, compared with five children from the control group. A larger number of failures within the experimental groups was found for two of the four speech tests, that is, for interrupted and filtered speech tests, but not speech in noise or competing words tests. Five children from Group A (but none from Group C) performed poorly on the interrupted speech test, compared with two from Group B. The filtered speech test was failed by six children from Group A and two children from Group C, compared with two from Group B. Parental reports of behavioural or learning disorders were distributed equally among the groups and were not associated with particular patterns of test failure. Overall, children in the experimental groups failed significantly more tests of central auditory functioning than did children in the control group (F(2,48)=5.5,p&lt;.01). The results were interpreted as implicating jaundice in long-term central auditory processing abnormalities.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1986</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Quantitative and Qualitative Analysis of Women&#8217;s Body Image: Comparisons Between Normal Weight, Overweight, Eating Disordered and Body Building Women</field><field name="creator">Hammond, Kay Maree</field><field name="description">This thesis approaches the area of women's body image with the aim of expanding existing knowledge based on traditional male/female comparisons of how women respond to quantitative measures of body image. It does so by distinguishing between some different body-type groups of women. These were mostly Caucasian women aged eighteen and over who lived in the greater Auckland area. They were grouped as: normal weight (n=43); overweight (n=37); women with eating disturbances (n=27); and body builders (n=17). A pilot study involving ten normal weight women examined the face validity of several established international measures of body image as well as additional ones developed for the main study. The established questionnaires were: the Rosenberg Self Esteem Scale, the Body Esteem Scale, the Weight Locus of Control Scale, a Figure Rating Scale and a Silhouette Rating scale. The newer measures consisted of modifications made to the Figure Rating Scale and the Silhouette Rating scale. Verbal questions about teasing history were also asked, the intention being to formulate a teasing history questionnaire for the main study. These measures were found to be valid by the women. In part one of the main study quantitative comparisons between the groups revealed some differences, but also some surprising similarities. Desirable body types of normal weight and muscular physique were described positively in physical and personality terms. The undesirable body types of thin and overweight received negative descriptions irrespective of the women's own group membership. The eating disordered women scored the lowest self-esteem while the other groups did not differ. The body builders scored the highest body-esteem while the normal weight and overweight, and overweight and eating disordered groups did not differ. Correlations between self-esteem and body-esteem were significant for all groups except the body builders. The correlation was strong for the eating disordered group and moderate for the normal weight and overweight groups. In the Figure Rating Scale the body builders chose more muscular ideal figures than the other groups and for all groups the ideal and current figures were usually one figure size different. At least half the women in each group felt their body was the same size as they thought it was' Of those remaining who gave different answers to the think versus feel ratings, nearly all in the eating disordered group reported they felt bigger. In the other groups there was an even split between those who felt bigger and those who felt smaller than they thought they were. The women were most united in their selection of the figure they thought men would find most attractive. In approximately a quarter to one third of each group (excluding the body builders due to small numbers) the figure selected as attractive to men was also chosen as the self ideal. Approximately a quarter of each group [excluding body builders) selected the same self ideal and peer ideal, however a considerable percentage of women selected a larger self ideal than peer ideal. All groups reported there should not be an ideal figure at all in society. All groups tended to believe that their weight was under their own control. Most women reported having been teased about their appearance and being affected by this teasing. This was especially noticeable for the eating disordered group, a considerable percentage reporting they still felt adversely affected by it. Part two of the study introduces feminist poststructuralist theory and the Foucaultian concept of power and discourse analysis as ways to explore body image research. The body image literature introduced in part one is then revisited showing how this area of research can be harmful for women. The presentation of the interviews with 28 women follows, seven women from each body type group. A short form of discourse analysis was used for the women's responses to issues in body building, their explanations of the self-esteem, body-esteem, and the results of the correlation of the two. Issues related to the presence of an ideal figure size in society are also discussed. A longer form of discourse analysis was involved for the readings of the women's accounts of having been teased about their appearance. These readings showed many women located their accounts of teasing within a discourse of trivialisation-of-teasing, indicating that the seemingly trivial practice of teasing is a powerful form of social control, resulting in feelings of vulnerability. The study concluded with summaries and conclusions from the literature presented in the introductions of both parts one and two. The quantitative and qualitative research methods were compared to see what both could offer body image research. Finally speculations were made about directions which body image research could take at both the individual and cultural level.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1987</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of glycoprotein II from bovine adrenal medulla</field><field name="creator">Hieber, A. David (Andrew David), 1966-</field><field name="description">Glycoprotein II (GpII) is a glycoprotein isolated from the membranes of chromaffin granules in the adrenal medulla. The chromaffin granules of the adrenal medulla are responsible for the biosynthesis, storage and secretion of catecholamines, neuropeptides and various proteins. The abundance of chromaffin granules makes them an excellent model to further study the organelles specialized in the synthesis and secretion of hormones and neurotransmitters, from both endocrine and synaptic vesicles. When viewed by two-dimensional electrophoresis GpII is a heterogeneoug glycoprotein (80000-100000 daltons) consisting of two components, upper (GpIIa) and lower (GpIIb). Protein and immunological characterisation revealed that the two components of GpII are distinct from each other. Further molecular characterisation of GpIIa showed that it consisted of a 1224 base pair cDNA, encoding a 383 amino acid polypeptide, with a calculated molecular mass of 40500 daltons. This characterisation also revealed 19 potential glycosylation sites, with deglycosylation studies further demonstrating that an estimated 55% of the molecular mass of GpII is asparagine-linked carbohydrate. The presence of poly-N-acetyllactosamine carbohydrate groups on GpII was also demonstrated. The predicted amino acid sequence of GpIIa shares a 72% amino acid identity with the human lamp-l type protein, which belongs to a highly conserved group of lysosomal associated membrane glycoproteins (lamp proteins). As the C-terminal region of GpIIa was identical to the C-terminal region of lamp proteins, a synthetic peptide to the C-terminal region of GpII was used to raise antisera to this region. This antisera was then used to demonstrate that the C-terminal region of GpII wag present on chromaffin granules and facing the cytoplasm. This same C-terminal region on lamp proteins is known to be a cytoplasmic tail that is essential for the intracellular targeting of lamp proteins to the lysosome. A common feature to the pathways of both GpII and lamp proteins is their appearance on the cell surface followed by internalisation via endocytosis. As endocytosis of the chromaffin granule membrane is known to occur, the possibility that GpII was a marker for endocytosis was investigated. The presence of GpII within clathrin coated vesicles was shown, and evidence was presented to demonstrate that the C-terminal region of GpII interacts with adaptor proteins of clathrin coated vesicles. Adaptor proteins are known to mediate between the cytoplasmic domain of proteins internalised by endocytosis, and the outside coat of clathrin. The evidence presented would suggest that the cytoplasmic tail of GpII is a potential marker for endocytosis within the chromaffin granule membrane. The results presented in this study indicate that GpII is the secretory granule and species counterpart to the lamp proteins. This finding however raises some interesting questions regarding intracellular targeting between the lysosomes and secretory granules within the chromaffin cell.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1988</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Implementation of a bubble model in FLAC and its application in dynamic analysis</field><field name="creator">Ni, Bing</field><field name="description">Methodologies of implementing nonlinear constitutive models of soil in FLAC are studied in order to reduce numerical distortion, which has been found to occur in nonlinear dynamic analysis when a nonlinear soil model is implemented using an &#8216;apparent modulus&#8217; approach. Analyses undertaken using several simple nonlinear soil models indicate that use of &#8216;plastic correction&#8217; approach can eliminate or minimize the problem. This approach is therefore adopted in the thesis to implement in FLAC a bounding surface bubble soil model, i.e. the Bubble model. Satisfactory performance of the Bubble model has been obtained in dynamic analysis without using any of the additional mechanical damping given in FLAC. An analytical study on the Bubble model is carried out with FLAC. On the basis of the study, the hardening function is modified to better incorporate size ratio effects of the yield surface and is explored to eliminate abrupt transition in stiffness from elastic region to yielding. Pore water pressure is formulated with the assumption that the pore water pressure is generated as a response to the constant volume constraint which prevents the tendency for volume change when plastic volumetric strain takes place. The formulation is added to the Bubble model so that pore water pressure can be generated automatically by the model for fully saturated and undrained soil. FLAC analyses indicate that the Bubble model is generally in good agreement with published experimental data. The parameters and initial conditions associated with the Bubble model are studied with FLAC analyses in triaxial stress space to investigate their influence on the model and to investigate their effective ranges. Both large and small strain behaviors of the model are explored in the parametric study. Finally, the Bubble model is applied in the modeling of vertical vibration of rigid strip foundations. The influence of soil nonlinearity on vertical compliance of rigid foundations is investigated. Some major factors are considered, which include initial stress level in soil, level of excitation and mass ratio of foundation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290800 Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2319</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Isolation and characterisation of N-glycans of ovine and human luteinizing hormones</field><field name="creator">Hiyama, Jun</field><field name="description">Gonadotrophic hormones are heterodimeric glycoproteins and their N-glycans attached to specific amino acid residues are currently thought to play important roles in hormonal biosynthesis, secretion and function. The studies reported in this thesis aimed at isolation and characterisation of structural properties of the N-glycans on ovine and human luteinizing hormones. Initially, chromatographic methods were developed using reverse-phase HPLC for the analytical separation of the three human pituitary glycoprotein hormones and their subunits. Separation of intact oLH and its subunits was also effected by a single HPLC step. A preparative procedure was developed for the efficient purification of hLH and hTSH from crude human pituitary extracts using hydrophobic chromatography which gave highly purified hormones in good yields and with high biological activities. This method did not significantly influence the hormones' extensive charge heterogeneity and it offered potential advantages in the characterisation of their carbohydrate structures. A preparative scheme was developed for the isolation of the N-linked oligosaccharides from each glycosylation site of o- and hLH. Charge heterogeneity of oligosaccharides, which were released by hydrazinolysis from subunits and glycopeptides, was characterised by anion-exchange HPLC. 1H-NMR analysis showed that the structures of all three N-glycans on hLH were highly heterogeneous but mainly diantennary complex-type, with site-specific patterns of terminal sialylation and sulphation as well as core-fucosylation. Sulphated/sialylated and/or disialylated oligosaccharides were the major components at each site. A set of new mono- and disialylated oligosaccharides with the terminal sequence NeuAc&#945;2-6GalNAc&#946;1-4G1-cNAc&#946;1-2Man&#945;1-3 was identified. This finding suggested unique site-specific terminal sialylation of oligosaccharides at Asn 78 (hLH&#945;) by an unknown &#945;2-6 sialyltransferase(s) in the human pituitary gonadotroph cell. Each glycosylation site in oLH had a distinct set of oligosaccharides ranging from mainly monosulphated hybrid-type at the two sites of oLH&#945; to predominantly disulphated diantennary complex-type on oLH&#946;. Core-fucosylation also differed at each site. These results suggested that processing of the oligosaccharides of the &#945;- and &#946;-subunits by &#945;-mannosidase II and &#945;1-6 fucosyltransferase was differently regulated by protein structure in oLH. Whereas hCG, hLH and oLH share similar biological activities, no apparent relationship between their N-glycan structures was found, which suggested that specific branching and peripheral structures of N-glycans on LH and hCG may not be essential for biological function, although the N-glycan nearer the N-terminus of the &#945;-subunit of hCG has been implicated in hormonal activity.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1989</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessment of the quality of observers' records of behaviour</field><field name="creator">Mudford, Oliver Charles</field><field name="description">The measurement of behaviour by direct observation may be improved when observers have been provided with equipment which enables real-time recording. There are no data available concerning the quality of this type of measurement. Indeed, there is no consensus among researchers as to appropriate methods of quality assessment. In the present series of studies, observers were provided with hand-held computers programmed to act as real-time recorders. The quality of their records was assessed by three "traditional" methods, representative of those which have been used most frequently in previous behavioural research: interobserver agreement, observer/criterion agreement, and relative error. An instrument calibration procedure, the standard method for measurement accuracy analysis in the natural sciences and engineering, was demonstrated for comparison with traditional methods.

The swimbladder begins to develop on the third day after hatch from a dorsal evagination of the gut tube. Communication w1h the gut is lost on about the tenth day following pneumatic inflation at around day eight. At this age the gas gland system appears fully functional and capable of secreting gas. By the age of settlement at around 30 days the swimbladder is a fully functional replica of the adult form except for the lack of a resorbent capillary system which does not develop until later in juvenile life. The swimbladder of the adult is of the euphysoclist form with a dorsally located resorbent oval area and sits high in the pleural cavity. The ventral tunica externa is firmly attached to the connective tissue lining the pleural space. The adult swimbladder displaces 5.6% of the volume of the body and its volume is regulated to provide near neutral buoyancy. The connective tissue integument provides almost no restriction to volume changes brought about by vertical movements of the fish and the swimbladder obeys Boyle's Law for physiological pressure changes. The ability of the connective tissue of the tunica externa to accommodate large tissue strains is due to massive regular crimping of otherwise straight collagen fibrils allowing reversible extensions up to 130%. In all other respects however the tissue structure of the tunica externa is consistent with a tissue providing an active mechanical role. The fibrillar morphology and physicochemical properties of swimbladder collagen is consistent with the vertebrate type I form however there are interesting variations in collagen form distributed throughout the swimbladder. Fibrillar morphology of the highly extensible tunica interna is significantly different to that of the tunica externa and appears to play very little mechanical rote. The extensibilty of the tunica externa appears to be regulated by physiological stress and related to the past history of tissue strain.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2012</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characteristics of firms and voluntary interim earnings disclosures</field><field name="creator">Bradbury, M. E.</field><field name="description">This thesis reviews the evolution of interim reporting in New Zealand. The attempts to regulate interim reporting by the stock Exchange Association of New Zealand and the lobbying behaviour of affected parties are documented. The regulation of interim reporting is interpreted as a series of self-interest actions by the affected parties. In 1973 semiannual reports were mandated for all firms listed on the New Zealand stock Exchange. However, the content of these reports, was not specified until 1976. The extent of voluntary reporting practice prior to 1973 is recorded. The major empirical analysis of the thesis examines the association between corporate characteristics and the voluntary disclosure of semiannual earnings during the period 1973 to 1976. The analysis shows that firms with high semiannual earnings disclosures have more shares issued, have paid an interim dividend, carry relatively less inventory, are in a more seasonal industry and have a greater earnings forecast error. Assets in place, political costs of disclosure and competitive costs of disclosure are not found to be associated with the level of semiannual earnings disclosure. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the significance of the explanatory variables depends on firm size and upon the threshold level of disclosure.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350100 Accounting, Auditing and Accountability</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1992</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From Qing reformer to twentieth-century publisher: the life and times of Zhang Yuanji 1867 &#8211; 1959</field><field name="creator">Ip, Manying</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the role of Zhang Yuanji, both as a liberal patriotic reformer in late Qing and as China's leading publisher after 1900. A historical figure hardly known to the West, Zhang contributed substantially to China's modernization in his quiet pragmatic style. When China was challenged by the imperialist West, the response of the nation's scholar-gentry elite ranged from spirited calls for wholesale westernization to a stubborn clinging to the 'national essence'. Individuals at the extremes of this range have received more attention from historians than the middle-of-the-road group of moderates, who in the twentieth century worked for modernization without discarding tradition totally. Zhang Yuanji was a typical figure in this group who attained intellectual maturity under Confucianism and yet was open-minded enough to accept Western philosophies and to adopt Western practices of entrepreneurship. Zhang Yuanji's in tense sense of patriotic obligation to introduce progressive learning for China's benefit while popularizing the best of the classical heritage was coupled with a culturalistic viewpoint that there could be no genuine changes unless a certain percentage of China'S thinking population became modernized in outlook, well-informed of world affairs, and imbued with a progressive spirit. Zhang pioneered in modern education from 1896 and remained a dedicated educationalist all his life. His publishing career in the Commercial Press can be viewed as a logical extension of his early aim of modernizing China through the spread of new knowledge. The history of the Commercial Press and in particular Zhang's part in it have received little scholarly attention, previous treatments of the subject have relied heavily on two official Commercial Press histories and the autobiographical writings of Wang Yunwu, which neglect Zhang's major contributions. The Commercial Press, as the largest publishing house in modern China, was in the forefront of educational, scholarly, and literary development in China from 1900 to the 1950s, and Zhang played a vital role in promoting progressive publications as well as preserving the best editions of classics and histories. Zhang's efforts to run the Commercial Press successfully through all the political upheavals that beset China from late Qing to after 1949 reveal both the scholar's attempts to keep up with all the latest ideological trends as well as the entrepreneur's ambition to run a modern business efficiently. A study of Zhang Yuanji's life and career is in part a study of the evolution of China's gentry-elite and the emergence of the native capitalists. The thesis draws on newly-available primary materials, both in the original and in manuscript, including over a thousand of Zhang's letters, several hundred poems and essays, and the extant sections of his business diary. These materials are supplemented by information provided by Zhang's surviving literary and editorial colleagues. Internal publications and source-materials of the Commercial Press are also used to reconstruct this biography of a little-known man who worked for China's modernization by drawing on his solid learning about China's past.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::430000 History and Archaeology::430100 Historical Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1993</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Order Hadromerida (Porifera: Demospongiae), taxonomy and relationships of the major families</field><field name="creator">Kelly-Borges, Michelle</field><field name="description">Despite advances of recent years no stable higher order classification of the Porifera has yet emerged.

The focus was on reading and language achievement, measured by standardized tests and the process of reading demonstrated when engaged in reading prose. The children were the entire population of severely and profoundly deaf, aged from 5 to 10 years at the commencement of the study, who had no other educational handicaps. They were being educated within a Total Communication programme at the Kelston School for Deaf and associated unit classrooms. Reading achievement was assessed by the Gates-MacGinitie Reading Assessment Test on three occasions, each one year apart. Reading achievement was also assessed by documenting accuracy and comprehension (retelling) when reading natural language texts. Language achievement was measured using the Grammatical Analysis of Elicited Language (Moog and Geers, 1979, 1980). The relationship between reading and language achievement was established. The reading of natural language stories was analyzed to establish the pattern of errors (miscues) on text at two levels of difficulty for the reader. Categories of semantically appropriate, syntactically appropriate, grammatically similar, the omission of inflectional morphemes, fingerspelt miscues and signing errors were established. Comparisons were made between age groups, proficiency groups(High and Low) and across developmental levels. Cloze passages were also analysed to assess the use of contextual information by these readers. Analyses of Variance (ANOVA) were undertaken for each miscue category in the signed reading, classified by age and proficiency of the reader, and difficulty of the text. Analyses of variance (ANOVA) were undertaken for the miscue categories classified by reading level, and the cloze exercise substitution classified by age and proficiency of the reader. Observations of classroom reading instructions were included to document the environment within which the children were being educated. Six individual case studies, three high progress and three low progress, were also analyzed. The findings suggest that reading achievement of these severely and profoundly deaf readers is still low. This is consistent with previous studies but achievement in comparison with earlier New Zealand data and data from surveys in the U.S. was slightly higher. This study supported previous research that suggested that standardized tests of reading do not adequately measure the reading achievement of deaf readers. High positive correlations (r &#8805;.90) between reading and language achievement were interpreted to be bi-directional and suggestive that higher rates of engaged time in reading could facilitate greater reading and language development. An integrated/interactive model most appropriately described the process of reading for these deaf readers as for hearing readers. Like hearing readers these deaf readers, at all ages and both high and low progress, were able to utilize contextual cues, and textual cues as they interacted with text. However, several unique differences in the process of reading have important implications for instruction. Low levels of syntactic cues during signed reading, it was suggested, reflect the readers use of their language in use and sensitivity to task factors. Fingerspelling was demonstrated to be a potentially useful strategy that was used at a significantly higher rate by High Progress readers. High Progress readers were more able than Low progress readers to use strategies ensuring fluency in order to construct meaning from texts Observations of classroom reading indicated that the rate of engaged time in reading was not high and that although the teachers espoused a meaning-emphasis some practices in the classroom did not foster independent problem solving readers. The educational implications of the data were discussed.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1995</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Enhancements to an object-oriented programming language</field><field name="creator">Mugridge, Warwick Bruce</field><field name="description">The objective of this thesis has been to explore the value and limitations of Class, an object-oriented programming language, in order to further the development of the language. The pivot for this thesis is WallBrace, a code-checking system. The development of the WallBrace system is the basis of a critique of Class, and leads to a number of language extensions being proposed. An important aim in this work has been the careful integration of these enhancements with the rest of the language, avoiding unnecessary additions. A number of functional and object-oriented extensions to the language are proposed. Discrimination functions, which may be higher-order and polymorphic, add considerable functional power. Generic classes allow for abstract data types, such as sets and lists, to be defined within the language. The forms interface proposed will greatly enhance the quality of user interfaces to Class programs. An external interface will allow Class programs to communicate with files, databases, and specialist user-interface programs, such as for plan entry.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1997</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Young people's reactions to nuclear issues : a constructivist analysis</field><field name="creator">Oliver, Pam, 1949-</field><field name="description">The 1980s saw an increasing interest amongst psychologists, both as researchers and as practitioners, in the ways in which people react to nuclear weapons issues, especially the perceived threat of nuclear war. Much of the research in relation to "nuclear threat", undertaken either within the United States or by United States psychiatrists in collaboration with European colleagues, and using extensive questionnaire surveys, focused on the fears of children and teenagers. Some researchers concluded that large proportions of young people were at risk of impaired psychological development because of nuclear threat which resulted in a pervasive sense of futurelessness and a distrust of .adults. This research has been widely criticised since because of apparent researcher bias in the methods used, interpretations offered, and general paradigm. I also found much of the research ethically objectionable. My research has involved 52 interviews with young New Zealanders and administration of a questionnaire to more than 2000 others, including ages nine to 18 and three ethnocultural groups, as well as interviews with some teachers. The objectives of these studies were: (1) to produce detailed information about how young New Zealanders react to nuclear weapons issues which might be used by educationalists, mental health professionals, parents, and young people themselves in dealing with those issues; (2) to make specific recommendations about young New Zealanders' apparent needs and preferences for learning about and dealing with nuclear weapons and related issues; (3) to provide a detailed methodological comparison of interview and questionnaire approaches to this research topic, and discuss issues of theory and paradigm; and (4) to comment on ethical and practical issues for both the researcher and the researched in undertaking research on emotive and potentially distressing topics, especially with young people. As a result Chapter 1 of my thesis contains a comprehensive critical review of the international research and theory relating to young people's perceptions of nuclear weapons, examining the problems of method, interpretation and paradigm associated with this area of research. Both interview and survey data are presented in relation to: (a) young people's levels of awareness and sources of information about nuclear issues; (b) their emotional, cognitive and behavioural reactions to nuclear issues, including coping strategies and activism: (c) their perceptions of the future; (d) comparisons across gender, age and ethnocultural group; (e) the role of adults; and (f) differences between New Zealanders and other national groups. The data are discussed in terms of: (i) their patterns, contexts and meanings; (ii) their implications for peace and global issues education; and (iii) their implications for research method, including ethical issues. Recommendations are made for how psychologists and others can help young people and adults in dealing with global and social threats, including how to undertake research which is empowering as well as valid and useful.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1998</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Panbiogeography: a cladistic approach</field><field name="creator">Page, Roderic D.M.

Yolk-sac larval P.auratus hatched at a small size (2.00mm SL), without functional eyes, mouth or digestive tract, and for three days spent long periods at rest. Growth was initially rapid but slowed by 3 days as yolk reserves neared depletion. By days 4-5, the mouth had opened, eyes were functional, yolk was depleted, and a rudimentary gut had formed. Larvae were now able to maintain a horizontal swimming mode and were actively searching for and attacking prey. First feeding was observed in some larvae. Growth was retarded during the transition from endogenous to exogenous nutrition and then increased as feeding proficiency improved. Yolk-sac F.varium hatched at a larger size (4.78mm SL), with functional eyes and jaws. Larvae were able to maintain a horizontal swimming mode from hatching. First feeding was observed from the first day after hatching. F.varium larvae grew steadily from the time of hatching. Ocular morphology was examined in larval, juvenile and adult P.auratus and F.varium. There was a 96 fold increase in eye size, from 0.23mm diameter in a 4 day old larval P.auratus (3.4mm SL) to a maximum diameter of 22mm in an adult of 333mm body length. F.varium displayed a 26 fold increase in eye size, from 0.28mm diameter in the smallest larva (5.00mm SL) to a maximum eye diameter of 7.2mm in a 11gmm long adult. Larval fish had pure cone retinae, however putative rod precursor cells were present from hatching in F.varium and from 18 days in P.auratus. Juvenile and adult fish had duplex retinae with cones arranged in a square mosaic in which 4 twin cones surround a central single cone. Hypertrophy of cone ellipsoids with increasing eye size, resulted in maintenance of a closely packed array in fishes of all sizes. The appearance of retinomotor movements was coincident with the development of a duplex retina in both species. Theoretical spatial acuity (calculated as a function of cone spacing and focal length of the lens) was poor in the smallest larval fish (2&#176; 1' and 1&#176; 8' minimum separable angle in 4 and 1 day old P.auratus and F.varium respectively) but improved to asymptotic values in adults (3'- 4', and 9' in P.auratus and F.varium respectively). Behavioural acuity (determined using the optokinetic response) of 4 day old larval P.auratus (37&#176; 30') and 1 day old F.varium (29&#176;) was very much lower than histological estimates. Behavioural acuity improved to 8&#176; 8' in 16 day old P.auratus and 4&#176; 18' in 14 day old F.varium, but did not attain theoretical estimates for fish of that size (55' and 54'). A rudimentary retractor lentis muscle was first apparent in larval fish 1 week after hatching, and was coincident with the formation of a posterior lental space. Presumably larval fish eyes were incapable of accomodative lens movements until this time. A relative measure of Matthiessen's ratio (distance from lens centre to boundary of the pigmented retinal epithelium/lens radius) measured histologically, decreased from 4.2 and 2.7 in 3 day old P.auratus and newly hatched F.varium, to 2.2 and 2.3 in larvae 22 and 16 days of age respectively. This suggests that growth of the retina and lens were not symmetrical in the eyes of very small larval fish. If Matthiessen's ratio holds for little eyes, then they will initially be strongly myopic. This may account in part for the mismatch between behavioural and theoretical acuity. Perceptive distances of first feeding larval P.auratus and F.varium, estimated for prey items equal in dimensions to maximum jaw widths, were very small (0.2mm and 0.4mm for prey 0.15mm and 0.2mm in size respectively), but increased with increasing body size to 2.1mm and 4.0mm for prey 0.3mm in size, at 16 and 14 days of age respectively. These data have implications for larval feeding in the wild.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2000</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular studies on actinidin, a cysteine protease from kiwifruit</field><field name="creator">Podivinsky, Ellen</field><field name="description">Research in this thesis describes the characterisation of mRNA sequences coding for actinidin, a cysteine protease found in abundance in the fruit of kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa). The first step in the characterisation required the isolation of mRNA from ripe kiwifruit tissue. The suitability of a number of RNA extraction procedures was investigated. The method finally adopted differed from that used for unripe fruit tissue, and was chosen as a result of the nature of the polysaccharide that contaminated nucleic acids prepared from extracts of kiwifruit fruit tissue. RNA extracted from ripe fruit was used to synthesis a partial cDNA library and clones for actinidin were isolated. A number of these cDNA clones were sequenced; three clones were almost full-length. The actinidin cDNA clones obtained fall into two broad sequence classes. The majority of them encode acidic proteins (pI&#732;4.7), with 97% homology to the published amino acid sequence of actinidin. The second class encode basic proteins (pI&#732;8.1), with 83% homology to the published amino acid sequence of actinidin. Both classes of actinidin cDNA sequence encode zymogens, which contain N- and C-terminal extensions not present in the mature form of the enzyme. The N-terminal extension of both sequence classes includes a putative signal peptide. Northern hybridization analysis was used to investigate the tissue specificity of actinidin mRNA expression, and the expression of mRNA for the two actinidin sequence classes during fruit ripening. Both actinidin sequence classes were expressed differentially during the latter stages of kiwifruit fruit development and through post-harvest fruit ripening. The expression of both sequence classes increased from just prior to fruit maturity through ripening and reached a maximum as fruit attained the stage of 'eating' ripeness. The level of expression of the sequences encoding acidic actinidin reached a plateau at this point, while the expression of the sequence encoding basic actinidin appeared to decrease slightly as fruit continued to ripen. The sequences encoding acidic actinidin were expressed during ripening at a much higher level than those encoding basic actinidin. No actinidin mRNA was detected in other tissues except for very low levels of the acidic form in kiwifruit leaf, and low levels of the basic form in senescing petals. A full-length, acidic, actinidin cDNA sequence was introduced into tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants via Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. Using the binary vector pGA643, the sequence was introduced in both the sense and antisense orientation relative to the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter and transgenic plants were obtained for both sequence orientations. The presence of the T-DNA cassette (containing the actinidin sequence) in the plant genomes was determined using PCR analysis, and confirmed by Southern hybridization. A number of the transgenic plants contained multiple insertions of the actinidin sequence, and most plants contained at least one intact copy of the T-DNA cassette. The transcription of the introduced actinidin sequence was investigated by Northern hybridization analysis. All of the plants containing actinidin in the sense orientation, and some of those incorporating the antisense construct, transcribed the actinidin sequence. Attempts to detect actinidin protein in the transgenic plants were unsuccessful. Acidic actinidin was identified as one of the most abundant bands in the total protein profile from ripe kiwifruit fruit tissue. The identity of the protein was confirmed by N-terminal sequence analysis. The electrophoretic mobility of actinidin, both in the total cell homogenate and when partially purified, suggested that the first step in post-translational processing of the zymogen may be the removal of the N-terminal extension. Actinidin was also partially purified and used to raise antibodies. Poor specificity of the antibody for actinidin led to preliminary evidence for the glycosylation of actinidin.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2001</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of the relationships between housing patterns, social class and political attitudes in three Auckland electorates</field><field name="creator">Prince, John D. (John David)</field><field name="description">There is a strain of social criticism, dating back to the fifties and sixties, which alleged that New Zealand was about to become a society more clearly divided by lines related to "class". New Zealand was presented as a society in which a natural egalitarianism of social habits and attitudes had flourished. The critical voices of this earlier period feared that as New Zealand's economy evolved further, so would the degree of social demarcation within society. They expected that these changes would show up most rapidly, and with deeper effects, in the northernmost part of New Zealand, particularly in Auckland. There the postwar period's industrial development and population growth was greatest. In the suburbs of the north, middle class beliefs and life styles would develop. Suburban life, in areas of new housing containing those who most notably benefited from these changes, would provide mutual reinforcements for the evolution of a much more consciously middle class way of life. Many of the implications of this social criticism are explored in this thesis by means of a questionnaire professionally administered to a sample of 312 respondents in three Auckland electorates. East Coast Bays was chosen as an example of a burgeoning middle class suburb, Te Atatu as a newer area of working class settlement, and Birkenhead as a bridge between the two of them, socially and politically. The survey was administered shortly before the 1978 general election. A variety of facts about, and attitudes to, housing, employment, life styles, suburban locations and indistrialisation are explored. These are normally related back to the basic dependent variables of voting choice, electorate, the propensity to think in class terms, and subjective class identification. The overwhelming pressure of the evidence is that of continuity with the egalitarian past. The chief hypothesis tested is that "following on the most rapid processes of postwar industrialisation in New Zealand, new suburban contexts have evolved in Auckland in which the middle class beneficiaries of Auckland's growth are reinforced in attitudes that reject egalitarianism, accept differential rewards and life styles, and are associated with distinctive political and social attitudes". On the evidence presented in this study it must be rejected.</field><field name="date">1985</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360100 Political Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2002</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies in the biology of Phytophthora cinnamomi Rands</field><field name="creator">Chee, Kheng-Hoy</field><field name="description">1. Sixteen New Zealand and 10 overseas isolates of Phytophthora cinnamomi Rands have been compared for oospore production in paired and single cultures. Considerable variability existed among the 26 isolates in respect of mating ability and responses to physical and chemical factors. Addition of steroids and did not influence oospore production. However, hypoxanthine increased oospore production in two isolates. 2. Discovery of the role of steroids in relation to growth and asexual sporulation of Phytophthora ssp. makes it possible to replace natural media by a synthetic medium. For this purpose an investigation was made into the carbon, nitrogen, vitamin and calcium requirements of P. cinnamomi. Twenty carbon compounds were tested as major sources of carbon with Ca(NO3)2 and glutamic acid as nitrogen sources. Dextrin, starch, and sucrose were the best sources of carbon for growth and asexual reproduction. Xylose also supported abundant sporulation, although growth was slow. Organic acids and alcohols were poor sources of carbon. The best sources of organic nitrogen tested for growth were glutamine and glutamic acid. Tryptophan, phenyl-alanine, and cystine appeared to be inhibitory. Of the vitamins tested, only thiamine was required by the fungus. Five calcium compounds added singly to the basal medium gave no increase in the growth of the fungus. 3. &amp; 4. The effect of soil extracts on sporulation of P. cinnamomi has been investigated. Non-sterile soil extracts from different soil types and from soils under different plan species all supported sporulation, stimulatory activity being markedly reduced only after 1000-fold dilution. Autumn soil was most active in stimulating sporulation, wheras summer soil was inactive. When peptone was added to summer soil, the stimulatory activity of the extract was restored. A wide variety of materials added to distilled water failed to stimulate sporulation. Soil extract lost its stimulatory properties after sterilisation by autoclaving, steaming, Seitz or sintered glass filtration, dialysis, ultrasonic disintegration, ultracentrifugation or treatment with propylene oxide or alcohol. Root exudates and microorganisms other than bacteria had no effect on sporulation. Fifty-nine bacterial cultures classified in 15 genera stimulated sporulation on one or more occasions when transferred from nutrient broth cultures but not from nutrient agar slopes. Of 16 morphologically distinct bacteria isolated from wet autumn soil, two Pseudomonas species stimulated abundant sporulation when transferred from agar plates to sterile soil extract. The activity of these isolates was lost after six weeks in culture, but was partially restored by growing them in nutrient broth. Extracts from sterilised soil inoculated with attenuated cultures of these Pseudomonas species were stimulatory but subcultures from these extracts were only stimulatory if grown in broth. The difference in ability to stimulate sporulation between cultures from broth and from agar was not due to bacterial numbers, flagellation, or fimbriation, but was associated with the additional nutrient transferred with the bacterial inoculum from a broth culture.

Strategic activities are defined as being essentially outward looking and primarily concerned with the positioning of the organisation in its environment in the long term. The types of interaction which are of interest at this level are defined and a general mathematical framework is developed to describe these processes. Optimisation techniques which are potentially useful in the screening and evaluation of decision alternatives are also discussed. A collection of mathematical techniques will, however, remain only of theoretical interest. To be of practical assistance in the decision-making process they must be accessible to the decision maker. This can only be accomplished by means of a properly constructed computer system. A brief review of decision support systems, the field of study which is concerned with the application of computers to the decision making process, is followed by an investigation into the requirements that a computer system should fulfil if it is to be successful as a strategic-level decision aid. An overview is then given of "Stratagem", a computer system designed and built to integrate the mathematical modelling framework and the decision support concepts. Finally, two different applications of Stratagem are described to illustrate its potential role in strategic-level decision processes.</field><field name="date">1982</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2004</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Translation of New Zealand fiction into film</field><field name="creator">McDonnell, Brian</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the topic of literature-into-film adaptation by investigating the use of New Zealand fiction by film-makers in this country. It attempts this task primarily by examining eight case-studies of the adaptation process: five features designed for cinema release (Sleeping Dogs, A State of Siege, Sons for the Return Home, The Scarecrow and Other Halves), one feature-length television drama (the God Boy), and two thirty-minute television dramas (The Woman at the Store and Big Brother, Little Sister, from the series Winners and Losers). All eight had their first screenings in the ten-year period 1975-1985. For each of the case-studies, the following aspects are investigated: the original work of fiction, a practical history of the adaptation process (including interviews with people involved), and a study of changes made during the scripting and shooting stages. The films are analysed in detail, with a focus on visual and auditory style, in particular how these handle the themes, characterisation and style of the original works. Comparisons are made of the structures of the novels and the films. For each film, an especially close reading is offered of sample scenes (frequently the opening and closing scenes). The thesis is illustrated with still photographs &#8211; in effect, quotations from key moments &#8211; and these provide a focus to aspects of the discussion. Where individual adaptation problems existed in particular case-studies (for example, the challenge of the first-person narration of The God Boy), these are examined in detail. The interaction of both novels and films with the society around them is given emphasis, and the films are placed in their cultural and economic context - and in the context of general film history. For each film, the complex reception they gained from different groups (for example, reviewers, ethnic groups, gender groups, the authors of the original works) is discussed. All the aspects outlined above demonstrate the complexity of the responses made by New Zealand film-makers to the pressure and challenges of adaptation. They indicate the different answers they gave to the questions raised by the adaptation process in a new national cinema, and reveal their individual achievements.</field><field name="date">1986</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420200 Literature Studies::420201 New Zealand literature in English</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2010</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Out of mind, out of sight: unilateral spatial disorders in brain-damaged patients</field><field name="creator">Ogden, Jennifer Ann</field><field name="description">Hemineglect and unilateral extinction on double simultaneous stimulation in humans are neuropsychological disorders which sometimes follow a lesion to the cortex, subcortex or basal ganglia of one cerebral hemisphere. The main symptom is that the patient appears to neglect or be unaware of stimuli which impinge in one half of space relative to the patient's body. The side of space neglected is usually the side contralateral to the brain lesion. This thesis comprises a collection of studies on various aspects of these disorders. Experimental subjects were patients in the Neurology and Neurosurgical Wards of Auckland Hospital. All had clearly defined solitary unilateral brain lesions confirmed by Computerized Tomography. Chapter 1 provides a historical review of research in the area, defines concepts, reviews recent human and animal research on hemineglect and extinction, and outlines the different theories which have been proposed in order to explain hemineglect. Chapter 2 describes the methods used in neuropsychological testing, the criteria used in the selection of subjects, the etiologies of the different types of lesions sustained by the patient sample, and the neuropsychological tests used in the various studies. Chapter 3 is a study of the incidence and severity of visual hemineglect in a group of 56 patients with left-hemispheric lesions and 45 patients with right-hemispheric lesions. Five paper and pencil tests designed to measure the presence and severity of visual hemineglect were given to these patients. The incidence of hemineglect in the two groups did not differ significantly (50% and 44% in the left and right brain-damaged groups respectively). However, visual hemineglect was found to be more severe after right- than after left-hemispheric lesions. The two groups were found to differ significantly with respect to the loci of lesions most likely to result in hemineglect. In the right brain-damaged group most patients with hemineglect had posterior lesions, and in the left brain-damaged group most patients with hemineglect had anterior lesions. Possible reasons for this are discussed in terms of the effects the lateralization of language representation might have on the representation of spatial functions. Chapter 4 describes an experiment designed to determine whether patients with unilateral cerebral lesions neglect the contralesional sides of their mental images of the external world. This phenomenon has previously been observed for patients with left-sided visual neglect following right-hemispheric lesions. Twenty control subjects and 16 patients with right- and left-hemispheric lesions were involved in the experiment reported in this chapter. In the 'static' condition they viewed pairs of complex shapes displayed, one shape at a time, on a video-screen controlled by a computer. In the 'dynamic' condition the pairs of shapes apparently moved, one at a time, behind a narrow vertical slit. In both conditions the subject had to decide whether the two shapes of each pair were the same or different. In fact, some were the same, while some differed on the right and others on the left. In the 'dynamic' condition subjects had to construct spatial images from non-spatial external stimuli before they could make a same/different response. Both right and left brain-damaged groups demonstrated a significant neglect of the contralesional sides of their images of the shapes in that they often gave 'same' responses when the shapes actually differed on their contralesional sides. This had implications for normal imagery processes. It appears that at some advanced stage our images are mapped onto our hemispheres in an analogue fashion. That is, objects or parts of objects that we imagine to be on our left are mapped onto our right hemispheres, and those parts we imagine to be on our right are mapped onto our left hemispheres. If one hemisphere is damaged at a site which is essential to this imagery process, the contralateral half of the external stimulus that is being imagined will be degraded or neglected. Chapter 5 is a study of auditory extinction in unilaterally brain-damaged patients. In particular the phenomenon of ipsilateral auditory extinction is investigated in detail. Previous researchers have found ipsilateral auditory extinction for dichotically presented verbal stimuli following lesions only of the posterior left hemisphere. It has been hypothesized that a lesion in this area disconnects a posteriorly routed interhemispheric auditory pathway and that as a consequence, left-ear verbal input is unable to reach the left (speech) hemisphere. In Experiment 1, I tested 53 brain-damaged patients for extinction of digits on a dichotic listening task and found that patients with lesions wholly anterior to the central sulcus in the left hemisphere exhibited ipsilateral extinction as well as patients with posterior left-hemispheric lesions. This finding poses problems for the above hypothesis that relies on a posterior inter-hemispheric pathway, and alternatives to this hypothesis are discussed. In Experiment 2, I tested 16 patients for extinction of dichotically presented non-verbal material (tones) to ascertain whether ipsilateral extinction is restricted to verbal tasks. Ipsilateral extinction was not found on this task for either left or right brain-damaged patients. This suggested not only that ipsilateral auditory extinction is related to the disconnection or disruption of left-ear verbal input from the left (speech) hemisphere, but that the right hemisphere is not essential for the decoding and processing of non-verbal material. That is, I did not find right-ear ipsilateral extinction for non-verbal input in patients with right-hemispheric lesions. Chapter 6 is the study of multimodal hemineglect and extinction in patients with right- and left-hemispheric lesions. Clinical observations suggest that multimodal neglect may be a single disorder with a common underlying cause, and that the number of modalities affected is dependent upon the severity of the underlying deficit. For example, patients with hemiasomatagnosia (body hemineglect) are often observed to exhibit visual hemineglect and tactile extinction as well. I tested 50 patients for contralesional visual hemineglect, auditory extinction, tactile extinction and hemiasomatagnosia and computed phi correlation coefficients for pairs of disorders to see if there was any basis for supposing they were caused by the same underlying deficit. As the proportion of patients with hemineglect varied widely from modality to modality, possibly as a result of varying sensitivities of the tests used to measure the different forms of neglect, I also computed tetrachoric correlation coefficients. This measure corrects for varying proportions on the assumption that a normal distribution underlies each dichotomy. The results were inconclusive as the phi-coefficients were generally low and the tetrachoric coefficients very high. Because of the extreme difference between the two forms of correlation it was not possible to come to any conclusions about the 'true' correlations. It may be that at least some forms of hemineglect and extinction are independent of one another and are often found together in the same patients because the lesions overlap modality-specific areas, rather than because they result from the same underlying cause. Chapters 7 summarizes the studies described in Chapters 3, 4, 5 and 6, and the results are reviewed in the light of some of the more important theories of hemineglect.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320700 Neurosciences::320799 Neurosciences not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2011</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Performance in multiple schedules</field><field name="creator">Charman, Lesle Frances</field><field name="description">Four experiments are reported. Each experiment investigated a different variable which at sometime has been thought to influence performance in multiple schedules. Variable-interval schedules were used in all experiments and twelve pigeons served as subjects, six in the first two experiments and six in the third and fourth. The parametric data provided by each experiment were analysed using the generalized matching law and comparisons with findings in concurrent-schedule research were made. In Experiment 1 the effects of component durations and component reinforcer rates on multiple-schedule performance were investigated. Component duration did not affect sensitivity to the ratios of reinforcer rates. In Experiment 2 the effects of food deprivation and component reinforcer rates on multiple-schedule performance were investigated. Sensitivity to the ratios of reinforcer rates increased as deprivation was reduced. However, the data could only be explained by a model which assumed no direct component interaction. In Experiment 3 the discriminability of the stimuli customarily used in multiple-schedule research was investigated. The stimuli were perfectly discriminable. It was shown that the undermatching of response and reinforcer ratios typical of multiple-schedule performance was not the result of a failure to discriminate the stimuli signalling the components. In Experiment 4, a procedure for investigating time allocation in multiple schedules was introduced. The birds could switch in to the component in effect, and the components alternated at three minute intervals. Each switch in to a component gave acess to the schedule in effect for fixed brief periods. Ratios of component response rates showed typical multiple-schedule undermatching. However, a commonality in concurrent and multiple-schedule performance was revealed in respect to local or switched-in response rates. In both types of schedule, it appears that pigeons allocate time so as to equalize the local response rates. It is apparent that the differences reported between concurrent and multiple-schedules with respect to the sensitivity with which responses are distributed between the components as a function of the distribution of reinforcers are a result of the constraints imposed on the subjects' allocation of time in multiple schedules.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2013</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Parameters of Self Concept Self Efficacy and Programme Enrichment</field><field name="creator">Rawlinson, Catherine</field><field name="description">In this study a unique Enrichment Programme was designed, based upon the four curriculum models of Renzulli, Betts, Treffinger and Feldhusen. Pedagogical strategies to reinforce the development of children&#8217;s academic self concept internal locus of control, self efficacy and demonstration of potential special abilities formed an integral part of this Enrichment Programme. Instead of pre-selecting children to participate in the Enrichment Programme, this study explored the effects of changing the direction of the identification process for Children with Special Abilities. As a result, all children in the Treatment classes participated in varying stages of enrichment. The theory underpinning this intervention design was based upon Bandura's theory of reciprocal determinism and his principle of bi-directionality. In this study a pre/post experimental design was used with both the Treatment and Control groups. Seven inner city Auckland Primary schools were randomly selected to take part in this study. The Treatment group consisted of four Standards 2-4 classes, the Control group consisted of three Standards 2-4 classes. During intervention the Treatment group worked with their teachers who also attended two introductory workshops relating to the Enrichment Programme. The Control group did not participate in the Enrichment Programme; instead they worked on their regular class programme. Measures of children&#8217;s general academic self concept, locus of control and self efficacy were obtained using three questionnaires. Teachers in the Treatment and Control groups also completed an adapted version of the Renzulli/Hartman Special Ability Scale, for each child in their class at the beginning and end of the intervention phase. When combining scores for all areas measured, MANOVA showed that following intervention there was a difference between the Treatment and Control group results but this difference was not significant at the .05 level. MANOVA showed that a significant Ability effect occurred in this study regardless of whether the children were in the Treatment or Control groups. Ethnic and SES differences were also obtained but these were not significant. ANOVA using Split Plot Design for Repeated Measures focused upon the separate scores in each of the cognitive/personal and behaviour performance areas measured. In Perception of General Academic Ability neither the Treatment nor Control group made a significant increase, however a significant Ability effect was obtained. The Treatment and Control groups did not make significant increase in any of the five areas of Locus of Control and there were no significant Ability, Ethnic or SES effects in this area. The Control group made a significant increase in Self Efficacy and a significant SES effect was obtained. The Treatment group made a highly significant increase in Teachers&#8217; Recognition of Children with Special Abilities and significant Ability and SES effects were also obtained in this area. A number of Treatment groups made increases which approached significance in the area of Teachers&#8217; Recognition of Children with Special Abilities. This study illustrates that it is possible to design a class-based Enrichment Programme which enables all children to participate in varying stages of enrichment and which incorporates pedagogical strategies to reinforce academic self concept. The self efficacy results confirm Bandura&#8217;s premise that reciprocal influences do not occur simultaneously and that it takes time for a causal factor to exert its influence. This study shows that changing the direction of the identification process, by including all children in a class-based Enrichment Programme can be an effective strategy for enhancing Teachers&#8217; Recognition of Special Abilities for children from different Ability, Ethnic and SES groups.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2014</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Potential precursors to the development of phonological awareness in preschool children</field><field name="creator">Arrow, Alison Wendy</field><field name="description">Phonological awareness is one of the most important metacognitive skills needed for literacy development. However, the relationships between preschool phonological awareness and pre-literacy skills are only just beginning to be examined. An important area is the study of potential precursors to phonological awareness. The current research proposed that phonological awareness develops along a continuum of linguistic awareness beginning with syllables and moving towards the smallest level of the phoneme. In the current research, potential precursors were examined in two studies. The first study was an examination of preschool phonological awareness in a sample of 110 New Zealand four-year-old children with no formal literacy instruction but who had a range of pre-literacy skills including 12 children who could read one or more words. The second study examined how literacy instruction influenced the development of phoneme awareness by independently assessing the role of learning to read and the role of learning to spell by teaching non-readers to read 8 CVC words or to spell the same 8 CVC words, but not to read and spell. The results found that rime and phoneme awareness both contributed to a latent variable of phonological awareness and that they each had different potential precursors. Receptive vocabulary explained the most variance in rime awareness with a small association of letter-name knowledge and own-name spelling while rime awareness developed more in children who learnt new words in the intervention. Rime awareness contributed to phoneme awareness along with letter-sound knowledge. When children were taught to read using blending this led to task specific phoneme awareness gains only. Phoneme awareness did not contribute to word-learning in the experimental conditions, with the only learning occurring in the spelling conditions. Letter-name knowledge had a relationship with the acquisition of orthographic representations. Letter-sound knowledge had a relationship with phoneme and letter-level attempts at unfamiliar words. This suggests that children with good letter-name and letter-sound knowledge have both orthographic knowledge and alphabetic strategies available in early word reading and spelling. Results are discussed in terms of their theoretical and practical implications emphasising the role of alphabet knowledge in early literacy acquisition.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2362</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Global Capitalism and the Revival of Ethnic Traditionalism in New Zealand: The Emergence of Tribal-Capitalism</field><field name="creator">Rata, Elizabeth , 1952-</field><field name="description">The social and economic restructuring accompanying increasing globalisation has provided new opportunities and new limits for social and ethnic movements in New Zealand as elsewhere. The purpose of this thesis is to establish the theory of tribal-capitalism through an examination of the responses to these changing global economic circumstances that have characterised the Maori ethnification, indigenisation and retribalisation movements since the 1970s. Although both the initial 'prefigurative' and the later 'strategic'(Breines, 1980:421) routes to tino rangatiratanga ('Maori sovereignty') were attempts to restore traditional social relations and secure political and economic autonomy from the dominant Pakeha society, the projects are distinguished by different approaches. On the one hand the 'prefigurative' traditionalist project indicted both capitalism and Pakeha society as its exponents sought a return to the precapitalist social relations of the pre-Contact era. On the other hand exponents of the 'strategic' project sought to establish a concordat with capitalist Pakeha society based upon the assumption that a capitalist economy could be made compatible with Maori political and cultural autonomy. It is argued that neither project, 'prefigurative' traditionalism nor the 'strategic march through the institutions of capitalism', achieved the objective of tino rangatiratanga. Irrespective of approach, Maori ethnification, indigenisation and retribalisation became reshaped and reconstituted by the conditions that made the movements possible and that shaped them in decisive ways. These tino rangatiratanga movements emerged from the institutional channels enabled by Pakeha bicultural idealists and given substance by the Waitangi Tribunal as a tribal-capitalist regime of accumulation characterised by exploitative class relations and reified communal relations. An extensive range of case studies is employed to provide evidence that tests the hypothesis of the emergence of tribal-capitalism from out of the projects that attempted to retain the traditional in a world dominated by capitalist relations. Despite the structural opportunities provided by Pakeha bicultural idealists, and despite the different approaches of the Maori tino rangatiratanga projects, it was not possible to restore communal relations of production. Objective forces, rather than internal miscalculation, ineptitude or corruption, brought about the failure as firstly 'prefigurative' and then 'strategic' projects became doomed attempts to sidestep class location within capitalist structures. The various studies examine the ways in which the 'prefigurative' and 'strategic' projects not only led to the transformation of the ethnification and indigenisation movements into the new class formations of tribal-capitalism, but actually became constitutive of the class fractions that define the regime. The dialectical interactive of agency and structure which transformed the projects became a reconstituting and shaping mechanism of change. First the study of the Pakeha new class's bicultural project grounds the later studies by locating the institutional inclusion of Maori indigenous particularity in the universalism of the new class humanists. Biculturalism established relatively benign conditions for the tino rangatiratanga projects by providing both opportunities and resources for Maori development. It is in the retribalising form of that development that an indigenous version of the capitalist regime of accumulation is located. The next three sections of the thesis examine the 'prefigurative' and 'strategic' routes of this indigenous particularity into the new inclusive structures in studies of: a reviving Maori family, an ascendant tribe, a separate Maori education system and the creation of the national Maori fishing industry. The outcomes of each study are examined to trace the failure of both approaches as particular groups within the retribalisation movement developed new and exclusive relationships to the traditional lands, waters and knowledge. The concluding section contrasts culturalist theories of the Maori tino rangatiratanga projects with the hypothesis of the emergence of tribal-capitalism advanced in this thesis. The claim that cultural strength can resist the imposition of capitalist class relations is found not to be sustained.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::379900 Other Studies In Human Society::379902 Indigenous studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2015</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The PPTA and the State: from militant professionals to bargaining agent : a study of rational opportunism</field><field name="creator">Jesson, Jocelyn Gavin</field><field name="description">This thesis using oral historiographic techniques examines the changing role and function of a teachers' union during changes in the nature of a national State which can also be related to changing forms of capitalism. The teachers' union is New Zealand Post-Primary Teachers Association (the secondary school teachers' union) and the period of particular focus is between 1983 and the beginning of 1993. This is the period of a crisis in the New Zealand State during which the character of the national State was moved from what has been described as a 'wage earners' Welfare State towards a more residual form providing a 'modest safety net'. The financial and the labour market were deregulated to become more free of direct State involvement. The administration of education was changed and the individual schools' elected Boards of Trustees were made responsible for the provision of schooling. The role of PPTA in the State is moved structurally in this time. As a professional association before the changes, PPTA had both opportunity for input into the mandate of education, as well as the possibility of creating implementation pressure through political action. As a bargaining agent, the input role of PPTA to decisions in education was limited to addressing members' concerns at the school level. The restructuring of education and of the labour market, PPTA was both an object to be acted on and a participant obstructing the changes. This thesis presents what is a PPTA view of those changes. PPTA formed a central part of the education structures which were to be transformed by the economic liberal project. The survival of PPTA demonstrates the extent to which the project was not completed and the resistance of PPTA was one of the reasons why the project in education could not be completed. The thesis is in three parts. Part one is a regulationist-derived periodisation of the historical development of the New Zealand wage earners Welfare State and education. This is followed by a consideration of the economic-liberal challenge to this State Part two considers the development of PPTA's professional project and the possibilities presented through different arenas. Part three focuses on the changing nature of the State labour market policy and PPTA's activity in that. The changing strategies and tactics of PPTA's 'professional project', the thesis argues, occur under changing political conditions and are an example of Offe's concept of rational opportunism</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2016</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identity, difference and politics: a poststructuralist investigation</field><field name="creator">Chueh, Ho-chia</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the ways in which concepts of binary opposition are elaborated in some of the key contemporary theories on difference and identity. This project contributes to the emerging scholarship on the notion of emancipation and empowerment in educational theory. It explores discourses of difference and identity that are engaged with constructions and re-construction of the notions of Self and Other. This thesis develops a systematic analysis of texts with arguments on political performance of representation and agency. The thesis begins with an examination of Hegel's thesis on the relationship between the lord and the bondsman which is implemented in the political discourses of John Rex and Paulo Freire. It continues to examine political theses with emphasis on the relationship between the mind and the body; examinations include theses offered by Robert Miles and Frantz Fanon. This thesis also explores the methodological value of concepts of binary opposition; it explores Claude L&#233;vi-Strauss' theory on cultural differences and examines Iris M. Young and Chantal Mouffe's discourses on the 'politics of difference'. This thesis further explores Jacques Derrida's notions of deconstruction and diff&#233;rence together with analyses and critiques of Homi Bhabha's and Gayatri Spivak's reconstruction of concepts of binary oppositions. This thesis calls for a consideration of Derrida's thoughts on the political as an approach to the understanding difference and identity. I propose a double reading of the texts examined in this thesis: on the one hand, they are genealogical analyses to understand and criticise the ways in which knowledge on (racial and cultural) difference and identity have been constructed. On the other hand, they are given affirmations of political significance with their performative effectiveness that language allows them to achieve.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330101 Educational psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2019</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Maori Settlement on South Kaipara Peninsula</field><field name="creator">Spring-Rice, Wynne</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370300 Anthropology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2020</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Rhetoric of mysticism</field><field name="creator">Adams, Peter James</field><field name="description">Research into mystical experience has to date relied primarily on retrospective self reports of mystical states. Analysis of such reports assumes a direct correspondence between their content and the content of the experiences. But experiencers themselves often express dissatisfaction with the capacity of language to convey these states, and the language they do choose to use is typically vague and ambiguous. The current dissertation argues that vagueness is not an accidental nor an unfortunate feature of mystical communications. Because of difficulties in direct expression, mystical communicators rely on the active and imaginative participation of the listener/reader to complete the expression. A theory of provocative gaps is developed to explain how this operates. A "gap" is conceived of as an open receptacle in linguistic space. It provides a site within a discourse upon which receptive listeners/readers can insert content from their own experience. Gaps can be created by blatant omissions of content, but in written descriptions are more likely to occur in indirect forms by exploiting subtleties in grammar and meaning. A simple diagrammatic system is developed for explaining the gap-provoking potential of several major rhetorical strategies. Three studies were designed to explore whether and at what frequency written testimonials of mystical experience exploit a selection of 31 of these gap-provoking strategies: the first study exposed their high frequency in extracts by well-known published mystics; the second indicated similarly high frequencies for the average person's description; and the third found significantly higher rates in mystical testimonials than in descriptions by the same participants of dream or travel experiences. A similar use of vagueness can be found in the language of hypnotic trance induction, and as an adjunct to the second study, the hypnotic susceptibility of 81 subjects was assessed and results indicated that subjects with mystical inclinations were more susceptible to hypnosis than those without. The general support of the studies for a theory of provocative gaps suggests that the notion of intentional vagueness could have useful application in the study of other types of communication, including: the media, art criticism, teaching, psychotherapy and academic discourse.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2021</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From the Eccentric to the Essential: a Study of Hardy's Imagery and his Debt to the Visual Arts</field><field name="creator">Batten, Juliet</field><field name="description">Hardy&#8217;s visual imagery reveals both the eye of the draughtsman and the eye of the artist.

Melmoth is included, but because it has dominated previous discussion of Maturin, I have chosen to concentrate on his neglected novels, Fatal Revenge, The Wild Irish Boy, The Milesian Chief, Women, or Pour et Contre, and The Albigenses. Special attention is given here to Maturin's two volumes of sermons (a valuable but seldom used source of information about his religious philosophy) and, more generally, to the theme of religion, which links many of his novels. This aspect of Gothic literature deserves a closer study than it usually receives, particularly in the work of Maturin who was a minister of religion. My thesis proposes a new interpretation of Fatal Revenge based on the parallel that Maturin developed between the use of superstition by Orazio and its use by the Catholic church. In The Albigenses there is a similar parallel between the outlaws and the supposedly holy Crusaders. Maturin took the Catholic church so often as his subject, not simply because it provided a colourful, stereotyped background (as some have suggested), but because it was a context in which he could seriously investigate the psychological pressures that produced (and still produce) conformity, extremism, and sexual violence. While his studies of oppressive societies may at times remind us of twentieth-century works such as 1984 or The Trial, Maturin's fiction is very much a part of its age. After a chapter that explores the history of 'the Gothic', my thesis focuses on the particular context of Maturin's period, mapping it initially by examining the responses to his work that appeared in print during his lifetime. Those reviews and essays make visible the complex field of forces in which Maturin worked. The Gothic novel developed in an age of more than usual ferment - literary, religious, and political - including the first phase of what we would today describe as feminist rebellion. All this was accompanied, as we can see from the criticism, by a strong conservative reaction in defence of the threatened values. The present study emphasizes the ways in which Maturin's work shared the new energies associated with change, even though it also displayed signs of ambivalence. I consider the reasons for this ambivalence and argue that in many cases there is subtlety in what appears at first to be confusion. Maturin's fiction was a late addition to the Gothic tradition, but its particular kinds of complexity - such as its psychological depth - made it an important development of the genre and linked it with other innovative writing of the period. Some admirers of Maturin have sought to play down the Gothic element in his work, which is understandable in view of the low esteem in which the genre has been held. The Gothic has often been seen, for example, as a confused rehearsal for Romanticism. While acknowledging the variety of Maturin's novels, I have sought to emphasise their continuing links with the Gothic genre and its special energies. During the past decade, new forms of Gothic criticism have appeared that treat the subject with greater seriousness. Today, interest in the Gothic genre seems to be springing to life again, and its relevance to our own time (which is also a period of complex social change and widespread ambivalence) has become clearer. I have attempted to contribute to this new type of criticism by pointing out the value of Maturin's studies of oppression and his ability to go beyond stereotypes in his treatment of women characters. I have also suggested some links between Gothic literature and feminist science-fiction writing today. In general, the aim of this thesis has been to consider the most mature Gothic fiction (such as that of Maturin) not merely as fantasy but as an expanded vision of reality.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420100 Language Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2024</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New patches on old cloth: some New Zealand Catholic lay women&#8217;s experiences of overseas mission 1963-2002</field><field name="creator">Atkinson, Diana Mary</field><field name="description">New Zealand Catholic lay women have actively participated in overseas missionary work for over forty years. From the 1960s, the Catholic Overseas Volunteer Organization (COVS), under the auspices of the New Zealand bishops, enabled lay women to respond to missionary bishops&#8217; requests for assistance. Overseas, they worked in a range of mission stations with a variety of religious orders. Their experiences are the focus of this study. Their stories have not been told previously and part of the intent is to make their work visible, particularly, to add to the histories of New Zealand women, Catholic women and Christian missionary women more generally. This thesis contends that their overseas experiences were far from partnership and collaboration and have subsequently failed to provide opportunities for wider participation in the New Zealand Church. Vatican documents, archival material, interviews with fifty ex-volunteers and the two lay women directors of the organization provide the data for this thesis. Feminist theology forms the theoretical base and narrative analysis the interpretive tool. There were three volunteer cohorts: young, single volunteers, mothers with dependent children and older women. Most volunteers grew up in the 1950s and 1960s, came from Catholic homes, attended Catholic schools and were actively involved in New Zealand parishes. Overseas, the women continued lives of faith and service, contributing needed and valuable skills. Many younger women enjoyed professional opportunities and their missionary community. It was harder to fit in to a mission station as Catholic mothers or older women and many found it difficult to establish a missionary identity, to be accepted as part of the team. In all groups, there was great satisfaction when experiences matched expectations. The missionary insights and/or skills of these ex-volunteers have generally not been sought by their New Zealand parishes and they are, for the most part, an unappreciated and neglected resource. Lay women&#8217;s experiences of overseas mission point to a need for change &#8211; lay women seek not only to participate but to be valued partners in their Church.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::440000 Philosophy and Religion::440200 Religion and Religious Traditions</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2025</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'A Toaster with Pictures': The Deregulation of Broadcasting in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Cocker, Alan</field><field name="description">'A toaster with pictures' was the characterisation of television by the former chairman of the United States Federal Communications Commission and advocate of broadcasting deregulation, Mark Fowler. It encapsulates the view of the neo-liberal reformers who set about to deregulate broadcasting as part of the wide-ranging economic attack on the structures of state regulation. Broadcasting was a consumer industry like any other. It conformed to the rules of economic behaviour and performed at its optimum in an environment of a free market.    This thesis traces the deregulation of broadcasting in New Zealand from its theoretical origins, to its adoption by policy advisors of the New Zealand Treasury, and its legislative enactment by the Government in the late l980s and early 1990s. But the account also traverses wider than those narrow boundaries. It is argued that in order to understand why this country undertook such a thoroughgoing reform of the broadcasting sector it is necessary to look at its history and account for the apparent wholesale rejection of the previous structures which were portrayed as regulated public service broadcasting.    It is also essential to the story of broadcasting deregulation in New Zealand to determine why this country was a pathfinder of reform. The essential conditions which enabled the speedy implementation of the policy whilst in other nations the reform process in broadcasting was stalled, only partially implemented, or rejected. The comparative overview also brings into focus the arguments of the opponents of deregulating this &#8216;particular' or 'peculiar' industry with its social and cultural role in society.    As New Zealand was the first nation deliberately to enact the deregulation of broadcasting, the final sections of the thesis look at the 'model' and assess its impact. The reforms have led to a new marketplace of broadcasting in which the audience is viewed as consumers rather than citizens. The dismantling of the social contract in broadcasting between the state and citizens and its replacement by supposedly individual contracts between broadcasters and consumers is, it is suggested, dysfunctional for democratic civil society.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360100 Political Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2026</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physiological and Biochemical Adaptation in the Nitrogen Nutrition of Spirodela Oligorrhiza</field><field name="creator">Ferguson, A.

Data were provided by 184 diversified New Zealand manufacturing plants- Quality is defined as the degree of conformance to specifications. The first phase of the research was the construction of a theoretical model to incorporate the impacts of quality on manufacturing performance, manufacturing productivity and business performance. The relationships of the model are based on the quality management literature. The second phase of the research was the design and administration of a survey instrument for the collection of empirical performance data. The data were then used to evaluate the relationships represented in the model. The final phase of the research used structural equations modelling in order to evaluate the relationships of the model. Quality was found to have significant and positive impacts on operational performance measures for process utilization, process output, production costs, work-in-process inventory levels and on-time delivery rate. The analysis found that change in quality level was most strongly associated with change in process utilization. The findings for the impacts of quality on operational performance were compatible with the quality management literature. The impacts of quality on business performance given by structural equations analysis were significant and positive for productivity-induced improvements of quality. Generally, the support for the impacts of quality on business performance which occur through other aspects of, operational performance was not significant. The limitations of the study were specified. The implications of the findings of the study for manufacturers were reviewed, along with the directions for future research.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2028</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The challenge for tomorrow's schools: learning to be responsive</field><field name="creator">Timperley, Helen</field><field name="description">Changes recently introduced in the administration of New Zealand education were intended to ensure that schools would become more responsive to their communities. Many aspects of school governance were devolved from a central government bureaucracy to Boards of Trustees at each school and greater choice of school was given to parents. In this thesis I examine the assumptions underlying these policy changes and propose a model of the processes necessary for the development of school responsiveness. The research progressed over four phases. In the first I survey beliefs and practices in 38 Auckland schools about the new school-community partnership established by the devolution of governance responsibility to the Boards of Trustees. This survey was followed by a second more extensive questionnaire survey on the same topic in ten of these schools. The role educational values might play in parents' choice of school and their perceptions of school responsiveness were addressed in a survey of five secondary schools in the second phase. The third phase comprised case studies of two schools which had contrasting community-school relationships. In one school the principal valued a close partnership with the community, yet the school roll had fallen steadily over a five year period. In the other school, which enjoyed a rapidly increasing roll, the principal believed educational decisions should be left to the professionals. The case studies investigated this apparent contradiction, that the partnership relationship between parents and professionals which was designed to increase school responsiveness appeared to be unrelated to roll trends, a possible indicator of responsiveness. In the fourth phase I describe and evaluate how the school with the declining roll attempted to become more responsive to its community. The research results show that the concept of responsiveness contained in the initial policy documents was simplistic in that neither a community-school partnership nor school choice was sufficient to improve responsiveness to the community. I propose a more focused concept of responsiveness than that contained in the policy documents and identify two critical attributes of this concept; the school's educational values and parents' concerns about school practice. Parents choose schools because they perceive that the professionals share their educational values. I suggest that establishing cohesive values, both between home and school and within the school itself, is educationally desirable and critical to achieving responsiveness. This cohesion, however, should be enacted in a way which respects the diversity within the school population if some students are not to be alienated by the values of the majority. The second attribute of responsiveness, acting on valid concerns of parents, involves parents in decisions about school practice of greatest importance to them. Vague calls for consultation on school policy do not achieve this aim. My proposed concept of responsiveness does not assume that parents dominate areas previously reserved for professional prerogative, but rather that parents and professionals jointly determine policy in those areas critical to achieving responsiveness. School-community partnerships and school choice will not result in responsiveness unless they serve as catalysts for professional learning about the values and concerns of the community. This learning is enhanced if schools encourage parents to exercise influence and engage in joint problem-solving. Achieving school responsiveness depends more on the attitudes and skills of the participants in the partnership than on the structural changes enacted in the recent legislation.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330104 Educational policy, administration and management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2029</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An evaluation of three treatment programmes for alcoholism: an experimental study with six- and eighteen-month follow-ups</field><field name="creator">Howden-Chapman, Philippa</field><field name="description">To evaluate the efficacy of a typical range of New Zealand alcoholism treatment programmes, 113 male and female alcoholics were randomly assigned after inpatient detoxification to one of three programmes that provided decreasing amounts and intensity of treatment: a six-week inpatient programme, a six-week outpatient programme, and a single confrontational interview where patients were referred to non-hospital services. Those who refused or dropped out of treatment were followed up in a semi-control group. A broad range of patient measures were taken at intake and 6 and 18 months afterwards, when 86% of subjects were located. No treatment was more effective than another (in terms of statistically significant differences) in helping subjects to abstain or drink less, nor did any treatment appear to be more effective than another in promoting social and psychological recovery. Furthermore, those who stayed in treatment did not show significantly more long-term improvement than those who refused or dropped out of treatment. Two programmes did significantly reduce the alcohol consumption of the alcoholics assigned to them at the 6-month follow-up compared to those who dropped out, but by 18 months there was no longer a significant treatment effect. Although the two follow-ups showed individual drinking patterns were unstable, on average almost half the subjects located had improved either because they had abstained or were drinking moderately. There were only small gains on direct measures of social adjustment. Compared to the general New Zealand population, subjects were more likely to be divorced or separated, manual workers and unemployed. Nonetheless, these characteristics did not contribute to predicting the subjects' response to treatment. Multiple regression equations explained between 33% and 57% of the variance in amount drunk after treatment. The patients' own predictions of their chances of drinking again, evidence of electrocardiographic abnormalities and the patients&#8217; net weekly incomes, were more consistent variables in explaining drinking levels and predicting abstinence in the long term than the demographic and psychological variables. Variables that were significant in explaining drinking levels were often not significant when it came to predicting abstinence and vice versa. Abstinent subjects felt more often than drinkers that they had achieved the goals that they had set themselves aria by the final follow-up there were many positive differences in lifestyle apparent. Thus, in the final outcome, although abstinence was clearly demonstrated to be a worthwhile goal, no treatment was significantly more effective than another in helping to achieve this goal. Patients who underwent treatment apparently showed greater recovery than those who dropped out of treatment but this result was also not statistically significant.</field><field name="date">1984</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2033</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Empirical Analysis of the Perceived Skills and Charateristics of Managerial Effectiveness</field><field name="creator">Page, Carole</field><field name="description">The primary purpose of this research was to establish whether different perspectives on managerial effectiveness could be integrated to derive a common core of skills and characteristics. The different perspectives include management theory, strategic management and international business perspectives, and the competency-based approach to management effectiveness in the United Kingdom, The United States, and New Zealand. The research programme used a blend of quantitative and qualitative techniques. Each phase of research is supported by a review of the international literature and empirical field work conducted in New Zealand. A research tool relatively new to management research, Concept Mapping (Trochim, 1989a, 1989b), was to allow qualitative verbal statements to be described in terms of both quantitative and spatial relationships. A singular advantage of Concept Mapping is that collection and analysis of data is conducted without imposing research constructs at any stage, and a distillation of a core set of skills and characteristics can be derived through the reiterative process of Concept Mapping. In addition to Concept Mapping sessions with practicing managers and management educators and developers, two national surveys were conducted. In essence, the research builds a framework of the factors influencing managerial effectiveness through literature reviews and empirical work to generate a predictor variable list then tests that list for predictive strength. The primary outcomes of the research were: 1) the identification of a set of skills and characteristics that discriminate classes of effectiveness and ineffectiveness; and 2) the provision of a conceptual framework for analysing the similarities and differences between models of managerial effectiveness.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2035</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Poetry in New Zealand 1850-1930</field><field name="creator">Kingsbury, Anthony Leicester</field><field name="description">Poetry in New Zealand, nearly everyone agrees, came to birth around 1920, or 1930, or 1940; in fact, round about when those who are now the grand old men of New Zealand letters were boys.

A thorough examination of the literature on small groups, coupled with field research on the implementation of teamwork in the New Zealand operations of a large multinational provides insights about how members of a team think. It is shown that the perception of membership by team members influences their ability to make effective use of resources and make informed decisions, not only within the team, but also with regard to its impact on the organisation. Social identity theory provides a theoretical model for the psychological processes of team membership. The processes of categorisation, self-categorisation and social identification are mapped against the introduction of teamwork over a period of two years to assess whether or not they are relevant. The results from surveys of and interviews with senior staff members support the processes described by social identity theory, where groups can operate as separate cognitive and emotional units as relevant for the management of teams at work. Because of the unique psychological processes, team members at work have to be interacted with (and be given information) differently than individuals in order to behave as a high-performing team. This study develops the implications of social identity theory for the introduction and management of teams at work, leading to high performance for the organisation.

These three different perspectives are seen, first, at the level of the empirical evidence of concentration and centralisation over time, and second, at the level of theoretical explanation and lastly, at the level of the sociology of knowledge, that is, how the theories themselves locate within economic cycles. The two empirical bases of this study are the survey of the top thirty companies directors and the top thirty companies networks of.1966, 1976 and 1986. A centrality analysis used on the latter three data sources, found that at the peak of the longwave (1966) when accumulation was high within the protected New Zealand economy, there were few corporate interlocks, suggesting that centralisation (the destruction of already formed capitals) was not a problem. But by the economic downturn (1986) corporate interlocks had proliferated reflecting the insecure nature of the corporate economy in crisis. The main conclusions drawn from the survey and the centralisation data sources positively corroborate the Marxist thesis that the corporate class fraction (as agents of capitalism) are in a free market economy as much directive as reactive to the state, that banks operate at direct and indirect levels of intervention on this class fraction and that there is some evidence of corporate class cohesion.</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370100 Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2038</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecology and Conservation of The Ouvea Parakeet, Eunymphicus cornutus uvaeensis (Loyalty Islands, New Caledonia)</field><field name="creator">Robinet, Olivier Louis</field><field name="description">Whole Document restricted for copyright reasons.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2040</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A mathematical and comparative study on cerebellar control of vestibular reflexes</field><field name="creator">Paulin, M. G. (Michael Geoffrey)</field><field name="description">The first aim of this thesis is an introduction to some basic aspects of multivariate control theory which are relevant to the question of how the brain controls movements. A regulator is a device which forces a system to follow a specified trajectory in the presence of perturbations which might cause it to diverge from that trajectory. Regulation involves constructing an additional control input which depends upon the difference between the actual system state and the desired state. This requires the construction of a state estimate from raw data about system input and output. For effective state estimation, the sensor input gain to the state estimator needs to be time-varying. Under certain assumptions, the appropriate input gain can be specified analytically. The feedback regulation signal can then be constructed as a function of the state estimate. For effective regulation, the gain of the feedback function has to vary during maneuvers. Under certain assumptions an appropriate feedback gain can be specified analytically. The state observer input gain equations have a simple relationship to the feedback gain equations, so that gain specification is essentially the same task in each case. Cerebellar research has been dominated for the past 25 years by the theories of James Albus and David Marr. These mathematicians proposed similar models in which certain synapses in the cerebellar cortex are continuously modified by experience in such a way that movements which are consistently repeated under a given set of circumstances come to be performed automatically by the cerebellum. Much experimental work has focussed on the role of the vestibulo-cerebellum in fine control and learning of the vestibulo-ocular reflex. The state of the art along this line is formally described by Fujita's adaptive filter model of the cerebellar cortex. In chapter 4 it is shown that a basic feature of Fujita's model is inconsistent with available evidence. The 'Tensorial theory of brain function' is discussed in chapter 5. This is a novel theory of brain function which has been used in an attempt two explain cerebellar function. The attempt is a failure, based on sophistocated misconceptions and flawed by poor reasoning and clumsy analysis. The approach serves to confuse rather than clarify the question of cerebellar function. The final chapter of the first part of the thesis presents a basis for a new approach to cerebellar function based on the engineering theory of control of multivariate dynamical systems. It is proposed that the cerebellum is involved in movement regulation by controlling the gains of brainstem motor pathways, and in mapping the animal's environment by controlling the gains of sensory inputs to the midbrain. While learning undoubtedly does occur in the cerebellar cortex, this is not specifically a 'learning device', as commonly conceived. The second part of the thesis is concerned with the development and application of a method of system identification for characterising the dynamics of the vestibulo-ocular reflex and its components in an elasmobranch. The chosen method involves pulse-rate modulated bilateral electrical stimulation of the horizontal semicircular canal ampullary nerves. This produces a synthetic vestibulo-ocular reflex in a stationary preparation. The stimulus pattern is a pseudorandom binary sequence of pulse rates, so that cross-correlation of the stimulus pattern with the response signal gives a Unit Impulse Response dynamic signature for the system. Computer software for signal generation, recording, analysis and display was written by the author. The identification system was applied first to characterise the dynamics of the eye movement response to horizontal canal ampullary nerve stimulation, and compare this to the dynamics of the eye motor plant alone. The eye motor preparation acts as a first order low-pass filter with a time constant of about 0.2 seconds (16&#176;C), while the ampullary preparation acts as a second order low-pass filter with a dominant time constant of about 0.75 seconds (16&#176;C). Central pathways of the elasmobranch vestibulo-ocular reflex extend the time constant of the motor plant by a factor of 3-4, as in other animals. Eye movements predicted by fitted linear models accurately mimic eye movements recorded during experiments, suggesting both that central pathways of the reflex operate normally during this somewhat un-naturally evoked response and that the identification procedure is effective. Furthermore, combination of the ampullary nerve to eye movement transfer function obtained in this study, with head rotation to ampullary nerve transfer functions obtained by other workers, gives a consistent picture of elasmobranch vestibulo-ocular reflex function predicting compensatory eye movements in the band 0.2 - 4.0 Hz., and perhaps higher. The identification method has also been applied to produce models of vestibulocerebellar Purkinje cell dynamics during electrically evoked vestibular eye movements. Linear identification gives a poor characterisation of Purkinje cell activity during the high frequency vestibulo-ocular reflex. This is incompatible with linear phase-compensator models of the cerebellar cortex, but consistent with the reflex gain modulation theory of cerebellar function advocated in the first part of the thesis.</field><field name="date">1985</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2041</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Proteins and transcripts involved in mini-F maintenance</field><field name="creator">Phua, Sin Hen</field><field name="description">The aim of the work described in this thesis was to understand the maintenance systems of the F plasmid of Escherichia coli. The work was centered on the biochemical studies of the primary replicative fragment of F, f5. 1. From an analysis of the protein species produced by miniF-vector hybrid plasmids in E. coli minicells, seven proteins were found to be encoded by f5. Similarly, the secondary F replicon, f7, was found to code for at least three proteins. 2. The f5-specific proteins were further characterized by determining their isoelectric points and molecular weights in two-dimensional gels. 3. Using transposon-induced and deletion mutants of miniF, the structural genes of the seven f5 proteins were mapped. 4. Analysis of the amounts of proteins made by transposon-insertion mutants revealed that some miniF proteins control the expression of miniF genes. These results suggested possible mechanisms of coordination between the three f5 maintenance systems (ccd, rep and par). 5. The polarities of the f5 transcripts synthesized in minicells were determined by hybridization with f5 DNA cloned in to single-stranded phage M13 vectors. The results were consistent with the gene mapping data, in that the directions of transcription of the seven f5 structural genes are uniformly rightwards. 6. In addition, the RNA-DNA hybridization experiments revealed the existence of untranslated leftward transcripts produced from the regions involved in f5 replication and partition.</field><field name="date">1984</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2042</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Children's understanding of sexual orientation</field><field name="creator">Saphira, Miriam Edna</field><field name="description">In 1989 New Zealand is considering legislation which will make discrimination against lesbians, transexuals and gay men illegal. To increase children's understanding of sexual orientations educators need to have some knowledge of what children already understand and how children use their information. The three studies address this issue in spite of the difficulties in obtaining permission to ask children about homosexuality. A homophobia questionnaire was administered to 290 first year psychology students. They were also asked to recall their childhood feelings about gay people when they first met a homosexual and first understood the concept of homosexuality. Older women were the least homophobic. A second study was carried out with 5, 7, and 11 year old children in three schools with a family discrimination task. A third of the 11 year olds could label the couples of the same sex as gay, homosexual or lesbian and gave more positive items to the two-parent families. A third study involved 31 children from two-parent families and 32 from lesbian families. Out of the 63 six to ten year olds, 27 could define 'homosexual' and 'gay' and 37 could define lesbian. Twenty could use a strategy to recognise a lesbian. Although social discrimination against non-heterosexual orientations placed some constraints on this research, it yielded preliminary evidence for the emergence of children's understanding of sexual orientations between 7 and 11 years of age.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2043</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular and genetic analysis of RepA from the P307 RepFIB replicon</field><field name="creator">Spiers, Andrew J. (Andrew Julian)</field><field name="description">The work in this Thesis concerns the replication control system of the P307 plasmid RepFIB replicon. The basic replicon occupies &#8776; 1.6kb of DNA and contains a single large open reading frame (repA) flanked on either side by a series DNA repeat elements. The organisational structure of fie replicon has placed RepFIB into the Step function class of replicons. The placement of RepFIB within this group, as well as a strong homology between RepFIB and mini-P1, has resulted in a series of predictions concerning the control elements of RepFIB replication. The aim of this work was to test some of these predictions and to characterise the fundamental control elements utilised by the replicon. This Thesis describes three different active promoter elements found embedded within the repeat elements flanking repA. Although the functional significance of two of the promoter is unknown (orip and EFp), the third is responsible for the expression of RepA and has been designated 'repAp'. All three promoters are sensitive to RepA in trans, demonstrating that repA is autoregulated and that RepA is a DNA-binding protein capable of recognising copies of the repeat elements. RepA DNA-binding has also been demonstrated in vitro using a modification of the Western analysis technique (referred to a 'Western-DNA') in order to complement the in vivo experimental results. Although the coding region of repA had been determined in earlier work, the identification of the translational start codon was uncertain. This uncertainty has been resolved by limited N-terminal sequence analysis of a RepA:&#946;-galactosidase fusion protein which has demonstrated that translation begins from a CTG codon located upstream of the predicted start sites. Finally, a series of genetic experiments have been used to determine the functional significance of RepA binding to the repeat elements. The repeat group upstream of repA are involved in autoregulation and also form part of the origin of replication, whilst the downstream repeats appear to be involved in the sensing and setting of plasmid copy number. Although the work presented in this Thesis does not directly test the applicability for RepFIB of various control models proposed to explain the behaviour of Step function replicons, the nature and type of control elements identified in RepFIB support the placement of RepFIB within the Step function class. As a result of this work, it is clear that RepFIB is confronted by the same kind of control paradox faced by replicons such as mini-P1 and mini-F. All three replicons use autoregulation and titration to control the supply of initiator protein required for replication. However, concurrent autoregulation and titration appear to be incompatible in current control models, and the identification of both mechanisms in these replicons has lead to a control paradox. Some of the results presented here suggest potentially valuable avenues of future research which may help resolve the paradox faced by RepFIB and other Step function replicons.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2044</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Christina Stead: the American years</field><field name="creator">Segerberg, Anita Kristina</field><field name="description">CHRISTINA STEAD (1902-1983) is a major Australian woman writer, and this thesis explores one of the least known periods in her life and work, the years she spent in the United States (1937- 7946). During this time she wrote her two best known novels, The Man Who Loved Children and For Love Alone, both based on autobiographical material. This study explores contextual aspects of Stead's life and work in New York, drawing on a considerable amount of new material. (Chapters I and II) During this period Stead wrote partly out of a personal need to understand her own life situation, and psychological readings of three novels, The Man who Loved Children, For Love Alone and Letty Fox, seen as a 'father trilogy', are designed to open up new lines of enquiry into aspects of all of these novels. (Chapters III and IV) The thesis also discusses formal aspects of Stead's work, beginning with her own formulation of an esthetics of the novel, which occurred during a course she gave in New York in 1943 called Workshop in the Novel. (Chapter V) The relevance of this course for her own practice as a novelist is also explored, with particular reference to the two later American novels A Little TeA, A Little Chat and, The People with The Dogs. (Chapter VI) In Chapter VII an exploration of Stead's interest in the genre of the novella, focussing on the collection The Puzzleheaded Girl, continues the formal lines of enquiry opened up in the previous two chapters, and in the following chapter the same collection provides a starting point for a consideration of Stead's deep interest in the situation of women in modern society, especially the recurrent figure of the wanderer or female rebel. The last chapter concentrates on the literary self-portraits which appeared in Stead's American fiction after The Man who Loved Children and For Love Alone, and their curiously limited characterization is compared with the more vigorous portrait of her provided in one of the novels of her husband, William Blake. This thesis, then, argues that Stead's life fed her fiction, especially in her American period, and that her work was part of a broader personal quest. Understanding this quest is relevant to a discussion of her literary style, and to her personal use of autobiographical material in her fiction, and it illuminates aspects of the creative process itself. Stead's need to understand her own life not only shaped her fiction, it also provided it with the 'intelligent ferocity' she aimed for, and resulted in a major 'realist' writer.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420100 Language Studies::420101 English</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2046</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Wit at several weapons: a critical edition</field><field name="creator">Sharp, Iain</field><field name="description">The text which follows is a critical modern spelling edition of &#8216;Wit at Several Weapons&#8217; devised according to the principles established for the editors of the Revels series of English Renaissance plays.

Social referencing research has also been conducted exclusively in the university laboratory. Three studies examined the influence of self-produced locomotion on the development of social referencing and compared social referencing behaviour in familiar and unfamiliar settings. Social referencing was defined as occurring when, following a novel event, infants looked to a familiar adult and used the information provided by the adult to adjust their behaviour towards the event appropriately. In the first study, forty infants, half locomoting and half non-locomoting, were seen in their own homes at either 7-months (10 crawling, l0 not crawling) or 9-months (10 crawling, l0 not crawling). Testing was repeated on all infants 2 months later. Infants were videotaped in each of three maternal availability conditions (mother available; not available; or not interactive) before a remote control toy car moved toward them. Mothers were instructed to give either a positive or negative facial signal when their infant looked at them during this final phase. The infants were responsive to the availability of the mother on a number of dependent measures. Locomoting infants approached their mothers more, played with the toys less, and differed in some aspects of looking behaviour during the availability phases. During the final social referencing phase neither group consistently used the information provided by the mother to change their behaviour. A second study examined a further ten, 9-month-old infants using an identical procedure. The infants were delayed in the onset of self-produced locomotion due to surgical and immobilization procedures prescribed for club foot. This group did not differ from the normal non-crawling 9-month-olds in the availability phases of the study but did look to their mothers more quickly and vocalized less during the social referencing phase. The third study used a similar procedure and identical novel stimulus to examine 20, 11-month-old infants' social referencing behaviour in a laboratory situation. There was a significant difference between the infants who received a positive versus negative message for the contact with the car measures. When they received a negative message, infants tested in the laboratory were less likely to touch the stimulus car and touched it for a shorter time than infants of the same age and tested at home. Mothers of all infants participating in this study completed the Infant Characteristics Questionnaire. None of the infant characteristics predicted which infants would use the social referencing strategy. It is concluded that social referencing is not a strategy used extensively by 7-and 9-month old infants although social looking is common at these ages in response to new events. Locomotion experience has little effect on social referencing. Infants use information from a variety of sources to assess a new situation and 11-month-old infants are more likely to use social referencing as a strategy in an unfamiliar setting. Theoretical implications of the results are discussed in relation to the cognitive requirements of preverbal and emotional communication and the relative importance of social influences for interpreting novel events.</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2050</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A contribution to the biology of the genus Carpophyllum Grev.</field><field name="creator">Dromgoole, Frank Ian</field><field name="description">The characterisation of the universal features of intertidal zonation on rocky coasts (Stephenson and Stephenson 1949; 1952; 1954; 1961) has stimulated many attempts t o explain the factors responsible for the observed patterns of distribution. Initial investigations which were essentially confined to the effects of a single factor upon different species suggested that ecological position was often correlated with physiological response. Recent studies have indicated that the subtidal distributions of algae show characteristic patterns (Kitching 1941 ; Bergquist 1960; Kain 1960; 1971; Morgans 1961 ; McLean 1962; Schwenke 1966; Neushul 1967; Clark and Neushul 1967; Larkum et al.1967; John 1971). However, there have been relatively few attempts to examine in detail and subsequently integrate the physiological response to environmental factors of major belt-demarcating algae of the sublittoral . The four New Zealand species of Carpophyllum are inhabitants of the uppermost sublittoral and the sublittoral fringe (Bergquist 1960; Dromgoole 1965). This particular study was undertaken in an attempt to elucidate the subtle differences in response which determine the distribution limits characteristic of each species. There is little information on the biology of Carpophyllum with the exception of some anatomical and embryological work (Delf 1939; Dawson 1940; Naylor 1954) and an earlier investigation of C. maschalocarpum (Dromgoole 1965). Thus to provide a basis for physiological experiments preliminary studies were directed to the following aspects: ( i ) a brief review of the morphology, anatomy and taxonomy of the genus, ( ii ) growth of sporelings in laboratory culture using various seawater media, ( iii ) definition of the geographical and vertical limits of the four species and a general study of their ecology with emphasis on population distributions, periodicitiy of reproduction and plant composition in relation to environment. The physiological response of algae to environmental factors has been examined by previous workers at the protoplasmic level using the criterion of resistance (e.g. Biebl 1956, 1962; Kanwisher 1957); at the metabolic level by measurement of photosynthesis and respiration (e.g. Chapman 1961n) ; and at the level of the whole plant by growth rates in laboratory cultures (e.g. Kain 1965) or of selected individuals in the field (e.g. Klugh and Martin, 1927). Attempts to culture Carpophyllum were not entirely successful. An earlier investigation indicated that the growth rates of Carpophyllum in situ are difficult to assess (Dromgoole 1965) and hence the metabolic approach, which does allow some integration of response to several factors by means of carbon balance calculations (e.g. Brown and Johnson 1964), has been used extensively in this study. The metabolic activity of large brown algae varies considerably with age and part of plant (Clendenning and Sargent 1957a, b; Chapman 1961a). To eliminate sampling problems in Carpophyllum a cuvette allowing continuous long-term monitoring of oxygen exchange of a single piece of material was developed. This laboratory apparatus has shown that the photosynthesis and respiration of the various organs is sensitive to environmental changes in pH, C02 supply, oxygen tension, light , water flow, dehydration and temperature. The nature and possible causes of the response t o each factor were examined in detail as this was considered essential to any interpretation of their ecological significance. Finally, the information obtained from these gas exchange measurements has been integrated by means of metabolic balance calculations and a descriptive synthesis of field and laboratory results has provided a general picture of the biology of these plants.</field><field name="date">1973</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2051</field></doc><doc><field name="title">W.

The original suggestion of the choice of these three poets came from Mr R.M.

The choice of the three poets concerned as objects of study was influenced not only by personal interest in their work, but also by a belief (which I feel the thesis may vindicate) that this was an opportune time to begin research into the careers of three men who, with other poets such as Ursula Bethell, Denis Glover, Charles Brasch, and Allen Curnow, may by common consensus be seen to have had a place in the first years of a significant verse tradition in New Zealand &#8211; the years from the early 1920s onwards.</field><field name="date">1966</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420100 Language Studies::420101 English</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2052</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Some Effects of Turnip Yellow Mosaic Virus Infection on Nucleic Acid Metabolism in Brassica Pekinensis Rupr.</field><field name="creator">Randles, John Wesley</field><field name="description">Summary 1.

S. Byatt&#8217;s Fiction</field><field name="creator">Kelly, Frances (Frances Jennifer)</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the conceptualisation of subjectivity, the past and language in the work of one particular English novelist and critic, A. S. Byatt. In doing so, it examines significant points of overlap between Byatt's fiction and criticism, on the one hand, and, on the other, the discourses that have contributed to their formation. Whilst Byatt's work is inflected by recent critical examinations of the three concepts, this thesis is less concerned with how it reflects prevailing notions of subjectivity, the past and language, than with its participation in an ongoing examination of each. Although I do investigate the interplay between Byatt's fiction and criticism, my focus is on how this is played out in Byatt's fictional texts, in particular the novels. The Introduction offers a brief summary of other criticism on Byatt's work summarises the recent definitions of 'text' and broader discussions of postmodernism that have impacted on my approach to her fiction, and proposes a reading of these texts that accounts for their ambivalence. In Chapter One, I focus on the reconfiguration of subjectivity in Byatt's writing, particularly as it relates to textuality. Chapter Two explores the relationship between present and past in Byatt's fiction that is partly enacted through the texts' own engagement with past literatures, in particular nineteenth-century literature, and the related issues of historiography, linearity and memory that these texts investigate. Language, in particular Byatt's interest in its relation to 'things', is the focus of the third and final chapter of this thesis. Throughout each of the chapters is an exploration of Byatt's engagement or reexamination of a persistent 'thread of two' in Western discourse. Although each chapter focuses on one of the three concepts, each also explores the issues that arise from the conjunction of 'two things' in these fictions: text and subject, present and past, language and the world. Related to this is my consideration of how Byatt's fiction is characterised by a number of contradictory impetuses. Of particular interest is the ambivalence that arises from Byatt's partial engagement with recent critical theory - not only because it reflects larger cultural and discursive movements, but also because it contributes to a productive forging of new forms of fiction that combine an awareness of the concerns of literary and cultural criticism with a desire to evoke pleasure in the texts.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420100 Language Studies::420101 English</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2059</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors influencing antibody production in vitro</field><field name="creator">Finlay, Graeme John</field><field name="description">A. ANTIBODY RESPONSES OF HUMAN TONSILLAR LYMPHOCYTES. 1 Human tonsillar lymphocytes were stimulated with pokeweed mitogen in vitro. A large number of cells developed which secreted antibody specific for sheep erythrocytes. The largest number of antibody-forming cells was produced on days 4 or 5, when optimal cell concentrations were used. Responses specific for bovine and horse erythrocytes were much smaller than those specific for sheep erythrocytes. 2 Antibody responses were studied using a culture system which permits the segregation of individual clones of antibody-forming cells. As the number of cells in each culture was increased, the efficiency with which clones were produced and the mean clone size also increased. Cell dose-response data suggest that precursors of clones detected on day 4 are less dependent on cell co-operation than those giving rise to clones detected on day 5. The frequency of antibody-forming cell precursors at the peak of the response was estimated at 1.2 to 3.8 x 10-5. 3 The physical properties of antibody-forming cell precursors were investigated. When fractionated by sedimentation velocity, precursors appeared to be enriched in fractions of cells with a larger volume than the majority of lymphocytes. Precursors were heterogeneous when fractionated on the basis of their buoyant density. Little precursor activity was detected in cells with a density of greater than 1.075 g/ml. Cells able to generate antibody-forming cells were most enriched in fractions with a density of about 1.065g/ml. Cells which suppress responses are also found in fractions of this density. 4 Hydrocortisone succinate at 1&#956;g/ml (2&#956;M)enhanced the production of antibody-forming cells in many experiments. Hydrocortisone had to be present from the time that cultures were initiated in order to exert this effect. The effect of hydrocortisone upon cells which had been fractionated on the basis of their buoyant density was examined. It was able to potentiate the responses of two medium density fractions only, and actually suppressed the responses of high density cells. 5 Hydrocortisone enhanced an antibody response stimulated by sheep erythrocytes in a similar way as it enhanced PWM-stimulated responses. The addition of sheep erythrocytes to PWM-stimulated cultures enhanced PFC responses only in the presence of the hormone. These data are interpreted as showing that suppressor cell activity is selectively inhibited by hydrocortisone. B. THE EFFECT OF IN VIVO PLASMACYTOMA GROWTH ON ANTIBODY RESPONSES OF MURINE SPLEEN CELLS IN VITRO. Spleen cells from normal and plasmacytoma-bearing mice were cultured and their antibody responses compared. In those instances where the production of antibody-forming cells was dependent upon helper T cells, it was found that the responses of cells from tumour-bearing mice were enhanced relative to controls. Thymus-independent responses were not enhanced. Evidence is presented that the nature of the effect of tumour growth upon antibody responsiveness is related to the culture system used.</field><field name="date">1979</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2060</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Crystal growth in eggshells</field><field name="creator">Silyn-Roberts, Heather</field><field name="description">Preferred orientation in the eggshells of the crocodiles, turtles and birds is shown by X-ray diffractometry to develop throughout shell deposition. In all shells, the texture that develops is one in which the (001) plane of the unit cell tends to lie parallel to the shell surface. The degree of texture varies from being high in the calcite of the ratite and tinamou shells and the aragonite of the turtle shells to low in the calcite of the crocodilian and carinate shells. A model is proposed for the deposition of the entire eggshell. This model explains the observed textures and fracture morphologies of the shells. In each shell column, crystal deposition is initiated at a single location, from which growth fans out at all angles to the shell normal. In both calcitic and aragonitic shells, growth is in the [001] direction, resulting in an increase in the degree of (001) preferred orientation with distance from nucleation. Where there is unhindered crystal growth, the shells show a crystalline fracture morphology, and the degree of texture that develops is a simple function of the column radius. This type of growth makes up the whole of the turtle shell, the inner 0.3 to 0.4 of the thick ratite shells and the cone layer of the other avian shells. At the start of the central layer of the avian shell, the onset of protein deposition coincides with a hindrance to texture development, which thereafter proceeds at a lower rate. A further hindrance occurs about half-way through the shell, probably caused by a change in the physical characteristics of the protein network. The degree of texture that develops in the avian shell is a function of the column radius and the degree of physical hindrance presented by the protein network. The central layer of the avian shell has a composite fracture morphology resulting from the intermingling of the network with the inorganic phase. The organic component does not appear to control crystal growth as previously believed, but instead acts as a reinforcing fibrous network.</field><field name="date">1984</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2062</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cooperative learning in preschool settings: enhancing the social integration of young children with disabilities</field><field name="creator">Boyd, Andrea</field><field name="description">An examination was made of the effectiveness of cooperative learning as a strategy for enhancing the social acceptance of preschool children with disabilities who had been included in a mainstream educational setting. Preschool groups accommodating children with special needs were randomly assigned to one of three experimental conditions - cooperative play and social skills training, social skills training on1y, or control (no intervention). Children in the cooperative play programme received significantly higher levels of social acceptance than did those in the social-skills or regular preschool programmes. Moreover, the cooperative play group showed significantly more positive and more frequent social interactions with nondisabled peers than did the children in the other groups. It was also found that following the intervention the children in both the cooperative and social-skills treatment groups were rated significantly higher than were those in the control group on social skills and social play posttest measures. The results thus indicate that the use of structured cooperative play yielded an incremental effect over social-skills training in furthering the social integration of preschool children with disabilities in mainstream settings. The finding that increased social acceptance occurs in situations where social-skills training is undertaken within a framework of structured cooperative play was discussed terms of its implications for the social inclusion of young children with disabilities in integrated educational settings. It was noted that if participation in mainstream preschool settings is to be of real value for young children with disabilities, programmes designed to maximize social acceptance, such as structured cooperative play and social-skills training, need to be utilized to facilitate social interaction. Indeed, in the absence of strategies to enhance social integration, the placement of young children with disabilities in mainstream educational settings may well place such children at risk with respect to their social development.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330101 Educational psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2065</field></doc><doc><field name="title">William Carlos Williams: A Study of his Work</field><field name="creator">Doyle, Charles</field><field name="description">This study is twofold in purpose: (1) to examine the full range of William's writing, a task which has not been undertaken by anyone since Vivienne Koch in 1950.

(2) P. carsei sp. nov. (previously &#8216;P. comans&#8217;) (also in Australia and the Kermadec Is.). (3) P. macilenta A. Rich. (previously P. macilenta var. saxatilis Carse) endemic. (4) P. pendula Col. (previously P. macilenta Auct. non. Rich. and P. macilenta var. pendula (Col.) Cheeseman) endemic. The taxonomy and nomenclature of these species is discussed in detail and the nomenclature is also discussed for P. kingiana Endl. (previously sometimes treated as P. tremula) and P. zahlbruckneriana Endl. (previously treated under &#8216;P. comans&#8217; or P.endlicheriana Agardh) both Norfolk Is. endemics, and the taxonomy of P. sp.aff.comans LHI (previously &#8216;P. comans&#8217;) endemic to Lord Howe Island is also discussed. Detailed study of the spores and paleae using conventional light microscopy and SEM was made for these species and also P. comans Forst. f. (from the New Hebrides) and P. novae-caledoniae from New Caledonia. Comparisons of the distribution, fronds, stipes, venation, rhizomes, paleae, indumentum, apices, sori, sporangia and spores have been made and where appropriate material of P. dentata ssp. flabellata, P. pacifica and P. vittata, has also been compared. Further comparisons have been made with material of &#8216;P. comans&#8217; from other Pacific Islands including Fiji (three species ), Rarotonga, Samoa, Tahiti (each one species). P. tremula, P. kingiana and P. novae-caledoniae are exceptional in the genus because they lack paraphyses in the sori. P. kingiana and P. novae-caledoniae have a copious waxy deposit around and among the sporangial stalks but P. tremula has no accessory sporangial features at all. Germination and gametophyte growth follow the normal pattern for the genus. Some gametophytes can be kept alive and growing for considerable periods (up to three years) and become elongate, ribbon-like and unisexual (female). Hybridisation was achieved between P. carsei and P. macilenta. The progeny resemble the natural hybrid swarms suspected of being the product of the same parents.</field><field name="date">1975</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2069</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Essential replication functions of the F plasmid</field><field name="creator">Watson, Lynley A.</field><field name="description">The work in this thesis concerns the analysis of essential replication genes of the F plasmid of Escherichia coli.

This work led to the following findings. 1. A 1.15kb region of f5 was shown to contain all the functions required for initiation of F replication. Insertions of a transposon within this 1.15kb region abolished mini-F replication. 2. A mini-F plasmid was constructed which constitutes the smallest F derivative so far reported. This plasmid has an elevated copy number, as a result of deletion of the incC region. 3. At least two proteins specified by the essential F replication region were identified in maxicells. The promoter fragments of two mini-F genes were fused to a &#946;-qalactosidase gene and demonstrated to have low but significant in vivo activities.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2070</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the biosynthesis of indole-3-acetic acid in tomato shoots</field><field name="creator">Cooney, Terrence Patrick</field><field name="description">The relative contributions of the three main intermediates of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) biosynthesis from L-tryptophan (L-Trp); indole-3-pyruvate (IPyA), tryptamine (TNH2) and indole-3-acetaldoxime (IAOX), were investigated in vivo in tomato shoots. Initially, L-Trp, D-Trp, IPyA, TNH2 and IAA were purified from shoots, identified by full-scan mass spectrometry and their concentrations measured using gas chromatography with an electron capture detector. High specific activity [5-3H]IAOX and [5-3H]IPyA were synthesized from L-[5-3H]Trp and used as internal standards. Purification of endogenous IPyA was enabled by forming a stable pentafluorobenzyl oxime derivative in the crude plant extract. The respective endogenous concentrations of L-Trp, D-Trp, TNH2, IPyA and IAA were found to be 2,520, 103, 146.3, 5.9 and 8.5 ng g-1 f. wt. However, IAOX could not be identified as a natural constituent of tomato shoots by full-scan GC-MS. Secondly, incubation of tomato shoots for 6, 10 and 21 h in 30% 2H2O was used as a means of labelling IAA and its putative precursors in vivo. L-Trp, D-Trp, TNH2, IPyA and IAA were then extracted and purified and the 2H content measured by combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. These indole compounds were labelled rapidly with up to four 2H atoms. Direct comparison of the number and the amount of 2H atoms incorporated (pattern) was obtained from the mass spectral data on the common m/z 130 ion and its isotope peaks. IAA and L-Trp demonstrated an increase in 2H label with up to 17% and 21% of their molecules labelled at 10 h respectively. This was followed by a significant decrease in 2H label at 21 h to 12% for both L-Trp and IAA. This decrease in 2H label was attributed to an increase in protein catabolism, following shoot excision, resulting in the dilution of free L-Trp pool(s) with unlabelled L-Trp from which IAA is biosynthesized. This is reflected in the observed 1.6 to 1.8 fold increase of free L-Trp from 10 to 21 h. In contrast, tryptamine demonstrated a continual increase in 2H label with an average of 8, 20 and 28% of the molecules labelled at 6, 10 and 21 h respectively, suggesting that TNH2 and IAA were synthesized from separate Trp pools. In addition, the relatively slow rate at which 2H is incorporated into tryptamine would not be sufficient to account for the rate at which IAA becomes labelled. However, IPyA demonstrated a rapid increase in 2H with 22% and 37% of its molecules labelled at 6 and 10 h respectively. From the rate at which IPyA was labelled with 2H and the concentration of IPyA in tomato shoots a rate of synthesis for IPyA in tomato shoots was estimated which was sufficient to provide most of the shoot IAA requirements. Furthermore, the extent to which IAA and IPyA were labelled relative to that of total L-Trp would imply that a smaller more rapidly metabolised pool(s) of L-Trp was the precursor of these compounds. The rate and extent that D-Trp was labelled was consistently less than that of IAA precluding it as a possible precursor of IAA. These results indicate that in tomato shoots IAA is biosynthesized from a rapidly metabolized sub-pool(s) of L-trptophan predominantly via IPyA.</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology::270101 Analytical biochemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2071</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into choice between fixed-interval and mixed-interval schedules of reinforcement</field><field name="creator">Foster, Therese Mary</field><field name="description">Pigeons were trained under concurrent chain schedules in which the initial links were equal aperiodic schedules.

The shorter of the two intervals comprising the mixed-interval schedules was always 5 sec, the longer was either 10 sec, 20 sec, 40 sec, or 60 sec. The number of times each of the two intervals occurred in these mixed-interval schedules was varied. The data were compared with predictions from various models of concurrent chain performance and the adequacy of these models was discussed. No one model was a good predictor of all the data. Davison and Temple's (submitted for publication) model fitted the FI vs FI data well and fitted the FI vs MI data better than any other model. It was suggested that a "carry over" from one condition to the next had affected the present data. It was also suggested that the way in which Davison and Temple's predictions differed from the obtained preference ratios was the result of a weighting of the intervals in the MI schedules that changed according to the particular choice arranged.</field><field name="date">1973</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2073</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The submerged vegetation of Lake Rotoma</field><field name="creator">Clayton, John Sinclair</field><field name="description">The Majority of Rotorua Lakes are rapidly becoming eutrophic and/or dominated by exotic hydrophytes. Lake Rotoma was studied to provide essential information on native aquatic hydrophytes within an oligotrophic lake, and to record the initial transition towards an exotic dominated community. The lake is of volcanic origin and has a markedly fluctuating water level because of the absence of a surface outlet. An underwater SCUBA investigation was made in 1972, followed by intensive sampling from 50 systematically located one transects in 1973. A suitable quadrat size and shape was selected and the sampling error was assessed. The species frequencies were calculated from presence or absence recordings. Quadrat cover, depth, gradient and substrate were also determined. Three characean species, Chara fibrosa f. acanthopitys. (A. Br.) R.D.W., Nitella leptostachys var. leonhardii (R.D.W.) R.D.W. and N.pseudoflabellata var. mucosa (Nordst.) Bailey, dominated the vegetation. The next most common pattern contained the same three species plus Lagarosiphon major (Ridley) Moss. The initial stages of L.major invasion in to a characean community was recorded from 1973 up to 1976. The charophytes ranged in depth from 0 - 17.5m and were located upon a wide variety of substrates and gradients. The native vascular plants were absent from many transects. The plants had a depth range from 0 - 4.5m with most occurring above 3.5m. The Low Mixed Community was primarily located in water less than 1.25ma at the N.E. end of the lake, which resulted in this area having a high species diversity. The exotic hydrophytes were more widespread and abundant than the native vascular phanerogams. The distribution of L.major and Elodea canadensis Michx. appeared to coincide with boating access, recreational usage and fallen submerged trees. The depth range was 0 - 6.0m, although the available habitats within this range have not yet been fully exploited. Emergent species were abundant within the S.W. inlet and also in the lagoons around the lake shoreline where sheltered conditions and shallow gradients prevail. An experimental study on the effect of erosion and sedimentation by removing the shallow water plant cover, showed that the presence of plants moderated the extent of erosion and also encouraged sedimentation. Recolonisation of cleared areas was discussed. Annual frequency changes in the vascular hydrophytes were largely influenced by water level fluctuations and by the extension of exotic species. Water-level fluctuations were observed to influence (a) the bottom limit of plant growth (probably indirectly through light penetration), (b) the upper limit of plant growth by determining available growing space, and (c) the rate of spread of exotic species by erosion and redistribution of existing stands. The 1973 raw data was processed and standardised in the form of species presence or absence, absolute frequency, and relative frequency within each transect. Distance matrices were constructed using non-Euclidean distance functions. A non-linear multidimensional scaling technique was used to construct transect and species ordinations. The advantages and problems associated with this technique are discussed and compared to alternative methods. That adopted was successfully tested for its ability to reconstruct a place map of the North Island of New Zealand. The configuration error was calculated for each ordination and was found to be less than for the alternative methods tested. From the first species ordination a concept of species prosperity was developed which involved the number of transects and quadrats within which each species was recorded, and the maximum depth recording for each species. Non-linear analysis indicated that average gradient might be a significant influence. From the first transect ordination, four vegetation groups were recognised and discussed. Depth, substrate, species dominance and gradient were significant within the ordinations. Non-linear analysis confirmed many of the previous interpretations of the ordinations but gave no further information.</field><field name="date">1978</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2074</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A spore atlas of New Zealand ferns and fern allies</field><field name="creator">Large, M.

N. (Michael Norman), 1950-</field><field name="description">Damage caused by possums (Trichosurus vulpecula Kerr) in New Zealand's extensive Pinus radiata plantations has caused concern among foresters. This study set out to examine the nature of tire problem and investigate the ecology of possums in radiata plantations in relation to damage and control. The work was carried out in the Kinleith Forest near Tokoroa in the central North Island. A review of existing literature and survey results showed that damage is mainly a problem of young plantations, consisting of bark-stripping on young trees and browsing of newly-planted seedlings. A simulated browsing experiment indicated that the latter damage was unlikely to result in discernible production losses. Bark-stripping was found to occur during the winter and spring. It had a patchy distribution and was only thought likely to prove serious where stocking was already low for other reasons. Analysis of stomach contents from animals poisoned in 1971 plantings and 1960 age class stands revealed that in both habitats possums relied heavily on foods other than pine, although in the older (1960) stands radiata pollen cones were an important winter and spring food. Insect larvae (Philia nigrostigma) were also eaten at this time of year, particularly in older stands. Little bark was consumed in either habitat, but it was a more common food in the younger stands, were it was eaten during the winter and spring. It is suggested that bark-stripping in young stands may be a response to relatively poor nutrition during the winter and early spring. Data on fat reserves, reproductive performance and growth support the view that the overall plane of nutrition was better among possums in the older stands. Possum populations were studied by livetrapping and radiotelemetry in two areas, one within a 1960 age class radiata stand (FRSA), the other extending across the boundary between a 1971 planting and cutover native forest (MSA). In the latter area there was a seasonal pattern of habitat use, with animals tending to use the native forest to a greater extent than the plantation during the winter. Population densities were similar in the two areas (2-3/ ha), with the MSA population having an apparent trend of increase. The two populations differed in composition, the FRSA one having an excess of females and the MSA an initial excess of males but an increasing proportion of females. It is suggested that disturbance of the MSA population, by burning in 1971 and subsequent poisoning, resulted in partial depopulation with initial recolonisation predominantly by dispersing males. Results from both study areas showed that young males have a greater tendency to disperse from their native area than do young females. Radiotelemetry revealed that possums in the MSA used more dens than those in the FRSA and good dens appeared to be few in the latter area. It is suggested that dens may be a limiting resource for some possum populations. Since females are known to control the use of dens the survival of males should be poorer where dens are limited, resulting ultimately in a biased sex ratio. Experimental depopulation of the FRSA and monitoring of its recolonisation over one year suggested that population re-establishment on cleared areas does not depend on local reproduction by survivors, but is primarily by dispersal in the initial stages, with an early influx of young males. The MSA population was also poisoned, in a standard 1080 airdrop, and the effectiveness of this operation was monitored. Current control practices are critically appraised in the light of the results obtained in this study and the value of widespread aerial poisoning operations in pine plantation habitats is questioned.</field><field name="date">1977</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2075</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The alpine survey: George Meredith as social critic</field><field name="creator">Church, Antoinette</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">1974</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2077</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Investigation of Behavioural Models of Detection</field><field name="creator">Godfrey, Rebecca</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2078</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Social psychology and mental retardation: towards an applied social psychology of mental retardation</field><field name="creator">Haxell, Mark Robert</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2079</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sources of variance in the detection of auditory signals with special reference to unstable decision criteria</field><field name="creator">Bridgman, Geoff, 1946-</field><field name="description">Data from twelve auditory signal detection experiments show that a model general to all signal detection tasks explains results better than specific auditory models. This thesis examines models of the detection of sinusoids in Gaussian white noise, all predicting linear ROC-curves on normal-normal co-ordinates, but differing in their predictions for the ROC-curve slope. Distinction is made between stimulus distributions, transducer distributions and response-inferred distributions. Response-inferred distributions include variance from stimuli, transducers and unstable criteria. The first three experiments (rating) showed that slope increases with increases in p(sn) and in the number of categories available for describing the presence of the signal. An explanation for this data assumes that the 'yes-no' criterion has the least variance and other criteria have variances proportional to their distances from the 'yes-no' criterion. This explanation is developed into a model of selective attention in which the variance of all real criteria is a function of their distances from an optimal criterion. Faulty memory is the assumed cause of criterion variance. Predictions that follow from the model are (i) there is a decline in criterion variance as signal strength increases ; (ii) there is a U- (or inverted U-) shaped function relating slope and signal strength; (iii) criterion variance is less in forced-choice tasks than in 'yes-no' tasks; and (iv) slope is partially determined by task design and any other factor which affects the subject's memory for signal or noise. Experiments 4-6 establish that the concept of criterion variance also applies to yes-no procedures, and Experiments 7-11 substantiate predictions made by the model of selective attention. Data from Experiments 5, 7, 8, 9 and 10 are analysed in terms of models of sinusoidal burst and gap detection. None of the probabilistic models is adequate, but Zwislocki's (1969) deterministic model of temporal summation accounts for the data. A model of response-inferred distributions is presented in which the mathematical relationships of the variances and locations of criteria, of signal strength and of stimulus variances to the slope of the ROC-curve are described. Equations for the optimal criterion, the variance of individual criteria and a measure of sensitivity uncontaminated by criterion variance are derived. Re-analysis of data using the model of response-inferred distributions supports the predictions of the model of selective attention. The model of response-inferred distributions predicts 'peaked' rating ROC-curves which are similar to two-state functions and commonly observed in the literature. However, both two-state and high-threshold theories are unable to explain the data. Experiment 12 compares the model of response-inferred distributions with Pike's (1973) multiple observations model for latency data and finds the latter model inferior. Criterion variance is shown to account fox at least half of the variance of the response-inferred distributions, and consequently, it is argued that TSD results should be viewed more in terms of the general processes which produce criterion variance than modality-specific models of signal processing.</field><field name="date">1977</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2080</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Trends and ethnic disparities in the incidence and outcome of stroke in Auckland, New Zealand over 20 years</field><field name="creator">Carter, Kristie Norah</field><field name="description">Aims:  The aims of this thesis were to investigate trends and ethnic disparities in the incidence and outcome of stroke in Auckland, New Zealand between 1981 and 2003. Methods:  Trends were assessed using information from the three Auckland Regional Community Stroke (ARCOS) studies, conducted in people (aged &#8805;15 years) in Auckland, during 12-month calendar periods in 1981-1982, 1991-1992, and 2001-2002.  These studies used comparable definitions and case finding methods and have been shown to meet the stringent criteria for a population-based &#8220;ideal&#8221; stroke incidence study.  Rates were calculated using Poisson distribution and are presented with 95% confidence intervals.  Trends in survival were assessed using Cox Proportional hazards regression modelling. Results:  Overall trends in the incidence and event rates of stroke declined across the study period.  These declines were significant in males and for the ages 65 to 74 years only.  However, growing disparities in the rates of stroke between the major ethnic groups in New Zealand were found, with significant declines in New Zealand Europeans and increases in M&#257;ori and Pacific populations.  Dramatic improvements in survival over the study period were also found, with the greatest improvement in the acute period, within the first 28-days after stroke.  Adjustments for patient or disease severity factors strengthened the survival model.  However, adjustments for care/service factors nullified the survival model, thus explaining most of the improving trend. Conclusions:  The small declines in the incidence of stroke, improvements in survival and the ageing of the New Zealand population will lead to data dramatic increases in the number of people living with the effects of stroke.  To maintain stable numbers of strokes occurring, more intensive prevention strategies need to target high-risk populations and population-wide health education strategies are needed to improve the health of the general population, hence reducing the risk of stroke.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stroke</field><field name="subject">Epidemiology</field><field name="subject">Ethnic disparities</field><field name="subject">Incidence</field><field name="subject">Survival</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2365</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Relationships of love and power in the Hahalis Welfare Society of Buka</field><field name="creator">Rimoldi, Eleanor</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the role and status of women in the Hahalis Welfare Society, a populist social movement on Buka, North Solomons Province, Papua New Guinea. The author spent fifteen months in the field, spread over three fieldtrips between 1975.and 1978. Welfare Society members in Hahalis Village shared with the author the work of their hands so that she could appreciate the significance of the ground, and the work of their hearts so that she could feel the compassion, love, and positive exuberance that informed their thinking &#8211; thus enabling her to understand in some measure the analysis, critique and transformation of Buka culture and society in which they were engaged. The first chapter of this thesis elaborates the relationship between Hahalis Welfare Society and its historical, and contemporary social/political context on Buka. There is also a discussion of the author's approach to fieldwork on Buka &#8211;both in terms of theory and practice. The second chapter explores the nature of traditional power and leadership which remain central to the philosophy and organization of the Welfare Society. The special importance of matrilineal principles and the brother-sister relationship are explored, as are forms of alliance between lineages and moieties. The qualities of balance and restraint inherent in the Buka concepts of power and leadership are shown to be under some strain in the contemporary political and economic context. Chapter Three discusses ritual occasions in relation to the issues raised in the preceding chapter. Ritual is seen as a creative re-thinking of the nature of power, and personal and social relationships &#8211; a complex weave that reflects the past, the present, and possible future designs. Chapter Four centres more directly on the role of women in Welfare Society and their past and present active participation in the development of its philosophy and its practice. The final chapter explores three issues drawn from the author's fieldwork experience which are discussed in terms of their relevance to Hahalis Welfare Society, and the development of anthropological practice. These issues centre on the subjective stance in anthropological fieldwork, the debate over fertility and family planning, and the problematic interpretation of sacrifice.</field><field name="date">1982</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370300 Anthropology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2082</field></doc><doc><field name="title">For God or Man: Notions of Women in Seventeenth Century England</field><field name="creator">McCrystal, John</field><field name="description">This study argues that 'new' ways of speaking about the nature and status of women are evident in the literary record of late seventeenth century England, particularly in the writings of Mary Astell (1666-1731). Writing to oppose the natural rights-based political theory of the 'Father of Modern Liberalism', John Locke, Astell employed the secular, rationalist, individualistic language which Locke himself used to argue the equal human dignity of women with men. Hers was the first unequivocal plea made by an English writer. The subject of this study is the provenance of these new modes of thinking about women. The result of a survey of primary sources, dating primarily from the period 1600-1700, it first seeks to show that seventeenth century England inherited a 'traditional' notion of women and their status from antiquity; scriptural, philosophical and empirical evidence of women's moral and intellectual equality with men coexisted uneasily with the consensual notion that they were men's subordinates. This notion survived the Continental and English Reformations to be incorporated into the theology of both the Church of England and the Puritans alike. Thinking and writing about women took place in the context of an 'ideology of order', wherein individuals were considered solely in relation to society and in terms of their obligations and status. It is then argued that the paradox of women's equal humanity and subordinate status first received serious interrogation during the political crises of 1640-1660. Radical Protestants, who placed the individual believer - male or female - at the centre of religious life, allowed women to participate to an unprecedented degree in worship. The potential of radical Protestantism to challenge the traditional subordination of women was obvious in the political theory of the 'Levellers', who secularised religious individualism to produce a programme of democratic reform. The invisibility of women in this proto-liberal programme is given special attention here. The paradox inherent in the traditional notion of woman was thrown into sharp relief, furthermore, in the course of the political debates between royalists and parliamentarians during the Civil War; both sides attempted to liken the relationship between king and people to that between husband and wife. The marriage analogue served to highlight the gap which was opening between political analysis and the justifications for the subordination for women. Finally, it is argued that renewed political crisis in the last two decades of the century saw the introduction of secular individualism to English political thought, reinforced with the 'new' metaphysics of Descartes. John Locke considered that since individuals constructed society for their own ends, they could resist government where these were not being served. Yet as Astell pointed out, Locke fell back upon the traditional assumption that women ought to be subordinated in this society to men. She adopted the new metaphysics to show not only that Locke's political conclusions were wrong and dangerous, but also to show that women, their subordinate social status notwithstanding, were of equal dignity and worth to men.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360100 Political Science::360104 Political theory and political philosophy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2083</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of the structure of the &#217;a Pou dialect of the Marquesan language</field><field name="creator">Mutu, Margaret</field><field name="description">This thesis is made up of three parts; the first is an outline and discussion of the various approaches taken in the description of Polynesian languages in the last 30 years. It provides background discussion of the model of description used in the rest of the thesis. The second deals with the phonology of the 'Ua Pou dialect, concentrating in particular on two areas; the phonetics of the glottal stop phoneme, and penultimate vowel extension. The latter is a feature which has received no mention in any literature to date but is the most noticeable suprasegmental phonetic difference between the Marquesan dialects and the other Eastern Polynesian languages. The last four chapters describe the structure of phrases in the 'Ua Pou dialect. The first two of these deals with the centripetal particles of the noun and verb phrase respectively, that is, the particles within phrases which modify the base of that phrase. Particles which relate phrases to other phrases, that is, the prepositions and ai, are dealt with separately in the last two chapters since their description requires some comments on the syntax of the language.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420100 Language Studies::420104 Pacific languages</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2086</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of clones of cytotoxic lymphocytes</field><field name="creator">Ching, Lai-Ming</field><field name="description">1.	&#8216;Spotaneously&#8217; generated cytotoxic clones were detected when normal spleen cells from CBA, DBA/2 or (CBA x DBA/2)F1 mice were cultured in polyacrylamide cultures vessels without stimulator cells. Cytotoxicity was mediated by T cells and the highest number of clones occurred after 4 days in culture. The spontaneous cytotoxic T cell clones were detected mainly in adult spleen cell cultures. Few spontaneous clones were generated by lymph node, thymus or neonatal spleen cells. 2.	The production of spontaneous clones does not increase linearly with the number of cells cultured which is in contrast with the production of &#8216;stimulated&#8217; clones of cytotoxic lymphocytes in the polyacylamide vessels. At the optimal cell concentration, 1.3 x 10 7 cells per culture, 20 spontaneous clones of CLs lysing P815 mastocytoma cell targets were detected in cultures of (CBA x DBA/2)F1 spleen cells and 14 clones were detected in cultures of CBA or DBA/2 spleen cells. 3.	The specificity of the spontaneous clones was examined by dividing each clone into two halves and assaying the half clones against a pair of different target cells. A range of spontaneous CLs of different specifications was produced. Spontaneous clones lysing syngeneic and allogeneic tumour or normal spleen cell blasts, as well as hapten-modified target cells were detected. 4.	Individual spontaneous clones of CLs exhibited a high degree of discrimination and were able to differentiate between many pairs of target cells which were syngeneic with respect to each other. 5.	When blast cells which had been induced by various mitogens were used as the target cells, the results indicated that spontaneous CL clones could discriminate between subsets of syngeneic lymphocytes which respond to different mitogens. 6.	One-way stimulated CL responses were generated using cells from mice which had been treated with cyclophosphamide. Treatment of mice with 200mg/kg cyclophosphamide abolished the ability of the cells to generate spontaneous clones in culture without impairing their ability to stimulate the production of CLs in responder cell populations. 7.	In contrast with spontaneous clones which could discriminate between different H2d target cells, CLs produced by CBA spleen cells stimulated with H2d alloantigens were observed not to differentiate between various H2d target cells. The results indication that spontaneous clones of CLs were not a representative sample of the stimulated clones of CLs. 8.	When CBA spleen cells were stimulated simultaneously with H2b and H2d alloantigens, separate populations of Cls against the two sets of antigens were produced. Very few cross-reactive clones were detected. 9.	When (CBA x C57B1)F1 spleen cells were stimulated with syngeneic F1 cells modified with TNP, clones of CLs lysing TNP modified cells of the F1 and the two parental strains were produced. The frequency of clones produced by F1 spleen cells against F1-TNP, CBA-TNP and C57B1-TNP target cells was 1 per 3.3 x 10 4, 1 per 6.7 x 10 4 and 1 per 10 5 spleen cells respectively. When (CBA x C57B1)F1 cells were cultured with TNP-modified CBA cells, clones of CLs against TNP-modified cells of both the parental strain were produced. CLs which lyse CBA-TNP and CLs which lyse C75B1-TNP targets segregated as two distinct populations with no cross-reactivity.</field><field name="date">1978</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2087</field></doc><doc><field name="title">General managers in the South Pacific: managerial behaviour and the impact of culture on decision making in the island nations of the South Pacific</field><field name="creator">Reddy, Narendra</field><field name="description">This research is concerned with the way in which general managers work in the island nations of the South Pacific: what they do, how they make policy decisions and manage the various resources of their organization. It looks particularly at the impact of their culture on management decision making. A literature review revealed that until recently most of the research work on managers was done in the west. In recent years there has been a proliferation of research on Japanese management practices and the decision making styles of Japanese managers. However, there is little research on managers and management in developing countries, and hardly any on managers and management, in the South Pacific island nations. This was dramatically evident when a computer search was completed early in this study. There were thousands of references available on managers and management. As more key words were included the number of references declined. Eventually when 'the South Pacific' was added there was a blank. The south Pacific is very much virgin territory when it comes to research information and data on managers and management. The question 'what do managers do?' appears simple but is difficult to answer. The traditional view of the manager's job comes from the classical school of writers who describe their work in terms of a composite of functions. Fayol defined it, in terms of five basic managerial functions planning, organizing, coordinating, commanding and controlling. In the 1930s Gulick introduced the concept of POSDCORB. Among later empirical works one of the most comprehensive studies on managers has been by Mintzberg who defines a manager's job under its distinguishing characteristics, the working roles, the variations in the manager's job, and the scientific nature of work. In this study the general manager's work has been examined by gathering data from in-depth interviews and observations of twenty general managers/chief executives from the South Pacific region. Four general managers each from Fiji, Western Samoa, Solomon Islands, Kiribati and Tonga were observed and interviewed for a week each over a seven month period and the results of the study are reported in this thesis. The study revealed that the work of general managers in the South Pacific islands is fragmented and they are engaged in a lot of activities with short duration. Furthermore routine administrative functions consume much of the chief executive's time, while little time and attention is devoted to planning and development work. The various indigenous South Pacific cultures are not supportive of managers, management and businesses in their endeavour to be successful and progressive. The cultures are conservative and generally do not want change, at least rapid change, and wish to preserve and maintain their culture and way of life.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420307 Pacific cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2088</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanisms of cytokinin action</field><field name="creator">Berridge, Michael Vivian</field><field name="description">1.	Twenty-two synthetic analogues of adenine were tested for their ability to promote the growth of Chinese cabbage leaf discs. In general an adenine residue substituted in the N6 position with a group of moderate size is required for maximum growth activity. 2.	Kinetin increases the turnover of ribosomes in floated Chinese cabbage leaf tissue. 3.	The synthetic cytokinins kinetin and 6-benzylaminopurine bind reversibly to purifies Chinese cabbage leaf ribosomes. At 4&#176;C, 0.8 molecules of kinetin and 1.08 molecules of 6BA are bound per ribosome. Adenine and adenine derivatives that are inactive as cytokinins showed much lower affinity for ribosomes. A positive correlation between the extent of ribosome binding of synthetic adenine analogues and their biological cytokinin activity was demonstrated. 4.	&#8216;In vitro&#8217; aminoacylating systems from Chinese cabbage and &#8216;in vitro&#8217; protein synthesizing systems from Chinese cabbage and etiolated pea shoots were developed and characterized. Cytokinins had no significant effect on these systems. 5.	Kinetin increased gross starch degradation and sugar utilization in leaf discs floated for 3 days in the light or dark whether or not sucrose was present in the floating medium. Since kinetin induced a change in neutral sugars prior to a change in starch content of the tissue, reduced sugar pools in kinetin treated tissue are suggested as the cause of induced starch degradation. 6.	14Co2 labelling of leaf tissue pretreated with kinetin for 24hr showed increased radioactivity in chloroform-soluble material and most sugar phosphates and a 35-40% decrease in radioactivity in the neutral sugars, glucose, sucrose and fructose. Incorporation into ATP was increase by 40% by kinetin. 7.	Isolated pea nuclei bound 6BA, kinetin and vvDMAAP, but showed low affinity for 3BA. DNase treatment of the nuclei enhanced 6BA binding by 100% while pronase treatment reduced binding. Binding sites liberated by DNase treatment showed reduced affinity for 3BA. It is suggested that nuclei contain cytokinin receptor site of a protein nature.</field><field name="date">1971</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2091</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tafesilafa'i: exploring Samoan alcohol use and health within the framework of fa'asamoa</field><field name="creator">Lima, Ieti</field><field name="description">This study seeks to establish how cultural change is transforming Samoan perceptions of alcohol and its role in social life by comparing understandings of, attitudes to, and patterns of alcohol use in successive generations of Samoans to establish how these are changing, and how trends in alcohol use might be expected to affect Samoan health status. It examines the complex relationships between alcohol and culture, and how such relationships interact to influence health. As well, it explores how Samoan culture, fa'asamoa, has changed since contact with Europeans, how, these changes have influenced Samoan people's perceptions and use of alcohol, and the role alcohol now plays in Samoan social life. Moreover, the thesis documents the social history of alcohol in Samoa since the nineteenth century, and explores the roles of some of the Europeans in shaping Samoan people's attitudes and behaviours towards alcohol and its use. Additionally, it examines the commercial and political economic interests of early European agencies in Samoa such as beachcombers, traders, colonial administrators, and missionaries which impacted on and influenced, to a considerable extent, Samoan people's drinking patterns. The study uses a qualitative methodological approach, utilizing qualitative interviewing as the main method of gathering data and various other methods to supplement the data. The sample population included Samoan men and women, of various religious denominations, drinkers and abstainers, born and raised in Samoa and in New Zealand. Unstructured interviews with thirty-nine participants, and eight key informants were conducted in Apia, Auckland, and Christchurch. The key informants included: a bishop of the Church of Latter Day Saints, the Samoan Police Commissioner, and the Secretary of the Samoan Liquor Authority who were interviewed in Apia; a pastor/lecturer of the Congregational Christian Church of American Samoa who was interviewed in Pago Pago, American Samoa; while two Samoan-born medical health professionals, a pastor of the Congregational Christian Church of Samoa, and one New Zealand-born woman researcher were interviewed in Auckland. The study found that alcohol and the drinking of it has secured a place in the social life of Samoans in the islands and in migrant communities such as those in Auckland, and to a lesser extent, Christchurch. It also found that while older women's and men's experiences and attitudes to alcohol differ significantly, particularly those born and raised in the islands, some similarities in the attitudes and practices of younger people towards alcohol, especially those born- and raised in New Zealand have emerged.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420307 Pacific cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2171</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mosaic: a study of juxtaposition in literature, as an approach to Pound's Cantos and similar modern poems</field><field name="creator">Horrocks, Roger</field><field name="description">The principles of form in &#8216;mosaic&#8217; poems such as The Cantos, Paterson, Maximus, or even &#8216;The Waste Land,&#8217; are not yet clearly understood. Criticism needs to bring its various ideas of &#8216;musical form,&#8217; &#8216;non-linear form,&#8217; or &#8216;the poem as a field of forces&#8217; into sharper focus. Mosaic poems are characterized by sudden changes of direction, heightened contrasts of style and texture, a complex use of quotation, and strange effects of fluidity where the usual distinction between the &#8216;tenor&#8217; and &#8216;vehicle&#8217; of metaphors is dissolved. To decide what features (if any) of the modern mosaic poem are new, the thesis examines possible precedents: so-called &#8216;pre-logical&#8217; poetry, the associationism of Romantic poetry, Leaves of Grass, Rimbaud&#8217;s poems, Mallarm&#233;&#8217;s Un coup de d&#233;s, etc. the work of European avant-garde poets of the 1910s (Apollinaire, Cendrars, Marinetti, et al.) is considered in detail, and the supposed originality of Pound and Eliot&#8217;s poetry is somewhat diminished when it is viewed against this European background. Nevertheless Pound and Eliot do contribute some technical innovations, particularly in the way their poetry combines &#8216;hard&#8217; and &#8216;soft&#8217; textures (to use Pound&#8217;s terms). The thesis examines Pound&#8217;s special &#8216;breakthrough&#8217; in 1919, and also the close interaction between his work and Eliot&#8217;s during this period &#8211; the two men advancing &#8216;like mountaineers roped together.' Mosaic poems demand a new style of &#8216;reading by field.&#8217; Criticism needs to develop ways of talking about the experience of discontinuity as sensitively as it now deals with continuity. Approaches to The Cantos that emphasize &#8216;ideogrammic logic&#8217; tend to be over-intellectual and not able to deal adequately with the more fluid or discontinuous aspects of the poem. The thesis explores the procedures of mosaic poetry, its various styles of &#8216;jumping&#8217; (to use Robert Bly&#8217;s term), ways of using fragments evocatively, and ways in which gaps or silences in a poem can be charged with meaning. Since collage is an important feature of mosaic poetry, the thesis attempts to survey this development historically, distinguishing it in some respects from traditional styles of quotation and allusion. The mosaic poem is compared and contrasted with earlier types of poem-sequence. The doubts expressed by Eliot, Tate, and other critics about the coherence of the modern long poem are answered by such essays as &#8216;Dr Williams&#8217; Position&#8217; in which Pound proposes new ideas of order. But Pound&#8217;s poetic practice was still more subtle than his theory, a discrepancy also noted in Eliot&#8217;s work. The thesis looks cautiously at the analogy often drawn between mosaic poetry and modern painting or film-making. It also examines the ways in which the music of pre-modern composers such as Bach and Beethoven has been used as a formal model by mosaic poets. The thesis offers a detailed analysis of &#8216;Canto XLVII&#8217; as a critical experiment in analyzing the reader&#8217;s temporal experience of mosaic poetry, his &#8216;shifting gestalts&#8217; as he explores the &#8216;field&#8217; of the poem. The analysis seeks to clarify the way in which The Cantos combines &#8216;Imagist&#8217; hardness with the fluidity of Symbolist poetry.</field><field name="date">1976</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420100 Language Studies::420101 English</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2093</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of the problem solving strategies used in family discussion groups</field><field name="creator">Everts, Johannes F.</field><field name="description">This investigation was inspired by Carkhuff's postulated that the principles which underlie effective counseling are equally pertinent to everyday human relationships &#8211; such as one may observe in the family. Carkhuff has not articulated this postulate in any detail and the present investigation both develops the notion of family problem solving strategies and tests it out in a practical situation. The development of this notion of family problem solving strategies begins with an integration of Carkhuff's model of the counseling process with similar models put forward by other authors. This is followed by a detailed analysis of family problem solving strategies as reported in the literature, and collation of data from both sources into a so-called Family Transaction Model (FTM). This Model consists of a series of distinctive though related parameters of family problem solving which include inner feelings, listening, self-expression, conflict management, the determination and execution of action plans, and the roles adopted by family members. Each parameter is defined in terms of specific behaviours or skills, postulated as necessary for effective problem solving. This FTM is then subjected to empirical validation in a comprehensive field study using 75 members of 18 complete nuclear families. A factor analysis of data derived from videotaped family discussions shows up two distinctive factors, "supportive involvement" and "distracting involvement"; these cover the parameters postulated above albeit in modified format. The main measurement variables involved have satisfactory inter-examiner and test-retest reliability. The FTM plus ancillary measures is shown to be highly effective in discriminating between parents and children; the former virtually embody the characteristics of supportive involvement while the latter show its obverse or distracting involvement. The Model also differentiates between male and female parents and, to a lesser extent, between male and female children. But it does not differentiate between family groups defined as troubled or untroubled on the basis of their referral to some helping agency or their mutual ratings of problem solving effectiveness. The format used for this assessment phase of the investigation also demonstrates the viability of using questionnaire ratings to ascertain family problem solving strategies, the value of family group discussion of real issues as a means to gather diagnostic data, and the inhibiting effects of videotape recording on the interview behaviour of participants. Finally the FTM is used as basis for a short-term treatment programme of 4 further sessions, such as might be undertaken by community resource personnel who have limited time and skill. This programme proves ineffective in changing observed interview behaviour, though participants report beneficial changes in attitude, mutual understanding and family relationships outside the interview situation. The results further suggest that the FTM is a viable basis for a treatment programme but that it is too comprehensive for success to be achieved in so few sessions, that therapists require extensive prior experience and training, that family members need to be flexibly involved in treatment, and that the entire programme needs to be carefully planned with a high degree of structure in the initial stages. The results of the present study as a whole provide a basis for further investigation including the validation of the FTM with a wide range of family groups, the development of more comprehensive rating scales, modifications in the assessment interview&#8217;s format, the development of a more effective treatment programme, and the development of an appropriate training programme for community resource personnel.</field><field name="date">1978</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2094</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ecology, population dynamics, and energetics of some soft shore molluscs</field><field name="creator">Larcombe, M.

In the past thirty years studies of community and population ecology of marine soft-shore invertebrates have increased, both in number and in depth, A good knowledge is building up of the interactions of benthic invertebrates with their physical and biotic environments. (Boughey, 1967; Green, 1968; Nancock and Simpson, 1962;) This thesis examines the ecology, population dynamics, and energetics of some common intertidals soft-shore molluscs, having particular concern with the range of variation that is possible in one parameter for different populations of the same species. Similar work has not been frequently attempted for molluscs, although there is some information available from syntheses of the work of different authors on the same species.(Bullock, 1955; Dehnel, 1955; Fretter and Graham, 1962; Hyman, 1967 ; Prosser , 1955; Wilbur and Yonge, 1966;) Most authors have concentrated either on the ecology of a species, or on the population dynamics of one population, or perhaps on the influence of one environmental factor, such as temperature, on one parameter, such as growth rate; rarely has there been a study of the interaction of several environmental factors with several population parameters .

General Introduction 1.1 Aims of this work.  The broad object of this work has been to improve understanding of shallow water marine environments and their faunal associations. To this end, information has been integrated from a number of specific investigations which were: 1. To examine the benthic macrofauna associated with sedimentary deposits, in an area with steep environmental gradients and associated complexity of faunal distributions. 2. To identify and describe the major benthic marofaunal associations, using both classical &#8220;intuitive" methods and more objective statistical methods employing computer techniques. 3. To investigate the hydrological and sedimentary features of the local environment, as a background to the faunal investigations.  4. To relate the distribution of the fauna and associations ;a selected environmental parameters, with particular reference to the grain-size characteristics of the sediments. 5. To relate the faunal associations to similar associations elsewhere in New Zealand and overseas. 6. To investigate the relationships between the living fauna and the dead remains of organisms found in the sediments, with the view to providing information which may be usefull to paleaecologists. 7. To try to portray certain aspects of the underwater environment difficult to appreciate by means other than diving.</field><field name="date">1972</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2098</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of rapid freezing techniques, and their application to an electron microscopical study of phloem structure</field><field name="creator">Dempsey, Graeme Peter</field><field name="description">Preface This thesis is divided into two parts: Part I - The Use of Rapid Freezing Techniques to Study Unfixed, Non-Cryoprotected Animal and Plant Tissues by Freeze-Substitution and Freeze-Fracturing . Part II - The Distribution of P-Protein in Mature Sieve Elements of Phloem, and its Relation to Proposed Translocatory Mechanisms.  The ultrastructure of the sieve elements of the phloem has remained a controversial issue for many years, mainly because of the extreme sensitivity of the cells to manipulation and conventional electron microscopical fixation methods. It was thought that rapid freezing, in association with freeze-substitution or freeze-fracturing, would stabilise the tissue and provide an image of the sieve element as little removed as possible from the in vivo condition. Thus, it was necessary to utilise a technique which froze tissue extremely rapidly, so that the use of cryoprotectants could be avoided.  Therefore, the work reported in Part I of this thesis describes efforts to evaluate the available freezing techniques, and to adapt and test a suitable technique for the investigation of phloem ultrastructure. This technique, coupled with other conventional electron microscopical methods, is employed in Part II of this thesis to study the ultrastructure of mature sieve elements.</field><field name="date">1975</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2099</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design and evaluation of projects with variable labour response: case study of agricultural aid on Atiu</field><field name="creator">Bollard, Alan</field><field name="description">This thesis analyses producer response to technical change using agricultural aid projects on Atiu, Cook Islands, as an example.

Although I have concentrated on the poetry, I have also ranged freely over the published writing of all these men. My conclusions can be reduced to these two propositions: 1. That the significance of a literary city can be understood only in conjunction with an attempt to explore the significance of other literary landscapes. 2. The significance of the city (and other landscapes) as metaphor is to be understood in terms of a basic process whereby the self is realized. This process is most simply represented geographically by a pattern of withdrawal and return, with the city and wilderness figuring as poles between which the self moves. The second proposition can be elaborated as follows: The process begins with the individual in a condition of alienation from his culture. This is culture, not just as a system of meaning and value, but culture as a way in which experience is ordered. At this point in the process, the city becomes a metaphor for the structures whereby a culture orders its common experience. The most basic ground for social alienation is that these structures serve to cut the individual off from experience. The response to this alienation is a desire to undergo a reductive process whereby orientative structures are simplified or demolished. The aim of such a process, which has a corresponding metaphor in the geographical metaphor of withdrawal, is to restore contact with experience. The experiential world is characterized by the absence of structure. Its cardinal metaphor is nature as wilderness (wildness), though, again, the city as oceanic and dislocative can fulfil a like function. It is in the unmediated intercourse with such a world that the self is realized. At this point a sense of meaning and value arises as experience is assimilated and integrated. The result of such an integration is a structure valid for the self&#8212;a structure, we might note, with no claims to permanence or finality. What is discovered in the wilderness is not so much a final structure, as a way of structuring. Which is what the realized individual brings back to the society from which he remains alienated. As the city can serve as metaphor for social structures, so it can serve as a metaphor for the structure (and the way of structuring) that might be--an ideal city. The final task is the discovery of a role that might facilitate the realization of this authentic culture.</field><field name="date">1976</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420100 Language Studies::420101 English</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2105</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interhemispheric transfer in a marsupial : a behavioural investigation of interhemispheric transfer of visual information in Trichosurus vulpecula</field><field name="creator">Webster, Donald MacDonald</field><field name="description">Eight marsupial phalangers, (Trichosurus vulpecula) with mid-saggital section of the optic chiasma were trained monocularly in a visual discrimination task, as were four which had, in addition, mid-saggital sections of the anterior commissure, fasciculus aberrans and hippocampal commissure. All were tested for transfer to the untrained hemisphere. The results showed that those with the commissures intact transferred information to the hemisphere not trained directly, while those with commissures sectioned did not. It appears that transfer of visual information between cerebral hemispheres can take place in an animal which lacks a corpus callosum, and that the forebrain commissures may be the functional equivalent, in this marsupial, of the corpus callosum in eutherians. A further eight animals received mid-saggital section of the optic chiasma. Two had all other interhemispheric pathways intact, two had mid-saggital section of fasciculus aberrans and hippocampal and anterior commissures, two had fasciculus aberrans only sectioned, and two had fasciculus aberrans only intact. All were trained monocularly in a visual discrimination task and tested for transfer to the opposite hemisphere. Those with all commissural pathways intact and those with only fasciculus aberrans intact demonstrated transfer. Those with all commissures sectioned and those with only fasciculus aberrans sectioned did not show transfer.

Haupt felt however that Engelhard was so different from those versions of Amicus and Amelius which he knew, 'dass entweder das lateinische buch nach welchem er dichtete (212. 6493) ein anderes war oder er selbst den stoff mit grosser freiheit behandelt hat.</field><field name="date">1972</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420100 Language Studies::420109 German</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2112</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Auckland Business and Businessmen in the 1880s</field><field name="creator">Stone, R. C. J.</field><field name="description">The city of Auckland in 1885 was free from the depression which had troubled the greater part of the colony of New Zealand since the early years of the decade. There had been a buoyant economic atmosphere for some time. The main local bodies of the city were carrying out an expansionist public works programme. Many new public companies had been formed in recent years. The city and suburbs were visibly growing as the building of houses, shops and commercial blocks went on at a rapid tempo. By early 1886, however, the prosperity had gone. Auckland passed into as harsh a decade as any experienced in the one hundred and thirty years of its European existence. Bankruptcies multiplied and were found in high and unexpected places. Firms imagined to be of unquestioned solidity fell. Large local companies were forced to liquidate: there was usually little left over for division among shareholders who had taken up holdings in more confident days. Thousands of properties fell into the hands of mortgagees.  Few were aware of how serious and general was the business collapse until October 1888 when a shareholders&#8217; committee of the Bank of New Zealand presented an alarming report. It disclosed that the heavy losses of the Bank were relatively far worse in Auckland than elsewhere and went on to censure much of the business carried on in the city and province. Since the Bank of New Zealand had long been regarded as an Auckland institution and its board invariably drawn from prominent businessmen of the city, this report reflected adversely upon the existing commercial practices, and the leadership of the city. But if there were &#8216;guilty men&#8217; as the report suggested, they were never brought to trial, nor were their names revealed except in the vaguest terms. The Banking Committee set up by the House of Representatives in 1896, failed to persuade Bank directors to name either the weak accounts, or the inadequate securities that the Bank had accepted in Auckland and the Waikato. Bank spokesmen were as tight-lipped as any private banker in Zurich. The facts were not revealed nor have been since. Yet the charges made in 1888 have generally stuck. It has been believed that influential Aucklanders did much to keep their city in a state of artificial prosperity.  This thesis grew out of intermittent research into Auckland&#8217;s economic development in the 1880s that I began in 1956. Since 1964 I have more seriously and continuously studied the businessmen of the decade. I soon found explanations of the boom and collapse invariably moralistic and generally unsatisfactory. Rarely did demonological trappings fit the businessmen when studied in detail. I became convinced that the sudden growth of the city and the related economic expansion were primarily economic phenomena that had primarily economic explanations. Where I have been able I have turned in my research to business records. The Sir John Logan Campbell Papers at the Auckland Institute Library were extremely valuable. But records of firms were all too few. I relied most heavily on quite unspectacular documents: the daily press, and the records of the land registries in Auckland and Hamilton and the companies&#8217; office in Auckland. Newspapers reported company business very fully in those days. The press invariably carried prospectuses, and had detailed accounts of company meetings. Annual reports, financial statements and shareholders&#8217; discussions at an important company meeting might run into thousands of words. Bankruptcy proceedings, and civil actions in court, moreover, were given far more detailed press coverage than today and tell us much about how the less successful and more litigious conducted their affairs.  Lands and deeds records I found exceptionally valuable. With some persistence and a little luck one can reconstruct much of the borrowing of the men whose names the Bank of New Zealand refused to reveal, and other businessmen as well. The key was usually a legal description of one piece of land of the person concerned often to be gained from the General Assembly electoral rolls. Deeds and memoranda of mortgage and transfer I found very rewarding. An unexpected bonus from Certificate of Title Register Books were maps that gave the means of establishing the dimensions of estates that usually described in very general and often erroneous terms.  The virtually unused company records stored in the National Archives Record Centre at Auckland proved to be a mine of information. Records of the old law firms and banks where available proved very valuable but the position of professional trust in which the lawyer and the banker stand in relation to clients&#8217; records must inevitably limit the opportunities of the historian to participate.</field><field name="date">1969</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::430000 History and Archaeology::430100 Historical Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2113</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Les formules exclamatives dans les farces (1450-1550): le parler expressif entre en sc&#232;ne</field><field name="creator">Weir, Andrew</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">fr</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420200 Literature Studies::420209 French</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2114</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of biological disturbance in determining the organisation of sub-tidal encrusting communities in temperate waters</field><field name="creator">Ayling, Tony, 1947-</field><field name="description">Biological disturbance was found to be one of the most important mechanisms control1ing community organisation in the temperate sub-tidal region. The different types of biological disturbance structuring three encrusting communities were investigated on the east coast of Northland, New Zealand. The operation of each type was determined and the rate of disturbance measured. Experimental exclusion treatments were set up to demonstrate the effects of the major disturbance agents on community structure. The urchin Evechinus chloroticus was the most abundant agent of biological disturbance and affected the widest spectrum of encrusting organisms. The abundant balistid fish Navodon scaber was another major agent of biological disturbance in this region. Disturbance of algal populations also resulted from a guild of abundant herbivorous gastropods. Two episodes of fungal/bacterial infection degraded numbers of the large sponges Ancorina alata and Polymastia fusca. The operation of the different disturbance agents was found to be generally unpredictable in both time and space. There was no escape from biological disturbance for encrusting organisms in either small or large size. Re-occupation processes on patches of free primary space were investigated both experimentally and by using settlement plates (artificial free space patches). Recruitment was found to be irregular in space and time, especially for long-lived sessile organisms. Settlement processes as well as growth and mortality of newly settled organisms were investigated with a view to understanding community development. Only one verifiable example of substrate preparation or biological succession was found to operate in the communities studied. It is postulated that community organisation is flexible and not rigidly directed along a single successional pathway. Multiple developmental pathways and multiple stable configurations are possible in the same locality, resulting from the operation of different disturbance regimes.</field><field name="date">1976</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology::270504 Invertebrate biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2115</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Byron's Plays: An interpretative study</field><field name="creator">Sharkey, Michael, 1946-</field><field name="description">This dissertation examines the eight dramas which Lord Byron wrote in Italy, to evaluate this motives in writing plays, and to trace his views on various fields. The plays are discussed individually in some detail. The Introductory Chapter indicates the status of the theatre in Byron's time, and distinguished "poetic" dramas from plays written with a view to the stage. Byron's idea of a "mental theatre" is indicated, together with his involvement in the production of dramas as a member of the Drury Lane Management Committee. Chapter Two: Manfred, Byron's first play, written in 1817, is seen as a development from Gothic drama; a closer examination suggests Byron described the world in dualistic terms. The eponymous protagonist defies the claims of the "evil Principle in propria persona." Promethean aspects of the hero are indicated, and auto-biographical elements in the play are considered. Chapter Three: Marino Faliero is seen as a "political" drama, in which the tragic protagonist identifies the State as the oppressor of individual rights. The Doge Faliero's "traditional" code of ethics is opposed by a revolutionist ethic which he adopts in order to crush the State. Byron suggests the Doge is used by both the State and his revolutionary allies as a figurehead; the Doge's character is investigated, and Byron's involvement in political affairs is briefly examined to show any political motive in his writing the play. Chapter Four: Sardanapalus explores the idea of a humane ruler condemned by his subjects as too "soft," and deposed by traditional elements in the army and state religion. Byron's skeptical and "liberal" views are indicated. Chapter Five: The Two Foscari shows the "suppressed passions" operating against a political current. Byron is seen to question assumptions concerning "duty" and patriotism, along lines explored in the two preceding neoclassical plays. Chapter Six: Cain. Byron's most controversial play is seen as an attempt to define man's relationships to God and nature. Byron takes up earlier suggestions in his plays of a dualist view of the universe, and expatiates on his sceptic views. A notion of the mind's self-sufficiency, outlined in Manfred, is further developed. Chapter Seven: Heaven and Earth provides further definition of man's place in an ostensibly hostile universe. Japhet, the "hero" of the drama, is confounded by the apparent indiscriminateness of God's punishment of man in the Flood. The notion of plural worlds, suggested in earlier works, and particularly in Cain is again utilised. Chapter Eight: Werner. In Byron's most "theatrical" work, an inheritance of guilt is reviewed to suggest the notion of a "damned world." Byron's deliberate melodramatic structuring of Werner, and his concern with psychological investigation of notive are examined. Chapter Nine: The Deformed Transformed. Byron's last, unfinished, play provides a recapitulation of themes of the earlier plays and looks forward to the style and concerns of Don Juan. Byron is most "inventive" and unrestrained in this drama that abrogates all the classical unities and appears to work toward an endorsement of the idea of salvation by act of will. The concluding chapter relates Byron's view of the universe that emerges form the dramas considered separately and together. The particular aims of each play, and the stylistic features of each, which defy general statements about an overall ambition, are recapitulated. Byron's reasons for choosing dramatic form are briefly sketched in light of the investigation of individual works. His concern to experiment, and to avoid prescription, is seen as indicating a possible mode of operation for a revival of the English drama in the Romantic era.</field><field name="date">1976</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420200 Literature Studies::420204 British and Irish</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2117</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Shakespeare in the Netherlands: a study of Dutch translations and Dutch performances of William Shakespeare's plays</field><field name="creator">Leek, Robert H., 1935-</field><field name="description">Introduction Subject matter. The content of the following pages is the result of a research project originally concerned solely with Dutch translations of Shakespeare&#8217;s plays; but even in its preliminary stages &#8211; the collecting of copies and data &#8211; it became evident that the field was far too wide to be done justice in one single short-term study. Between the middle of the seventeenth century and the present day more than fifty Dutch authors have busied themselves with the translation or adaptation of Shakespeare&#8217;s plays. It might have been feasible to subject the work of one of these to detailed scrutiny, or to devote a less thorough, but still fairly comprehensive analysis to half a dozen of them. But such a study would have taken shape in a vacuum: since, to date, little academic research on this topic has been undertaken by Dutch scholars and, to my knowledge, none whatsoever in the English-speaking world, there would be no way of relating the findings on any one translator or any one limited set of translators to the merits of their many colleagues, to the cultural environment in which his or her work was conceived, and to the historical perspective of these efforts. Hence, the project developed, firstly, towards the establishment of such a historical and cultural perspective and, secondly, towards viewing the problem of translating Shakespeare into Dutch in general terms, and in a framework that would accommodate, in a cursory way, at least all those translators whose work has been &#8211; and in many cases still is &#8211; accessible to the Dutch public of this century, either in published versions or in performance on the stage.  The historical and cultural perspective. The first thirteen chapters, therefore, contain only a limited amount of material on translations. A few pages of Chapter I are devoted to an isolated seventeenth-century version of The Taming of the Shrew; Chapters III and IV are concerned, respectively, with a set of eighteenth-century prose translations and with the classicist French and German derivates of some Shakespearean plays that were translated into Dutch and performed in the Netherlands, in some cases, until less than a century ago; Chapters VII and VIII deal briefly with a dozen nineteenth-century translators whose work, but for that of one of them (L. A. J. Burgersdijk), is of historical interest only. Finally, Chapter XI introduces the efforts of twentieth-century translators, which come under closer scrutiny in the second part of the study. Had this work been submitted to a university in the Netherlands, a brief reference to texts by scholars such as Dr. R. Pennink, Prof. Dr. B. Hunningher and Prof. Dr. H. H. J. de Leeuwe would have rendered the writing of Chapters II and V, as well as some sections of Chapters VI, IX and XII superfluous. These chapters and sections deal with the earliest reactions to Shakespeare by the world of Dutch letters &#8211; between the early eighteenth and mid-nineteenth centuries - , with the Dutch theatre of the past two centuries and with those who were concerned with, and involved in it as writers, critics and directors. However, this material is only accessible to Dutch readers, and must be assumed to be totally unfamiliar to their English counterparts and, for that reason, had to be summarised and incorporated in this study, even though my limited research period in the Netherlands &#8211; a little short of twelve months &#8211; left no scope for independent work on my part in these specialized fields. The same applies to the content of Chapter I: the movements of strolling players from England in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth century, and their effect on the dramaturgy and theatre history of The Netherlands and Germany.</field><field name="date">1972</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420200 Literature Studies::420214 Other European</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2119</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physiological and Behavioural Studies on the Ecology of some New Zealand Chitons</field><field name="creator">Boyle, Peter Robin</field><field name="description">Experiments on the responses to osmotic stress and desiccation are reported for several species of New Zealand littoral chitons. Qualitative and quantitative studies on the ecology of the common Auckland species have been undertaken, with special reference to microhabitat conditions. The micro-anatomy of the dorsal sensory organs has been studied, and related to the comparative responses to light stimuli, and experiments involving interference with these organs. Sypharochiton pelliserpentis was found t o be an osmo-conformer, showing only limited volume regulation but a wide tolerance to salinity fluctuations. Size of the animal had a negligible effect on the osmotic response, and it is likely that other chitons are osmo-conformers but with less tolerance of osmotic stress. Animals of this species were better able to resist the effects of desiccation than several other chitons. This resulted from a kinetic behaviour pattern in response to low humidities causing aggregation in the laboratory, and a well developed tolerance of extreme water loss, Sypharochiton Pelliserpentis colonises a wide rage of microhabitats on rock surfaces, some exposed to wide salinity changes (13.28&#176;/oo to 45 .80&#176;/ooS) between tides, and others exposed t o drying. Population size structures indicate that exposure t o desiccation is likely t o be more important than osmotic stress in controlling populations, and microhabitat more important than tidal level. The other chitons studied were restricted to pools, beneath boulders or to wave-splashed situations which did not dry. One very fast-moving chiton, Ischnochiton maorianus exhibited photo-negative orientation and the 'shadow response', the full range of reactions to light stimuli yet reported in chitons. It possesses only the megalaesthete type of dorsel sensory receptor. Experiments showed masking or abrading these organs to affect the rate of response, and it is concluded that at least one of their functions is light reception. Hithochiton neglectus, a species possessing well developed extra-pigmental ocelli, did not show such clear responses to light. Problems of the structure and function of these organs are discussed.</field><field name="date">1967</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2120</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cytokinins and The Growth of Spirodela Oligorrhiza</field><field name="creator">McCombs, Patrick James Alan, 1947-</field><field name="description">1.	Spirodela oligorrhiza on sterile glucose-mineral medium ceased to grow three days after transfer into darkness. 2.	Cytokinins, supplied in the medium, allowed continuous growth of Spirodela after transfer into darkness. Other plant growth substances, or adenine analogues, were ineffective. 3.	Kinetin stimulated production of new fronds after a 24 hour lag period when added to dormant cultures although it was rapidly taken up. Kinetin reached a constant concentration in the plantlets within 30 to 60 minutes of addition to the medium. 4.	In the absence of cytokinin, dormancy continued for three or four weeks after which growth spontaneously resumed in darkness. The growth rate then reached almost half that achieved with optimum kinetin concentrations in darkness. Growth continued in darkness for at least eight weeks without cytokinin. 5.	Pretreatment in the light with either metabolic inhibitors, kinetin, abscisic acid, or high or low temperature, essentially eliminated the period of dormancy of Spirodela transferred to darkness in the absence of cytokinin. Growth was reduced 50% to 90% during the pretreatments. 6.	The pretreatments designed to affect plastid RNA, protein or ATP production were the most effective. The fastest growth rate achieved in darkness without cytokinin after pre-treatment was 10% less than that promoted by optimum kinetin. 7.	Dormant Spirodela in darkness continued to incorporate precursors into RNA, DNA and protein at a rate 50% that in growing (plus kinetin) cultures. Net rates of macromolecule accumulation were extremely slow, indicating extensive degradation. 8.	Addition of kinetine to non-growing Spirodela in darkness stimulated the synthesis of RNA, DNA and protein simultaneously after a lag of approximately one hour. The rates of precursor incorporation increased to equal those in continuously growing cultures. 9.	Non-growing Spriodela in darkness rapidly accumulated starch. Kinetin had little or no effect on accumulation and mobilisation of starch. 10.	14C-glucose was taken up by growing (plus kinetin) and non-growing (minus kinetin) Spirodela in darkness, and was metabolized equally in each. Three times as much 14C-glucose entered starch in the non-growing cultures. 11.	A model scheme for control of dormancy in Spirodela is proposed based on an inhibitory mediator. The mediator may be similar to the hypothetical mediator of the pleiotypic response shown by animal cells.</field><field name="date">1971</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270300 Microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2123</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the respiration of mangrove seedlings</field><field name="creator">Outred, Heather Anne</field><field name="description">The mangrove seedlings Bruguiera and Aviceania develop in a swamp environment where oxygen may be deficient and carbon dioxide in high concentration. Both of these states may be inimical to respiratory processes in plants and especially to the early stages of germination. While vivipary allows the development of the seedlings to a stage where they may better withstand the unfavourable conditions of the environment, nevertheless mangrove seedlings are still liberated when low oxygen concentrations can have severe effects. The developing Avicennia seedling, while on the parent tree, is surrounded by a tough pericarp which restricts gaseous diffusion and induces a partially anaerobic environment around the cotyledon tissues. The detection of high lactic acid levels in Avicennia seedlings may be linked with the carbon dioxide-rich atmospheres which build up around the tissues. It is possible that high levels of carbon dioxide induce the production of lactic acid, a non-toxic product of fermentation, rather than of the more toxic ethanol. Lactic acid is also formed during the initial stages of anaerobiosis in Bruguiera seedlings.</field><field name="date">1973</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany::270402 Plant physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2124</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of the biology and utilisation of Pterocladia and Gracilaria</field><field name="creator">Luxton, David Morley</field><field name="description">Pterocladia lucida (R. Br.) J. Ag. is the prinipal raw material for agar production in New Zealand. Since collection commenced in 1943 the annual harvest has never stabilised and over recent years there has been a general decline, which has inhibited expansion of the indigenous industry. Field and laboratory studies have been made in order to obtain information on the biology of P. lucida. Form variability is considered in detail and a relationship between external morphology and wave exposure of the habitat is proposed. The culture of P. lucida from spores in a running seawater system is described in detail. Results on carpospore and tetraspore germination, and sporeling growth under light and temperature regimes are presented. Germination of both spore types was inhibited at 10&#176;C while at higher temperatures germination was greatest under 4 klux. Spore germination and sporeling development in culture is described. Only sterile prostrate thalli possessing rhizoidal haptera were obtained and a hypothesis relating the appearance of surface haptera to the direction of irradiation is proposed. The development of an outdoor wave tank for culturing is described and the growth rate and development of sporelings is discussed with reference to water movement. Sporelings were maintained in culture for up to 22 months. Cultured sporelings have also been transplanted into different habitats. Creeping axes established from carpospores produced erect fronds, which produced tetraspores after seven to ten months in situ. This confirmed part of a Polysiphonia-type life history for the first time in a Gelidioid species. Axis elongation rate in situ was estimated to be less than 10cm year-1 at Leigh. It was concluded that the collection of attached weed could not be sustained annually, but controlled harvesting in specific areas every two years is advocated. Seasonal variation in agar yield and gel strength from wave exposed and sheltered populations of P. lucida was studied. Agar levels varied throughout the year, being greatest in spring and summer, while gel strengths showed a similar trend. The feasibility of utilising indigenous Gracilaria secundata Harvey forma pseudoflagellifera May has been studied. The yield and gel properties of agar were determined from different alkali pretreatments. There was a marked increase in gel strength when weed was pretreated in alkali, the maximum gel strength being obtained from a weed treatment of 3 percent NaOH for three hours at 80&#176;C. The gel properties of agar from G. secundata f. pseudoflagellifera are compared with agar from other sources. The agar was suitable for commercial use, but exhibited a greater resilience than that from Pterocladia lucida. The vegetative regeneration of G. secundata f. pseudoflagellifera in the Manukau Harbour has been studied and an experimental harvest of 0.68t is described. During spring 100 percent regeneration from hand cleared and raked areas occurred after eight to thirteen weeks. Based on regeneration results, mechanical harvesting four times a year of Gracilaria mats in the Manukau Harbour is advocated. The predicted sustainable yield is 1084-1304t year-1. The extraction and gel properties of agar from Melanthalia abscissa (Turn.) Hook. et Harv. are reported for the-first time, but the commercial collection of this species is not advocated.</field><field name="date">1977</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany::270499 Botany not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2128</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Temporal mach bands: a psychophysical study</field><field name="creator">Kirkwood, B. J.</field><field name="description">Five experiments were carried out to discover whether there is a subjective enhancement of temporal contours analogous to the Mach band effects in spatial vision. A transient overshoot in the incremental threshold occurred immediately after the crest of rising linear ramps at photopic levels. A psychophysical matching experiment verified that this peaking effect is perceived as a bright pulse and can be considered the temporal equivalent of the bright Mach band. No equivalent of the dark Mach band at the foot of rising linear ramps was found. Rather there was an anticipatory decrease of sensitivity (Crawford effect) at the base of ascending gradients. The magnitude of this effect was directly proportional to the rate of change of the stimulus at photopic levels. Data from descending ramps was less simple to interpret. A small rise in incremental threshold was sometimes observed at the crest of ramps, but this effect was much less pronounced than the peak at the crest of equivalent ascending ramps. Matching procedures located troughs at the foot of descending ramps which correspond to the dark spatial Mach band. This effect was less apparent when incremental threshold techniques were employed. An experiment using exponential rather than linear change in luminance over time gave results in general accord with the above. The Crawford effect was found to follow the Bunsen-Roscoe Law. It was found that the transient undershoot and overshoot effects were related to the rate of change rather than the actual form of the ramp when the rate of change was greater than about 300mL per second. Impulse responses were derived by differentiating step responses. Ascending steps generated a biphasic impulse response and descending steps give a triphasic unit impulse response. This lack of equivalence over conditions is diagnostic of system nonlinearity. Fourier analysis of the impulse responses showed equivalent spectral components and lowpass filter action in each case, indicating change in gain and phasing rather than time constants occur between 'on' and 'off' conditions. The system was shown to be quasilinear within conditions since linear convolution of the impulse responses with appropriate ramps generated functions that were a fair approximation to the psychophysical response to such ramps. The relationship between the impulse response and the spatial equivalent line spread function was discussed and the similarity of the impulse responses to dynamic changes in sensitivity inferred from results of masking experiments pointed out. The results were then considered in relation to a multichannel model for processing spatiotemporal information.</field><field name="date">1979</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380103 Biological psychology (neuropsychology, psychopharmacology, physiological psychology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2129</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intelligent motion control with an artificial cerebellum</field><field name="creator">Smith, Russell L.</field><field name="description">This thesis describes a novel approach for adaptive optimal control and demonstrates its application to a variety of systems, including motion control learning for legged robots. The new controller, called &#8220;FOX&#8221;, uses a modified form of Albus&#8217;s CMAC neural network. It is trained to generate control signals that minimize a system&#8217;s performance error. A theoretical consideration of the adaptive control problem is used to show that FOX must assign each CMAC weight an &#8220;eligibility&#8221; value which controls how that weight is updated. FOX thus implements a kind of reinforcement learning which makes it functionally similar to the cerebellum (a part of the brain that modulates movement). A highly efficient implementation is described which makes FOX suitable for on-line control. FOX requires a small amount of dynamical information about the system being controlled: the system&#8217;s impulse response is used to choose the rules that update the eligibility values. A FOX-based controller design methodology is developed, and FOX is tested on four control problems: controlling a simulated linear system, controlling a model gantry crane, balancing an inverted pendulum on a cart, and making a wheeled robot follow a path. In each case FOX is effective: it associates sensor values with (and anticipates) the correct control actions, it compensates for system nonlinearities, and it provides robust control as long as the training is comprehensive enough. FOX is also applied to the control of a simulated hopping monoped, and a walking biped. FOX learns parameters that fine tune the movements of pre-programmed controllers, in a manner analogous to the cerebellar modulation of spinal cord reflexes in human movement. The robots are successfully taught how to move with a steady gait along flat ground, in any direction, and how to climb and descend slopes.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290900 Electrical and Electronic Engineering::290901 Electrical engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2130</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Economic Governance for a Globalising Auckland? Political Projects, Institutions and Policy</field><field name="creator">Wetzstein, Steffen</field><field name="description">In the context of a peripheral, small and largely resource-based economy, New Zealand&#8217;s economic policy makers have for long faced the key challenge of influencing global connections of local actors in value-adding activities. This dissertation seeks to interpret the nature and trajectories of governance activities relating to economic processes in Auckland, New Zealand&#8217;s largest city-region, in the 1990&#8217;s and 2000&#8217;s. This period, a time of neoliberalising political-economic conditions following intensive economic restructuring in the 1980s, saw a re-entry of central government to the governing landscape of Auckland. The research focuses on how regional actors such as the Auckland Regional Growth Forum, the Auckland Regional Economic Development Strategy and the business-driven initiatives of &#8216;Competitive Auckland&#8217;, &#8216;Committee for Auckland&#8217; and the &#8216;Knowledge Wave&#8217; conferences, gradually became aligned with an emerging governmental project from central government that re-defined perceptions of and expectations about Auckland&#8217;s economic role. The research approach is informed by several literatures, especially those of the regulation, actor-network and governmentality schools. The different questions that spring from these literatures enable scrutiny of Auckland&#8217;s institutional developments in terms of the identification of interdependencies amongst governing interests, the nature and degree of mediation of investment processes from institutional experimentation and the possible emergence of effects from new governance arrangements. The thesis situates and uses the policy and academic positioning of the researcher to develop methodologies to interrogate the emergence of the material and discursive dimensions of the regional economic governance framework of Auckland. This thesis argues that ongoing institutional experimentation has been both a pre-cursor to and an active ingredient in the re-appearance of the New Zealand central state in Auckland&#8217;s economic governance. Importantly, governing is increasingly complex; and about mobilising a range of actors by influencing their perceptions about governing and investment goals through discursive governance practices. In this context, current socio-economic interventions can be best understood as contingent assemblages of governing resources, producing discursive alignments of interests that lead to a re-working of processes and practices of the state-regulatory apparatus. The effects of the institutional developments on private investment decisions are largely unknown however. While the emerging institutional framework for economic governance involving Auckland is increasingly embracing Auckland&#8217;s globalising character, influencing the city-region&#8217;s economic participation in the globalising world economy may be harder to achieve as a political project than current policy rhetoric implies. Theoretically, this research challenges territorial conceptualisations of political economic management and contributes to the wider development of a relational-institutional framework for understanding sub-national economic governance.

One is Portuguese, Violante del Cielo, and four are Spaniards: Luisa de Carvajal y Mendoza, Leonor de la Cueva y Silva, Marcia Belisarda and Catalina Clara Ram&#237;rez de Guzm&#225;n. All are from the educated upper or noble classes and their lives span some one hundred and forty years, from 1566 to 1693. The thesis focuses particularly on their sonnets of love and friendship, both secular and religious. The sonnet was specifically chosen as the vehicle to study the ideas and concerns of literate, seventeenth-century women. As a difficult form of poetry requiring wit, artistry and education, sonnets enable a display of intellectual capabilities and offer opportunities for veiled criticism of contemporary systems of control. These women do not overtly rail against a system that offers them much in terms of social advancement and privilege. However, they do re-write our understanding of the Baroque by presenting their interests, pleasures and discontents from a feminine viewpoint. This detailed, contextual study of women's works, set against the philosophical, religious and moral treatises that governed their age, enables a wider interpretation of women's thought and intentions in the Iberian peninsula than may hitherto have been acknowledged, particularly in terms of relationships of affection within the family. Collectively, their individual works display a determination to demonstrate women's intelligence and moral strength. Furthermore, it becomes clear that women living within a system that utilised biological determinism as proof that they were incapable of reason, strive in their works to show that they are both capable of reason and determined to demonstrate it as undeniable fact.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420399 Cultural studies not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2132</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling cardiac activation from cell to body surface</field><field name="creator">Buist, Martin L.</field><field name="description">In this thesis, the forward problem of electrocardiography is investigated from a cellular level through to potentials on the surface of the torso. This integrated modelling framework is based on three spatial scales. At the smallest spatial resolution, several cardiac cellular models are implemented that are used to represent the underlying cellular electrophysiology. A bidomain framework is used to couple multiple individual cells together and this provides a mathematical model of the myocardial tissue. The cardiac geometry is described using finite elements with high order cubic Hermite basis function interpolation. An anatomically based description of the fibrous laminar cardiac microstructure is then defined relative to the geometric mesh. Within the local element space of the cardiac finite elements, a fine collocation mesh is created on which the bidomain equations are solved. Each collocation point represents a continuum cell and contains a cellular model to describe the local active processes. This bidomain implementation works in multiple coordinate systems and over deforming domains, in addition to having the ability to spatially vary any parameter throughout the myocardium. On the largest spatial scale the passive torso regions surrounding the myocardium are modelled using a generalised Laplace equation to describe the potential field and current flows. The torso regions are discretised using either finite elements or boundary elements depending on the electrical properties of each region. The cardiac region is coupled to the surrounding torso through several methods. A traditional dipole source approach is implemented that creates equivalent cardiac sources through the summation of cellular dipoles. These dipoles are then placed within a homogeneous cardiac region and the resulting potential field is calculated throughout the torso. Two new coupling techniques are developed that provide a more direct path from cellular activation to body surface potentials. One approach assembles all of the equations from the passive torso regions and the equations from the extracellular bidomain region into a single matrix system. Coupling conditions based on the continuity of potential and current flow across the myocardial surfaces are used to couple the regions and therefore solving the matrix system yields a solution that is continuous across all of the solution points within the torso. The second approach breaks the large system into smaller subproblems and the continuity conditions are iii iv imposed through an iterative approach. Across each of the myocardial surfaces, a fixed point iteration is set up with the goal of converging towards zero potential and current flow differences between adjacent regions. All of the numerical methods used within the integrated modelling framework are rigorously tested individually before extensive tests are performed on the coupling techniques. Large scale simulations are run to test the dipole source approach against the new coupling techniques. Several sets of simulations are run to investigate the effects of using different ionic current models, using different bidomain model simplifications, and the role that the torso inhomogeneities play in generating body surface potentials. The main question to be answered by this study is whether or not the traditional approach of combining a monodomain heart with an equivalent cardiac source in a two step approach is adequate when generating body surface potentials. Comparisons between the fully coupled framework developed here and several dipole based approaches demonstrate that the resulting sets of signals have different magnitudes and different waveform shapes on both the torso and epicardial surface, clearly illustrating the inadequacy of the equivalent cardiac source models. It has been found that altering the modelling assumptions on each spatial scale produces noticeable effects. At the smallest scale, the use of different cell models leads to significantly different body surface potential traces. At the next scale the monodomain approach is unable to accurately reproduce the results from a full bidomain framework, and at the largest level the inclusion of different torso inhomogeneities has a large effect on the magnitude of the torso and epicardial potentials. Adding a pair of lungs to the torso model changes the epicardial potentials by an average of 16% which is consistent with the experimental range of between 8 and 20%. This provides evidence that only a complex, coupled, biophysically based model will be able to properly reproduce clinical ECGs.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291500 Biomedical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2133</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Some aspects of the microbiological activity of the Mangere oxidation ponds</field><field name="creator">Brockett, Olive Dinah.</field><field name="description">1.	A general introduction to the theory, operation and biological activity of oxidation ponds has been given as well as specific introductions to the two areas of research studied, namely the role of fungi and some aspects of the nitrogen cycle in the Mangere oxidation ponds. 2.	The enumeration and identification of fungi present in the bottom layers of the pond showed that the numbers were not sufficiently large to make a valuable contribution to the degradation of organic material in that particular environment. The dominant fungi present were species of the genera Penicillium, Mucor, Trichoderma and Geotrichum. 3.	Isolates of some of the fungi most frequently isolated from these lower regions were grown under conditions of low redox potential. It was found that although the fungi did grow over the one month test period, they did not show great metabolic activity. 4.	Direct examination of pond water containing a whitish glassy scum showed only the presence of clumps of heterogenous biomass but no dominant microorganism. Filamentous yeasts isolated from these scum samples formed a surface layer when grown in liquid medium. When inoculated into pond water it appeared that these filamentous yeasts formed a matrix to which the biomass adhered producing a condition similar to that seen in the original samples. 5.	Use of ultra think layers of cetyl alcohol prevented scum formation by these filamentous yeasts but not growth in the medium underneath. Larger scale trials would be required to determine if this method is feasible for reducing scum formation in oxidation ponds. 6.	Investigation of the proteolytic activity of pond sludge showed that the part of the nitrogen cycle which concerns the degradation of protein was present and active in the oxidation ponds. Proteolytic activity was found to increase with increasing depth of pond water up to the maximum (220 cm) tested. This suggests that increasing the depth of the ponds to approximately 185 cm (6 ft.) would improve pond efficiency in relation to degradation of protein. 7.	The bacteria responsible for nitrification in the oxidation pond surface water were isolated and identified. Nitrosomonas was responsible for the oxidation of ammonia to nitrite and Nitrobacter for the oxidation of nitrite to nitrate. A twelve month survey of these bacteria showed Nitrite accumulated only when large numbers of Nitrosomonas were present. Statistical analysis of the data obtained indicated that populations of these bacteria were influenced by pH, alkalinity and ammonia. 8.	Enumeration of denitrifying bacteria at different pond depths showed that greatest numbers were present in the sludge and interface although they were well distributed through the aqueous phase. 9.	Identification of the isolated denitrifying bacteria showed that they were strains of Pseudomonas denitrificans, Micrococcus denitrificans and Bacillus lichenformis. Their identity was confirmed by comparison with standard cultures. 10.	The denitrifying properties of these bacteria were studied to compare their ability to remove nitrate, as well as their reaction to additives. All three bacteria were able to remove low levels of nitrate but high nitrate concentrations were shown to be inhibitory. The use of additives to promote denitrification appeared to depend on the additive and the bacterium and not on the carbon nitrogen ration. Of the materials tested glucose was the most satisfactory and methanol the most inhibitory. Further work is necessary to clarify the role of methanol because in small scale studies with sewage effluents in other laboratories it has been found to be most efficient in promoting denitrification. 11.	Continous measurements of the redox potential interface of a sludge, and pond top liquid (10-15cm. from the surface) revealed that the electronegative potential of the sludge remained remarkably steady. When the electrode was at either the interface or near the surface it recorded a distinct diurnal pattern. In pond top liquid the length of the positive potential period was dependent on day length. A change from the normal redox potential pattern of pond top liquid preceded deterioration of pond stability. The pattern returned to normal after a change in environmental conditions. It appears that continuous redox potential measurements could be valuable in showing changes in pond performance before they can be detected by other methods.</field><field name="date">1971</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2134</field></doc><doc><field name="title">&#8221;My Two Countries Firmly Under My Feet&#8221;: Explorations of Multicultural Identity in the Fiction of Amelia Batistich and Yvonne du Fresne</field><field name="creator">Nola, Nina</field><field name="description">This thesis offers a detailed reading of the fiction of the Dalmatian New Zealand author Amelia Batistich and the Danish New Zealand author Yvonne du Fresne from the perspective of multicultural literary criticism. It draws strongly throughout on interviews and discussions with the authors themselves, and on their personal papers. The Introduction explores the term "multicultural literary criticism", examines its significant development in theory and practice in Australia (especially in the writings of Sneja Gunew), and discusses the challenging issues raised by its use in a bicultural context, in New Zealand. The body of the thesis is organised into two parallel sections, the first (of five chapters) on Batistich and the second (of four chapters) on du Fresne. Each section begins with an introduction to the writing life of the author concerned, with particular reference to the forces. Shaping her sense of identity as a New Zealander from an ethnic minority community. Subsequent chapters then discuss chronologically the development of the author&#8217;s work from short fiction and articles through to the later novels. Each author's struggle to find a fictional voice which expressed her identity as a hybrid New Zealander is highlighted. The role of editors and publishers in shaping the migrant voice of both authors is also explored, and the reception of both authors' works by critics often unwilling or unable to read for difference in a literary landscape dominated by the perception of New Zealand as socially homogeneous. The thesis argues - in an extended enquiry into the constructedness of identity - that both authors have struggled throughout their careers to find a place for both themselves and their characters in New Zealand literature. The bibliography contains a checklist of the published writings of both authors, primary and secondary material related to the field of ethnic minority writing, and a checklist of other migrant writings and creative multicultural works in New Zealand. &#8220;No matter how far fate has blown the frail tree of my life across foreign lands, its roots have always sucked nourishment from that little barren clod of soil from which it sprung."

Either we produce methods by which the network may be decomposed into small manageable parts, or we must attempt to solve simultaneously for all the properties of the network, at a particular time. At present, the class of networks for which comprehensive solutions are known is so restricted that it is usually essential to consider the first approach, at least in the first instance. First we consider the problem of decomposition points, the points at which a stream of customers is broken up into several substreams, heading for different destinations. Conditions are established for a class of decomposition switches, which ensure that if the input stream to the switch is a Markov renewal process, then so are each of the substreams. We then investigate the behaviour of one of these substreams at a subsequent service facility. When the service times are exponentially distributed, an analysis of this, the SM/M/1 queue, based on the properties of the busy cycle, considerably simplifies and extends the results known for it. Some attempt is made to relax the condition on the service time distribution. Since there is always the possibility that a Poisson process approximation to the arrival stream may be acceptable, the dual of this queue, where the sequence of service times forms a Markov renewal process, is considered. This seems a particularly appropriate generalisation, since it allows for different classes of service requirements, perhaps reflecting the origin of customers from various parts of the network. In addition, some results are presented for a queue in which both the arrival times and service requirements depend on the sequence of customer types. Since the output from a queue in a network will form part or all of the input to a subsequent queue, we consider, finally, the departure processes from queues of the types that have been mentioned. Although, in general, it is not possible to describe the departure stream from queues of these types in terms of a particular stochastic process, we can find the distributions of some of the parameters of a very general departure process, in particular, the number of departures from the last queue mentioned above.</field><field name="date">1974</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2139</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Numerical modelling of fibre-reinforced thermoplastic sheet forming</field><field name="creator">Christie, G. Richard</field><field name="description">Continuous Fibre Reinforced Thermoplastics (CFRTPs) combine high strength, stiffness, impact and chemical resistance with possibilities for efficient part production by various thermoforming processes. Sheet forming of molten CFRTP laminates has generated much interest, but problems of buckling, wrinkling and predicting fibre distribution have meant a deeper understanding of these processes is needed. The first part of this study looks at the problem of gross buckling in homogeneous &#8220;trellis&#8221; flows of bidirectional laminates. Modelling the molten composite as a Newtonian fluid reinforced by inextensible fibres, linear stability analysis is used to determine the growth rate of small out-of-plane imperfections. Buckling is predicted when fibre tensions are negative, indicating that laminates must be kept in tension during forming to reduce such defects. A new approach to Grid Strain Analysis is presented, which uses surface fitting to determine the deformations occurring in sheet forming. The new method improves analysis of smooth, inhomogeneous deformations, and allows greater flexibility in viewing the results. The technique has been used to visualise deformations in a blister fairing made from cross-ply PLYTRON laminates. Arrow diagrams produced from the part demonstrate the tendency of bidirectional composites to deform by trellis flow, while transverse flow results from the action of the diaphragms used to form the part. The significance of inter-ply slip in CFRTP sheet forming provided the impetus to develop a finite element model for molten laminates, which treats each ply as a separate continuum. Contact between plies is modelled, with slip given a viscous response. Ply deformations are governed by a highly anisotropic elastic law, to handle the stiff fibres and as a first step towards a viscoelastic model of major intra-ply deformation modes. The finite element model parameters were adjusted to fit the part shape and load response of unidirectional PLYTRON laminates in bending. However, a perfect fit is unobtainable due to local transverse flow occurring at the bend in the real laminate. Nevertheless, the bending of the remainder of the ply is well described by the elastic model, using a fibre direction stiffness 25000 times that in the transverse direction. With the present model, a somewhat less anisotropic set of parameters gives the best overall fit and has been applied in several thermoforming simulations. As observed in experiments, matched-die bending simulations display ply buckling at high forming speeds. Hemispherical dome forming simulations exhibit out-of-plane buckling and near-inextensible fibre behaviour, with trellis-like deformation predominant in cross-ply laminates. In simulated double-diaphragm forming of bends and hemispherical domes, tension superimposed on the laminate from the stretching diaphragms is shown to eliminate buckling. However, high forming pressures and excessive transverse flow are a problem with current, stiff diaphragms. Final discussions look at improving contact modelling, reducing model sizes by adopting thin shell assumptions, and improving the ply model.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290500 Mechanical and Industrial Engineering::290501 Mechanical engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2143</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Balanced brains: an investigation of visuospatial ability and lateralization in musicians</field><field name="creator">Patston, Lucy</field><field name="description">Musicians comprise a unique population whereby persistent musical practice involving complex cognitive and motor tasks dates back to childhood when the potential for neural plasticity is at its highest. Accordingly, it has been speculated that musical training results in neural structural and functional differences between musicians and non-musicians. In particular, there is evidence to indicate parietal regions are more equally lateralized in musicians, but research investigating visuospatial abilities and lateralization in musicians is scarce. Studies 1 and 2 aimed to assess the visuospatial ability and cognitive processing speed of adult musicians versus &#8234;demographically and educationally matched non-musicians. &#8234;Musicians performed more quickly and more accurately than non-musicians in two tasks of visuospatial ability, and completed more items than non-musicians in three tasks of processing speed, suggesting &#8234;musicians had better &#8234;visuospatial ability and a faster speed of processing. Studies 3 and 4 aimed to investigate &#8234;visuospatial attention in &#8234;these groups using a line-bisection task and a visual discrimination task. On both tasks musicians demonstrated more balanced visuospatial attention with a slight bias to the right hemispace, which was in contrast to the non-musicians&#8217; bias to the left hemispace, a natural phenomenon known as &#8216;right pseudoneglect&#8217;. In Study 5, the laterality of visual processing in musicians and non-musicians was further investigated by comparing electrophysiological interhemispheric transfer time (IHTT) of lateralized visual stimuli across the corpus callosum. Non-musicians had faster right-to-left than left-to-right IHTT consistent with previous research, whilst musicians had more balanced IHTT in both directions and faster left-to-right transfer than non-musicians. Absolute latency patterns revealed similar results and consistently demonstrated more balanced visual processing in musicians. The behavioural data, analysed in Study 6, revealed a tendency (n.s.) for the &#8234;musician group to respond more quickly to stimuli presented in the right visual field than to stimuli presented in the left visual field, whilst &#8234;non-musicians did not show this pattern. Overall, the results indicate that musicians have enhanced visuospatial ability and are less lateralized for visuospatial attention and perception than non-musicians. The results are discussed in relation to plastic developmental changes that may be caused by extended musical training from childhood. Specifically, it is proposed that musical training in early life may elicit a process of myelination that is more bilaterally distributed than myelination in non-musicians.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">musician</field><field name="subject">visuospatial</field><field name="subject">laterality</field><field name="subject">N1</field><field name="subject">music</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2367</field></doc><doc><field name="title">To rent or to buy? housing tenure choice in New Zealand, 1960-80</field><field name="creator">Chapman, R. B.</field><field name="description">This study analyses the economic aspects of housing tenure choice in New Zealand, 1960-80. The analysis proceeds by way of the building, refining and estimation of a model of household tenure choice, using a considerable body of micro-level data and aggregate time series. It is argued that the household faces a wealth constraint, a dual budget constraint, and minimum dwelling standard constraints, and that the household's tenure choice depends on the interaction of these constraints and its preference set. The budget constraint is a dual constraint because the true economic price of buying relative to that of renting generally differs from the 'outlay' price of buying relative to that of renting. The outlay prices of housing services are important for households with limited current income available for housing unless the household's wealth constraint is unusually loose. Considerable emphasis is placed on the modelling of the prices of housing services. A sub-model of landlord behaviour and the examination of the operation of the private rental housing market are directed at explaining the path over time of urban New Zealand rents. Sources of data are as follows. In considering prices and the various constraints on tenure choice I employ my own survey data, collected in Auckland, and time-series data from the New Zealand Department of Statistics (NZDS) and the New Zealand Valuation Department, together with crosstabulation data from various sources. I make use for the first time (for these purposes) of a body of data collected by the NZDS - their Household Sample Survey data - to estimate a cross-sectional tenure choice function. For the examination of national tenure choice trends I had to construct my own estimates of the private sector home-ownership rate. The chief conclusion of this study is that lack of wealth constrains the large majority of 'unwilling' private tenants (who are about three-quarters of all private tenants) to rent. Both interview evidence and cross-sectional econometric work support this conclusion. A second major finding is that the impact of the budget constraint on household tenure choice has varied considerably over time but in terms of economic prices, buying has been consistently (over the last two decades) cheaper than renting for the typical tenure-choosing household with a moderate marginal rate of time preference and a moderate planning period. In times of rapid dwelling appreciation the economic price of buying relative to that of renting is particularly low. In contrast, the outlay price of buying (comprising costs in the current period) has been considerably greater than the outlay price of renting, especially when nominal interest rates have been high, and this fact has undoubtedly deterred a significant a significant proportion of households from buying. Finally, the decline in the private sector home-ownership rate between 1961 and 1976 was found to be largely due to changes in the 'age:marital status:household size' structure of the population of households. These changes outweighed the net effect of economic factors which worked to raise the home-ownership rate until 1976.</field><field name="date">1981</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2176</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An integrated process for the recovery of clinically significant trace proteins from human plasma</field><field name="creator">Benny, Athol Graeme</field><field name="description">Methods for the preparation of concentrates of factor VIII, factor IX, high purity factor IX, Cl esterase inhibitor, specific immunoglobulin and platelet factor XIII are described.

Alumina is also expected to have good flow and handling properties, and dissolve well in the bath. Unfortunately, it does not always dissolve rapidly and this leads to the formation of "sludge", which creates operating disturbances in the cell; it is difficult to remedy this problem without a basic understanding of the process of alumina dissolution. Consequently, the objective of the work presented in this thesis was to develop an apparatus and technique that would allow the dissolution behaviour of powder alumina to be measured as realistically and objectively as possible, and then determine the important factors affecting dissolution. The method developed involved the merging of three different techniques: &#9679; electroanalytical measurement of dissolved oxide concentrations &#9679; recording of the associated thermal phenomena &#9679; visual observation of the interaction of alumina with the bath which were then used to investigate the effect of a range of alumina properties and smelter operating conditions on dissolution behaviour. A series of dissolution parameters was selected to evaluate the relative dissolution behaviour of the different variables. It was found that slow dissolution behaviour resulted primarily from poor feeding and/or dispersion, coupled with poor heat transfer in the first few seconds of the dissolution process. If the flow properties of the alumina were good, alumina flowed easily out of the dropper on to the surface of the bath forming relatively thin but well-distributed rafts. If not, alumina could flow out into a localized area producing very dense rafts which clumped together and eventually sank to the bottom forming sludge. properties such as loss on ignition enhanced the dispersion of the alumina through the release of volatiles, which caused the alumina to "effervesce" on the surface. Conversely, bulk density aggravated the clumping problem as the density of the formed rafts increased with increasing bulk density. Good feeder design can help to counteract deficiencies in the flow properties of an alumina, if the importance of wide coverage and the imparting of a horizontal velocity component to the alumina are kept in mind. It was also found that if the bath agitation was increased, either by increasing the amount of existing stirring or by reducing the bath volume in the feeding area for a given bath velocity, the initial heat transfer to the alumina could be dramatically improved. The presence of bath superheat was important for maintaining optimum heat transfer conditions for fast dissolutions, as alumina was found to dissolve better when a higher proportion of the heat required was supplied from the bulk of the liquid bath as opposed to localized freezing. Increasing the initial alumina concentration in the electrolyte retarded the dissolution process, with the retardation becoming increasingly more significant at higher concentration values. Similarly, reducing the cryolite ratio, which also decreased the alumina solubility, resulted in the dissolution being inhibited in the later stages, as more alumina dissolved. In situations where the mass transfer in the bath was improved, the impact of these concentration effects was minimized. The video recordings were useful for indicating potential operating difficulties with the samples, such as excessive emissions and flow problems. Six different raft formations, characterizing the degree of bath surface coverage and the raft density or cohesion, were identified from the videos and the aluminas were classified accordingly. Preliminary heat balance calculations were performed using the data obtained in this study and were used to estimate the heat of dissolution for &#945;-Al2O3, for a variety of alumina concentrations in cryolite-based electrolytes. The results indicated heat values of 112&#177;15 and 55&#177;5 kJ mol-1 for alumina concentrations in the bath of 0.43 and 2.83 wt% respectively. Further work is necessary to refine these calculations, however. Reacted ore was found to dissolve more slowly than parent virgin alumina but it was difficult to ascertain which property caused the difference - whether bulk density, flowability, influence of HF, or presence of other impurities. As a result, it is recommended that a series of dissolution runs be performed on reacted samples of different compositions to establish which property associated with reacted ore causes the problem.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2159</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cyclic deformation of a clay</field><field name="creator">Bacchus, David Robin</field><field name="description">Dynamic loading tests consisting of one hundred sinusoidal strain-controlled cycles at 0.2 cps. followed by a compression test to failure were conducted on remoulded, fully saturated clay triaxial specimens. Electrical transducers coupled with automatic recording equipment were used to measure pore-pressure, axial load and deformation. The effects of strain amplitude and stress history on the peak shear stresses, the mean effective stress and the specific damping energy were investigated. Mean effective stress, which showed negligible cyclic variation, decreased progressively during dynamic loading except that for over-consolidated soils it increased during the first cycle only. Progressive reduction of peak shear stress and specific damping energy was closely related to the reduction of mean effective stress. After 100 cycles the strength and structure of the clay was dependent on the void ratio and the dynamic strain amplitude. All effects were more marked with increasing strain amplitude. A descriptive model was proposed to account for the development of unusual &#8216;S&#8217;-shaped loops.</field><field name="date">1969</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2165</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fast 2D shape approximation algorithms and their errors</field><field name="creator">Friedrich, W. E.</field><field name="description">In this thesis, efficient algorithms for fast shape approximation in the area of machine and robot vision are analysed. The core of the thesis consits of two main parts, an error analysis of chain coded silhouettes and a simplified, hence fast shape approximation scheme for practical applications. The area of shape description and approximation is introduced. General techniques for processing of boundary data are outlined followed by a brief description of the image processing system which was developed during the study. Processing procedures developed and their options are presented. Two applications realized by the author have emerged from the algorithm development, firstly a semi-automatic shape registration and measurement procedure and secondly, a low-cost robot vision system. The advantage of the experimental robot vision system is an effective communication between the robot and the object recognition system. The shortcomings of these applications, mainly inaccuracy of the shape description lead to the introduction of an error analysis for boundary descriptors. In contrast to existing methods, the error analysis can be applied to straight lines, circular arcs, and arbitrary shapes consisting of these two shape primitives. The analysis is comprehensive and covers all kinds of chain code sets representing various pixel shapes as well as different pixel configurations. The results of the analysis lead to the development of simple ways of overcoming the accuracy limitations of conventional methods. Two algorithms for improving the length estimation of object outlines are introduced. A comparison with existing methods showing the effectiveness of these algorithms is made. For practical applications of object recognition, a new, simple and hence fast and effective algorithm for polygon approximation, called the "arc operator" is developed. The combination of the arc operator and the length correcting algorithm directly improves the ability to identify partially visible shapes. The performance of the arc operator is compared to six other well known algorithms. Slight disadvantages in accuracy are outweighed by the enormous advantage in processing time, particularly with an integer implementation. An example of overlapping parts demonstrates the potential of the arc operator to extract characteristic shape descriptions.</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290500 Mechanical and Industrial Engineering::290501 Mechanical engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2156</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Extended theory of the Be&#769;nard convection problem</field><field name="creator">Nield, Donald A.</field><field name="description">The onset of convection in a horizontal fluid layer, heated from below, is, examined by means of perturbation analysis. The resulting eigenvalue system of equations is solved by means of a new extension of a Fourier series technique. Two sets of coupled effects are investigated: (i) thermal buoyancy and surface-tension effects, and (ii) thermal buoyancy and solute buoyancy effects. For the first set of effects the magnetohydrodynamic problem is also studied. For the surface-tension problem, attention is focussed on the case where the lower boundary is a rigid conductor and the upper free surface is subject to a general thermal condition. It is found that for this care the surface-tension and buoyancy forces reinforce each other and are tightly coupled. Cells formed by surface tension are approximately the same size as those formed by buoyancy. The stream line patterns produced by the two agencies acting separately are again similar. When the fluid is electrically conducting and is in the presence of a vertical magnetic field, it is found that the field always has a stabilizing effect. When convection cells are formed in the presence of such a field, their horizontal dimensions are less than for cells formed in the absence of the field. The magnetic field accentuates the difference between the cells induced by surface tension and those by buoyancy, and thus reduces the coupling between the destabilizing forces. Increase of magnetic field causes the buoyancy cell pattern to become more symmetrical, but causes the streamlines in surface-tension cells to become bunched near the surface. When the magnetic field is large, the transition from one type of cell to the other type is extremely sudden, at least when the upper surface is a good thermal conductor. It has been found that, on the model considered, there can be no oscillatory for this problem. However, dimensional analysis reveals that, for a sufficiently flexible upper surface, oscillatory Instability might in fact occur. Finally the thermohaline problem, where the density varies with both temperature and the concentration of some solute, is studied. The eigenvalue equation is now found for general boundary conditions. The degree of coupling between the thermal and the solute effects again depends on the similarity between convection cells caused by the two agencies acting separately. (For one extreme case studied the coupling is zero for a certain range of parameters.) In this problem both monotonic and oscillatory instability can now occur.</field><field name="date">1966</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2162</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Peak shift following simultaneous discrimination training</field><field name="creator">Winton, Alan Stuart William</field><field name="description">Organisms trained to respond at a high rate to one stimulus, S1, and at a low rate to another stimulus, S2, lying in the same physical dimension as S1, may, when presented successively with a number of stimuli lying in the dimension, respond at the highest rate to a stimulus away from S1 in a direction opposite S2. This "peak shift" effect has been found following training in which S1 and S2 were presented successively, but not when they were presented simultaneously. In the present study peak shift was obtained when S1 and S2 were presented simultaneously during training. In order to isolate the conditions necessary to produce peak shift after simultaneous training, different groups of pigeons were given variations in procedure, but peak shift was obtained with all groups. The variations included using stimuli from various physical dimensions, using different training procedures, and using various methods of presenting stimuli during the tests for peak shift. The results were generally more consistent with discrimination theories that postulate the interaction of generalisation gradients around S1 and S2, rather than with theories that postulate control by some relationship between S1 and S2, and in particular, they were most consistent with explanations of peak shift that propose that the responding occurring in the presence of S1 is inhibited in the presence of S2.</field><field name="date">1973</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2166</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Management of Senior Managers: How Firms in New Zealand Acquire, Defend and Extract Value from their Senior Managerial Resources</field><field name="creator">Gilbert, John</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2168</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Demospongiae of New Zealand-Systematics, distribution and relationships</field><field name="creator">Bergquist, Patricia R.</field><field name="description">The scope of the present work is the systematic revision of the Demospongiae of the N.Z. region, here defined as including North and South Is. and all outlying islands as far north as Three Kings and South to Auckland and Cambell Is.

One of the main purposes of the programme was to provide a unified theme for post-graduate research in the department. The initial aim of the programme was to develop through graduate research, sufficient facilities for radio astronomy observations at frequencies below 100Mhz.  Being among the first group of graduate students in the programme, the author was given the problem of studying the antenna requirements for the programme. At the frequencies concerned, the antenna systems are often large and expensive. As the programme is supported at present, only by funds for ordinary graduate research, there is a great need for an antenna array with good performance at minimal cost. This has led the author into his main field of study, viz. the synthesis of arrays with non-uniformly spaced directional elements. The use of directional elements together with non-uniform spacing technique permits larger inter-element spacings in the array without resulting in large sidelobes in the response pattern.  Available synthesis methods are inadequate despite the large number of papers published on the subject since its introduction 7 years ago. The synthesis problem involves the determination of a set of element positions to give a desirable response pattern. Because the element position variables lie in the arguments of the cosine terms in the pattern function, the problem becomes highly non-linear. For simplicity, most of the published works have assumed isotropic elements. The methods proposed have been mainly centred on some form of linear approximations to the problem. Consequently, these methods are only effective over a limited region of space*. As a result of this limitation, good pattern characteristics can only be achieved with impractically small spacings. For arrays with less than about 50 elements, the element spacings can best be determined by an optimisation procedure. This method involves the repeated application of small pertubations to the element positions of a starting array until maximum improvement to the sidelobe levels of the array is achieved. An efficient perturbation method has been proposed by Baklanov et al using a matrix approach. Because of the inherent limitation of this method, Baklanov&#8217;s arrays are mostly impractical due to the occurrence of small spacings. Such limitations are removed by the author through the use of a modified synthesis procedure. With this new procedure, the author was able to control the pattern over a considerably larger area in space. Thus arrays with average inter-element spacings up to two wavelengths can be synthesised with positive control over all sidelobes in the arrays. The sidelobe levels of the author&#8217;s arrays are, as a whole, bery close to the levels of the corresponding theoretically optimal patterns. The element directivities are taken into account in the synthesis process. A total of 30 non-uniformly spaced arrays of varying sizes and sidelobe levels were synthesised using the method developed. Since all these arrays have near to optimal sidelobe characteristics, they provide a basis for a detailed study of the properties of non-uniformly spaced arrays as a whole. A number of interesting points are revealed when pattern parameters like gain, beamwidth, sidelobe level, etc., are studied in relation with the spacing characteristics of the arrays. A better understanding of the properties of non-uniformly spaced arrays is also gained by comparing the pattern characteristics of the synthesised arrays with that of current tapered arrays.  The design and testing of a 16-element non-uniformly spaced array of Yagi antennas is described in Chapter 4. This array demonstrates one practical application of the synthesis work reported in this thesis. *The word &#8216;space&#8217; used throughout the Introduction does not mean the physical space, which is defined, in a 2-D case, by the zenith angle &#952;.

Exploratory case study is made of three healthcare provider organisations: community health service; independent practitioner association; Maori health network. Three research models are developed to examine identified gaps and areas of interest in healthcare quality management literature. The first model relates to differences between generic standards and specification standards. The second model relates to the fit of healthcare service delivery systems and ISO 9000. The third model relates to exploration of the linkages and co-ordination of an integrated care delivery network. One proposition and two hypotheses are developed in relation to the models, and are closely associated with gaps in healthcare service quality knowledge. Strong support is found for the first hypothesis though not the second hypothesis, and there are also some unexpected results. There is strong support that the process of implementing the ISO 9000 model will enhance healthcare management performance, even though the outcomes are unpredictable. There are indications supporting the notion that implementation of the ISO 9000 model will increase effective linkages and co-ordination within integrated care delivery networks. The body of evidence accumulated during the study did not, however, permit a valid conclusion regarding the hypothesis. The findings of the study can be extended to other healthcare service areas and through interpretation and extrapolation they add value to healthcare service quality research in general. In particular, the findings of the three case studies in this research suggest that future models for healthcare service quality should include a comprehensive generic model for quality management of individual and integrated healthcare service organisations.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280100 Information Systems::280102 Information systems management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2180</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The high strain-rate compressive behaviour of beta-brass single crystals</field><field name="creator">Ferguson, W.

The first part of the investigation required the development of basic apparatus for investigations of the type planned. This apparatus included a dynamic compression testing machine and apparatus for the production and preparation of metal single crystals. The second part of the investigation required the assessing of the existing knowledge of the static and dynamic properties of beta-brass and the planning of a programme aimed at contributing to this knowledge. A review of the existing literature is presented and a programme of tests is outlined. As a result of the investigation the following conclusions were drawn concerning the static and dynamic properties of beta-brass single crystals. The dynamic upper and lower yield stresses were found to be strain-rate sensitive and the upper yield stress increased by up to 4.5 times the static yield stress. The dynamic upper and lower yield stresses were found to be temperature dependent and to show the same temperature dependence as the static yield stress. Both increasing strain-rate and decreasing temperature raised the yield stress. The dynamically deformed material showed large yield drops whereas the statically deformed material did not. Both the static and dynamic work hardening behaviour were found to be orientation dependent. The rate of work hardening for the static tests increased with decreasing temperature whereas that for the dynamic tests did not. The dynamic work hardening behaviour was insensitive to strain-rate. At strains greater than 4 per cent the dynamically deformed material was found to be softer than that statically deformed the same amount. Both the statically and dynamically tested material deformed by slip and the formation of deformation bands. Twinning was not observed. Jerky flow was found to be composition and temperature sensitive.</field><field name="date">1964</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2188</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cell performance and anodic processes in aluminium smelting studied by product gas analysis</field><field name="creator">Dorreen, Mark Murray Radley</field><field name="description">Aluminium smelting is an energy intensive process, and as a result there has been considerable and ongoing research over a number of decades on the energy efficiency of various aspects of the process. One of the most important measures is current efficiency, which has been shown to have direct relationships with current density, cell temperature, electrolyte chemistry, and anode-cathode distance. The effects of these variables on current efficiency are generally accepted, however there remains debate over the influence of the alumina concentration in the electrolyte on current efficiency. This research relied upon the development of a laboratory scale aluminium smelting cell where the current efficiency was measured via sampling of the product gases. A modified oxygen balance was used, with gas analysis performed using online mass spectrometry. The findings of this research agreed with the accepted current efficiency trends, showing a current density influence of 17.25 %CE per A/cm2, over the range 0.3 and 1.1 A/cm2. The influence of electrolyte chemistry was -7.8 %CE per unit cryolite molar ratio, between cryolite ratios 1.99 and 3. The anode-cathode distance was shown to have no influence on current efficiency in this cell, contradicting the established findings, however this was expected because of the design of the cell with no metal pad at the cathode and therefore constant mass transfer conditions at all the anode-cathode distances used. The most significant finding concerning current efficiency is that the variation with alumina concentration is so small, -0.0376 %CE/wt% Al2O3, that there is effectively no influence. While in many other studies an influence was found, the values and direction of the relationship varied. This suggests that in many cases the observed variation in current efficiency was actually caused by a change in the level of stability in the cell, by processes such as dissolution of sludge from the cathode or the thermal disturbance of alumina feeding, whereas in this research the cell was stable under all operating conditions.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2183</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Saturated pool boiling and subcooled flow boiling of mixtures at atmospheric pressure</field><field name="creator">Wenzel, Ulrich.</field><field name="description">An experimental and theoretical investigation of heat transfer to liquid mixtures has been performed using binary and ternary mixtures of acetone, isopropanol and water. Two data-bases were established which contain measurements of the heat transfer coefficient under saturated pool boiling and subcooled flow boiling conditions. A third database comprises measurements of heat transfer and pressure drop in a plate heat exchanger. The performance of two heat transfer enhancement techniques, namely the coating of the heat transfer surface with teflon and a perforated brass foil, was studied under saturated pool boiling conditions. A model was developed, which can be used to predict the heat transfer coefficient. The model is based on the additive superposition of convective and boiling heat transfer coefficients. It is applicable for heat transfer to mixtures and single component fluids under saturated and subcooled boiling conditions. The empirical parameters in the correlations used in the model were not altered to fit the measurements of this study. The predictions of the model were compared to the experimental data, which covers the convective heat transfer regime, the transition region and the fully developed nucleate boiling regime. It was found that the best agreement between predicted an measured values was achieved, if the linear mixing law was used to calculate the ideal heat transfer coefficient rather than the correlations by Stephan-Preu&#223;er or Stephan-Abdelsalam. The heat transfer coefficient under saturated pool boiling conditions could be predicted with an accuracy of 12.6 %. A comparison between over 2000 measured heat transfer coefficients under subcooled flow boiling conditions in an annulus and the predictions of the model showed good agreement with a mean error of 10.3 %. The accuracy of the model was found to be independent of the fluid velocity and composition, as well as of the magnitude and mechanism of heat transfer. The heat flux in a plate heat exchanger could be predicted with a mean error of 6.9 % for a wide range of fluid velocities, subcoolings and compositions. The heat transfer coefficient on the test liquid side of the exchanger could be predicted with a mean error of 10 %. The heat transfer model was used for a theoretical study of the heat transfer to mixtures boiling on a finned surface. It was found that the fin geometry and thermal conductivity have a distinct influence on the local and mean heat transfer coefficients. The results indicate that the application of fins is more effective for boiling of mixtures than for boiling of single component liquids.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291400 Materials Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2190</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A land mobile radio coverage area prediction model for New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Rowe, Gerard Brendan</field><field name="description">This thesis describes research undertaken as an initial step in the development of a nationwide land mobile coverage area prediction model for New Zealand.

A secondary aim is to investigate the dynamic behaviour of a silt and the effect of variations in the stress-controlled dynamic triaxial test method on the measured sample response. The soil model employed in the developed method of dynamic analysis uses a set of nested yield surfaces to represent shear stress-strain behaviour. These yield surfaces are defined by von Mises failure criterion, have an associated flow rule and undergo both kinematic and isotropic hardening. An empirical model is used to calculate the rise in pore pressure due to cyclic shear stresses. The changes in yield surface radii and hardening constants are defined by experimentally determined relationships between maximum shear modulus, shear strength and mean effective confining stress. A combination of critical state soil mechanics and volumetric considerations is used to relate increments in mean strain to increments in mean stress. The soil structure is divided into elements and a finite difference scheme used to solve the equations of motion. An energy transmitting boundary is incorporated in the analysis. The program has the capacity to analyse the dynamic response of a soil structure to both shear and compression waves approaching the base of the structure from any angle. The dam constructed for the Patea hydroelectric scheme was used as a practical application of the computer program. An input earthquake record considered appropriate to the site was chosen. The dynamic analysis of the dam with an empty reservoir indicated that in this state the dam can satisfactorily withstand the design earthquake. The dynamic analysis of the dam with a full reservoir subject to the same uniform base excitation suggests that a slide in the downstream shoulder would develop. The input earthquake waves travelling along the base of the dam from the upstream toe to the downstream toe, accentuate these displacements. These displacements are caused by the generation of high pore pressures which redistribute after the earthquake to temporarily reduce the stability of the dam further. The assumptions and approximations inherent in the method of analysis tend to make the results pessimistic. It was found that the vertical component of earthquake excitation was the major cause of the generated pore pressure. The results of an extensive programme of laboratory tests carried out on the main construction material in the dam, are presented. The test programme consisted of undrained triaxial, isotropic consolidation, free vibration torsion and stress controlled dynamic triaxial tests. Factors influencing the pore pressure generation characteristics obtained from the stress-controlled dynamic triaxial tests, were found to include the compacted dry density, the cyclic shear stress, the initial effective confining stress, the test frequency, the method of sample compaction, the use of filter paper side drains and the type of end platen.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290800 Civil Engineering::290801 Structural engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2192</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In-situ mechanical behaviour of Huntly coal</field><field name="creator">Mills, K.

Laboratory tests on core specimens and small scale in-situ pressuremeter testing are used to determine elastic properties and failure criteria of the coal and coal measure rocks. The in-situ stress field that exists in the Waikato basin and in particular in the Test Panel of the No 1 West Mine is determined. An instrument is developed especially to measure in-situ stress in coal. To check in-situ behaviour of the coal seam, a full scale underground roadway is excavated in the Test Panel. Stress changes and deformations are monitored from nearby drives allowing all the changes to be observed, even those that are normally missed because they occur ahead of excavation. Using elastic properties and in-situ stresses determined from small scale tests, the roadway excavation is mathematically modelled using the finite element technique. Stress changes and deformations thus calculated are compared to those measured in the full scale test. With evidence gained in the Test Panel investigation, general observations of tunnel behaviour elsewhere in the mine are investigated.

Circuits</field><field name="creator">Blomfield, Douglas Arthur Edmonds</field><field name="description">A new method for the synthesis of broadband impedance transformers having predictable passband frequency response is presented. The technique is based on the use of non-commensurate (i.e. unequal element length) transmission line networks. Through the use of approximations and computer optimization studies non-commensurate circuits are shown to be advantageous in distributed circuit design. The new method derives a non-commensurate circuit from a conventional commensurate prototype in such a way that the transmission matrix of pairs of elements in both circuits is made equal at one frequency. The transformation used ensures that the frequency response of the derived circuit closely matches that of the prototype circuit. Limitations on section characteristic impedances imposed either by constructional constraints or other practical realizability considerations are more easily met using the new design technique than when using conventional commensurate networks alone, Moreover, wide harmonically related passbands are largely avoided. The method finds greatest application where there are circuit length (or size) restrictions which must be met. Where such restrictions do not apply, conventional commensurate techniques are usually sufficiently flexible. The non-commensurate technique can however still provide benefits of even greater flexibility or better stop-band attenuation. The method presented is only an approximate equivalence and so an analysis of the technique is presented. The analysis establishes the degree of approximation. The use and application of the non-commensurate design technique are supported by an experimental investigation.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290900 Electrical and Electronic Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2179</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ethylene Biosynthetic Genes in Actinidia Chinensis</field><field name="creator">Whittaker, David J.</field><field name="description">Actinidia chinensis, a diploid relative of kiwifruit, has valuable fruit characteristics, and varieties with superior flavour and marketable size have recently been selected in a classical breeding programme. However, the marketability of the fruit of A. chinensis and many other species of Actinidia is limited by poor fruit storage properties. Pioneering work in tomato has demonstrated that fruit ripening and senescence can be very effectively delayed by down-regulating genes required for biosynthesis of the phytohormone ethylene. The goal of this work was to isolate genes for ethylene biosynthesis in A. chinensis, characterise their expression, and to generate transgenic plants containing T-DNA constructs designed for ethylene downregulation. A small cDNA library was constructed from RNA isolated from the ripe fruit of A. chinensis. The library was screened for genes encoding each of the enzymes in the ethylene biosynthetic pathway, by probing with PCR products amplified from kiwifruit cDNA and with a cDNA clone previously isolated from kiwifruit. Three distinct cDNA clones encoding S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) synthetase (ACSAM1, ACSAM2 and ACSAM3) were isolated from the library, together with two distinct 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) oxidase cDNA clones (ACAO1 and ACAO2). No ACC synthase cDNAs were detected in the library, indicating low transcript abundance. However, a partial ACC synthase cDNA (ACAS1) was amplified from ripe fruit using PCR techniques, and subsequently cloned in a plasmid vector. Phylogenetic analysis of SAM synthetase protein sequences from A. chinensis and other plant species indicates bifurcation of angiosperm SAM synthetase sequences into two main branches; ACSAM3 was assigned to a different branch from ACSAM1 and ACSAM2. The peptide sequence of ACAS1 shows higher homology to several auxin-inducible ACC synthase peptides than the product of the ethylene-inducible ACC synthase gene which is predominantly transcribed in ripening tomato fruit. RNAse protection assays were employed to estimate the relative transcript levels of each of the ethylene biosynthetic genes isolated from A. chinensis during ethylene-induced, post-harvest fruit ripening, and in immature fruit and floral samples. The response of the mature fruit to exogenous ethylene indicated a clear separation of ethylene sensitivity and ethylene production in A. chinensis. The application of exogenous ethylene correlated with increased transcript levels for all three SAM synthetase genes (ACSAM1, ACSAM2 and ACSAM3) and for the ACC oxidase gene family. Transcription of the ACC synthase gene ACAS1 was not affected by exogenous ethylene, but transcript levels increased during subsequent ethylene biosynthesis, consistent with this being a controlling step for the onset of ethylene production. One or more ACC oxidase transcripts increased significantly both prior to and during ethylene production. Only one of the SAM synthetase transcripts (ACSAM3) was induced during the late ethylene burst, and these transcripts were also abundant in floral tissues and young fruit. A role for SAM synthetase genes in the methionine salvage pathway is discussed. The expression patterns for ACAS1 and the ACC oxidase gene family arc consistent with the consensus view that the rate of ethylene biosynthesis in plant tissues is dependent on both ACC synthase and ACC oxidase activity levels. Therefore, with the aim of down-regulating ethylene biosynthesis in A. chinensis, expression cassettes containing ACAS1 and ACAO1 cDNAs, each controlled by a d35S promoter, were inserted in tandem into the Agrobacterium binary vector pCGN1549, in both the sense and antisense orientations. Leaf tissue from the &#8216;Earligold&#8217; variety of A. chinensis was transformed with the resulting binary vectors, and transgenic plants were regenerated. PCR and Southern analysis indicated intact T-DNAs were integrated in at least half of the transformed plants, and Northern analysis detected mRNAs from one of the transgenes transcribed from both the sense and antisense constructs. No decrease in wound-induced ethylene biosynthesis was detected in the leaves of a small sample of these transgenic plants, and a larger number of transformants are now being grown for phenotypic screening. Down-regulation of ethylene biosynthesis may improve the storage properties and/or the shelf life of transgenic A. chinensis plants and may provide insights into the roles of ethylene in fruit ripening.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2169</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of heat transfer to particles in thermal plasma processing</field><field name="creator">Wu, Murray Kelvin</field><field name="description">Thermal plasma technology is potentially useful for a range of materials processing applications, such as the synthesis of sub-micron, ultra-pure ceramic powders. Thermal plasma reactors are characterised by short residence times (between 10 and 100 ms). Consequently, for chemical reactions to proceed to completion, reactants must be in the gas phase. Reaction rates of solids and liquids are too slow to proceed to any great degree in a thermal plasma, and unvaporised particles can contaminate product material. However, many useful reagents for plasma synthesis are available in particulate form, and thus particles must be completely vaporised if they are to be effective. In this thesis, vaporisation of particles in thermal plasmas was investigated both numerically and experimentally. A numerical model of particle vaporisation in a thermal plasma was developed, which considers the effects of particle vapour on thermodynamic and transport properties of the plasma. This was compared with a simpler model which neglects vapour contamination effects on the plasma. Results showed that the simpler model greatly over-estimated vaporisation times of copper, aluminium, and tungsten particles in argon plasmas at temperatures less than 11000 K, but reasonable accuracy was obtained at higher temperatures. It was found that heat and mass fluxes, and vaporisation time could be expressed in a reduced form which is independent of initial particle diameter. Heat and mass fluxes during vaporisation were found to be linear functions of the inverse of particle radius. Gas-vapour property data are generally difficult to obtain, and guidelines are recommended for using pure argon properties to estimate vaporisation time. The two major types of thermal plasma are the DC (direct current) arc, and the RF (radio-frequency), or induction, plasma. The RF plasma has several advantages over other techniques for the synthesis of powders. Reactions occur in primarily in the gas phase, resulting in good mixing between reactants. Rapid quenching of the tail flame can be used to promote homogeneous nucleation and fine particle size. There is no source of external contamination, because the RF plasma torch lacks electrodes, and a wide variety of reactants can be used, including corrosive and oxidising reagents. The plasma has a relatively low velocity and large diameter, and axial feeding of particles results in better vaporisation of particulate reagents than other thermal plasma torches. In the experimental programme, two RF plasma torches were designed and constructed using the same 13.5 MHz, 15 kW power supply. Fluidised bed feeders and a vibratory feeder were constructed to feed low flow rates (less than 0.2 g/min) of powders, and other apparatus were designed for collecting product particles and quenching the plasma tail flame. The final torch design was used to study heat transfer to particles of a range of materials and particle sizes in the plasma. The materials studied covered a range of boiling points and heats of vaporisation, so that the effects of these properties could be investigated. Particles of alumina, titanium carbide and magnesium oxide smaller than 38 &#956;m diameter were found to vaporise completely. Condensation of vapour produced particles approximately 100 nm diameter which were probably agglomerates of smaller particles formed by homogeneous nucleation. Inspection of morphologies of unvaporised particles showed that the treatment of particles in the plasma is not always uniform, as particles follow a wide range of trajectories and experience various temperature histories. From a semi-empirical analysis of partial vaporization of a range of particle sizes it was estimated that the mean residence time of particles was 18 ms and the mean plasma temperature was 9400 K A heat transfer coefficient of 8000 W/m2K was estimated for partially vaporising particles, which was similar to heat transfer coefficients obtained by numerical modelling. These three parameters may be used to predict the degree of vaporization of particles in an RF plasma torch. Thermodynamic analyses of plasma synthesis of titanium carbide and nitride were performed, indicating the feasibility of the synthesis of these materials in thermal plasma reactors and possible reactant combinations which may be used.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291400 Materials Engineering::291404 Ceramics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2193</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling of a pinched sluice concentrator</field><field name="creator">Subasinghe, G.

Although the initial goal of the reforms was to improve the nation's economy, changes soon took place across other fields ranging from politics to culture, from society to the legal system. These changes throughout the 1980s and 1990s had a significant impact on the development of Chinese film. Contemporary Chinese films reflect these changes either directly or indirectly. This thesis studies the development of film in post-Cultural Revolution China to the mid-1990s. The thesis argues that Chinese film experienced a shift of cultural identity from being subject to Chinese tradition to submitting to transnational globalism. The causes of this shift were a combination of China's own reform process and international cultural and financial involvement in the Chinese film industry. In light of some Western cultural theories, such as structuralism, post-structuralism (including deconstruction), psycho-analysis and postmodernism, this thesis examines a series of acclaimed Chinese directors and films. Many of these directors and films are internationally well known either for their cinematic achievements or for the political controversies about their films. They are seen as representative, especially when contemporary Chinese film is assessed from a cross-cultural, global perspective. In a new millennium Chinese cultural policies on film production and censorship are changing. This thesis summarizes how the Chinese film industry in the last two decades has responded to, and from time to time accelerated the country's modernization, commercialization and internationalisation.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2178</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Risk factors for motorcycle injury: the role of age, gender, experience, training and alcohol</field><field name="creator">Mullin, Bernadette Therese</field><field name="description">Introduction: Motorcyclists in New Zealand suffer a disproportionate number of road traffic crashes. In 1995, 2% of all registered vehicles in NZ were motorcycles, but 9% of reported injuries and 13% of all fatalities were in motorcycle riders. Generally there is a lack of good evidence about many postulated risk factors, with previous studies reporting inconsistent findings. Aim: To identify the role of age, gender, experience, training and alcohol consumption as risk factors for moderate to fatal injury resulting from a motorcycle crash. These factors were chosen because they are the subject of current policy debate in New Zealand. Methods: A population-based case-control study was conducted in the Auckland region over a three year period from Feb 1993. The study base was defined as motorcycles being ridden on non-residential public roads of the Auckland region over a three year period between the 15th of February 1993 and the 14th of February 1996 between 6am and midnight. A case was defined as a motorcycle crash occurring within the study base in which either or both the motorcycle driver or pillion passenger met the injury criteria: were admitted to a public hospital within Auckland; were treated in the Public Hospital Emergency Department in the region with an Injury Severity Score of 5 or greater; or died as a result of a motorcycle crash. The aim was to identify all cases using comprehensive case finding procedures included surveillance of emergency departments, the Coroner's office and injury crashes reported to the Police. Controls, or the sample of the study base, were identified from roadside surveys which were conducted at random times from 150 random sites chosen from non-residential roads. Each road was sampled in proportion to its total length. This produced a random sample of motorcycle riding from the study base. If possible, the motorcyclist was stopped at the survey site. If this was not possible, they were identified by following up their registration plate number. Interviewer-administered questionnaires were used, either face-to-face or by telephone, to obtain exposure data. Objective alcohol data were also obtained from blood and breathalyser tests. Results: Information was obtained on 477 cases and 1518 controls, with interviews completed for 94.5% of case drivers and 81.2% of control drivers. Motorcyclists aged 25 years and over had the lowest risk of moderate to fatal injury from a motorcycle crash when compared to drivers aged from 15 to 19 years (adjusted RR=0.45, 95%Cl=0.33-0.62); the risk for 20 to 24 year olds was intermediate (adjusted RR=0.72, 95%Cl=0.52-1.00). There was insufficient evidence from this study to assess whether there was a changing pattern of risk for motorcycle riders aged over 50 years. The population attributable risk for 15 to 16 year olds in this study was only 0.72%. There was no evidence of an association between gender and risk, indicating that most motorcycle injuries occur in males because most motorcycle riding is done by males. Motorcyclists with more than five years of regular on-road motorcycle riding experience were associated with some increased risk compared to those with less than two years (adjusted RR=1.57, 95%Cl=0.96-2.58), particularly among the 20 to 24 year age group. Motorcyclists who had ridden their motorcycle 10,000 kilometres or more had a lower risk compared to those who had ridden less than 1000 kilometres (adjusted RR=0.52, 95%Cl=0.35-0.79). There was no clear effect observed for other measures of experience including off-road motorcycle riding, other motor vehicle driving and familiarity with the road. There was some evidence that motorcyclists who had attended motorcycle training were at lower risk (adjusted RR=0.74, 95%Cl=0.49-1.14), but the precision of this estimate was poor. There was less clear evidence of an association with recent non-motorcycle training and risk. Motorcyclists who reported having consumed alcohol within 12 hours were at higher risk (adjusted RR=1.53, 95%Cl=1.05-2.23) with a population attributable risk of 11%. Discussion: The methods used in this study to identify and sample the study base by obtaining a random sample of motorcycle riding are likely to have provided a valid estimate of the risks associated with the exposures measured. However some limitations of the study design include the general reliance on self-reported measures of exposures, the lack of data collected on other motor vehicles on the road and the poor quality of data available on alcohol and other environmental factors. This study has identified the following groups of motorcyclists to be at increased risk of moderate to fatal injury: riders aged less than 20 years, riders with more than five years of riding, riders who have not undertaken a motorcycle training course, riders who have ridden less than 1000 kilometres on their current motorcycle and those who have recently consumed any alcohol. Given these results, combined with the information obtained from the systematic literature review, the provisions of the Graduated Drivers Licensing System should be reviewed. This should include consideration of basing restrictions for riding primarily on the age rather than the experience of the motorcyclist and the completion of specific motorcycle training courses only, rather than a training course for any motor vehicle. Further research should consider some of the shortcomings of this study that have been outlined above and also consider methods of increasing the proportion of female riders and older riders in research. The limited evidence of benefit from motorcycle training courses, while encouraging, indicates that further investigation of their benefit in controlled trials is required.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321214 Health and community services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2182</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The fatigue of prestressed concrete beams under reversed cyclic loading</field><field name="creator">Jacobs, M. L. (Murray Lionel)</field><field name="description">This thesis reports investigations into the stiffness of and energy loss in two series of prestressed concrete beams subjected to reversing sinusoidal cyclic end rotations of equal magnitude and direction. These rotations produced equal moments at the ends of the beams and zero moment at the centre which led to uniform shear along the length of the member. Special care was taken in the manufacture of the two series of beams to ensure essential uniformity of the properties of the beams one to another. The end rotations and the resulting moments where measured by suitable transducers and traces of the moment versus rotation relationship were recorded on an X-Y recorder at intervals during each test run. The amplitude of rotation was progressively changed during each test to ensure a steady value of the end moments. From these recordings the changes in end stiffness and energy absorption were observed and recorded against the number of cycles of moment applied. Concrete strains near the ends of the beams were recorded during the tests. The end moments were expressed as a percentage of the &#8220;ultimate&#8221; moment which would be required to fail the beams in one reverse cycle of loading. The moment rotation properties of the beams were observed to change as the number of cycles of loading were increased, this change being more rapid for higher percentages of &#8220;ultimate&#8221; moment. The energy dissipation was found to increase with an increase in the frequency of the cyclic loading, It was considered that the greater part of the energy dissipation arose from the material damping within the concrete. At higher percentages of ultimate moment, the number of cycles sustained before failure was found to increase when ties were inserted around the reinforcing wires. The results from the tests were analysed and an attempt made to relate the properties by the beans to the properties of the component materials of the prestressed members. A theoretical model was postulated with certain simplifications of the relationships of the material properties and a computer program designed to simulate qualitatively, the behaviour of the beams tested. A non-linear hysteretic stress-strain relationship was assumed for the concrete in this analysis which gave similar stress-strain traces to these found in the experimental analysis.</field><field name="date">1968</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2256</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Auckland heart study: a case-control study of coronary heart disease</field><field name="creator">Jackson, Rodney T.</field><field name="description">Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of death and a major cause of morbidity in New Zealand. Although the mortality rates are now declining, they remain high by international standards and there is considerable scope for the prevention of coronary heart disease. There is a paucity of New Zealand data on the aetiology of this disease. The Auckland Heart Study is a case-control study of coronary heart disease which was designed to determine whether a range of variables including; smoking, passive smoking, hypertension, exercise, alcohol, serum lipids, and dietary and psychosocial factors, are related to coronary heart disease in New Zealand. Other factors examined included respiratory infection, sex hormones and serum vitamins. The study also documented the prevalence of the major risk factors in the Auckland adult population so as to examine trends in risk factors since the 1982 Auckland Risk Factor Study. The study was conducted between 1 March 1986 and 3 May 1988. There were two case groups: non fatal myocardial infarction cases and coronary death cases; and two control groups: myocardial infarction controls and coronary death controls.

Simulations were performed using CFX-5, an unstructured commercial CFD package. The research focuses on the performance of the SST and k-&#969; turbulence models which were judged to be CFX-5's most appropriate turbulence models for downwind sail flows. Two-equation turbulence models are viewed as the most appropriate model type for sail simulations, they capture a significant amount of the flow physics whilst providing turnaround times for sail simulations of less than one day. CFD simulations were compared with experimental data for a flat plate at shallow angles of incidence. This test case holds particular relevance to sail flows since both flows are affected by leading edge separation bubbles which form due to knife-edge separation at sharp leading edges. The CFD captures this leading edge bubble well, with the SST model predicting the length of the bubble with 7% of the experimental value. Wind tunnel data was gathered for two-dimensional downwind sail sections for the purpose of CFD validation. A preliminary wind tunnel study was carried out using a low aspect ratio model. The tests were prone to three-dimensional effects and only three-dimensional CFD simulations were capable of successfully reproducing the flow. High aspect ratio wind tunnel test results were also conducted in an effort to obtain nominally two-dimensional wind tunnel data. Surface pressures were measured using Pressure Sensitive Paint (PSP), however due to the low dynamic pressure of the tests error appeared in the data and comparison with the CFD was poor Results show that CFD is capable of qualitatively reproducing downwind sail flows, the leading and trailing edge separation regions were captured and the CFD results compared well with wind tunnel flow visualization. Finally, CFD simulations were used to investigate the two-dimensional downwind sail design space through a parametric study of sail draft and camber. Results show that increasing camber increases both lift and drag a trend that also is evident in three-dimensional sail designs. It is also shown that gains can be made by using designs with draft values as far aft as 60% which helps reduce the extent of trailing edge separation. This parametric design study illustrates how CFD can be used successfully to analyse design trends and rank designs. The research presented illustrates how CFD can be used in the design process but also that care must be made in validating the method. Through this study the relative strengths and weaknesses of the turbulence models are better understood. Whilst CFD cannot yet be reliably used for downwind sail performance prediction, it is still a useful tool for investigating the flow structure which leads to better understanding of the design space.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290500 Mechanical and Industrial Engineering::290501 Mechanical engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2181</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Emotional child abuse and resiliency: an Aotearoa/New Zealand study</field><field name="creator">McDowell, Heather</field><field name="description">Emotional child abuse is recognised as the unifying construct of child abuse (Brassard &amp; Gelardo, 1987). Defining emotional child abuse (ECA) is an area of debate in the literature and a widely recognised definition has yet to be developed. There is general agreement on the definition of resilience with most making reference to adapting and coping well in the face of adversity. Recent research has questioned the implied unidimensionality of the term. A research study was designed with several aims: to explore how ECA is defined by professionals working in the area of child abuse, and by members of the general public; to develop an understanding of the nature of ECA from adults who self-identified as having experienced ECA; and, to examine the ways in which these adults coped, and dealt with ECA and its effects. Further aims of the research following from these were to develop a definition of ECA, and to identify implications for practice for those working in the area of ECA. Attachment theory (Bowlby, 1969, 1988; Crittenden &amp; Ainsworth, 1989) was the theoretical base for the research. The literature on resilience was reviewed with a particular focus on ECA. Consistent findings in the literature on the cost of resiliency in the area of emotional well-being and functioning were explored and used to critically examine the clinical utility of the term. Two surveys were developed, one for distribution to all the professionals working in the area of child abuse in statutory agencies in Auckland; and one for distribution to a sample of adults living in the greater Auckland area. Comparison of the conceptual and specific categories derived from the definitions of ECA provided by the professional group (N=l8l) and the lay group (N=142) indicated considerable agreement. Differences between the groups on the relative frequency of use of the categories were explained and directions for future research were suggested. Concurrence between the findings of this study and others on developing a definition of ECA supported the existence of ECA as a separate and consistent form of child maltreatment. Adults who saw themselves as having experienced ECA were identified through the general public and professional surveys (N=30). They were individually interviewed using a semi-structured format about the nature of the ECA they had experienced and how they had coped with it as a child, adolescent, and adult. The interviews, and relevant material from the surveys, were analysed using a Grounded Theory approach. The themes that emerged from the material on the nature of ECA were grouped into four areas: the nature of ECA; the effects of ECA; the context of ECA; and, disclosure of ECA. The themes that emerged on how participants coped and dealt with the ECA they had experienced revealed a range of coping strategies and changes in these across the broad developmental stages of childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. An important distinction that emerged was that between coping with the ECA and dealing with it. The cost of coping was a prominent theme and concurred with findings in the literature. The implications for practice and directions for future research generated by these findings are discussed. A theoretical definition developed from the research findings is presented and applied to specific examples from the research.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380106 Developmental psychology and ageing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2201</field></doc><doc><field name="title">He ao rereke : education policy and Maori under-achievement: Mechanisms of Power and Difference</field><field name="creator">Johnston, Patricia Maringi G.</field><field name="description">In acknowledging continual educational under-achievement of Maori children, this thesis investigates the relationship between education policy and Maori under-achievement. It argues that under-achievement is framed within boundaries of changing recognitions and realisations of power and difference: that conceptions of difference have influenced education policy and schooling practices for Maori. Theoretically, the thesis examines 'what counts as difference' and 'what differences count'. In recognising that unequal power relations between dominant and subordinate groups produce distinct views about difference, 'what counts as difference' encompasses the perspectives of dominant groups and 'what differences count', subordinate groups. The former view is developed to expand the basis for investigating 'Pakeha conceptions of difference', and the latter, 'Maori conceptions'. The thesis traces the interactions and relationships of 'difference' and 'power', and examines, historically, how they have contributed to and sustained Maori educational under-achievement. The contribution of these conceptions of difference to informing schooling practices is investigated through four sequential 'Classification Schemes' of Assimilation, Integration, Multiculturalism and Biculturalism. The thesis argues that Biculturalism is based on a positive view of Maori cultural differences, and examines the extent of Maori influence on four recent education policy making processes. The thesis also acknowledges a Maori focus on the importance of structural differences for addressing their needs. On the basis of those two different perspectives, the thesis develops the concepts 'Maori-friendly' and 'Maori-centred', to examine processes, and structures and the relative influence of Maori on mainstream policy forming processes. The thesis shows that Tomorrow's Schools, Education for the Twenty-First Century and the Maori Affairs Select Committee Inquiry encapsulate different degrees of both Maori-friendly and Maori-centred approaches, though arguing that ultimately, it is Pakeha conceptions of difference that inform and influence all the policy forming processes. However, the fourth policy process examined was originally a wholly Maori-centred initiative - Te Kohanga Reo. The thesis points to and traces the incorporation of Te Kohanga Reo into the mainstream education system and its consequences for Maori, and concludes that structural differences ensure continuing Pakeha control over Maori conceptions of difference and henceforth Maori educational under-achievement.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2194</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanical wave velocity dispersion in rods and extension of the resonant bar method to 800 KHz: a study of the velocity dispersion of longitudinal waves in rods, and a feasibility study of extending the Resonant Bar method of internal friction measurement to 1 MHz</field><field name="creator">Booker, Rudolf Edward</field><field name="description">The Resonant Bar method for measuring internal friction in solids has been investigated with the aim of extending this method to higher frequencies in the range 100 kHz to 1 MHz. This necessitated a study of the velocity dispersion of the fundamental longitudinal mode in rods of appropriate size in the region where the wavelength is of the same order of magnitude as the diameter. It is shown that the velocity dispersion of the fundamental longitudinal mode in a cylindrical rod obeys the exact solution of the Pochhammer - Chree equation calculated by Bancroft and Bradfield, over the range of diameter to wavelength ratio from zero to 2.0. The velocity dispersion of the lowest longitudinal mode of a rod of square cross-section has proved to be the same as that of a cylindrical rod of the same material, provided the equivalent diameter of the square cross-sectioned rod is taken to be 1.155 times its thickness. The theory of Nigro (1966, 1968) agreed only partially with the experimental velocity dispersion of a square rod (Booker 1969). As a result of this and a recent theory by Fraser (1969), Nigro has modified his theory, so that at present there is perfect agreement between theory and experiment. In cylindrical rods many resonant responses are excited that are not due to the fundamental mode (also called the Young's modulus mode) when the diameter to wavelength ratio becomes appreciable (usually about 0.7). These resonances are attributed to higher order longitudinal modes. Identification of the Young's modulus mode resonances becomes impossible when many of these higher order mode resonances occur. On several occasions one of the expected Young's modulus mode resonances is absent, its place being taken by two or more resonances extremely close together in frequency and of small vibration amplitude. Frequently some of the harmonics have a frequency above or below the expected value, so that they do not lie on a smooth graph of frequency versus harmonic number. It is shown that the above two phenomena occur when the value of &#8486; (= &#969;a/Ct) is close to one of the values &#8486;E, &#8486;1 to &#8486;2, or &#8486;3, where, at a value of: (1) &#8486; = &#8486;E, an end-resonance occurs; (2) &#8486; = &#8486;1, the first complex mode becomes real; (3) &#8486; = &#8486;2, the L(0,2) mode cuts the &#8486; axis on an &#8486; versus koa graph; (4) &#8486; = &#8486;3, the L(0,3) mode cuts the &#8486; axis. To extend the Resonant Bar method to frequencies approaching 1 MHz, it has been found essential to use rods approximately 31/2 inches long and 1/8 th of an inch in diameter. The design and construction of a bar support abstracting a negligible amount of energy from such slender rods proved almost impossible. Both a central three-pin support and a central three-wire support have proved to be unsuitable. A support consisting of two parallel horizontal tungsten wires of a quarter of a thousandth of an inch diameter has however been found to give damping values consistent to within 10%. Graphs are drawn of damping versus frequency for several aluminium and fused silica rods, showing that Q-1 varies but little with frequency and that on the whole it varies smoothly from one harmonic to the next. The Resonant Bar method is ideally suited for the determination of dynamic elastic moduli. A computer program has been developed and used to calculate Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio for any given rod from the resonance frequencies of longitudinal vibration, the dimensions and the mass.</field><field name="date">1969</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2208</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cyclic variability in a natural gas fuelled spark ignition engine</field><field name="creator">Chanchaona, Somchai</field><field name="description">An investigation of cyclic variability in a single-cylinder spark ignition engine fuelled by natural gas was carried out. The effects of combustion chamber shape and compression ratio were examined intensively. Four different combustion chambers were tested and compression ratio was varied in the range of 8.5:1 to 15:1. For each test condition, the in-cylinder pressure data were recorded at each degree of crank angle rotation for a total of two hundred consecutive engine cycles. These pressure-time histories were used for the detailed study of combustion characteristics. The generalized plot of maximum pressure and location at which maximum pressure occurs was demonstrated as an effective means of diagnosing the cyclic variability. It was shown that compression ratio had negligible effect on cyclic variability, but combustion chamber shape had a strong influence. The indicated mean effective pressure proved to be a good index for measuring cyclic variability for a wide range of operating conditions. However, for specific cases in which the variation of indicated mean effective pressure shows poor sensitivity, maximum pressure and maximum rate of pressure rise are useful measures. For high compression ratio engines, a compact combustion chamber arranged around the spark plug has been shown to be superior for reducing cyclic variability. In addition, a study of a model for the small-scale structure of turbulence using the data from these experiments showed good agreement with those from the literature. Alternative assumptions for estimating turbulence length scale were tested and a preferred method is recommended. The study showed that the fast burning combustion chamber is the solution to reduce cyclic variation. However, cyclic variations of maximum pressure and its location in the fast burning condition still exist and continued research to reduce these cyclic variations should concentrate on the variation of characteristics of flame kernel creation and growth from cycle to cycle.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290500 Mechanical and Industrial Engineering::290501 Mechanical engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2209</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mountain beech forest on Mount Ruapehu: dynamics, disturbance, and dieback</field><field name="creator">Steel, Marion Gaynor</field><field name="description">The role of, and response to, disturbance, in the dynamics of the mountain beech forest at western Mt Ruapehu, was examined, using palynology, dendrochronology, and vegetation survey. The pollen record indicates that, two thousand years ago, the west Ruapehu forest was dominated by Nothofagus solandri. About 1800 years B.P., the eruption of Lake Taupo devastated the forest. Though Halocarpus spp. and Phyllocladus asplenifolius were important early colonizers, Nothofagus solandri re-established itself close to its present limits after the eruption. Fire, from about 650 years ago onwards, did not affect the beech forest, but did affect the coniferous vegetation on the ring plain near the mountain. The age structure of the forest shows that there was a large disturbance event shortly before 1740. A dieback occurring about 1969 appears to have been the largest episode of mortality since 1740, larger than the dieback episode described by Cockayne at the beginning of this century. Dieback occurred as a short peak-period of Nothofagus solandri death about 1969. It was the large trees of the mature cohort which tended to be killed by dieback rather than the smaller individuals. Tree-ring analysis, showed that narrow tree-rings occurred in beech in the 1960's. Extreme rainfall years in the early 1960's may have put the beech trees under stress, making them susceptible to dieback. The drought in 1969 may have precipitated extensive mortality. The characteristics of N. solandri rings from Ruapehu are similar to ring characteristics of that species from South Island studies. The 1982 cyclone had a noticeable impact on the forest, affecting some areas severely. However, the impact was relatively minor compared to the influence of dieback. The mean density of trees &gt;= 10cm dbh was 520 stems/ha., of which 220 stems/ha. were Nothofagus solandri. The mean basal area was 22m2 /ha., of which 11m2 /ha. was N. solandri. The basal area is very low compared to that in other N.Z. forests. N. solandri, Griselinia littoralis, Phyllocladus asplenifolius, Podocarpus hallii, and Libocedrus bidwillii, made up 35, 22, 16, 9, and 8 percent, respectively, of the total density. Basal area, density, and species composition varied as much within sites, as between them. The shrub layer formed a large part of the vegetation at west Ruapehu. Coprosma species were particularly abundant. There is sufficient regeneration to indicate that a new cohort of N. solandri is becoming established in most areas. Some areas will probably remain in shrubland for many decades. The result of dieback and windthrow has been to virtually eliminate the canopy of large old beech trees, and to increase the heterogeneity of stand structure. N. solandri seedling densities are not as high as those found in many South Island beech forests. Nothofagus solandri is growing faster than are most of the co-existing tree species, and it appears likely that it will continue as the dominant tree species. Implications for forest management are discussed.</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany::270401 Plant systematics, taxonomy and phylogeny</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2206</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'To map out the "venereal wilderness"' : a history of venereal diseases and public health in New Zealand, 1920-1980</field><field name="creator">Kampf, Antje</field><field name="description">This thesis traces the public health debate about venereal disease in New Zealand from 1920, when the first venereal disease clinics were established, to 1980 before the first AIDS/HIV cases emerged. Studies of venereal disease in New Zealand have concentrated on issues of morality and on the political and social debates; this thesis focuses on treatment procedures and Health Department campaigns. The thesis explores the role of doctors in relation to venereal disease. While advancements in drug therapy benefited patients, medical authority was undermined by demanding and defaulting patients, inadequate medical education, and a low status of the profession. The medical profession developed epidemiological studies and defined 'at risk' groups in post-war decades. Despite claims to be 'scientific', the assessments were informed by stereotypes which had changed little over time. The thesis evaluates the scope of preventative health campaigns. Defined as a public health issue by the 1920s, venereal disease was seen as an individual responsibility by the 1960s. During this time the use of legislation declined, and education and contact tracing increased. The control of infection was limited owing to financial and administrative problems, defaulters and opposition from doctors. Those deemed most at risk were not reached by government educational campaigns, leaving much to the work of welfare groups and individual doctors. The health campaigns targeted groups like Maori and servicemen. The historiography has tended to overlook Maori, and, when military campaigns are discussed, to focus on females. This thesis attempts to redress the balance. Maori had, at least until the 1950s, different treatment experiences from non-Maori patients, although this did not necessarily imply discrimination. The military did attempt to control servicemen, though each Service had different experiences. This thesis stresses the complexity of the gender issue. There was a change from blaming females for infection in the early twentieth century to increasingly pointing to male responsibility. Despite these changes, even with the concept of individual risk pattern by the 1960s, and the understanding that men could be asymptomatic carriers, women were persistently seen as the 'reservoir'. A gender bias persisted.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321207 Indigenous health</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2202</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Frying of potato crisps - an investigation aiming at reduction oil content and acrylamide formation</field><field name="creator">Tran, Mai Thu Thi.</field><field name="description">Reducing oil content, minimizing any carcinogenic acrylamide in the high temperature frying process for potato crisps, and producing good products with considerable crispiness and acceptable color were the objectives of this research. Vacuum frying with pre-treatment of potato crisps was investigated as an effective process for oil content reduction. Pre-drying and subsequent dipping (PSSD) in a sugar solution (&#8216;sugar dipping&#8217;) were considered as an advantageous procedure for the treatment of potato crisps before frying in order to reduce oil uptake during frying. Vacuum frying was observed as an excellent process to decrease significantly the acrylamide formation at low temperature frying of potato crisps. In this study, potato crisps were respectively blanched, pre-dried, and dipped in a solution of sugar (23.07 wt %) for two seconds, before vacuum frying at 120oC, 110oC under different vacuum pressures (170mbars, 150mbars, 100mbars and 50mbars in separate experiments). Conventional frying at 180oC was also used as the control to benchmark the reductions in the oil contents and acrylamide formation among various techniques. There was a significant reduction in oil content of the potato crisps observed when the new techniques were applied. The crisps that had been pre-treated and fried with conventional frying have given the result of 30 wt % reduction. The crisps that were fried under vacuum frying achieved greater oil reduction with varying percentages when applying different pretreatments. The lowest oil content was achieved when the potato crisps were fried at 110oC and 150 mbars giving 58 % reduction on the dry basis compared with control samples. There are various advantages of the technique with PSSD as we have discovered: it is simple and can be applied in potato crisp industries in continuous mode in both vacuum and conventional frying systems. The crisps that had been treated with pre-drying and subsequent sugar solution dipping and then fried were crunchier and possibly had better perceived taste to the consumer, due to the small sugar addition. Pre-drying and vacuum frying have all turned out to be excellent techniques to reduce acrylamide formation in potato crisps as we have found in this study. Vacuum frying at 120oC and 150 mbars reduced acrylamide formation by 80 to 85%. The 95% reduction was obtained when the crisps had been pre-dried. Acrylamide was undetectable when crisps were pre-dried and vacuum fried at 110oC, 150 mbars. The crisps with pre-drying subsequent sugar dipping and vacuum fried at low temperature had improved color compared with the control samples, which were produced by conventional frying at high temperatures.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2318</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards a theory of the configuration and management of export-dependent land-based value systems: The case of New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Lockhart, James C.</field><field name="description">Land-based industries provide the majority of New Zealand's export earnings. The scale of production in the larger industries accounting for this trade creates significant dependency on export markets. The performance of these industries in the international location, therefore, has a marked influence on the country's prosperity. The process of taking land-based products from pasture to plate encompasses a value system. A value system (depicted as the Z-form Model, overleaf) includes all sequentially aligned organisations through which product flows from the producer to the international consumer. Value systems also include the linkages between adjoining and non-adjoining organisations. The objective of the study was to develop a theory of the configuration and management of export-dependent land-based value systems, supported by case study material drawn from select New Zealand industries. The Z-form Model constituted a framework from which both relevant contributions and shortcomings in the literature were identified. A conjoint approach to theory building, encompassing both theoretical and empirical contributions, was developed. Empirical evidence was then gathered through multiple case studies of the meat and pipfruit industries to augment theory building. Particular attention was paid to empirical processes relating to the generation of wealth and its subsequent distribution. Phenomena observed through case research were reduced into concepts, and the relationships between concepts identified. Concepts and relationships were then presented as an emergent theory in the form of a causal network. Some of the perspectives and behaviours of value systems were supported by the literature, however, many considerations were found to be unique. A theory of the configuration and management of New Zealand's export-dependent value systems is presented. The theory encompasses empirically based value system strategies that serve to enhance wealth generation and wealth distribution. Normative value systems, based on the Z-form Model, that return wealth to organisations in the home-base location are provided. Further opportunities for wealth creation and repatriation are identified.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2229</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spread spectrum switching: a low noise modulation technique for PWM inverter drives</field><field name="creator">Handley, P. G.</field><field name="description">Three phase AC drives controlling cage induction motors have become widely accepted in industry, but one extant problem with this technology is that of increased acoustic noise emitted from the driven motor. This Thesis addresses the problem of the acoustic noise emitted from motors driven from voltage sourced PWM inverters and proposes a technique - Spread Spectrum Switching - for minimizing its effects. In the course of the work many other issues associated with real-time microprocessor-based PWM have also been advanced: &#8226; efficient microprocessor based PWM waveform generation, &#8226; harmonic analysis of generalized PWM waveforms, &#8226; compensation for the effects of power switch timing delays, and &#8226; compensation for the finite resolution of timers. The Thesis uses a variety of computational and analytical methods, backed by experimental observations, to quantify the improvement gained in each of these areas. Spread spectrum switching is a technique for eliminating the characteristically tonal structure of the acoustic noise emitted from a PWM inverter driven motor. Similar to the concept of spread spectrum communications, spread spectrum switching involves pseudo-randomly varying the instantaneous PWM switching frequency so that the energy of any PWM switching harmonics is dispersed over a wide bandwidth. This energy dispersion effectively eliminates any tonal components from the resultant motor acoustic noise while leaving the overall sound level largely unchanged; spread spectrum switching provides a significant qualitative yet minimal quantitative noise reduction. The PWM generation paradigm used in this Thesis is the recently reported Space Vector Modulation. A novel algorithm for microprocessor based space vector PWM generation is proposed, providing a basis for fast, efficient generation, even when overmodulating - a situation where many algorithms operate significantly more slowly. Furthermore, it is shown that the space vector method inherently generates a near optimum - in terms of motor harmonic loss - PWM waveform. However, when physically realized on a practical inverter such ideal PWM waveform s are corrupted by timing errors associated with both the inverter's power switches, predominantly the lockout time, and the finite resolution of hardware timers. Resolution corrected modulation is proposed for overcoming the problem of finite timer resolution and involves the use of integral feedback to account for any errors between ideal and physically realizable PWM switching times. This technique effectively provides 4 to 5 bits of added resolution to a given timer, allowing accurate waveform generation at low sinewave amplitudes and high switching frequencies using readily available, often microprocessor based, timers. Lockout times cause inverter output voltage errors, with consequent current zero crossing distortion, and a strategy for alleviating this problem is proposed and implemented in both a triangulation and space vector modulator. Two harmonic analysis techniques are proposed for analyzing PWM waveforms. The first technique is suitable for the analysis of regularly sampled PWM waveforms and has been used here to obtain closed form expressions for the harmonics of both space vector and asymmetrical triangulation PWM. These expressions show that PWM harmonics occur as a series of "combs" centered on multiples of the switching frequency. A second technique - the Directional Rotational Transform - is proposed for numerical analysis of general PWM waveforms. This technique uses an equivalent space vector representation of the PWM waveform, yielding the magnitude, phase and sequence (positive or negative) of the harmonics, and is useful in situations where each of the three phase waveforms is different, as in these cases Fourier Transform analysis of a single phase or line voltage only approximates the harmonics actually seen by the motor. The spectra generated using both these techniques compare favourably with those measured experimentally and, for synchronous PWM, those evaluated from Fourier Transforms. The culmination of modulation techniques presented in this Thesis yields a microprocessor based AC inverter drive featuring low acoustic noise emission at but a few kiloHertz switching rates and accurate PWM waveform generation using a single chip, low cost, micro-controller.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290900 Electrical and Electronic Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2230</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of fermentation and distillation in ethanol production</field><field name="creator">Weeks, M. G.</field><field name="description">The fermentation of sugars from biomass to produce liquid fuels is receiving widespread attention as a renewable source of energy. For such processes to become competitive with current alternatives, technology must be improved to increase the efficiency and productivity of the operation. Using ethanol fermentation by Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast as a model system, two aspects of the process were considered in detail. The first aspect concerned the use of cell recycle in a continuous fermentation. A new technique was developed for the rapid settling of yeast cells in the fermentation medium and involved the addition of dense, inert particles to a yeast suspension at pH 4.5, followed by a rapid change in pH to 8.0 - 9.0. Large flocs formed immediately and settled rapidly, leaving a clear supernatant. Separations of 99.9% were possible, even at yeast concentrations of 50 g/l (dry weight) and increases in settling rate of up to 1600 fold were observed. When the pH was returned to 4.5, the flocs were destroyed. Seeded settling at constant pH was possible although the flocs were smaller, the settling rates were lower and significantly more seed was required. Flocculation was also found to be influenced to a greater extent by certain components in solution. Nickel powder was used extensively in these experiments although several other materials were tested, with ground iron sand showing potential for application on a larger scale. The pH switching technique for seeded settling was used to recycle yeast cells in a semi-continuous fermentation. Application of the technique to this and similar systems is discussed. The factors affecting yeast/inert powder flocculation is discussed and a model is proposed to explain the observed experimental behaviour for flocculation, both at constant pH and with rapid pH switching. The second aspect of ethanol production considered in this thesis was the distillation stage. Equipment and techniques were developed to obtain basic mass transfer information in binary or multi-component systems. A new design of evaporation cell was used to measure the evaporation of ethanol and water mixtures into an air stream in a wind tunnel. This enabled the effect of liquid concentration on evaporation rate to be studied dynamically from batch tests. Radiochemical labelling was used to measure liquid concentrations and proved to be a relatively simple, rapid and precise analytical technique. Coupled with the direct measurement of liquid displacement, precise information on the evaporation loss of both ethanol and water components was obtained. The pure component evaporation data agreed well with literature correlations and, for the binary liquid mixtures, good agreement was found between the experimentally determined mass transfer flux ratios and those predicted from Gilliland's solution to the multi-component gas diffusion equations. The velocity dependence of the overall mass transfer coefficients enabled estimates to be made of the distribution of diffusional resistance between the gas and liquid phases. For the ethanol-water system diffusion was gas film controlled and the overall mass transfer driving forces could best be represented in terms of vapour concentration.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2236</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chronological analysis and simulation of marine biosocial systems</field><field name="creator">Wolfenden, Jean E.</field><field name="description">The logical structure of this thesis demanded a three part presentation. Part I of this thesis provides an historical analysis of global marine ideologies and values, and establishes a framework and justification for the research. The chronological analysis in Part I reveals that humans lived in harmony with the environment throughout most of history. It was not until the twentieth century that technological developments and the burgeoning human population began to take its toll. During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries disciplines such as astronomy, physics and chemistry became distinct from philosophy. The most recent discipline to develop has been psychology, a science that is barely one hundred years old. In the past, psychological investigation ignored the natural world until in recent years the new paradigm of environmental psychology has emerged. Expanding on the notion of phenomenological psychology, a systems-oriented approach demands a holistic world view in contrast to analysing parts of a system. From this perspective, the present research adopted a biosocial multidisciplinary approach to the study of the human/marine environment interface. Part II is concerned with the theory and method in the study of marine and coastal environments. The theoretical concept of consumer socialisation assumes that learning takes place during interaction with socialisation agents such as family, peers, cultural influences and the media. To test the paradigm of social learning theory in familial (informal) and peer collaborative (formal) circumstances, two research studies were carried out. First, a three generational sample of five families in Auckland, New Zealand, were interviewed to test intergenerational commonalities and differences in social, cultural and economic values pertaining to marine environmental issues. Content analysis supported the notion that mechanisms associated with consumer socialisation theory were evident in the rhetorical constructs of participants. Predictions that environmentally aware parents and grandparents would have children with similar attitudes, and adjacent generations would have more closely aligned attitudes and beliefs than nonadjacent generations, were supported. Further, interactive dialogue resulted in contradictions and coercion, strategies associated with attitude change within the theoretical model of social learning. The second research study investigated the effects of collaborative learning on cognitive development. In contrast to the systemic approach of experiential learning, the traditional lecture format fails to address the student as a total person. Based on this premise, an interactive simulation game with a focus on marine conservation, and the corresponding effects on learning and behaviour, was developed in the present study. Decisions relating to conservation versus economic development of the marine environment were manipulated by the introduction of role-play in the context of the simulation game, which was based on an imaginary island governed by eight ministries. Following rigorous pilot testing, the final version of the simulation game was field tested with one hundred and fifty-four students aged between twelve and fifteen years at three Auckland, New Zealand, high schools. Results revealed first, a significant effect of role-play on decision-making and second, a significant difference between control and experimental groups in correct answers to knowledge-based questionnaires, confirming the effectiveness of peer interaction through simulation as a teaching device. Students began to construct their own cognitive understanding of environmental issues and problems faced by government departments with divergent agendas. Once this point was reached it was not difficult for participants to consider social, economic and environmental factors in terms of real-life situations. The results of both studies are summarised in the final chapter. Findings revealed that socialisation processes are instrumental in developing orientation towards environmental issues. Furthermore, interpersonal communication has the power to alter cognitive structures. Justification for concern about marine environmental protection, and the urgency associated with the development of educational mechanisms, was evident from the results of this research. Implications for future interaction with marine biosocial systems, limitations of the study and directions for further research, are defined in the closing sections of this thesis.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2241</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of the families of variable length self synchronising codes called T-codes</field><field name="creator">Higgie, G. R.</field><field name="description">Studies of the families of variable length self-synchronising T-Codes are presented. The studies use Monte Carlo computer simulations to analyse the synchronising properties of the T-Codes and the relationships between these and their coding efficiency. Software and hardware implementations of the algorithms which are used to support these simulations are documented, and one of the encoding/decoding techniques presented is shown to be capable of operating at very high speed while being simple to implement. This technique is also shown to be applicable to the encoding and decoding of any variable length, exhaustive, instantaneous code. From the results of the simulations it is shown that some T-Codes consistently outperform others in the family with respect to their synchronising properties, and that the best of these codes have an average synchronisation delay of approximately 1.5 codewords. More importantly, it is shown that the T-Codes with the best synchronising performance are also the most efficient when encoding symbols from a specified information source, and that the coding efficiency of these codes is only nominally less than that of an optimal Huffman code generated for the source. A theoretical analysis of the synchronising properties is presented, and this is used to explain the relationships which exist between the average synchronisation delay and coding efficiency. These results are used to demonstrate that it is possible to choose a T-Code which has both the desirable properties of unrivalled synchronising performance and optimal coding efficiency, and guide-lines are given for choosing such a T-Code for a specified information source. This combination of a fast and simple encoding/decoding technique with codes which have unrivalled synchronising performance without sacrificing coding efficiency is offered as a solution to many of the problems normally associated with variable length coding techniques.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290900 Electrical and Electronic Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2232</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Radio frequency plasma synthesis of ultrafine titanium carbide powders</field><field name="creator">Stephens, Robert Leslie</field><field name="description">The work reported in this thesis was part of a larger project to evaluate the use thermal plasma processing to synthesise ultrafine TiCx, TiNy, and TiCxNy powders from locally available TiO2, natural gas and NH3. The objectives for the work reported in this thesis were to develop and test the necessary experimental apparatus for a process for synthesis of the ultrafine ceramic powders, and then to investigate the synthesis of ultrafine TiCxOz powders from pigment-grade TiO2 and natural gas using the process that had been developed. The apparatus developed included a powder feeder capable of feeding ultrafine cohesive powders, a RF plasma torch, and powder collection equipment. Feeding cohesive powder at low flow rates with little flow rate variability is recognised as an extremely difficult task. Perhaps as expected, the vibrated elutriated fluidised bed (VEFB) powder feeder that was developed only partially met its design specification as it fed TiO2 agglomerates to the process that were too large to vaporise and react. The poor process repeatability was attributed to the VEFB powder feeder. It was recommended that a Wright system powder feeder be developed to overcome these limitations. The RF power supply required significant modifications before being used for plasma generation, including the addition of silicon-controlled rectifiers for continuously-variable power control and a complete redesign of the grid feedback circuit. The RF plasma torch development took several iterations, and the design used for all experiments performed adequately except for a low tailpiece reactant gas injection velocity which resulted in poor mixing between reactants injected through the tailpiece and the hot flow. The tailpiece injection velocity should be increased to at least 50 m s-1 for future experiments. The powder collection apparatus used for most experiments consisted of a 785 mm long section of 78 mm ID water-cooled stainless steel tube with smaller diameter tubes inserted within the larger tube. The mass collection efficiency of this device was greater than 75%, and was considered sufficient to ensure that statistically representative samples were collected. The experimental programme for the synthesis of ultrafine TiCxOz was centred on a base case set of experimental parameter values, and investigated the process repeatability, the plasma torch power input, the nominal reaction stoichiometry, the natural gas injection location, the tailpiece injection velocity, and the effect of H2 co-injection. Variation of only one parameter in each experiment led to the identification of required process modifications and reaction system parameters for future study. A complex multiphase mixture of four particle types was produced. Ultrafine spherical single-crystal particles ranging from 7 to 25 nm in diameter were almost always observed and were homogeneously nucleated TiO2 or Ti suboxide particles that then grew by liquid droplet coalescence. Ultrafine cuboid or rhomboid single-crystal particles up to 25 nm across parallel faces were almost always observed and were homogenously nucleated TiCxOz particles with x close to 0.99 and z close to 0 that grew by a gas-solid mechanism. Unvaporised single-crystal TiO2 feed particles and largely amorphous free carbon particles ranging from 8 to 40 nm were always observed. The crystallinity of the free carbon particles increased while the extractable content decreased when the natural gas was injected upstream of the plasma. This indicated that the formation mechanism changed from an acetylenic growth mechanism with upstream injection to a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon mechanism with downstream injection. The low mass vaporisation efficiency and mixing patterns meant that TiCxOz was formed unless the process power input was too low. TiO2 to TiCxOz, conversion was largely unaffected by either an increase in the reaction stoichiometry or reactant injection location. Little or no conversion of TiO2 to TiCxOz occurred in experiments performed below the minimum power input, which for this process appeared to be that required to bring all streams entering the process to a bulk temperature of around 4000 K. The major enthalpy demands for this process were heating the Ar flow required for torch operation and the natural gas reactant stream. Future experiments should not use upstream injection of reactant gases so that all available enthalpy transferred from the discharge to the cooler central core can be used for particle vaporisation. The TiCxOz synthesis experiments were modelled using free energy minimisation techniques. It was found that it was important to include all inert gases in the system specification and that the thermodynamic properties of graphite should adequately represent the thermodynamic properties of the free carbon, so the prediction of the onset of free carbon formation should be relatively accurate. The system TiCx-TiNy-TiOz forms a solid solution with complete miscibility at elevated temperatures. However, the phase and atom distributions, and the temperatures at which phase transitions occurred, were relatively unaffected by the inclusion of ideal solution TiCxOz(s,l) in the system specification. It was concluded that slight differences did not warrant the added complexity caused by including the solution phases in the system specification. Analyses of the individual experiments indicated that free carbon formation would be a serious problem, and that the high vapour pressure of TiN(g) around the temperatures at which TiC(s) formation was predicted to occur may have led to the formation of TiCxNyOz(s) with significant nitrogen levels.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2244</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intermetallic phases formed during galfanizing</field><field name="creator">Chen, Zhan Wen</field><field name="description">Galfan (5 wt% Al-Zn plus 0.05 wt% mischmetal or 0.1 wt% Mg) is a coating which in recent years has undergone many industrial studies and trials. The aim with Galfan is to produce a coating which has no intermetallic phases in the coating but this condition is not always achieved. Though it is important, the nature of the intermetallic phases and the mechanisms of their formation and growth during Galfanizing are far from fully understood. The overall objective of this investigation was to identify the intermetallic phases which form and grow during Galfanizing. At 450&#176;C, the formation of the intermetallic phases was in the form of a local outburst and the intermetallic phases then grew in a breakaway morphology. The previously reported structure and composition of the intermetallic phases were found to be either incorrect or incomplete. The intermetallic local outburst was determined to be mainly Fe2Al5-Znx with the outer part next to the eutectic being FeAl3-Znx. The breakaway phase was FeAl3-Znx and another phase next to the interface was Fe2Al3-Znx. The intermetallic growth is characterized by the growth of Fe2Al3-Znx towards the substrate with a &lt;001&gt; growth direction, following a reaction path of &#945; (substrate) - Fe2Al5-Znx - FeAl3-Znx - Galfan (melt). When the dipping temperature was increased, the rates of intermetallic formation and growth were greatly increased. The intermetallic morphology was shown to change from predominantly breakaway at 450&#186;C to predominantly layered at temperatures higher than 490&#186;C resulting from a fast growth of Fe2Al5-Znx. The degree of the preferred orientation of Fe2Al5-Znx, increased at higher dipping temperatures. It was shown that the lattice parameters and therefore the interplanar spacings of Fe2Al5-Znx formed during Galfanizing were dependent on the dipping temperatures. The same reaction path as that described for 450&#186;C was also followed at higher temperatures. However, when the substrate is dipped at high temperatures and when the Fe2Al5-Znx grows to a considerably thickness, the limited diffusion rate of aluminium across a thick Fe2Al5-Znx layer resulted in the formation of FeZn10-Aly. When silicon was present in the substrate, the time for the intermetallic formation was much lengthened and the growth of Fe2Al5-Znx and therefore the whole intermetallic layer became considerably slower. When silicon was present in the melt, the intermetallic phases did not grow to any noticeable extent, at 450&#186;C and 470&#186;C. However, at 490&#186;C and above though the nucleation time of the intermetallic was also delayed, once nucleated the growth was fast resulting in a highly localized growth. It was found that the existing data on the interplanar spacings of Fe2Al5-znx were incorrect. The two most intense peaks were shown to be due to diffraction from 221 and 311 rather than from 002 and L30. A new list of interplanar spacings was proposed. It was shown that the lattice parameters and therefore interplanar spacings of Fe2Al5-Znx formed during galvanizing were dependent on the aluminium content of the bath. The compositions of intermetallic phases determined in this study were not, consistent with those expected from previously published ternary phase diagrams. At 450&#186;C, the solubility of zinc was found to be 5.3 wt% in FeAl3, 20.9 wt% in Fe2Al5, and 2.0 wt% in FeAl at 450&#186;C. Based on these results, a new version of the Fe-Al-Zn ternary phase diagram at 450&#186;C was proposed.</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2240</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Women of Tikopia</field><field name="creator">Macdonald, Judith</field><field name="description">This thesis is based on 18 months fieldwork in 1979-80 in the Solomon Islands. The study was carried out among the Tikopia people both on their home island and in the settlement of Nukukaisi in Makira. The central focus of this study is an analysis of the women of Tikopia from several perspectives. First they are examined in time: the women of Professor Raymond Firth's study of 1929 are contrasted with women 50 years on. Next they are described in different geographical settings - the home island and the settlement. Special attention is paid to two categories of women: the fafine taka 'unmarried women' and the fafine avanga 'married women'. These two groups stand in strong contrast with one another. The unmarried women have considerable social and sexual freedom. However, their structural position in society is undergoing some redefinition as they are required to replace in the domestic workforce their brothers who have migrated as wage labourers to other parts of the Solomons. The departure of the young men has caused some demographic imbalance among the young and their absence decreases opportunities of marriage for the young women. No other career is available to young women as they do not leave Tikopia for schooling or work as their brothers do. By contrast, the married women, to whom marriage ostensibly brings social maturity, are the most tightly controlled section of the population, being responsible to the patriline into which they have married. The social and symbolic elements of gender relations in Tikopia are therefore examined through the lives of these two groups of women. A further concern which underlies this work are the developments in theoretical and methodological approaches to the study of gender by anthropologists, with special reference to their application in the Pacific area.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420307 Pacific cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2243</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Probabilistic methods applied to slope stability analysis</field><field name="creator">St. George, J. D. (John D.)</field><field name="description">In slope stability analysis, as with other areas of geotechnical engineering, there is a high degree of uncertainty associated with design parameters. Engineers rely heavily on historical information and present performance to establish criteria. The observational approach which is essentially taking a Bayesian stance is advocated in most projects. The purpose of this study was to develop a method which will augment current design practice for mine slope stability, with the use of strength parameters derived from the back analysis of failures. A computerised database system for the storage of slope instability cases was developed using a commercial package. This enabled consistent and complete records of failures to be stored and recalled for analysis. To utilize these back analysis results in a probabilistic framework, a Bayesian approach was formulated to calculate the probability distribution of c-&#966;. Two separate likelihood functions were derived from the observations of slope failures in similar materials for 1) The functional relationship between the c-&#966; parameters required to meet critical equilibrium conditions. 2) The average normal and shear stress conditions on the failure surface. Uniform prior distributions were used to assess the likelihood function. Strength properties from tests and other sources were collated into informative priors and the corresponding posterior distributions defined. Both likelihood functions produced results in agreement with reported test results. A probabilistic model based on the first-order second moment approach was developed to cope with circular and non-circular slope stability analyses. The spatial variability of the random variables was incorporated into this model and by considering the contributions of the end resistance a quasi 3-D probability of failure was derived. All the case studies were analysed using this model with the posterior strength parameters. It was found that the spatial variability only had a major effect when the range of influence of the variability was small compared to the size of the slope. Both watertable and model error had much greater effect on the variance. The 3-D aspects of failure were investigated and a lateral release factor was introduced to assess the importance of the end resistance on the failure probability. A predictive analysis was presented to demonstrate the use of these methods in slope design. End resistance was shown to have most impact on 3-D probability of failure.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2242</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling of geysers</field><field name="creator">Saptadji, Nenny Miryani</field><field name="description">Geysers that discharge water and steam intermittently to the atmosphere are one of the rarest natural phenomena associated with geothermal systems. Several approaches including laboratory experiments, field observations and mathematical and numerical modelling studies are used in the present study to explain the behaviour of geysers and the important parameters controlling the eruption of geysers. A particular study is made of three geysers at Rotorua geothermal field: Pohutu, Prince of Wales Feathers and Waikorohihi. The existing mathematical model (steinberg et al., 1981a) is studied and an improved mathematical model is developed to accommodate two-phase flow and the variation in fluid properties with temperature. Both the existing and the improved mathematical models are used to model Pohutu and are able to reproduce not only the interval between eruptions but also the durations of the cavern filling and the duration of the pre-play stage observed by the author on the 20th of August 1993. Fully transient numerical models, which include the eruption process itself, are developed using MULKOM and the AUTOUGH2 simulators and produce reasonably good agreement with the analytical solutions and experimental data. The model provides information about the processes inside the geyser system and models the surface discharge which cannot be modelled using the Steinberg type of model. A fully transient model for Pohutu, which is developed using the AUTOUGH2 simulator, is able to reproduce the behaviour observed by the author on the 20th of August 1993. The results of sensitivity studies show that of the three Rotorua geysers, the Feathers is the most sensitive to changes in the rate of the hot upflow from depths. Both the Feathers and Waikorohihi are more sensitive to temperature changes than Pohutu. Pohutu is currently a vigorous geyser with preliminary pulsating spring behaviour; large changes in the rate and temperature of the hot upflow would be required to stop it erupting. All geysers are sensitive to variations in the water level and temperature in Te Horu.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291100 Environmental Engineering::291101 Environmental engineering modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2259</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Two dimensional nonlinear seismic ground response studies</field><field name="creator">Marsh, E. J. Edward John</field><field name="description">The work in this thesis investigates the nature of the two dimensional nonlinear seismic ground response of alluvial basins. Computer programs are developed to analyse both the out-of-plane (SH) and in-plane (PSV) two dimensional solution spaces. A finite difference approach is utilised. The seismic input motion may originate from either below or from within the two dimensional mesh modelled. The analyses are performed in terms of total stresses and strains, and pore water pressures are not taken into account. A transmitting boundary allows energy to radiate from the solution space. The computations are performed with a nonlinear soil model which incorporates hysteretic material damping. The shape of the initial loading curve of the soil model may be arbitrary, but the majority of the analyses presented utilise a hyperbolic initial loading curve. Alluvial basins of constant L/H ratio are analysed subject to both vertically propagating seismic waves and seismic waves inclined at angles to the vertical. Both simple displacement pulse and complex transient earthquake acceleration input forms are utilised. Varying levels of excitation are employed to study the effect of strain level on the basin response. Two dimensional basins of varying L/H ratios are analysed subject to vertically propagating waves, and the results compared to a one dimensional nonlinear formulation. The results obtained using a hyperbolic initial loading curve are compared to those produced using initial loading curves derived from empirical relationships for dynamic soil properties. Results from the two dimensional nonlinear analysis are compared to those obtained from a two dimensional linear visco-elastic solution. A detailed case study is investigated with the two dimensional nonlinear analysis forming part of the Ashigara Blind Prediction Test. Elastic closed form solutions for simple two dimensional configurations are calculated, and time domain results compared to the nonlinear analysis. In-plane Rayleigh wave and out-of-plane Love wave characteristics in the nonlinear medium are investigated. A study of soil-structure interaction in the nonlinear medium is made. The feasibility of including discrete fault source models in the two dimensional analysis is investigated, with both dislocation and stress drop methods of input. The two dimensional nonlinear site response analysis method presented in this thesis is found to be a very flexible tool in calculating the ground response of alluvial basins to seismic waves. The method is relatively inexpensive computationally in the light of present computer capabilities. The method is therefore preferred to one dimensional and linear visco-elastic analyses in calculating the response of alluvial basins, given sufficient site data.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290800 Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2255</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Conceptualising the influence of clients on valuations</field><field name="creator">Levy, Deborah S.</field><field name="description">The review of property-related literature pertaining to valuer behaviour, valuation bias and smoothing all indicate that there are many behavioural issues that may affect valuation outcomes. Evidence suggests that heuristics may be one explanation for such phenomena, but a growing literature suggests that the role of the client within the valuation should also be considered. The main aim of this study therefore is to construct a framework of client influence in order to achieve an in-depth understanding of the commercial valuation process and the role played by the client within this process. Previous research in the area of behavioural property research has been undertaken utilising a quantitative research approach, however by introducing a qualitative approach a richer and more in-depth understanding of the topic was achieved. The research question addressed in this study was established as "How do clients influence valuation outcomes?". Constructionism identified the underlying assumption about reality governing the research; based on the premise that different people construct meaning in different ways in relation to the same phenomena. The theoretical perspective was determined to be interpretivism which was guided by the study's goal of assessing the nature of reality for both valuers and clients regarding the valuation process. The research process consisted of four stages, the first being the literature review and the construction of a preliminary framework of client influence. The second stage incorporated one-to-one interviews with valuers and the compilation of an updated framework. Stage 3 consisted of one-to-one interviews with clients and the compilation of a revised framework; and Stage 4 collected feedback from a number of experienced valuers and sophisticated clients in order to enhance the trustworthiness of the findings. The framework of client influence highlights eight main factors with the potential to affect the type and amount of client influence and power over the valuation process. These are described as the type of client; external pressures; valuer traits; the type of client valuer relationship; the characteristics of the valuation firm; the valuation process; the purpose of the valuation and finally technical valuation. In addition to the formulation of a framework of client influence the results provide a comprehensive understanding of the valuation process and specifically the incentives, power and opportunities clients have to influence valuations. The results of the study suggest that there are a number of specific influences not previously documented in the property literature that appear to have the potential to affect valuation outcomes and the valuations that are ultimately reported to stakeholders. In particular the strong influence the client has over the whole valuation process was uncovered. The main findings of the research suggest that clients possess not only the incentives and the ability to influence valuation outcomes, but the valuation process itself is largely governed by the client and provides opportunities for them to exert their power over the valuer. This influence does not only exist within the formal valuation process, but informally before the valuation has been commissioned. The study concludes by identifying scholarly contributions and contributions to the property profession. These suggest that the knowledge gained from the research can assist the property profession in understanding the role of both client and valuer in the valuation process and the tension that may exist between valuer independence and customer satisfaction. This knowledge can be used to effectively educate both valuers and clients of their roles in the valuation process together with areas where a valuer may be potentially vulnerable to undue influence.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2221</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teenage dating violence</field><field name="creator">Jackson, Susan M.</field><field name="description">Three studies were undertaken with high school students, unified by the goal of informing prevention programmes in high schools. The first study used a questionnaire to gather information from 373 students about their experiences of emotional, physical and/or sexual violence across heterosexual dating, peer and family relationships. Although girls and boys reported similar rates of all types of violence, the emotional consequences for girls were more adverse, girls were more likely to talk to someone about it and more likely to terminate the relationship. There was a correlation between violence victimisation in dating relationships and in the family. Experiences of peer violence were similar for boys and girls, although girls reported significantly more sexual harassment and boys significantly more physical violence. The two remaining studies in the research used a discourse analytic approach to examine the talk of students. One study used 12 group interviews in which 101 students were invited to talk about their perceptions of dating relationships and the violence that occurred within them. The key strand in the analysis of this talk was the social construction of masculine and feminine identities. Boys commonly drew on the discourses of naturalness, the sexually driven male and the patriarchal discourse. For girls, the prevailing discourses were the discourse of the body, the discourse of 'emphasised femininity' (traditional femininity) and, as with the boys, the patriarchal discourse. The other study involved analysis of 24 individual interviews with girls, who had themselves been in relationships with boyfriends that involved violence. Their stories were commonly threaded with the romantic narrative, but although girls at times positioned themselves within the passivity of romantic discourse and 'emphasised femininity', they also positioned themselves in the contradictory discourse of feminism. The high levels of reported violence in the questionnaire study supported a need for dating violence prevention programmes in schools as well as suggesting specific areas to target within programmes. The group interview study strongly indicated the need to foster alternative constructions of masculinity and femininity and the individual interview study pointed to the need to alert teenagers to the fusion of love and violence through exposing the trappings of romantic discourse.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::321200 380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2250</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of reaccreditation on general practice in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Tracey, Jocelyn Margaret</field><field name="description">The Reaccreditation Programme of the Royal New Zealand College of General Practitioners (RNZCGP) became compulsory for all members in 1994. Ongoing reaccreditation of medical specialists is a new, but rapidly growing trend on which little research has been done. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the effects of reaccreditation on general practice in New Zealand in the first three years of the programme. The history and current status of reaccreditation programmes throughout the world is summarised. The requirements of the RNZCGP Reaccreditation Programme are described and contrasted with the requirements of other programmes. A basic assumption of the Reaccreditation Programme that general practitioners can accurately identify their own areas of deficiency, is tested and found to be incorrect. A very low correlation between general practitioners' self assessments of knowledge on a given topic, and their results on a written objective test was found. The attitudes of general practitioners to the Reaccreditation programme, both shortly before it began and three years post-implementation are tested using a validated semantic differential questionnaire. Initial acceptance was reasonably high, but this decreased with time. Qualitative and quantitative studies of the ways in which general practitioners have altered their educational activities because of the programme showed improvements in the quality of the activities selected, but little increase in overall time spent. Analysis of the effects of the compulsory audit aspect of the Reaccreditation Programme showed that this activity has resulted in significant improvements to patient care. The effects of the programme on general practice are analysed in the light of current change theories and finally recommendations are made regarding the possible future development of the RNZCGP Reaccreditation Programme.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2246</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Economy, ritual and history in a Balinese tourist town</field><field name="creator">MacRae, Graeme S.</field><field name="description">This work began in reflection upon the form of tourism in Ubud: in which rapid economic change and profound cultural conservatism appear combined in unlikely symbiotic relationship. It became, in the field, a set of parallel enquiries into tourism, economics, politics, ritual, spatial organisation and history linking Ubud with wider local, regional and global processes. My provisional argument goes something like this. The economic development associated with tourism has resulted in Ubud not in a wholesale replacement of the forms of traditional culture with those of international capitalist culture but instead with conservation, development and intensification of aspects of traditional culture. Tourism is in fact built upon the marketing of an image of traditional culture consisting primarily of the performing and plastic arts and an aesthetic of village life combining agricultural production and ritual activity. In practice tourism has transformed the economic foundations of this way of life from dependence upon agricultural production to dependence upon a whole new sector providing goods and services to tourists. This transformation has had varied effects upon the components of the marketing image. One the one hand it has made possible profitable commoditisation of traditional arts but on the other it has marginalised the agricultural sector in a number of ways. The relationship between tourism and ritual activity is less direct. While people have resisted direct commodification of ritual, they recognise its role as a tourist attraction. Ritual practices and the temples in which they take place have however been the subject of massive redevelopment. While the forms of these are traditional, their content is linked to tourism in more complex ways. This process has not been ad-hoc but has been the subject of de-facto management by various parties including the traditional aristocracy, foreign expatriates, government and an emerging middle class. This management has been enabled and limited by access of the various parties to key resources including English language, land, cultural knowledge, investment capital and government contacts. This thesis does not report on all of this but represents in effect a report upon work in progress, providing a broad overview and the first stage of what is now seen as an ongoing research project. It is presented as a series of linked sections designed to be read at three levels: 1. as stand-alone contributions to various sub-fields of Bali studies, 2. as a set of relationships between these sections which contribute to the argument outlined above and 3. as the outline of a larger research project linking Ubud into processes of wider geographical compass and historical depth. It begins with description of contemporary Ubud, the transformation of its economy and a brief history of tourism. The relationship between ritual and economy is discussed both in general terms and ethnographic detail to provide insight into the context of cultural ideas in which tourist development has taken place. The spatial organisation of ritual reveals patterns of cultural order and political influence requiring historical analysis which in turn focuses attention on the role of the traditional aristocracy and changing patterns of control over land and labour as key factors in understanding the contemporary situation.

This study used the physical activity questionnaire validated in the Auckland Heart Study Validation Project. Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of death and a major cause of morbidity in New Zealand. The Auckland Heart Study was a case-control study examining coronary heart disease and its risk factors and was conducted in Auckland from 1986 to 1988 (Jackson, 1989). This study incorporated a three month recall questionnaire on physical activity. The results showed that a high level of physical activity was associated with a low rate of coronary heart disease. For example the odds ratio for those with high levels of moderate leisure time physical activity was 0.78 for men and 0.39 for women. To assess the validity of the physical activity questionnaire, the Auckland Heart Study Validation Project was conducted in 1988. Both physical inactivity and hypertension are risk factors for coronary heart disease and physical activity is known to lower blood pressure. The Auckland Blood Pressure Control study was conducted during 1989-90 in order to assess the effectiveness of physical activity as a means of lowering blood pressure in a community setting. The physical activity questionnaire used in the Auckland Blood Pressure Control study was the same one validated in the Auckland Heart Study Validation Project. This thesis describes both the Auckland Heart Study Validation Project and the Auckland Blood Pressure Control study. The Auckland Heart Study Validation Project The 186 Participants for the Auckland Heart Study Validation Project were randomly selected from the control group of the Auckland Heart Study. Of those who could be contacted, 152 completed a seven day physical activity and food intake diary. The seven day diary was the gold standard for the three month physical activity recall questionnaire used in the Auckland Heart Study. The response rate for completing the seven day diary was 82%. The original control group had been randomly chosen from the community and hence the sub-sample of 152 participants represented a reasonable cross-section of the community. The correlations for the three month recall questionnaire compared with the seven day dairy, were 0.61, 0.49 and 0.86 for moderate, vigorous and total activity respectively. These findings were consistent with other validation studies in the literature. One of the strengths of the Auckland Heart Study Validation project was that it was undertaken in the community population for which it was intended. It was concluded that the three month physical activity recall measured physical activity in general and over the three recall period. Auckland Blood Pressure Control study Low levels of physical activity have been shown in observational studies to be associated with a high incidence of both coronary heart disease and hypertension. A concern with observational studies is that the findings may be due to confounding factors which are not able to be controlled, either in the design or the analysis. The best method of controlling for confounding is through the use of randomised controlled trials. The literature on physical activity as a means of lowering blood pressure contains many randomised trials and almost all have methodological weaknesses. Moreover, most of those studies have been conducted in laboratory settings; very few trials of physical activity and blood pressure have been conducted in community settings. The literature on salt restriction as a means of lowering blood pressure contains numerous well designed randomized controlled trials showing that salt restriction can lower blood pressure. While significant results have been achieved from salt restriction most of these studies have been involved intensive input from dietitians. None of the community based studies have demonstrated significant blood pressure reductions. The aim of the Auckland Blood Pressure Control study was to assess the effectiveness of physical activity and/or salt restriction as therapies to lower blood pressure in treated hypertensive patients in a community setting. The research design was a factorial design randomised controlled trial of physical activity and salt restriction as therapies for lowering blood pressure. Participants were recruited for the study from general practitioners and a variety of public advertisements. The study was conducted over six months and 181 of the baseline 208 participants completed the study. The two interventions were brisk walking for 40 minutes, three times a week and salt restriction advice. The main outcome measures were blinded blood pressures measured at three and six months. The average age of the participants was 55 years and there were approximately equal numbers of men and women. At the three month interview there was a statistically reduction in systolic blood pressure for salt restriction and physical activity as separate therapies, but not for the combination. There was no significant reduction in diastolic blood pressure at the three or six month assessment. Although the Auckland Heart Study three month recall questionnaire was valid for the case-control study there was concern that it was not sensitive enough for the randomised controlled trial. It was concluded that both physical activity and salt restriction lowered systolic blood pressure, at least in the short term, in persons with hypertension treated with medication in a community setting.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2245</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Short-term electrical load prediction and related aspects</field><field name="creator">Kobe, Maria Ursula</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted at the request of the author</field><field name="date">1986</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2247</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Continuing transformation: the structure, composition, and functioning of the New Zealand Labour Party in the Auckland region, 1949-70</field><field name="creator">Gustafson, Barry.</field><field name="description">Throughout the Western democracies since 1945, many Socialist and Labour Parties have apparently emulated organisationally their more conservative and often more successful middle-class rivals and have experienced what L.D. Epstein has termed 'contagion from the right'. This thesis sets out to examine this proposition in relation to what happened between 1949 and 1970 to the New Zealand Labour Party, specifically in the twenty-two electorates which, at the time of the 1969 election, comprised the Auckland Region of the Party. Data was gathered by a variety of methods which included the use of four different questionnaires; interviews; correspondence with all the Labour Members of Parliament in the Region; exhaustive research into Head Office records, which included membership returns, annual financial statements from branches, correspondence files, Conference records, and N.Z. Executive minutes; detailed examination of branch minute books; the utilisation of the records of the Auckland Regional Council, the defunct Auckland Labour Representation Committee, and various electorate organisations; and field and participant observation. A variety of approaches was used also in processing and presenting the data: descriptive, quantitative, comparative, and deductive. Part I describes and analyses the quantitative and qualitative changes in structure, composition and functioning that took place between 1949 and 1970. Part II compares the white-collar with the manual-worker branches, members, and activists in 1969 and 1970, Throughout, there is an attempt to explain what caused the various changes and to suggest what happens to a Labour Party as its membership becomes more white-collar in composition. The Appendices, which are contained in a second volume, include detailed statistical tables and figures and copies of the four questionnaires. Volume II also contains the Bibliography. It was found that, in response to the changing realities of its social, economic, and political environment, the N.Z.L.P. had altered considerably in the period studied. The changes were not mimetic but organic. The society changed dramatically. The composition of the Party - first at the Parliamentary level and later at the primary level - inevitably and at first imperceptibly changed also. The white-collar proportion of the Labour Party's membership in the Region studied rose from 15 per cent in 1949 to 51 per cent in 1970. The Party at the grass-roots level functioned mare and more in ways related exclusively to winning elections and showed a declining concern with ancillary social and solidarity considerations. Membership, branch meeting activity, and fundraising at the branch level, all declined dramatically. Significantly, branch activity increased only in regard to Annual Conference participation. The changes in society, which led to a change in the composition and policies of the Party, in turn altered the ways in which the Party functioned. Subsequently reluctant recognition of those changes resulted in an increasingly conscious attempt to formally restructure the Party in the direction it was being carried. The major conclusion reached in this dissertation is that a political party, if the N.Z.L.P. can be taken as an example of a more general trend, is so inextricably interdependent with its social environment that significant changes in society must inevitably be reflected in the composition of the Party and in the ways in which the Party functions. Those changes in composition and functioning in part constitute and in part impel both attitudinal and organisational changes which amount to a continuing transformation of the Party itself to accord with the new social realities.</field><field name="date">1973</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360100 Political Science::360101 New Zealand government and politics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2248</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Work relations and forms of production in New Zealand agriculture</field><field name="creator">Blunden, Greg</field><field name="description">This thesis contributes to the debates over the conceptualisation of enterprises involved in agriculture, the industrialisation of agriculture and the reproduction and subsumption of family farms. In making this contribution, a framework is developed for the examination of work relations and forms of production in apple orcharding and dairy farming in New Zealand. It is argued that many of the intense debates in the literature result from the research perspectives which are used - principally Marxist perspectives. While sympathetic to Marxist theory, a realist perspective is adopted to lessen these problems. Middle-order theory is developed to fill the gap between high political economy and the concrete world of agricultural production. The theory suggested here is tangible in the world of experience. Three themes, all of which are undervalued in the literature, guide the theoretical discussions - work relations, the biophysical basis of agricultural production and the concept of different forms of production. Flexibility is the concept used to integrate these themes. In the first stage of theoretical development and integration, two types of conceptually different workers are theorised: wage workers and self-employed workers have different motivations for work and different flexibilities in doing their work. From this basis, a functional typology of work relations in agriculture is developed, which differentiates all workers and enterprises. In the second stage, the flexibility of workers is matched with the labour demands of hypothetical production systems which are based to differing extents on biophysical resources. Some of these production systems are able to be controlled and consequently made more amenable to wage labour than are others. The third theme argues that two conceptually different forms of production exist &#8211; simple commodity production and capitalist production. The generalised exchange relations of capitalism are held to be a necessary condition for the emergence of simple commodity production. The power of these conceptualisations is tested by extending the concept of simple commodity production to include sharecropping. It is argued that non-ownership of the farm is the only criteria by which sharecroppers can be excluded from being classified as simple commodity producers, and this is less important than the ownership of the share contract. Apple orcharding and dairy farming in New Zealand are the focus of the empirical part of this research. First, the production system for each industry is established in relation to their dependence on biophysical systems. Then secondary data, and the information from postal questionnaires and interviews with key informants are used to examine the social relations of production in core regions of production, and in regions where each industry has expanded substantially during the 1980 to 1994 period. The production system for apples features two distinct demands for labour which are related to the biophysical inputs. One is a relatively small, permanent work force which must be flexible to attend to the capricious nature of the biophysical resource, and the other is relatively large, lumpy demands for labour, especially at the harvest. These lumpy demands for labour can be met only by accessing external labour markets. The forms of production in the apple industry are distinguishable as either simple commodity producers or capitalist producers. The family enterprises are categorised as simple commodity producers, despite, in some cases, a relatively low contribution of labour by family workers to the enterprise. The three large, fully-capitalist apple producers have reduced their exposure to apples, an indication that the prospects for regular sustainable profits by capitalist producers from apple production are not sufficient. The milk production system is characterised by a demand for high levels of permanent numerical flexibility and high contributions of family labour. Its pastoral basis imposes limits on the scale of individual farms, and these farms are ideally suited to family-based enterprises &#8211; simple commodity producers. Sharemilking is an integral part of the industry. Despite the lack of farm ownership, these sharecroppers can be classified as simple commodity producers. That the large-scale capitalist dairy farmers use mostly 50/50 sharemilkers to operate the majority of their farms supports the contention that sharemilking is the most efficient way for capitalist farmers to organise production. The apple industry is more amenable to the capitalist form of production than pastoral dairy farming because of the higher seasonal demands for labour external to the family, the lower levels of labour flexibility required by the production system and the limits of scale which are part of pastoral dairy farming do not exist in apple orcharding. Yet simple commodity producers are likely to persist in apple orcharding because of their inherent characteristics as a form of production. While capitalist producers must make a certain profit to maintain their presence in any industry, the motivation of simple commodity producers revolves around the duality of household and enterprise, and its reproduction Key words: Work relations, Flexibility, Biophysical conditions of production, Simple commodity production, Capitalist production, Sharecropping, Sharemilking, Subsumption, Apple orcharding, Dairy farming, New Zealand.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370400 Human Geography</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2258</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Business-IT Alignment and Shared Understanding Between Business and IS Executives: A Cognitive Mapping Investigation</field><field name="creator">Tan, Felix B.</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280100 Information Systems::280102 Information systems management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2228</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Me he korokoro ko&#772;mako = &#8217;With the throat of a bellbird&#8217; : a Ma&#772;ori aesthetic in Ma&#772;ori writing in English</field><field name="creator">Battista, Jon Lois</field><field name="description">The primary aim of this thesis Me he korokoro k&#333;mako [&#8216;With the throat of a bellbird&#8217;] is to demonstrate the existence of a distinctive M&#257;ori aesthetic in M&#257;ori literature written in English. Its introductory section, of three chapters, investigates the ways in which mainstream critical discourse in various ways appropriates M&#257;ori literature to its own Western-derived models of meaning and values, and proposes instead a definition of a M&#257;ori aesthetic grounded in the principle of whakapapa, whose whole cultural components for M&#257;ori literature include distinctive textual functions for myth, orality, acts of naming, other aspects of language, and symbolism. The concept of whakapapa also provides the organizing principle and methodology of the central chapters of the thesis, which are divided into two Parts &#8211; each of six chapters. These are framed by a Prologue and Epilogue, whose subject is the profound cultural symbolism of the waka in the work of a founding figure for M&#257;ori writing in English, Jacqueline Sturm, and in Star Waka, by a major later writer in English, Robert Sullivan. Part One devotes three chapters each to the adult fiction of one female writer, Patricia Grace (Potiki and Baby No-Eyes), and one male writer, Witi Ihimaera (The Matriarch). Part Two, following the principle of whakapapa, devotes six chapters to M&#257;ori literature for children. Its primary text is the major anthology of such writing &#8211; Te Ara O Te Hau: The Path of the Wind, Volume 4 of Te Ao M&#257;rama, edited by Witi Ihimaera, with Haare Williams, Irihapeti Ramsden and D.S. Long. It grounds its reading of the volume&#8217;s many texts (literary and visual, in M&#257;ori and in English) in the many distinctive cultural behaviours and meanings attached to the figure of M&#257;ui. Each of the authors and texts has been chosen in order to study and exemplify a particular aspect of the M&#257;ori aesthetic defined in the Introduction, through close readings which draw strongly on the work of major M&#257;ori social historians, authors of iwi histories and genealogies, and interpreters of cultural meanings attaching to the natural worlds, and recent work on literary stylistics by Geoffrey Leech and others. It also draws on conversations with numerous M&#257;ori informants, including some of the authors discussed. The readings are designed to reveal the rich, culturally contextualised knowledges which M&#257;ori readers bring to the texts, and which their authors share and invoke through their deployment of the values and practices of whakapapa. While such representations and explorations of self offer new interpretive possibilities for P&#257;keh&#257; readers, they are also part of a global movement in which indigenous peoples engage in the politics of decolonisation from a position of strength, the stance of self-knowledge.

This thesis analyses three such mechanisms. In Part I, I consider the use of coinsurance to limit the demand for health care. Because coinsurance reduces the elasticity of demand with respect to the price of health care, consumers facing low coinsurance rates may be charged a higher price by doctors. Such discriminatory pricing enables the doctor to extract surplus created in the insurance market, and therefore reduces the effectiveness of coinsurance. I show that in equilibrium, some consumers remain uninsured. I also show how this problem is solved if the doctor and insurer enter into managed care style arrangements. Such arrangements improve insurer and doctor profitability, and restore complete insurance market coverage. In Part II, I consider the design of fundholding schemes which encourage doctors to restrict expensive treatment to severely ill patients. I show that such schemes may be undermined by a patient-doctor side contract. In the face of such patient-doctor collusion, the fundholding scheme may be made collusion-proof by increasing its "power". I show that the optimal collusion-proof scheme may pay the doctor more than his reservation wage. An alternative solution to patient-doctor collusion is to use a partial fundholding scheme that requires some additional co-payment from the patient. Part III analyses New Zealand's internal market reforms. Introduced in 1993, the reforms involved the separation of funding and provision of health care, and were intended to simulate a competitive market environment, thereby improving the incentives of government owned health care providers to be efficient. On the supply side, I look at the internal restructuring of hospitals into private-sector clones. I argue that this commercialisation failed to take account of informational issues within the hospital. On the demand-side, I examine the suitability of internal markets for eliciting optimal innovation from the hospital sector. Again, I find that a standard argument, namely that increased competition leads to innovation, is questionable in the context of the internal market.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics::340200 Applied Economics::340204 Health economics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2235</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Auditory-nerve and energy-detection models of temporal summation in hearing: a theoretical and experimental investigation</field><field name="creator">Kemp, Simon</field><field name="description">Experimental extensions and theoretical explanations of a psychoacoustic experiment concerning temporal summation of human hearing are investigated. The experiment has the well-established result that, ceteris paribus, a brief tone burst is more readily letected than a brief gap in a tone. Two models, one based on the neuroelectrical activity of the auditory nerve and one on energy-detection theory, are presented and developed in detail: both are shown capable of predicting the result of the bursts and gaps experiment. Seven experiments are reported. Experiment 1 found the reaction time to the start of a faint tone embedded in noise generally shorter than that to its end. Experiment 2 examined the effect of rise/decay time on the detectability of brief bursts of, or gaps in, broadband noise: when the energy change was constant, 1here was no effect except at long (100 msec) rise/decay times. Experiments 3 and 4 assessed the detectability of bursts of, and gaps in, a tone embedded in noise where energy change to noise power per cycle was constant but duration varied. The data demonstrate that the effect of duration on detectability was different for burst than gap events, a result predicted by both models. Experiment 5 showed that, when the energy in and duration of a tone burst in noise were constant but the temporal distribution of the burst energy varied, detectability remained unchanged. The repetition rate of noise bursts and gaps in continuous noise was varied without effect on detectability in Experiment 6. Bursts, however, were consistently mere detectable than gaps. Experiment 7 compared the detectability of increments and decrements of a continuous tone embedded in noise. The quantitative predictions of the two models are compared with the data resulting from Experiments 3, 5, and 7. The qualitative results of these and the other experiments are also discussed in terms of their theoretical implications. Taken all together, the experiments do not definitely favour either model over the other.</field><field name="date">1979</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2260</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of natural antioxidants</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Jingli, 1966-</field><field name="description">This thesis relates the physicochemical properties of phenolic compounds to their antioxidant activities. It focuses on the partitioning of phenolic compounds between hydrophilic and lipophilic environments and the relevance this has to their in vivo health effects. Data in the literature was lacking so the phase partition coefficients (log P) of 53 phenolic antioxidants were measured by reversed-phase HPLC and calculated by log P prediction software. There was a very strong linear correlation between measured and calculated values (r=0.91). The importance of log P in determining antioxidant assay values was then tested by developing an assay system capable of measuring activities of both hydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidants. This Lipid Peroxidation Inhibition Capacity Assay (LPIC), based on using liposomes to simulate a cell membrane environment, was then used to measure the activity of antioxidants with a broad range of structures. The activities were correlated against log p, the difference of heat of formation (&#8710;Hf) and half-wave potential (Ep/2) and used to derive a predictive model to calculate the LPIC activity. There was a highly significant linear correlation between the calculated and measured values. The LPIC activities also correlated well to published LDL inhibition activities but not to measured ORAC activities. These findings suggested that behaviours of antioxidants in the small unilamellar vesicles of the LPIC assay were similar to that in the LDL assay but not to the aqueous phase based ORAC assay. The LPIC assay may therefore be a better indicator of potential health benefits of antioxidants in the human body than the ORAC assay. The possible mechanistic reasons are that it may better reflect ability to prevent the oxidation of LDL blood stream particles that leads to cardiovascular disease and also takes into account the importance of membrane solubility which can raise the cellular concentration and thus potential to protect cells from oxidative damage.

Instead of looking for economic impacts of the now-available technological tools, this research investigates how local individuals use (or not) computers, and analyses the mechanisms by which computer-mediated information, obtained by those who use computers, is disseminated through their customary face-to-face interactions with their compatriots. A holistic multiple-case study design was the basis for the data collection process. Data were collected during four-and-half months of fieldwork. Grounded theory informed both the method of data analysis and the technique for theory building. As a result of an inductive thinking process, two intertwined core themes emerged. The first theme, individuals&#8217; exploitation of ICT, is related to how some individuals overcome some difficulties and try to make the most of the now available ICT tools. The second theme, complementing existing social networks through ICT, reflects the interaction between the newly ICT-mediated information and virtual networks and the local existing social networks. However, these two themes were not evenly distributed across the communities studied. The evidence revealed that dissimilarities in social cohesion among the communities and, to some extent, disparities in physical infrastructure are contributing factors that explain the unevenness. But social actors &#8211; named as &#8216;activators of information&#8217; &#8211; become the key triggers of the disseminating process for fresh and valuable ICT-mediated information throughout their communities. These findings were compared to the relevant literature to produce theoretical generalisations. As a conclusion, it is suggested any ICT intervention in a developing country requires at least three elements to be effective: a tolerable physical infrastructure, a strong degree of social texture and an activator of information.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">information and communication technology (ICT)</field><field name="subject">human capital</field><field name="subject">social capital</field><field name="subject">institutions</field><field name="subject">developing countries</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280100 Information Systems</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2357</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Investigation of Intracellular Isosmotic Regulation in the Mollusc Melanopsis Trifasciata (Gray 1843.)</field><field name="creator">Bedford, Jennifer June.</field><field name="description">An estuarine mollusc Melanopsus trifasciata was studied with respect to its osmoregulatory capacity.

However it is isosmotic and more or loss isotonic with the environment as far as the haemocoelic fluid is concerned. An attempt was made to find out how or why this response of the cells to changing external osmotic pressure comes about. Various techniques were used: puromycin to block protein synthesis, labelled amino acids, time experiments, enzyme assays, and so on.

The thesis poses the broad questions of what is the range of women's attitudes to specific issues, what patterns are there to women's attitudes and how well do traditional political categories describe women's attitudes? Attitudes of women to five civil rights or moral policy issues censorship, corporal punishment, the death penalty, abortion and homosexual law reform - are examined and the way women identify themselves in terms of feminism and the left-right spectrum is also discussed. A feminist approach is adopted and focus group interviewing is the methodology which is used for the study. Some of the labels used to describe attitudes to political issues and political identification are discussed. The way the women interpret the labels of left and right and feminism are examined and patterns of self-identification with these political terms are looked at. The attitudes expressed by the women to the five policy issues are categorised according to libertarian, liberal, conservative, neo-conservative, authoritarian or humanitarian labels. The patterns of attitudes and identification are explored. The findings are that diversity and plurality characterise the women's views. Their opinions cover almost the whole range of views on the five issues, they respond differently to the use of the left-right spectrum and the label of feminism, and almost every woman demonstrates an ideological profile which is uniquely her own. There are some similarities among the women, but patterns cannot be easily identified using the traditional political labels. There is also an assessment made of the value of the focus group methodology which has been used rarely in political science. The thesis ends by posing more questions. The adequacy of the liberal and conservative categories for classifying attitudes is raised and there are questions about whether the focus group interview method is gender specific.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360100 Political Science::360104 Political theory and political philosophy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2266</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Social Relations in a Northland Maori Community</field><field name="creator">Bhagabati, Annada Charan</field><field name="description">The Maoris today occupy a unique position in the wider New Zealand society.

With limited knowledge of the underlying pathological molecular mechanisms, pharmaceutical intervention has to-date not provided any effective clinical treatment strategies to attenuate or compensate the neuronal cell death.  Attention has therefore turned to biotherapeutic molecules and novel treatment approaches to promote restoration and protection of selectively vulnerable populations of neurons in the HD brain. Rapid advances in vectorology and gene-based medicine over the past decade have opened the way for safe and efficient delivery of biotherapeutics to the CNS.  With numerous factors known to regulate the development, plasticity and maintenance of the mammalian nervous system many proteins have emerged as potential therapeutic agents to alleviate HD progression.  This investigative study utilised gene delivery vectors derived from the non-pathogenic adeno-associated virus (AAV) to direct high-level expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), Bcl-xL or X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) within the rodent striatum.  Maintenance of the basal ganglia and functional behaviour deficits were assessed following excitotoxic insult of the striatum by quinolinic acid (QA), a neurotoxic model of HD pathology.  Enhanced striatal expression of BDNF prior to QA-induced lesioning provided maintenance of the striosome-matrix organisation of the striatum, attenuating impairments of sensorimotor behaviour with a 36-38% increase in the maintenance of DARPP-32 / krox-24 expressing striatal neurons, reduced striatal atrophy and increased maintenance of striatonigral projections.  Higher levels of BDNF however induced seizures and weight-loss highlighting the need to provide regulatable control over biotherapeutic protein expression.  Continuous high-expression of BDNF or GDNF resulted in a downregulation of intracellular signal mediating proteins including DARPP-32, with AAV-GDNF not found to enhance the overall maintenance of striatal neurons.  Neither of the anti-apoptotic factors provided significant protection of transduced striatal neurons but tended towards ameliorating QA-induced behavioural deficits, displaying behaviour &#8211; pathology correlations with the survival of parvalbumin-expressing neurons in the globus pallidus.  The results of this thesis suggest BDNF as a promising putative biotherapeutic for HD, but emphasises the requirement to control expression following gene delivery, and for further elucidation of the physiological impact that enhanced expression of endogenous factors has on the host cells.  Additionally the maintenance of neural networks beyond the caudate-putamen will be vital to ensuring efficient clinical outcomes for HD.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Huntington's Disease</field><field name="subject">Gene Delivery</field><field name="subject">Adeno-associated virus</field><field name="subject">Brain derived neurotrophic factor</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::329900 Other Medical and Health Sciences::329903 Therapies and therapeutic technology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320700 Neurosciences::320702 Central nervous system</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2363</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A molecular and evolutionary study of skua breeding systems</field><field name="creator">Millar, Craig D. (Craig Donald)</field><field name="description">The skua (Family Stercorariidae) are a group of large, gull-like, predatory seabirds. Two skua species are found in the Antarctic region; the south polar skua (Catharacta maccormicki) and the brown skua (C. lonnbergi). The breeding distribution of the former, is restricted to the Antarctic continent and nearby islands, while the latter has a circumpolar distribution which extends northward from the Antarctic Peninsula and includes many of the Southern Ocean islands. The south polar skua is strictly monogamous, while in contrast, a number of populations of brown skua are comprised in part of communally breeding groups. The brown skua represents the only known example of a communally breeding seabird. In every skua species, breeding females are on average larger and heavier than males. However, in most skua species this dimorphism is relatively small and is of only limited use in sexing individuals. The discovery of sex-specific fragments in the DNA fingerprints of the south polar skua is reported. The multilocus probe pV47-2 hybridised to Hae III restriction fragments which were present exclusively in females and therefore presumably W-linked. The presence of these sex-specific fragments were used to identify female adults and chicks. In addition, the use of these fragments as potentially informative maternal markers is discussed. The parentage of the 13 families from two populations from Ross Island, Antarctica, determined by DNA fingerprinting, revealed a single instance of extra-pair paternity and a single instance of a chick which was parented by neither resident adult. The most likely explanation for the latter is the 'adoption' of a chick from a neighbouring territory. Similarly, DNA fingerprinting was used to assign the sex of individuals of brown skua from a population which breeds on the Chatham Islands, New Zealand. A large proportion of the Chatham Islands population breed in communal groups. Each communal group was shown to be comprised of a single female and two or more males. Consequently, the overall sex ratio amongst breeding birds was biased, with almost twice the number of males as females. In contrast the sex ratio amongst fledgling chicks did not differ significantly from 1:1. The patterns of reproductive success in breeding pairs and communal groups of the brown skua from the Chatham Islands population were determined using multilocus DNA fingerprinting. Sixteen breeding groups were examined, the parentage of 45 chicks produced over three breeding seasons was established using the probes 33.15 and 33.6. No evidence was found of either extra-pair paternity or extra-group fertilisation and there was no evidence of egg dumping by females in any breeding group. These results suggest that long-term banding records for breeding pairs and communal groups accurately reflect the overall reproductive success of these individual groups. In addition, preliminary band sharing analysis indicated that adult members of communal groups were not closely related. These findings are also supported by banding records and are in contrast to the findings of the majority of communally breeding species studied. In the 10 communally breeding groups examined, multiple paternity within a clutch was recorded on two of the 12 occasions in which two chicks were reared. Furthermore, analysis of parentage of the chicks belonging to communal groups in which the adults had remained unchanged for two or more seasons showed that some males had variable reproductive success in different seasons. These records suggest that estimates of reproductive success of individuals based on a single season's data can be misleading. Should temporal changes in paternity (and/or maternity) be shown to be common phenomena in other species, this would have major implications for the interpretation of many parentage studies. The explanation of altruistic behaviour is one of the central issues in contemporary evolutionary theory and behavioural ecology. One of the best known examples of apparent altruism is the helping behaviour which occurs in communal breeding groups such as those found in the brown skua. Within these groups individuals often help to raise offspring which are not their own. This behaviour is an apparent enigma in a world in which organisms are assumed to act in a selfish manner. Consequently, this behaviour has become a focal example at the centre of much evolutionary debate. A variety of theories have been suggested to explain helping behaviour, the most recent is that helping is an unselected consequence of the evolution of communal breeding. This hypothesis is discussed in relation to the recent literature and it is concluded that it does little to advance the current debate. An alternative theoretical approach to helping behaviour is outlined. In conclusion the general findings from the investigation of communal breeding in the brown skua are summarised and these findings are discussed. Finally, possible areas of future research are outlined.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2269</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Facilitating learning: integrating teaching and research</field><field name="creator">O'Rourke, Maris L. (Maris Lilian)</field><field name="description">The research studies reported in this thesis extend over a 5-year period of my own growth and development as a researcher and teacher. Two themes run in parallel. The first theme was improvement in skills in implementing objective research to assess behaviour change resulting from childcare and teacher training programmes. The second theme was the clarification and explanation of my own role and behaviour as a trainer of teachers and childcare workers. The theoretical framework used for the objective research was applied behaviour analysis and the one used to explain my behaviour was Argyris and Schon's (1974) theory of action with its two different theories-in-use. Model I is where people strive to satisfy the governing variables of defining goals and trying to achieve them; winning not losing; minimising negative feelings; and being rational. This creates conditions where only single-loop learning is possible. Single-loop learning is where people adopt new actions to realise their governing variables. However double-loop learning, where we learn to change the governing variables themselves, is only possible with a Model II theory-in-use i.e. where people strive to give and get valid information, make free and informed choices and generate internal commitment to the choices. During Study I my own behaviour as a researcher and teacher could be explained in terms of Model I. I adopted a rigorous research model for the research and a traditional authoritarian model for the teaching. However I perceived a mismatch between what I said (Model II) and what I did (Model I), also I did not like the 'behavioural world' my research activities had created. I wanted to be an effective teacher and an effective researcher yet the two seemed incompatible. The rigorous research methods I was using to evaluate my teaching were limiting the quality of learning and teaching. In Study 1 the effects of training 8 childcare students in two childcare centres using Specific Instruction, Graphic Feedback and Daily Verbal Feedback were evaluated for three caregiver behaviours: non-verbal, verbal and participation (in activities, childcare and housework). This first study showed that when the unilaterally controlling methods of rigorous research were combined with authoritarian teaching, conditions were produced which explained only how people would behave under similar circumstances of control and generalisation was limited. In Study 2 the effects of training 8 childcare supervisors to train their staffs in eight childcare centres using a training package which included Negotiated Instruction, Practice and Feedback were evaluated for three caregiver behaviours: talking with children and adults; socio-emotional (positive and negative); and participation (in activities, childcare and housework). During Study 2 I tried to make the transition from Model I to Model II and moved to teaching where I shared control through negotiating the curriculum and research which included social validation measures. However on reflecting on the outcomes of Study 2 I realised that I was still continuing to do Model I research (where I unilaterally controlled and master-minded the research design, goals and procedures) whereas in contrast in my teaching role I had simply adopted a role which was opposite of Model I (i.e. I had handed control over to the participants). However Study 2 showed that when rigorous research was combined with a negotiated curriculum (unilateral control and shared control) more generalisation occurred. Results indicated that childcare supervisors could effect significant changes in their own behaviour after a training package of negotiated instruction, feedback and practice. Further, they could transfer skills learned to their staffs. These changes were only achieved when: (1) A mismatch could be shown between what the supervisors and staff said and what they did and they judged the behaviour to be important and desirable; (2) Feedback on performance was provided to the supervisors by the experimenter and to the staffs by their supervisors; (3) Opportunities for comparisons of performance were provided (either within-subjects or between-subject); and (4) Supervisors could negotiate to learn the specific skills they needed e.g. how to give positive and negative feedback to staff. Following Study 2 I continued to try to match my espoused views with my practice in my teaching and integrate teaching and research within a Model II framework. I felt that teaching and research need not be separate activities if the data generated could be used for clients' learning and skills learned generalised to the 'real' world. I therefore taught an exploratory course involving aspects of self-control by participants and shared control over course goals and methods. Experience in teaching this course suggested that when socially significant goals were targeted and students collected their own baseline data, data were generated which course members could use to understand, and in some cases solve, their own problems. Creating conditions which fostered psychological ownership of goals and methods for changing behaviour (giving clients choices; working on behaviours clients judged important and desirable; creating favourable attitudes towards training; and giving clients responsibility for implementation), appeared to enhance the occurrence of generalisation. The thesis, then, arrives at two fundamental propositions. The first is that the process of conducting rigorous applied research (e.g. research-determined and specified hypotheses, predetermined measures, research design etc.) reinforces the discovery and invention of single-loop solutions only. The second is that research and training programmes that attempt to embody Argyris' (1974) Model II theory-in-use will be more effective for developing conditions where a new set of skills can be produced as well (double-loop learning).</field><field name="date">1985</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2270</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Images of society in New Zealand writing an examination of the social concerns of New Zealand writers, 1960-1970</field><field name="creator">Volkerling, Michael</field><field name="description">Every writer works within a particular social contest which influences the way in which he apprehends and attributes value to the experience he represents in his work. This influence does not promote an absolute uniformity of outlook among writers, nor does it necessarily limit the formal possibilities open to them: rather it predisposes writers to favour arguments or experiences that confirm certain ways of seeing society which, though they may vary in their emphases, are still contained within identifiable parameters. It is possible to describe the nature of the culture of any period by defining the &#8216;structure of feeling&#8217; shared by writers &#8211; that blend of theories and assumptions which constitutes the organising vision through which their social concerns and aesthetic ideals achieve a formal reconciliation. With the novel, this structure of feeling may be identified by attempting to locate the point of vision of the writer as it is stated in terms of social reality. For what is seen and rendered in the novel represents  an interpretation of social reality, an image of society, stated in terms of the structure of feeling prevailing during the period in which the writer is working. The purpose of this present study is to relate these general principles to a consideration of literature in New Zealand concentrating on work produced between 1960 and 1970. To do so necessarily involves an order, firstly, to define the values which are held in common within the New Zealand literary tradition &#8211; that is to say, the structure of feeling which prevails here &#8211; and secondly, to discover how the themes which are treated most consistently during this decade are subsequently developed, or, alternatively, resist development. An associated purpose is to identify the themes which recur in the work of writers whose approach to literature, and the forms they choose, are otherwise very different; to illustrate the origin of these common concerns in the structure of feeling which informs literary culture in New Zealand; and to show how that structure is expressed in relation to the new experiences and phenomena encountered here as a result of the rapid social change which has occurred during the 1960s. The argument of this study is developed mainly through an examination of prose fiction, in particular the work of Frank Sargeson, Noel Hilliard, Janet Frame, Maurice Duggan, Maurice Gee, and Maurice Shadbolt. Criticism and occasional writing &#8211; particularly that found in popular magazines &#8211; is also referred to. What should be conclusively demonstrated is the extent to which the structure of feeling which informs New Zealand literature has been rendered obsolete by recent rapid changes in New Zealand society; that the assumptions about society implicit in this structure of feeling prevent the writer from fully apprehending the nature of his experience; and that if literature here is to remain a valuable source of social knowledge, new ways of seeing &#8211; and new forms which can effectively express them &#8211; must be developed.</field><field name="date">1975</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420100 Language Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2271</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Andr&#233; Malraux: &#201;volution de la pens&#233;e et constance du mythe profond</field><field name="creator">McGillivray, Hector</field><field name="description">The first three chapters of this thesis deal with the development of Andr&#233; Malraux's thought in the fields of politics, culture and aesthetics. In the light of Marxist thought, the writer's work as a whole shows a conception of history as fundamentally irrational and non-progressive, governed by existential forces such as the passions of nationalism and class feeling, denounced by Julien Benda. Against History as Fate, Malraux appeals ultimately to the will to consciousness, whose chosen field of expression is art, Malraux's recourse amidst a dying Western culture. The final chapter of this thesis concerns the images that haunt Malraux's work, and sets up a model of the myth underlying the conscious thought of the writer. This 'personal myth' throws light on the writer's inner world, and on the direction his intellectual thought took. Consequently, the theological function of art in Malraux's aesthetical conception stems from his unconscious personality, which gives a profound meaning and unity to the contradictions apparent in the writer.</field><field name="date">1979</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420100 Language Studies::420108 French</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2272</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nuclear arms control negotiation with special reference to New Zealand and the comprehensive Test Ban Treaty</field><field name="creator">Wilson-Roberts, Guy</field><field name="description">In 1996, at a special session of the United Nations General Assembly, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) was opened for signature. Within one week, seventy states, including all five nuclear-weapon states, signed the Treaty. This brought to an end fifty years of both nuclear tests and nuclear test-ban negotiations. For many states, the achievement of the CTBT was a major success for nuclear arms control. New Zealand played an important role in the early stages of the CTBT negotiation. Every year from 1972, New Zealand and Australia tabled a resolution in the General Assembly calling for a CTBT. After two decades of diplomacy, the resolution was adopted by consensus in 1993, allowing negotiation for a CTBT to take place in the Conference on Disarmament. Substantive negotiation for a CTBT began in 1993, but test-ban negotiations had been taking place almost since the start of nuclear testing in 1945. Like many other nuclear arms control issues, the negotiations had been dominated by the United States and the Soviet Union. Engaged in their own nuclear arms race, the two superpowers pursued their own bilateral nuclear arms control negotiations to manage their strategic relationship. Until the CTBT negotiation, multilateral nuclear arms control was mostly limited to the Treaty for the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). The NPT reflected the desire of many non-nuclear states to become involved in nuclear arms control and use multilateral agreements to place obligations on the nuclear-weapon states. While both bilateral and multilateral nuclear arms control often languished due to disagreements, multilateral nuclear arms control negotiation has also dealt with the complexity of reconciling the perspectives of many states. This complexity has made the use of negotiation theories difficult, although if used pragmatically, theory can be a useful tool for the study of negotiation events. Through the test-ban resolution, New Zealand was able to contribute to the process of reaching consensus by acting as a facilitator. New Zealand is a good example of how a small non-nuclear state can make a useful contribution in multilateral nuclear arms control negotiation, typically dominated by large nuclear-weapon states, and still advance its national interests.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360100 Political Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2274</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regulation and functional significance of ATP binding cassette transporters in human placenta</field><field name="creator">Evseenko, Denis</field><field name="description">The aim of this project was to study ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters in the human placenta, in particular their regulation and role in trophoblast differentiation and survival. The presence and localisation of four major placental drug transporters, multidrug resistance gene product 1 and 3 (MDR1 and 3)/ABC subfamily B members 1 and 4 (ABCB1 and 4), multidrug resistance associated proteins 1 and 2 (MRP1 and 2)/ABCC1 and 2 and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP)/ABCG2 was initially studied in term human placenta, cultured primary trophoblast and BeWo and Jar trophoblast-like cell lines. Jar cells were found to be more similar to nondifferentiated cytotrophoblast with respect to their ABC protein expression profile, whereas BeWo cells more closely reflected differentiated syncytiotrophoblast. Treatment of primary term trophoblasts in vitro with cytokines (TNF-&#61537; or IL-1&#61538;) decreased expression and activity of apical transporters ABCB1/MDR1 and ABCG2/BCRP. Growth factors, on the other hand, increased BCRP expression and activity, while estradiol stimulated BCRP, MDR1 and MDR3 expression MDR1/3 functional activity. The ability of BCRP/ABCG2 to abrogate the apoptotic effects of TNF-&#61537; and ceramides was studied in primary trophoblast and BeWo cells using pharmacological and molecular (siRNA) approaches. The results suggest that BCRP/ABCG2 contributes to the resistance of trophoblast cells to cytokine-induced (extrinsic) apoptosis, whereas its effects on apoptosis activated via the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway is minimal. This altered resistance was associated with increased intracellular accumulation of ceramides and reduced ability to maintain phosphatidylserine in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. A role for BCRP/ABCG2 in cell protection from differentiation-induced stressors was also demonstrated during the process of cell fusion associated with transient loss of plasma membrane lipid asymmetry. Finally, expression of BCRP/ABCG2 (and 9 other genes) was studied in 50 placentas from normal pregnancy and pregnancies complicated with fetal growth restriction (FGR). A marked reduction of BCRP/ABCG2 and MDR1/ABCB1 expression was observed in FGR placentas, while other transporter genes were unaffected. Collectively these data suggest that BCRP/ABCG2 and probably other ABC transporters may play a hitherto unrecognised survival role in the placenta, conferring a &#8220;stress resistance&#8221; to trophoblast cells.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Placenta</field><field name="subject">ABC transporters</field><field name="subject">Apoptosis</field><field name="subject">Differentiation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2348</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A novel mucin-desulfating sulfate-6-N-acetylglucosaminidase (sulfoglycosidase) from the anaerobic colonic bacterium Prevotella strain RS2</field><field name="creator">Rho, Jung-hyun</field><field name="description">Sulfate removal from sulfomucin is believed to be a rate-limiting step in sulfomucin degradation by bacteria from the digestive tract. A novel sulfomucin-desulfating enzyme has been discovered in the anaerobic bacterium, Prevotella strain RS2, which can grow on colonic mucin as its sole energy source. The enzyme, located in the periplasm, was assayed by measuring p-nitrophenol removal from the model substrate sulfate-6-N-acetylglucosamine-1-p-nitrophenol, sulfate-6-N-acetylglucosamine being the other product. This activity differs from that of sulfatases which remove the sulfate ester group from sulfate-6-N-acetylglucosamine and its analogues substituted at the Cl position. The enzyme has been termed a sulfate-6-N-acetylglucosaminidase or sulfoglycosidase (SGL). The SGL was purified to a single protein band of 100 kDa as analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The purified SGL protein was trypsin-digested and peptide fragments were sequenced. PCR and inverse PCR were then used to amplify the entire sg/ gene from Prevotella strain RS2 genomic DNA. After inserting the gene into a suitable plasmid, active recombinant SGL was expressed using an Escherichia coli expression system. The SGL was characterized using a selection of model substrates, and shown to be an exo-enzyme that removes non-reducing terminal sulfate-6-N-acetylglucosamine residues by glycosidic bond cleavage. When tested against its putative physiological substrate, sulfomucin, the only small molecular size product detected corresponded to a sulfate-6-N-acetylglucosamine residue. Thus the SGL can catalyze a reaction, formerly thought to be performed in bacteria by the combined actions of a N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfatase and a N-acetylglucosaminidase. Inhibition studies on the SGL were carried out. Inhibitors of the SGL and those of the sulfatases were used to confirm the presence or absence of SGL-like activity in other bacteria that inhabit environments containing sulfomucin. Four isolates, including Prevotella strain RS2, of the thirteen strains tested, appeared to have SGL-like activity. This research on the SGL with its novel catalytic activity, suggests a new mechanism by which sulfomucin desulfation can occur. The physiological importance of the enzyme is postulated to be (i) to provide energy in the form of sulfate-6-N-acetylglucosamine, for the bacterium, (ii) to remove sulfate-6-N-acetylglucosamine groups present on mucin chains, thus creating or removing sites for different adhesins, and (iii) removal of inhibitory sulfate-6-N-acetylglucosamine groups from mucin chains that limit degradation of the chain by exoglycosidases and neuraminidases.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2275</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Human resource management in Chinese-western joint ventures</field><field name="creator">Chen, Shaohui, 1966-</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2277</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tryst Tropique: Pacific Texts, Modern Sexualities</field><field name="creator">Wallace, Leonelle</field><field name="description">Tryst Tropique questions some of the assumptions that have been made about the heterosexual trajectory described by European desire as it has informed literary, artistic and anthropological representation of the South Pacific. It reads a series of contact encounters and Pacific residencies for their unfolding of European sexual inscription and discovers their inevitable entanglement with problematics of homosexual definition. This thesis arcs between two readings wherein the sexual conduct of Polynesian men both requires and escapes European definition. The first, which settles on the documents of Cook's third voyage, uses British indifference to Hawaiian sodomitical desire to help measure a representational space from whence the European homosexual will emerge (Chapter Two). The next reading considers the erotics of male visibility legible across a number of Marquesan contact texts including Herman Melville's Typee (Chapter Three). Chapter Four discovers that the suspicion of sodomitical misconduct which clouded the career of William Yate, an early nineteenth-century New Zealand missionary, continues to involve twentieth-century commentators in the interpretative dynamics of sexual entrapment. Chapter Five turns to Gauguin's Tahitian writings and paintings to engage with the place of ambivalence in contemporary analyses of colonial discourse. Chapter Six extends the parameters of the thesis in terms of gender and of geography, taking up the controversy generated by Derek Freeman around the early Samoan fieldwork of Margaret Mead. It argues that in the example of Mead's career, we can observe the way in which female sexuality acts as the cipher by which culture multiplies and maintains ignorances and knowledges across the discursive field of sex in both cosmopolitan and primitive locations. The final chapter, which analyses a contemporary documentary representation of Samoan fa'afafine, finds the pertinence or applicability of European sexual description to Polynesian behaviour again at stake, though now we find that the liberal gesture of cultural relativism is co-optable to a homophobia already drilled and proficient in erecting a difference without to forestall a difference within. Reading against the grain of much postcolonial work on the South Pacific, Tryst Tropique finds that it is the male body-whether native or European-not the female, which provides the sexual vanishing point which structures many of these narratives. In each of these Pacific moments a privileged figuration occurs: the body which stands as a placemarker for erotic capacities-both indulged and forsworn-is indicatively male. These inscriptions of masculinity betray a certain amplifying anxiety; the discrepant sexual availabilities recorded in each text break with increasing urgency on the shore of heterosexual and homosexual definition. Even as these Pacific journal keepers, these writers and artists, map identity more and more ferociously onto the known grid of gender, it seems as if the horizon of sexual certainty further and further recedes.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420200 Literature Studies::420203 Literatures of the Pacific</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::379900 Other Studies In Human Society::379902 Indigenous studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2279</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Madness, media &amp; mental illness: a social constructionist approach</field><field name="creator">Nairn, Raymond George Ross</field><field name="description">Background Depictions of mental illnesses in the mass media have been analysed and criticised for more than forty years with little improvement, and that has serious implications for the ongoing efforts to destigmatise both mental illnesses and those who suffer from them. Aims To examine media depictions of mental illnesses within a social constructionist framework. To identify why media depictions take the form they do and to indicate ways in which such practices may be more effectively addressed. Method Items chosen from factual media genres were subjected to discourse analysis. This form of analysis attends to the preferred meaning of the items and how that meaning is constructed within the item. Exemplars of such analysis are contrasted with the content analyses more commonly performed on media materials before reporting analyses of items from everyday media reports and of materials that were expected to be less stigmatising. Results Irrespective of the form of analysis it is found that media depictions of mental illnesses are dominated by representations of dangerousness, criminal violence, unpredictability, and social incompetence. The same features were found in a destigmatisation documentary and a series of backgrounders on mental health services, in both of which madness was utilised to create interest and drama. It is argued that these characteristics occur because media personnel, like most laypersons, represent mental illnesses as forms of madness. Conclusions That my social constructionist analysis is able to account for the lack of change in media depictions over forty years. That the preference for a public mental health approach to destigmatisation is misplaced because it is unable to address the fear generated by lay understandings of mental illnesses. That the attempt to avoid conflation of the person with the disorder in Diagnostic and Statistical Manuals beginning in 1980 was an inadequate step in an appropriate direction in that it sought to remind clinicians that a mental disorder does not make a person non-human. The thesis findings are interpreted as showing that destigmatisation requires a new way of depicting mental illnesses, one that privileges the individual's experience and their ordinary humanness.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2280</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Edition of the Book of Sovereign Medicines MS X3346</field><field name="creator">Lalor, Daphne E. (Daphne Elaine)</field><field name="description">This thesis is an edition of a manuscript of medical remedies, MS X3346 (now stored in the Alexander Turnbull Library in Wellington) which belongs to the Medical Historical Society of the Auckland branch of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians. The manuscript is one of five known copies of a compilation by a sixteenth century Benedictine monk, John of Feckenham, who became Abbot of Westminster during the reign of Mary Tudor. In the dedication to the manuscripts, which is almost identical in each, the Abbot states that 'This Book of Sovereign Medicines' Named for convenience throughout this edition, 'The Book of Sovereign Medicines' was collected by him for 'the poor who have not at all times the learned physicians at hand'. The scribal handwriting, and the names of various people in MS X3346, indicate that it was penned between 1665 and 1675, or about seventy-five years after Feckenham's death. Research into the life of the compiler was undertaken, as was an overview of the medical ideas of the period, together with a study of the popular genre of which the Abbot's work was an example. Also included in this thesis is a Provenance of the manuscript, a description of its state, a comparison of it with the other known copies, and the story of its donation to the Medical Historical Society. A transcript of the manuscript was prepared, maintaining the scribal spelling, punctuation and capitalization as accurately as possible. Following this, a modernized version was made, aiming at a readable text. The layout of the original manuscript and the transcript was maintained as far as possible, to facilitate keying of annotations and comments to the text. The Oxford English Dictionary was used as the standard for spelling and grammar, and an attempt was made to conform to the principles used by Stanley Wells and Gary Taylor in the compact edition of Shakespeare's Complete Works. A glossary was prepared defining herbs, ingredients, medical terms and so on. Annotations to the remedies indicate the same or similar examples in other works, especially in the Folger edition of 'This Booke of Sovereigne Medicines' (edited by E.R.Macgill in 1990). Also in the annotations are explanations of words and phrases specific to a remedy, and identification of many of the people mentioned in the work. Quotations from authors of the time of Chaucer to the modern day are included in the glossary and annotations to help define and illustrate medical terms and ingredients perhaps not familiar today. Early herbals were studied, especially those of William Turner and John Gerard. As Eleanour Sinclair Rohde (The Old English Herbals, p.98) has pointed out, Gerard was justly condemned by critics of his own time as well as modern ones for 'having used Dr Priest's translation of Dodoen's &#9090;Pemptades&#9089; without acknowledgement'. Nevertheless, this editor, like Rohde, has found such pleasure in Gerard&#8217;s delightful language, his descriptions of plants, with their habitats and their virtues, that many quotations from his Herball have been included. There is an index of authors and quotations, and also a general index to the contents of the modern version.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420100 Language Studies::420101 English</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2281</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gendered Resistance: A Comparative Study of Four Twentieth-Century Women&#8217;s Autobiographies</field><field name="creator">Baisn&#233;e, Val&#233;rie</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420100 Language Studies::420101 English</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2282</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Currie Commission and Report on Education in New Zealand 1960-1962</field><field name="creator">Scott, David John, 1946-</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates and analyses the Report of the Commission on Education in New Zealand,1962, also known as the 'Currie Report', paying particular attention to the policy process surrounding the written and oral submissions. Views expressed during the submissions and their ideological basis are related to wider power relationships within society. The submissions emanating from outside the Department of Education are revisited as well as the departmental submissions to establish whether there are any grounds to challenge the consensual, liberal interpretations that have been attached to this important New Zealand historical educational document. The issues raised and avoided in the submissions coalesce around specific themes, which are related to the broader issues of the development of New Zealand educational history. Attempts to counteract, mute and marginalise dissent and to encourage optimal social control are witnessed in the organizational structure of the commission and in its methods. The interaction and networking of key participants is studied and the important inter-relationship between central bureaucratic interventions and powerful educational pressure group activity points to the continuing operational success of central government processes. The often competing forces of provincialism and centralism in New Zealand education underlie many of the conflicts surrounding educational change. Religion, race, gender and class are forces that continually interact to create legitimation crises. The governmental attempt to minimise or at least rationalize these socially contested differences in education from 1960-1962 is the subject of this thesis. An analysis is made of the process by which public dissatisfaction regarding education in the fifties and sixties was mediated and largely marginalised by the educational bureaucracy. This is done by a thorough examination of the interaction of pressure groups, unions, media and governmental agencies during the two year submissions to the Commission on Education 1962. The distinction between the commission's report and the submissions and interrogations leading up to the report is important, as the primary data extracted from the primary resource material in the submissions, at times, contradicts the departmental view as expressed in the report itself. In this way it is hoped to move beyond the rhetoric that informs previous commentaries and move closer to an interpretation based upon the primary data.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2283</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"For a season quite the rage?" : ships and flourmills in the Ma&#772;ori economy 1840-1860s</field><field name="creator">Petrie, Hazel, 1949-</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2284</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Critique of the Influence of Sustainable Development on Ecological Sustainability: A New Zealand Application</field><field name="creator">Knight-Lenihan, Stephen</field><field name="description">This thesis proposes a method to critique whether introducing sustainable development concepts into a planning process enables decision-makers to effectively address ecological sustainability. The method is trialed by assessing the adoption of sustainable development concepts by the central Government of New Zealand. A Sustainable Development Assessment Framework is proposed, allowing users to judge what kind of sustainable development is being applied and, consequently, how ecological issues are likely to be assessed against economic and social needs. An Ecological Assessment Matrix is also proposed. This identifies the key ecological issues that need to be addressed, and suggests the management responses required to address them. The key issues identified are: ecosystem disturbance, modification and fragmentation; the accumulation and synergistic effects of contaminants; the accumulation of physical change on ecosystems; and biodiversity decline. In combination, the Framework and Matrix assist in making judgments as to whether and how the ecological sustainability component of sustainable development is being addressed. A critique is then undertaken of the New Zealand Government&#8217;s Economic Transformation environmental sustainability actions/action areas and, in more detail, the influence of introducing sustainable development requirements into the transport sector. The critique includes reviewing aspects of resource management and local government legislation. The focus is on the adoption of sustainable development concepts from the year 2000. Conceptually, ecosystem sustainability is increased by halting or reversing the negative trends associated with the key ecological issues. This contributes to creating robust social-ecological systems. Whether and how sustainable development is addressed is influenced by existing ecosystem resilience (a system&#8217;s ability to cope with perturbations, including development), the ability of human society to influence resilience (society&#8217;s adaptability), and the capacity to create a fundamentally new system when economic, ecological or social conditions require it (transformability). The critique process contributes to assessing ecosystem resilience and a society&#8217;s level of adaptability. It concludes that incorporating sustainable development concepts has enabled decision-makers to address the key terrestrial and freshwater ecological issues in ways that were not available prior to the concepts being adopted. However, analysis also indicates the guiding rationale for decision-makers remains economic, despite intentions to the contrary. This suggests that existing net negative ecological trends may continue. Indigenous biodiversity is a particular case in point. Relevant guidelines and goals are required to address this situation. Also, while ecological issues could be addressed through the Resource Management Act 1991, other research demonstrates the intent of the Act has not been realized. Contributory reasons include a failure to adequately resource key central government agencies and local government. These barriers need to be addressed to ensure the potential benefits of the sustainable development process are realized across all applicable legislation. The observations above are provisional. The Framework and Matrix proposed now need to be applied at the local government level, in co-ordination with research being done by others, to test whether some of these indicative barriers are being addressed locally. In connection with this, an Epilogue is included in this thesis. It outlines how community-led sustainable development could complement initiatives at the central Government level. It uses the need to integrate biodiversity management into &#8216;working&#8217; environments as an example of how this could operate.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3076</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Alienated by Evolution: The Educational Implications of Creationist and Social Darwinist Reactions in New Zealand to the Darwinian Theory of Evolution</field><field name="creator">Peddie, Bill</field><field name="description">This investigation explores the reactions to Darwinism in the format and informal education of New Zealand society. The subsidiary purpose is to look at some implications for formal education. Many of the reactions have focussed on distortions of the Darwinian theory of evolution with the form of reaction to Darwinism being centred on different views of humankind. The various group interests have caused different aspects of Darwinism to be highlighted particularly when groups feel their interests are under threat. Using aspects of an "HS3" historical survey technique i.e. the history of the public reaction to an aspect of science and science teaching, key features of this debate are set in context. This context is then used to show that creationist objections and social Darwinian interpretations share many characteristics with their overseas counterparts. A philosophical analysis of the positions taken supports a charge that New Zealand creationist science is partly non science, and partly bad science. It is also shown that confusion has been created when groups have debated issues from different perspectives including cultural perspectives. In particular there has been a lack of communication as various creationist groups, using different research bases, and political, economic and legal institutions, have adopted generalist conservative positions, highlighted metaphysical and ethical considerations and drawn on creationist science literature to support the science of their case while pro-evolutionist groups have adopted specialist liberal or progressive positions, concentrated on the logic and epistemology of the debate and have drawn on mainstream science literature. Finally some implications have been drawn from this analysis of the different reactions, and recommendations have been made for future teaching of evolution and related concepts.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2286</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tokelauan syntax studies in the sentence structure of a Polynesian language</field><field name="creator">Sharples, Peter R.</field><field name="description">A fairly comprehensive treatment of the main features of Tokelauan sentence structure is the central aim. The syntactic analysis is presented within a framework which is an adaptation of Chomsky's 'Standard Theory' but special consideration is given to the problem of squaring a grammar based on formal evidence with a functionally-based analysis of sentences. The principal modification to the Standard Theory is the readoption of kernel sentences and generalized transformations, i.e. a partial reversion to the transformational model proposed in Chomsky's Syntactic Structures. Thus, the output of the base rules is a set of simple sentence structures, with no embeddings. The treatment of other aspects of Tokelauan included in this analysis are described below in a brief synopsis of each chapter. Chapter 1 is introductory, serving to locate the language, place and the people of Tokelau. Previous discussions of the position of Tokelauan within the Polynesian group are reviewed, and a basic vocabulary list is provided together with Cognate percentages shared by Tokelauan of Samoan, Nanumean Ellice and Sikaiana. The aims and scope of this analysis are then discussed in the context of a brief survey of earlier syntactic studies of Polynesian languages, and of the various grammatical models applied to Polynesian or developed in recent theoretical work on syntax and semantics. Chapters 2 and 3 are essentially referential, presenting lists of all the grammatical elements and rules to be discussed in later chapters. Chapter 2 has two parts. In Part 1 the segmental phonemes of Tokelauan are described, along with the practical problems associated with the choice of orthographic symbols. In Part 2 the functor (grammatical) morphemes of Tokelauan are listed and their uses exemplified. Chapter 3 lists the categorial rules of the base component and some transformational rules. Chapters 4-6 discuss evidence for and against the formal analysis outlined in 3. Chapter 4 treats the major categorial (phrase structure) rules, stating the procedures used to determine immediate constituents, and defending potentially controversial parts of the analysis against alternatives. Formal and functional analyses are made independently, then compared. In Chapter 5, certain transformational rules of Tokelauan are examined with illustrative examples. The final chapter is in two distinct but related parts. First the grounds on which Hohepa based his ergative-accusative classification of Polynesian languages are summarised, and reviewed in relation to the evidence of Tokelauan. One result is a rejection of the concepts of direct object (and so, of transitivity) and of an active-passive transformation a s significant grammatical relations in Tokelauan. The later sections examine certain functional relations associated with the constituent analysis of sentences particularly the functions of case markers. This exercise provides a framework for verb classification in Tokelauan.</field><field name="date">1976</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370300 Anthropology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2288</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Writing home to her mother and father: Fabrizia Ramondino&#8217;s Althe&#769;nopis and Clara Sereni&#8217;s Casalinghitudine</field><field name="creator">Green, Paula, 1955-</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted at the request of the author.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420100 Language Studies::420110 Italian</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2290</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Productivity improvement in the New Zealand heavy engineering industry</field><field name="creator">Seidel, R.

They are united by an emphasis on the relation between linguistic forms and communicative functions, and in particular on the semantics and pragmatics of grammatical categories. Chapter 1, 'Outline of the main structures of Tokelauan' forms a background for the more intensive studies of later chapters. After short sections on phonology, morphology and word classes, I describe the composition of noun phrases and verb phrases, the pronoun system, and the internal structure and semantics of nominalisations. The final two sections cover a number of aspects of the structure of the simple sentence, including predicate types, verb classes, and clause types, and review the main types of complex sentence. Chapter 2, &#8217;Tense and aspect', presents a discourse-based analysis of this area of syntax. Section 1 outlines the theoretical basis of the analysis of Tokelauan tense-aspect categories which is presented in the following two sections. I then extend the analysis to a particular discourse type, oral Tokelauan narrative. The final section takes a typological approach, considering whether the particle kua can be regarded as a member of a cross-linguistic category of Perfect. Chapter 3, &#8216;The discourse functions of focus constructions&#8217;, looks at a number of Tokelauan constructions involving clause-initial noun phrases which clearly have the pragmatic force of focusing, but in some of which the distribution of given and new information is not of the expected kind. Since clause-initial noun phrases are used for other discourse functions which can be grouped under the heading of topicalisation, the chapter concludes with some comments on this matter in section 2. Chapter 4, &#8216;The syntax of complementation&#8217;, attempts in the first three sections a comprehensive description of Tokelauan complement types and of the semantic classes of complement-taking predicates. Section 4 is concerned with the syntax and semantics of complementizers, and sections 5 with reduced complements of the kind which have been associated with the terms equi-deletion and raising. The final section assesses the overall nature of the Tokelauan complementation system.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2292</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Flowering in ryegrass and conservation of the photoperiodic response</field><field name="creator">Gagic, Milan, 1971-</field><field name="description">Grasslands account for almost one quarter of the world&#8217;s cover of vegetation. Almost three quarter of the world&#8217;s milk, beef and veal are produced from temperate grasslands. In New Zealand, ryegrass (Lolium perenne) is the main pasture constituent with more than half of the total export revenue coming from grass-related products. Much of ryegrass production and quality depends on the timing of flowering through seasonal progression. In many plants, day length is the critical environmental parameter that controls when plants begin to flower. In Arabidopsis the CONSTANS (CO) gene mediates day length response. Upstream of CO is the GIGANTEA (GI) gene which is associated with the circadian clock mechanism and is required to promote CO expression. The FT gene is the immediate downstream genetic target of CO and is a direct promoter of flowering. In this study, cDNA libraries, sequence alignment and genome walking were used to sequence and describe three putative orthologues from the ryegrass photoperiod pathway: LpGI, LpCOL1, and LpFT3. All three behaved in a true photoperiod manner characterised by cycling expression patterns under continuous light conditions and differential expression patterns in LD and SD conditions. Different photoperiods brought about differences in expression of these genes measured either by the phase shift change (LpGI and LpCOL1) or by the change of the transcript level (LpFT3). Gene expression changes over a vernalisaton time course were also analysed and results indicated that LpFT3 acts as the flowering integrator. The role of LpGI, LpCOL1, and LpFT3 as putative photoperiod genes was further confirmed by genetic mapping, which placed them on linkage groups 3, 6, and 7, respectively. The syntenic positions in rice contain major heading date quantitative trait loci. The function of LpFT3 was examined by over-expressing the gene in Arabidopsis under control of the cauliflower mosiac virus (CaMV) 35S promoter. Substantially higher expression of the endogenous Arabidopsis AtFT transcript was observed in the mutated ft-1 line overexpressing LpFT3, suggesting a positive feedback loop either directly or through upstream intermediaries. Overexpression of the LpGI and LpFT3 genes restored rapid flowering to the respective gi-3 and ft-1 Arabidopsis mutants while overexpression of LpCOL1 did not accelerate flowering either in co-2 or wild type Arabidopsis plants. However, overexpression of LpCOL1 completely restored the late flowering phenotype of the gi-3 mutant indicating the existence of another important link outside the well established hierarchy of GI-CO-FT in the photoperiod pathway. This study revealed that the ryegrass photoperiod pathway genes show high similarity to their wheat, rice and Arabidopsis counterparts. Exploring ways to modulate flowering time in ryegrass could provide major benefits to the agricultural industry by increasing forage quality, controlling seed and pollen production, and addressing potential problems linked with climate change.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">flowering</field><field name="subject">ryegrass</field><field name="subject">photoperiod</field><field name="subject">molecular</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2424</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Governing bodies: a Maori healing tradition in a bicultural state</field><field name="creator">O'Connor, Tony, 1972-</field><field name="description">Biculturalism is a relationship in government between the British Crown and the indigenous [M&#257;ori] people of New Zealand. I show that this relationship permeated some M&#257;ori healing practitioners&#8217; healing knowledge and perception. A key way in which this occurred was through the practitioners recognizing biological and social boundaries between M&#257;ori and P&#257;keh&#257; [New Zealanders of European descent]. A second was through the practitioners&#8217; embodiment of connections with social groups including the nation, a history and present shared between M&#257;ori and P&#257;keh&#257; and an idealized pre-contact past. A fundamental principle of Te Oo Mai Reia was that for the practitioners to harness the power of the various forces that sustained life they had to be in touch with their whakapapa [genealogy] for it was through their ancestors that they could commune with the Ultimate Deity, Io, the source of the most potent of all forces of life. A further key principle was that spiritually inspired and traditional M&#257;ori culture heightened the wellbeing of M&#257;ori, not modern, P&#257;keh&#257; culture. Spiritual and ancient knowledge was supra-conscious and made knowable through an embodied awareness of self and other. To make my argument I draw on literature inspired by Foucault that shows how states govern by implementing their operations and securing their penetration into the citizenry by drawing and building upon pre-existing bodies of knowledge and relations of power. I also draw on literature that shows how the human body bears the effects of such practices of government. To this literature I integrate perception by showing how, in this M&#257;ori healing context, the government of the bicultural nation-state worked through the ways the practitioners made sense with the body (especially through feeling, seeing and touching).</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">healing</field><field name="subject">body</field><field name="subject">medical anthropology</field><field name="subject">governmentality</field><field name="subject">embodiment</field><field name="subject">perception</field><field name="subject">biculturalism</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2327</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on Cell Membrane Ultrastructure, and the use of the Freeze-Fracturing Technique in Electron Microscopy</field><field name="creator">Chalcroft, James Paul</field><field name="description">1) The Ultrastructural appearance of frozen-fractured mouse liver cell membranes, and consistent variations in the distribution of membrane-associated particles caused by various pretreatments as described by previous investigators, were confirmed in this study. 2) Freeze fracturing, was evaluated as a method for studying the ultrastructure of single celled microorganisms. Large prokaryotes with previously undescribed morphologies were investigated using freeze fracturing, thin sectioning, and negative staining techniques. 3) Structures thought to represent flagellar attachment sites were demonstrated in frozen fractured bacterial preparations for the first time. 4) A previously undescribed level of cell organization was discovered in a rumen organism classified morphologically as Selenomonas. 5) A technique was devised to retrieve replicas from both sides of the fracture of a single frozen-fractured specimen. The results obtained by its use support the theory that frozen cell membranes fracture along some interior plane rather than at the membrane-cytoplasm boundary. The technique also showed that the particles seen on frozen fractured membranes lie within the thickness of the membrane. 6) For determination of the third dimension in freeze fracture replicas, i.e. the heights of various features, an alternative method to stereoscopy was devised. This method, which can be made semiautomatic in execution, involves microdensitometry of electron micrograph negatives and certain mathematical manipulation of the optical density data.</field><field name="date">1971</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2306</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adolescent Sexual Offender Treatment Programmes in New Zealand: A Process Evaluation</field><field name="creator">Geary, Jan Elizabeth.</field><field name="description">Adolescent sex offenders are recognised as perpetrating a significant proportion of all sexual abuse in our communities. The results of extensive research in this area have clarified many intervention issues and this has led to the development and implementation of treatment programmes aimed specifically at adolescents. Notwithstanding the publication of a small number of outcome studies, process evaluations of treatment programmes for this client group have not featured in the literature. This dissertation presents the findings of a process evaluation of the three main community based adolescent sexual offender treatment programmes in New Zealand. The evaluation aimed to investigate how the programmes worked so that their strengths and weaknesses could be identified. The findings provided the basis for recommendations aimed at improving service delivery and programme effectiveness. Qualitative methods were employed with data being obtained from in-depth interviews with key stakeholders, direct observation and written documentation across three sites. Results indicate (a) high levels of consumer satisfaction with the programmes; (b) the importance of providing flexible and integrated approaches to treatment; (c) engagement in treatment was facilitated by the quality of the client-therapist relationship, family involvement, culturally appropriate communication, and creative and physical activities; (d) the importance of providing clients with good pre-entry information to reduce barriers to participation; (e) recognition should be given to issues of cultural difference by ensuring cultural services for ethnic minorities are integrated into all levels of programme delivery; (f) the importance of building strong interagency collaborations and public relations; and (g) the importance of strong organisational structure and leadership support for staff. The results are discussed in terms of programme improvement in the New Zealand context as well as their application to programme development and improvement in other settings.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2420</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Diagnostic writing assessment: the development and validation of a rating scale</field><field name="creator">Knoch, Ute</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420100 Language Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2343</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Migrating genders: westernisation, migration, and Samoan fa'afafine</field><field name="creator">Schmidt, Johanna Mary</field><field name="description">This thesis is an investigation of how fa&#8217;afafine identities are constructed, maintained, and changed in the contexts of contemporary Samoa and New Zealand. Fa&#8217;afafine are biological Samoan males who, to varying degrees, enact feminised gender identities. In existent representations, fa&#8217;afafine tend to be interpreted through western conceptualisations of sex/gender/sexuality, or using models of &#8216;primitivism&#8217;, which locate them as instantiations of expressions of gender or sexuality that are more &#8216;natural&#8217; than those of the &#8216;civilised&#8217; west. &#8216;Traditionally&#8217;, all gender in Samoa is primarily marked through labour, although the influx of western material and discursive culture has led to a shift in emphasis on sexuality in expressions of Samoan gender. These shifts have inevitably affected how fa&#8217;afafine identities are enacted, experienced, and understood. These influences are even more marked for fa&#8217;afafine who migrate to New Zealand, who appear to go through a number of &#8216;stages&#8217; in first assimilating into western sex/gender discourses, and then asserting their unique identities as fa&#8217;afafine. However, the paths followed by individual migrants vary according to the dominant ideologies of the time. The processes by which migrant fa&#8217;afafine locate physical and social spaces in which they can enact feminine identities are outlined, which usually initially involve identifying as either &#8216;gay man&#8217; or &#8216;woman&#8217;. In order to identify explicitly as &#8216;fa&#8217;afafine&#8217; in a New Zealand context, participants must understand themselves as somewhat ambiguously gendered. Data collection has been primarily through in-depth interviews, supplemented by observation, to enable analysis of how fa&#8217;afafine themselves understand their identities and lived experiences. The particular problems outlining these processes in the light of the exigencies of cross-cultural research are discussed in the methodology chapter. The theoretical approaches underlying the thesis as a whole incorporate the perspectives of Michel Foucault, Pierre Bourdieu, and Judith Butler in understanding gender as performative and open to slippage in response to the availability of particular discourses, yet also sedimented over time in a manner which configures the body in ways which are not easily altered.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::379900 Other Studies In Human Society::379901 Gender specific studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2309</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Design and Verification of a Cryptographic Security Architecture</field><field name="creator">Gutmann, Peter</field><field name="description">A cryptographic security architecture constitutes the collection of hardware and software which protects and controls the use of encryption keys and similar cryptovariables. This thesis presents a design for a portable, flexible high-security architecture based on a traditional computer security model. Behind the API it consists of a kernel implementing a reference monitor which controls access to security-relevant objects and attributes based on a configurable security policy. Layered over the kernel are various objects which abstract core functionality such as encryption and digital signature capabilities, certificate management and secure sessions and data enveloping (email encryption). The kernel itself uses a novel design which bases its security policy on a collection of filter rules enforcing a cryptographic module-specific security policy. Since the enforcement mechanism (&amp;e kernel) is completely independent of the policy database (the filter rules), it is possible to change the behaviour of the architecture by updating the policy database without having to make any changes to the kernel itself. This clear separation of policy and mechanism contrasts with current cryptographic security architecture approaches which, if they enforce controls at all, hardcode them into the implementation, making it difficult to either change the controls to meet application-specific requirements or to assess and verify them. To provide assurance of the correctness of the implementation, this thesis presents a design and implementation process which has been selected to allow the implementation to be verified in a manner which can reassure an outsider that it does indeed function as required. In addition to producing verification evidence which is understandable to the average user, the verification process for an implementation needs to be fully automated and capable of being taken down to the level of running code, an approach which is currently impossible with traditional methods. The approach presented here makes it possible to perform verification at this level, something which had previously been classed as "beyond Al" (that is, not achievable using any known technology). The versatility of the architecture presented here has been proven through its use in implementations ranging from l6-bit microcontrollers through to supercomputers, as well as a number of unusual areas such as security modules in ATMs and cryptographic coprocessors for general-purpose computers.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2310</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Enzyme activities associated with gonadotropic hormones</field><field name="creator">Daja, Mirella Maria</field><field name="description">A structural relationship between gonadotropic hormones and certain types of enzymes has been suggested in previous studies and an investigation into the possibility of enzymatic activity associated with the gonadotropic hormones has been the primary focus of the research presented in this thesis. Partial sequence homology between human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and &#945;-chymotrypsin prompted the recent proposal of a tertiary structure of hCG using &#945;-chymotrypsin as a folding template, which suggested the possibility of intrinsic peptidase activity associated with hCG. Highly purified hCG (CR127) was assayed for enzymatic activity against a range of synthetic peptide substrates and was found to exhibit Arg-specific peptidase activity. This activity was almost completely inhibited by diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP), soybean trypsin inhibitor (STI), N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK) and to a lesser extent by N-&#945;-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK), which indicated that the observed protease activity was serine protease-like. To establish whether this activity was intrinsic to the hormone or due to contaminants, extensive purification procedures were carried out. Hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) and soybean trypsin inhibitor-affinity chromatography were found to effectively separate the protease activity from the hormone, indicating the presence of exogenous protease contaminants in the highly purified preparation of hCG. Further analysis by [3H]-DFP labelling of hCG and SDS-PAGE of the isolated contaminants revealed the presence of possible serine proteases with apparent molecular masses of 60 and 20 kD. Because serine proteases are known to stimulate cAMP production in the same target cells, it was necessary to determine the effects of the contaminating proteases on the receptor binding of hCG and cAMP production. The presence of these contaminants was found to have no apparent effect on the receptor binding capability of hCG, however the in vitro biological activity of hCG as determined by maximal cAMP production was decreased after HIC-HPLC purification of the hormone. These observations suggested that the serine protease-like contaminants contributed to the total cAMP production, thereby introducing significant error in biological assays that use hCG (CR127). The possible intrinsic enzymatic activity of hCG against its receptor as a natural substrate was further investigated. A membrane-bound receptor preparation was isolated from porcine ovaries and a receptor binding assay successfully established. The effects of hCG binding upon the membrane-bound receptor were studied and receptor proteolysis was observed. However, this proteolysis could not be definitively attributed to the actions of hCG. A purified receptor was subsequently prepared by hCG-affinity chromatography and analysed by SDS-PAGE with detection by autoradiography and silver staining. The purified receptor was found to have undergone proteolysis during the purification procedure, presumably following incubation with the hCG affinity matrix. Recent reports of the presence of homologous amino acid sequences in the active site of thioredoxin and the &#946;-subunit of the gonadotropic hormones luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and subsequent demonstration of thioredoxin-like activity associated with these hormones, prompted an investigation into the possibility of thioredoxin-like activity associated with hCG. LH, FSH and hCG were all assayed for their ability to promote reactivation of reduced and denatured RNase. Although LH was shown to be capable of reactivating reduced RNase, the level of activity detected was significantly lower than that previously reported, whereas FSH and hCG were not found to be capable of this thioredoxin-like activity. These results suggested that the previously reported thioredoxin-like activity may be due to contamination of the hormone preparation, by the ubiquitous enzyme thioredoxin. The possibility of LH possessing intrinsic dithiol-disulphide interchange activity was investigated further using [3H]-iodoacetic acid. RNase/LH were incubated in an attempt to quench a dithiol intermediate. Preliminary results suggested that the presence of LH in this reaction increased the amount of protein radiolabelled, however, the isolation of a radiolabelled dithiol intermediate which could be conclusively identified as LH was not forthcoming. Furthermore the lack of RNase reactivation activity in hCG, suggests that the putative thioredoxin-like activity of LH, if intrinsic, may not be involved in receptor activation and/or signal transduction, as hCG and LH share the same receptor and should therefore have a similar mechanism of activation.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2311</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Translation and understanding: mental models as an interface in the process of translation</field><field name="creator">Kikuchi, Atsuko</field><field name="description">This thesis discusses two characteristics of language which affect translation, using English and Japanese examples. However, the general points made in the thesis are not specific to these two languages. One characteristic of language is that it encodes particular perceptions of experience by its users. Word meaning is defined in this thesis in terms of the typical experience the language user associates with a word. Concepts for which there are no single lexical items are encoded by putting together words which the speaker thinks best characterise the concept. This particular characterisation of a concept may become established in the language community. If the members of a language community form a habit of characterising a concept in a particular way, it may become difficult to perceive the concept in any other way. In translation, this may lead the translator to impose characterizations established in her own language on the other language. However, such difficulties can be overcome because of the creative capacity of people everywhere to learn new ways to perceive the world. And language provides the mechanism to encode such novel perception. This is the other characteristic of language discussed in this thesis. We can use an existing word to encode a new kind of experience which we perceive as having some connection with the kind of experience associated with the word. Such novel application of a word can be understood because upon hearing the word, the typical experience associated with the word is evoked in the hearer's mind, and using her knowledge, the hearer constructs a mental model which she thinks best accounts for the combination of experiences evoked in her mind by the linguistic forms. Defining word meaning and sentence meaning in terms of mental images allows us to understand the process of translation: Upon hearing/reading the source language text, the translator constructs a mental model based on the text. She then bases her translation on this mental model, which becomes a rich source of information. Because the translator is not moving directly from one language to the other, no direct correspondences between the linguistic forms of the two languages need to be sought. This also explains why it is relatively easy to translate between two languages whose users share similar experiences and therefore can build similar mental models, even if the languages are typologically very different from each other.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420100 Language Studies::420115 Japanese</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2312</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Agrobacterium-mediated gene transfer into kiwifruit</field><field name="creator">Janssen, Bart-Jan</field><field name="description">A system has been developed to aid in the establishment of Agrobacterium-mediated transformation for new plant species. A series of binary vectors have been constructed that express a chimaeric &#946;-D-glucuronidase (GUS) gene in plants cells but not in bacterial cells. This feature allows GUS activity from transformed plant cells to be assayed in the presence of Agrobacterium. Preliminary experiments examined the expression of these chimaeric GUS genes in transformed petunia leaf discs. GUS expression was detectable 2 days after inoculation, peaked at 3 &#8211; 4 days and then declined; if selection was imposed expression increased again after 10 - 14 days. The amount of expression observed 4 days after inoculation correlated well with stable integration as measured by kanamycin resistance, hormone independence, and gall formation. Histochemical staining of inoculated leaf discs confirmed the transient peak of GUS expression 3 - 4 days after inoculation. Surprisingly, GUS expression was concentrated in localized zones on the circumference of the disc; within these zones essentially all the cells appeared to be expressing GUS. These results suggest that the frequency of gene transfer from Agrobacterium is extremely high within localized regions of the petunia leaf explants, but that the frequency of stable integration is several orders of magnitude lower. A reliable Agrobacterium-mediated transformation system has been established for kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa var. deliciosa cv. Hayward) by using transient expression of GUS to monitor gene transfer frequencies. In vitro culture of kiwifruit plants and conditions for regeneration of plants from leaf discs have been established. Several factors were found to improve gene transfer frequencies in kiwifruit: (i) healthy actively growing source tissue; (ii) the use of Agrobacterium strain A281; (iii) the presence of a layer of moistened filter paper between the leaf explants and the cocultivation media; and (iv) the presence of 20 &#956;M acetosyringone in both the bacterial culture media and in the cocultivation media. Pre-culture of leaf explants significantly inhibited gene transfer, particularly at the cut edge of the explants. Using the optimized transformation system, at least one transgenic plant can be regenerated from each leaf inoculated. Stable transformation frequencies have been shown to vary significantly between different binary vectors. Phenotypic, PCR, and Southern analysis has confirmed the presence of stably integrated T-DNA in several transgenic kiwifruit plants.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2313</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Namakir: a description of a central Vanuatu language</field><field name="creator">Sperlich, Wolfgang B., 1948-</field><field name="description">This is a description of the phonology, morphology and syntax of Namakir, a language of the Oceanic subgroup of Austronesian, which is spoken on some six small islands of the Shepherd Islands, central Vanuatu. My perspective on Namakir is that of a person trained in linguistics, who carried out linguistic fieldwork for the purpose of grammatical description. In addition I contributed to ethnographic work as well as compiling data for a dictionary, part of which is appended to the present description. Namakir is a conservative language which retains many features that make Oceanic languages unique. Thus it is a valuable witness for comparative and reconstructive work in Oceanic linguistics. The physical, social and historical setting of Namakir is detailed in the introductory chapter. A section on theoretical issues concerning the descriptive enterprise is included. The chapter on phonology outlines the Namakir consonant and vowel inventories, with due emphasis on the glottal stop which, as a reflex of the Proto-Oceanic glottal stop, is a unique occurence in Vanuatu languages Sections on phonotactics, stress and phonological processes add to the basic description of segments. In the chapter on morphophonemics the dynamics of derivational processes are explored. A major section deals with consonant alternation, a phenomenon widely discussed in Oceanic Linguistics. The major form classes are detailed in the next chapter. Nominals, determiners, adjectives, verbs and adverbs are established as word categories and paradigm tables are provided for comprehensive overviews. The last chapter on Namakir syntax provides a systematic description of noun phrase and verb phrase. Possessive constructions receive special attention as they exhibit a number of unusual features. The verb phrase is discussed within the framework of the Oceanic definition of verb and periphery which include subject markers as well as pronominal objects. The Namakir mood and aspectual system is presented in detail. A major section deals with serial verb constructions in relation to current descriptive theories. The concluding sections discuss selected items regarding complex sentence structures. Negation and question sentences, existential and comparative sentence types are included. Coordination together with direct and indirect speech is noted to use forms of a quotative verb, being especially significant in the organisation of narrative sequences. Relative and temporal clauses share a single overt marker. A morpheme-to-morpheme glossed narrative is appended to demonstrate narrative style. A substantial Namakir-English-Bislama wordlist is added as a repository of data collected during fieldwork.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380200 Linguistics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2314</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Children's Writing in New Zealand Newspapers, 1930s and 1980s</field><field name="creator">Holt, Jill</field><field name="description">This thesis is an investigation of writing by New Zealand children in the Children's Pages of five New Zealand newspapers: the New Zealand Herald, Christchurch Press and Otago Daily Times in the 1930s and 1980s, the Dominion in the 1930s; and the Wellington Evening Post in the 1980s. Its purpose is to show how children reflected their world, interacted with editors, and interpreted the adult world in published writing, and to examine continuities and changes between the 1930s and 1980s. It seeks evidence of gender variations in writing. and explores the circumstances in which the social role of writing was established by young writers. It considers the ways in which children (especially girls) consciously and unconsciously used public writing to create a public place for themselves. It compares major themes chosen by children, their topic and genre preferences in writing, and the gender and age differences evident in these preferences. The thesis is organised into three Parts, with an Introduction discussing the scholarly background to the issues it explores, and its methodology. Part One contains two chapters examining the format and tone of each Children's Page. And the role and influence of their Editors. Part Two (also of two chapters) investigates the origins and motivations of the young contributors, with a special focus on the Otago Daily Times as a community newspaper. Part Three. of four chapters, explores the children's writing itself, in separate chapters on younger and older children, and a chapter on the most popular genre, poetry. The conclusion suggests further areas of research, and points to the implications of the findings of the thesis for social history in New Zealand and for classroom practice. The thesis contains a Bibliography and an Appendix with a selection of writings by Janet Frame and her family to the Otago Daily Times Children's Page in the 1930s.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420200 Literature Studies::420201 New Zealand literature in English</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2315</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tamarillo mosaic potyvirus: characterization and resistance</field><field name="creator">MacDiarmid, Robin M.</field><field name="description">The export of tamarillo is an important component of the New Zealand, exotic fruit industry. However, the quality of tamarillo fruit is severely decreased by tamarillo mosaic potyvirus (TaMV) which detrimentally affects fruit colour resulting in the fruit being unacceptable on the international marketplace. Virus incidence was surveyed in four tamarillo growing regions. Viruses were detected by indicator plant symptomology, and the incidence confirmed by dot blot analysis or ELISA. TaMV was present in 100% of tamarillo trees analyzed in ten of the twelve orchards surveyed. Incidence of potato aucuba mosaic potexvirus, cucumber mosaic cucumovirus, alfalfa mosaic virus and arabis mosaic nepovirus, which had all been previously reported in tamarillo was also determined. Tomato spotted wilt tospovirus was identified for the first time in tamarillo plants in New Zealand. TaMV RNA was purified from infected tamarillo leaves and a 1600 base pair cDNA clone generated to the 3'-terminus. The clone was sequenced and the location of the gene for the coat protein was identified by direct amino-terminal sequencing of purified TaMV coat protein. Comparison with other potyvirus coat protein sequences established that TaMV represents a new member of the potyvirus group. Seven chimeric transgenes containing TaMV sequences were constructed in three different binary vectors suitable for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of plants. Of the twenty-six independent Nicotiana benthamiana plant lines generated expressing either TaMV coat protein or TaMV RNA sequences modified to block translation, eight plant lines demonstrated resistance to virus infection (more than 10% of resistant plants/line). All plants of one line, PT#25, were resistant to TaMV infection using dilute inocula; 40% were also resistant after inoculation with more concentrated inocula. The level of accumulation of CP in transgenic plant lines did not correspond with the degree of resistance to TaMV infection. In eight of the twenty-six transgenic lines a proportion of plants demonstrated recovery from systemic infection. Recovery was manifested as an absence or significant reduction of virus symptoms in newly developed leaves of plants that had previously shown symptoms of systemic TaMV infection. The mechanism of recovery from systemic infection is discussed. The protocol for the regeneration of transgenic tamarillo by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation was improved. The efficiency of transformation was optimized and the rate of transgenic shoot elongation was increased. Two tamarillo plants transformed with a transgene designed to express the TaMV coat protein were produced and were demonstrated to express the neomycin phosphotransferase gene and TaMV coat protein gene. However, following challenge with a low concentration of inoculum, micropropagants of these tamarillo plants failed to demonstrate resistance to TaMV infection. Three in vitro enzymatic activities of the virus encoded cytoplasmic inclusion protein were studied. The cytoplasmic inclusion protein was purified to near homogeneity using differential centrifugation and sucrose gradient purification. RNA-stimulated ATPase activity was demonstrated and the Km and Vmax determined. RNA binding and energy-dependent dissociation were characterized. RNA helicase activity of the cytoplasmic inclusion protein was demonstrated in the presence of NTP using RNA duplexes with single-stranded overhangs. These results have confirmed and extended the previous findings of the likely RNA helicase function of the potyvirus cytoplasmic inclusion protein, and suggest possible future mechanisms for obtaining resistance to potyviruses.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2320</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Host races and cryptic species in marine symbionts</field><field name="creator">Stevens, Peter M. (Peter Michael)</field><field name="description">The Pinnotheridae is a family of decapod crustaceans comprising more than 120 mostly microphagous and commensal species. As symbionts of a variety of aquatic invertebrates, pinnotherids typically live in an intimate association with their host depending on it for an almost lifelong source of nourishment and shelter, together with a site for mating. The New Zealand pinnotherid fauna was thought to comprise only one species, Pinnotheres novaezelandiae Filhol, associated with a multitude of hosts. Recently, however, a separate species, P. atrinicola Page, has been described which is regarded as being host specific to the horse mussel Atrina zelandica Gray. In this context, the relationship between pea crabs and their hosts is of special interest, and is the focus of this thesis. An investigation into the population dynamics of the symbiotic relationship between P novaezelandiae and its host, the green-lip mussel Perna canaliculus, at Westmere Reef, Auckland between May 1986 and July 1988 is reported. Ovigerous females and Stage I males and females were found throughout the sampling period, indicating that reproduction is continuous in this species. The developmental composition of the pea crab population reveals that soft-shelled males, usually regarded as an anomalous instar, formed a significant component of the pea crab population at all times. It is suggested that these individuals represent a distinct facies, analogous to the Stage II female instar. The presence of a pea crab was found to have a highly significant detrimental effect on mussel condition. Analysis of the distribution of pea crabs among the mussel population indicates mature crabs display a repulsed distribution favouring to live a solitary existence, whereas younger (pre-hard and Stage I) crabs showed a random distribution in broad agreement with a theoretical Poisson distribution. The biological status of the two described taxa was investigated by a survey of electrophoretically detectable genetic variation of populations from throughout the North Island of New Zealand. Pea crabs from 18 host populations from nine geographically disparate localities were subjected to cellulose acetate and poly-acrylamide electrophoresis. Forty-one enzyme systems were screened for polymorphism. Clearly resolved enzyme phenotypes were obtained at 23 presumptive loci, of which l5 exhibited polymorphism. An analysis of electromorph frequency data revealed that both taxa are highly genetically structured and typified by high levels of polymorphism and heterozygosity; results atypical of brachyuran crabs. P- atrinicola was found to exhibit strong patterns of geographic differentiation and clinal variation in electromorph frequency. Of particular significance is the pattern of genetic differentiation observed among populations of p. novaezelandiae. Hierarchical F-statistics indicated that the preponderance of inter-population differentiation can be attributed to differences in electromorph frequency among host-associated populations of P. novaezelandiae within a sampling locality. Geographic differentiation was a comparatively insignificant factor in the structuring of the sampled P. novaezelandiae populations. Individuals belonging to two genetically very distinct units were found within a newly recorded host species, Mactra ovata ovata Gray at Green and Wood Bays, Manukau Harbour. Hardy-Weinberg analyses indicate the host-associated populations of P. novaezelandiae exhibit such a pronounced pattern of homozygote excess and disturbance from genetic equilibrium in sympatry that it is unreasonable to consider them as a single panmictic population. It is concluded that significant biological discontinuities based on host origin exist within the currently recognised taxon. Such a conclusion is supported by data presented on qualitative differences in host recognition observed between different host-associated populations of P. novaezelandiae. Conservatively these discontinuities indicate host race development, although a viable alternate hypothesis would be the presence of cryptic, host-specific biological species within P. novaezelandiae. Hostrace development as found here is a well recognised phenomenon in insect-host and parasitoid-host relationships, although little studied in marine symbiotic relationships. Such a phenomenon has important implications for ecological, behavioural and physiological studies on marine symbionts in general.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2321</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of photoadaptation in the intertidal red alga Gracilaria chilensis</field><field name="creator">Stevens, Michelle Lisa Glogau</field><field name="description">The intertidal red alga, Gracilaria chilensis Bird, McLachlan et Oliveira (Rhodophyta, Gracilariales), lives in an environment in which light is highly variable in terms of both amplitude and duration. A laboratory investigation of the photophysiology of G. chilensis was conducted to assess the response of the photosynthetic apparatus to light variability characteristic of the natural environment. Freshly collected Gracilaria chilensis was found to exhibit an endogenous rhythm of photosynthesis in conditions of constant limiting light and temperature. However, such a phenomenon was not observed in saturating light. Rhythms of phycobiliprotein concentration and dark respiration were also observed but were not as well-defined and could nor account for the photosynthetic rhythm. The photosynthetic response of G. chilensis to light fluctuations of various durations (0.25 to 900 seconds) and light levels was compared to that in static light. G. chilensis was able to utilise rapidly fluctuating light (&lt; 1 second) more efficiently than fluctuations of longer duration (60-900 second). Mean photosynthetic rates were enhanced by up to l50% in fluctuating light of less than 60 sec duration over that predicted from steady-state. The photosynthetic apparatus of freshly collected G. chilensis was found to have many low-light "shade" acclimation characteristics. These included a low compensation point (5 &#181;molm-2 s-l) and onset of saturation (80 &#181;molm-2 s-l) suggesting sensitivity to photoinhibition. However, (laboratory) low-light acclimated G. chilensis was able to tolerate periods of constant high light (2000 &#181;molm-2 s-l)for periods of six hours without detectable detrimental effect on photosynthetic capacity, although photosynthetic efficiency was significantly inhibited after two hours of this treatment. The time course and characteristics of photoacclimation were determined by culturing G. chilensis in low- (15 &#181;mol m-2 s-l) and high- (180 &#181;mol m-2 s-l) light and high- and low-nitrogen regimes. The observed change in photosynthetic characteristics and pigment concentration indicated that acclimation began after a time lag of l-2 days, was complete after approximately a week and was reversible. Acclimation to growth light included changes in growth rate, P-I response curves, pigment concentration and composition and other biochemical components (e.g. carbon/nitrogen ratio). The nitrogen regime significantly affected pigment concentration in the high-light grown plants and the response suggests pigments play a role in nitrogen storage as well as light harvesting. These various physiological characteristics described above were interpreted as important mechanisms that enable G. chilensis to optimise photosynthetic response in the highly dynamic and stressful zone of the intertidal environment.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2322</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Variables affecting choice behaviour: choice behaviour and deprivation</field><field name="creator">Temple, William</field><field name="description">Pigeons were studied in concurrent chain schedules in which the terminal links were variable-interval (aperiodic) and fixed-interval (periodic) schedules. Choice was studied at various maintained percentages of body weight, (Experiment 1) and after various amounts of food had been pre-fed (Experiment 2). No effects on choice of the level of deprivation were found except in those choice conditions in which both terminal-link schedules were variable-interval schedules. Choice behaviour was further studied with equal, but increased magazine durations (Experiment 3) and no reliable effects were found. Explicit discrimination training established control over choice behaviour by the amounts pre-fed (Experiment 4) and generalisation gradiets of choice showed that this control was reliable.

An understanding of their wider context is essential to an understanding of the sites themselves, so a study is made of European artillery and fortification practice and technology from the 14th century onwards, with an emphasis on the coastal artillery practices of the British Empire in the 19th century. On this foundation, coastal fortification practices in New Zealand in the 19th century are examined, and the political background to the construction of coastal forts is outlined. The social and economic impact of the defences are studied, and the resources used in their construction detailed. Land acquisitions for the defence works in Auckland are examined. With a thorough understanding of their background and context (both national and international), Forts Resolution, Bastion, Takapuna, Victoria, Cautley and the submarine mining depots are then studied in detail, with limited excavations, extensive field survey, and the use of comprehensive archival sources. Fina1ly, it, is concluded that the forts built in Auckland between 1885 and 1925 were a product of the colonial experience, in that, they were a complex technological product of imperial demands and needs, and had little relevance to the realities and requirements of a small and remote colony 20,000 km away from the imperial centre. The thesis is a study of the &#8216;disappearing gun&#8217; period of coastal fortification, and also an acknowledgement that much of the evidence of this once socially and economically significant activity has been destroyed. To assist the reader, there is a large bibliography, and appendices containing a comprehensive glossary, a list of New zealand defence schemes from 1840 to 1914, a list of site record numbere, and biographical details of the key fort builders.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370300 Anthropology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2325</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The place of schooling in Maori-Pakeha relations</field><field name="creator">Simon, Judith A.</field><field name="description">Recognizing the continual restructuring of Pakeha-Maori relations as dominance and subordination, this thesis sets out to gain an understanding, through a critique of ideology, of the place of schooling in the securing and maintenance of those relations. Theoretically, it draws mainly upon the concept of ideology as interpreted by Jorge Larrain but also upon Gramsci's concept of hegemony, the notion of social amnesia as presented by Jacoby and the concept of resistance as developed by Giroux. It also examines the historical development of the concepts of 'race' and 'culture' which are employed ideologically to rationalize educational policies concerning the Maori. Tracing the progression of policies and practices in Maori education from the 1830s to the present day, the research shows the schooling of the Maori to have contributed significantly to the securing of Pakeha economic and political dominance in the nineteenth century and to the maintenance of that dominance through much of the twentieth century. Of particular significance has been the control of Maori access to knowledge. With Maori resistance playing a considerable part in the shaping of these policies and practices, the school is recognized as one of the sites of Maori-Pakeha struggle. Widespread underachievement of Maori within education - revealed in 1960 by the Hunn Report - is recognized as an outcome of these processes. Taking account of policies in recent years directed at improving Maori educational achievement, the thesis examines fieldwork research conducted within Auckland primary and secondary schools, in order to understand the extent to which current policies and practices of schools contribute towards overcoming the asymmetry in social relations. Focussing upon teacher perceptions of Maori children and their needs, the way schools sort and classify their pupils, provisions for a Maori dimension in schooling, including 'taha Maori', and the place of history in social studies programmes, the research finds that the struggle still continues, with tensions surrounding the efforts of the minority of teachers and other educationists working within the education system towards Maori interests. While a significant number of teachers, particularly in primary schools seem concerned to implement the 'taha Maori' policy and other aspects of 'multicultural education', these efforts are not matched by a concern to address the problem of Maori educational under-achievement, with teachers either explaining away the problem or accepting it as a quasi-natural state of affairs. Over all the research shows that schools in general continue, in a variety of ways, to control and limit Maori access to knowledge-power and thereby help to maintain the asymmetry in Maori-Pakeha relations. Maori children who do succeed within the education system are seen to do so primarily because they and their families have learned to deal with the system. The multicultural policies of education as presented by the Department of Education are recognized as ideological responses to Maori resistance and challenges, creating an appearance of change and of commitment to Maori interests while, in essence, functioning to maintain the asymmetry in social relations.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370300 Anthropology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2328</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Science/Fiction of Sex. A Feminist Deconstruction of the Vocabularies of Heterosex</field><field name="creator">Potts, Annie</field><field name="description">This research conducts a feminist poststructuralist examination of the vocabularies of heterosex: it investigates those terms, modes of talking, and meanings relating to sex which are associated with discourses such as scientific and popular sexology, medicine and psychiatry, public health, philosophy, and some feminist critique. The analysis of these various representations of heterosex involves the deconstruction of binaries such as presence/absence, mind/body, inside/outside and masculine/feminine, that are endemic to Western notions of sex. It is argued that such dualisms (re)produce and perpetuate differential power relations between men and women, and jeopardize the negotiation of mutually pleasurable and safer heterosex. Particular attention is paid to the ways in which sexological discourse deploys such dualisms as normal/abnormal, natural/unnatural, and healthy/unhealthy sex, and produces specifically gendered 'experiences' of sexual corporeality. The thesis examines a variety of written texts and excerpts from film and television; it also analyzes transcript material from individual and group interviews conducted by the researcher with heterosexual women and men, as well as sexual health and mental health professionals, in order to identify cultural pressures influencing participation in risky heterosexual behaviours, and also to identify alternative and safer pleasurable practices. Some of these alternative practices are suggested to rely on a radical reformulation of sexual relations which derives from the disruption of particular dualistic ways of understanding and enacting sex. The overall objective of the thesis is to deconstruct cultural imperatives of heterosex and promote the generation and acceptance of other modes of erotic pleasure. It is hoped that this research will be of use in the future planning and implementation of sex education and safer sex campaigns in Aotearoa/New Zealand which aim to be non-phallocentric and non-heterosexist, and which might recognize a feminist poststructuralist politics of sexual difference.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420303 Culture, gender, sexuality</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2331</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Signalling mechanisms coordinating nutritional status and lactation</field><field name="creator">Stewart, Kevin William</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted at the request of the author.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2333</field></doc><doc><field name="title">General practice consultation and outcome: a social analysis of the patient practitioner encounter</field><field name="creator">Raymont, Antony</field><field name="description">The thesis examines general medical practice with particular attention to patient outcomes. Sociological descriptions of healing are presented and compared with official views of medical institutions. A theoretical position is taken capable of interaction with the disciplines of both sociology and medicine. Definitions of health are reviewed and used to specify desirable outcomes to patient-practitioner encounters. The context of modern medical care is then discussed; the influence of the intellectual, social and economic environment on the development of medical care since 1800 are evaluated, and modern reformist pressure on medical practice is examined. From this discussion a list of qualities of interest in the sociological investigation of medical practice is developed. A research project, undertaken in New Zealand, is described which gathered information on a random sample of 9477 general practice patient-practitioner encounters. A survey methodology was used with data supplied by practitioners. In addition, a patient survey was carried out in a sub-sample of 763 visits. Data on practitioner, patient, problem presented, process of the encounter and outcome was recorded. Outcome was measured as empowerment at the visit and improvement after two weeks. The results of the project are presented and analyzed. It was found that most patients are satisfied with their consultation and that a majority have improved health state at two weeks. Much of the variation in improvement is explained by the severity of the problem and the age of the patient. Social variables make a small contribution to the prediction of good outcomes. In particular, empowerment at the consultation is related to improved subsequent health state. The influence of occupation, gender and ethnicity on problems presented to the practitioner and on outcome are discussed. A proportion of patients had delayed obtaining medical care for financial reasons. This was associated with more severe problems and poorer outcome. A psycho-social approach to problems was rare and patient counseling did not appear to contribute to a sense of empowerment. Practitioners reported highest rapport with simpler consultations and rapport was negatively related to empowerment. The significance of these findings is discussed. In a final section it is suggested that medical treatment and counseling may be antithetical skills and that both practitioner and patient may have vested interests in a materialistic view of the content of their interaction. The forms of social control implicit in the encounter are elaborated.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2334</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Changes in organisational design in New Zealand privatised organisations</field><field name="creator">Erakovi&#263;, Ljiljana</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted at the request of the author</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2335</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contemporary Developments in Catholic Missiology : the Story of the Sisters of Our Lady of the Missions of the Province of Aotearoa New Zealand, 1861-2000</field><field name="creator">Smith, Susan Elizabeth</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted at the request of the author</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::440000 Philosophy and Religion::440200 Religion and Religious Traditions::440204 Christian theology (incl.

Electrophoresis of the AMPs extracted from a selection of Demospongiae showed that most of the AMPs typical of vertebrate connective tissues were present. No evidence was found in this study to suggest a possible role whereby the presence or absence of sulphated AMPs could be of use in sponge taxonomy. Histochemical studies on the cytological localization of AMPs in both adult tissues and developing larvae also failed to provide any evidence to support the previous hypothesis that AMP localization could be used as an aid in the classification of the Demospongiae. Ultrastructural studies on the localization of AMPs indicated several mechanisms whereby AMPs could contribute to sponge cohesion. The AMPs associated with collagen fibrils were found to be arranged in a way essentially similar to that already described for mammals, and various other lines of evidence confirm the similarity of the sponge mesohyl to vertebrate connective tissue. There is, however, no need to imply a direct evolutionary relationship. The possible role of AMPs in both cell-cell and cell-substrate adhesion has been examined in detail. Evidence is presented for the existence of an aggregation factor in Microciona coccinea. The factor has been shown to be a proteoglycan in a closely related species of sponge, and although conclusive evidence on the role of factor is lacking it is interpreted by many workers to be a surface attached molecule involved in adhesion. No evidence was obtained in this study to confirm localization of the factor at the sponge cell surface, but this may be a result of limitations in present ultrastructural techniques. Initial cell contact in cell-cell adhesion during aggregation was seen to occur in the regions of narrow extensions of the plasmalemmae termed membrane bridges. Structures of this sort have been proposed on physical grounds as one means by which cells may overcome the electric repulsive barrier between them to make adhesion by ionic bridging. Adhesion to the substrate in metamorphosing sponge larvae was seen to be mediated by a groundmat which is believed to be secreted by the larva, and which contains a granular component as well as collagen and fine filaments. The role of junctions in cell-cell adhesion was examined in detail in adult sponges and in aggregated cells. The presence of the cell junctions characteristic of other organisms could not be convincingly demonstrated in sponge tissues, and it seems probable that structures other than the typical cell junctions may be involved in communication and adhesion within sponges. An unusual AMP surface coat &#8211; the larval coat &#8211; is described from the surface of the T-pinacocytes in metamorphosing larvae of Halichondria moorei. The similarity of this coat in some respects to the fuzzy surface coat of amoebae is noted, and some of its possible functions are discussed.</field><field name="date">1975</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2337</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Glucose Transporters in Diabetic Complications of the Lens</field><field name="creator">Merriman-Smith, B. Rachelle</field><field name="description">Lens transparency is primarily maintained by the anaerobic metabolism of glucose. Glucose is transported from the aqueous humuor to the lens epithelial cells however, it has not yet been established how glucose penetrates to the inner part of the lens. The core of the lens is acidic, approximately pH 6.5, as an effect of the accumulation of lactate, the end-product of glycolysis. This confirms that glucose is drawn deep into the core of the lens. Until recently it was assumed that glucose was transported to the core via a gap junction-mediated route by cell-cell diffusion. However, passive diffusion is limited in capacity and is unlikely to be sufficient for nutrient transport especially for larger lenses. Instead, an active circulation system has been proposed that has the potential to transport glucose deep into the lens via an extracellular route. This would imply that fibre cells may have evolved their own glucose uptake system, yet no direct evidence to this effect has been available. My thesis describes new molecular evidence that both epithelial and fibre cells have evolved their own glucose uptake system. The rat lens expresses the facilitative glucose transporters GLUTI and GLUT3 differentially. GLUTI is predominantly expressed in the epithelium while GLUT3 is predominantly expressed in the fibre cells of the lens. In the normal lens, this makes good physiological sense. GLUTI has a high Km suitable for situations of high glucose concentrations, as is the case for the epithelium where the aqueous humour mirrors glucose concentrations found in blood. GLUT3 has a lower Km and is particularly suitable for the fibre cells, where the supply of glucose from the tortuous extracellular space is limited. The discovery of GLUT3 in the fibre cells lends strong support for the existence of an active circulation system in the lens and makes it seem unlikely that glucose is transported into the core via gap junction-mediated diffusion. In the diabetic state, sorbitol - a product of glucose metabolism, occurs at elevated levels of about 30 times more than that of the normal, suggesting a significant increase in glucose uptake. This imposes an osmotic stress on the lens, which can be countered by regulated cell volume decrease only in the outer but not in the inner cortex. As a consequence inner cortex tissue breaks down and opacities result. My studies of the diabetic rat lens shows that the situation is made worse by an apparent up-regulation of GLUT3 in the fibre cells. Quantitative RT-PCR shows that the GLUT3 transcript is up-regulated six-fold during the initial weeks of diabetic insult in the streptozotocin rat model. The up-regulated GLUT3 protein is detected in the region where maximum tissue damage occurs. These results suggest a new mechanism for the initial tissue damage in the diabetic lens, whereby increased uptake of glucose leads to an over-production of sorbitol which causes osmotic stress on the fibre cells that is beyond their defense capability of regulated cell volume decrease. While my results described above have revolutionized our view of nutrient transport in the lens and its potential role in the early stages of diabetic cataract, the picture is only complete when the functionality of GLUT3 can be demonstrated. For this purpose, vesicles were prepared from isolated lens fibre cells and subjected to quantitative uptake studies using a fluorescent glucose derivative. Uptake was greatly reduced using the GLUT-specific inhibitor phloretin demonstrating that GLUT3 of the rat lens fibre cells is indeed fully functional. In summary, my results add a new dimension to our understanding of how the lens maintains homeostasis and tissue transparency. The lens has evolved an ingenious system to supply, nutrients to the core region to compensate for the absence of a vasculature. However, by achieving this, it has rendered itself unable to defend itself against the adverse effects of high glucose. My results also contribute towards developing new strategies of rational drug design to prevent or delay cataract.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2338</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Professional Expertise: A Model for Integration and Change</field><field name="creator">Yielder, Jill</field><field name="description">The nature of professional expertise has been widely debated in the literature. However it has been examined primarily from a dichotomy of perspectives - either from an experiential or a cognitive focus, without the attempt to integrate these, and other aspects of expertise, into an integrated and coherent model. This research is structured in two sections. The first part incorporates a philosophical discussion, which advances an integrated model of professional expertise. The second part uses a case study focused on the field of medical imaging to illustrate and refine the model. Ten professionals identified as experts in the various sub-specialties within medical imaging were guided through a sustained period of interviews and logging of critical incidents in order to elicit in-depth data in relation to the process of expertise. Findings showed that while expertise is situated in the context of practice, it incorporates several dimensions working together in an integrated, seamless fashion through the medium of the individual practitioner. The proposed model integrates five main aspects, namely: knowledge base; cognitive processes; internal integrative processes; interpersonal relationships; and professional practice. That is, it is a synthesis of a particular knowledge base, the cognitive processes, personality and internal processes of the practitioner. It manifests through, and builds on, interpersonal relationships with clients and other professionals, and is expressed through the actual doing of professional practice. It is through the reflexive examination of practice and management of change that professionals may transform these five integrated aspects into the qualitative state of expertise. One of the implications of these findings for higher education are that institutions providing professional education need to value all the dimensions of expertise and their effective integration in order to promote the learning required to advance professionals towards this level of practice.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2340</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CHESS: Chief Executive Stress Survival: a study of occupational stress in New Zealand top management</field><field name="creator">Robinson, Paul F.</field><field name="description">This study develops and used a CHESS (chief Executive Stress Survival) model developed from the occupational stress literature to predict variations in the psychological and physical stress experience and health risk of chief Executives of New Zealand organisations. The model proposes that stress is a sequential process with identifiable phases and that variation are mainly due to the frequency of environmental experiences and stressor factors which are both &#8220;chronic&#8221; and &#8220;episodic&#8221;, &#8220;at work&#8221; and &#8220;outside work&#8221;. The model also assumes, however, that the impact of the environmental variables and stressor factors are moderated by individual personality differences, coping mechanisms and stress management practices. The model was tested on a sample of 107 male chief Executive officers and General Managers. It was found that the majority of the sample (80%) were relatively stress resistant and healthy. Stepwise multiple regression was used to test the model, and some evidence derived suggests that the frequency of environmental problems does predict various stress symptoms and that environmental stressors ultimately predict health risk profiles. Individual differences are shown as being largely independent variables predicting stress, rather that being moderating variables as suggested by the model. Coping and stress management variables are also shown to play a significant moderating role in the stress - outcome relationship. Some evidence derived suggests that there may be individual manager profiles, provisionally labelled &#8220;stress immune&#8221; vs &#8220;vulnerable&#8221; and &#8220;ill - health preventers&#8221; vs &#8220;non-preventers&#8221;. Due to the depth of the cross-sectional data obtained on this rarely studied management level, some comparison with published information on other researched groups are explored. A number of limitations of the study are noted.

The extracts were incubated with radiolabelled tryptophan and other substrates and cofactors thought to be involved in indoleacetic acid biosynthesis. After incubation indolepyruvate and indoleacetic acid were separated and quantified by HPLC. There was no significant difference in the conversion of tryptophan to indolepyruvate and indoleacetic acid between the incubations and control incubations using boiled extract. The concentrations of indolepyruvate and indoleacetic acid in mung bean hypocotyl suspension cultures were measured using GC-MS SIM over the growth of the culture, a period of 29 days. Indoleacetic acid concentrations, although scattered, mostly remained at constant low levels in the range of 6 to 9ng/g fwt of culture. The indolepyruvate levels steadily increased to a maximum level after 14 days, then remained at this level, 10 to 12 ng/g fwt, for the remainder of the culture period. This plateau in indolepyruvate concentration matched the period that the suspension culture was in the logarithmic phase of growth. An aromatic amino acid aminotransferase was purified over 33,000 fold from the shoots and primary leaves of mung beans, as determined using a tryptophan aminotransferase activity assay. The enzyme was a monomer, with a molecular weight of about 58kDa. The pH optimum was broad, with a maximum at about 8.6. The relative activities of the aromatic amino acids were: tryptophan 100, tyrosine 83 and phenylalanine 75, and the Kms were 0.095, 0.08 and 0.07mM respectively. The enzyme was able to use 2-oxoglutarate, oxaloacetate and pyruvate as the oxo acid substrate at relative activities 100, 128 and 116 and Kms 0.65, 0.25 and 0.24mM respectively In addition to the aromatic amino acids the enzyme was able to transaminate alanine, arginine, leucine and lysine to a lesser extent, and showed slight activity with asparagine, aspartate, histidine, valine and D-tryptophan and tyrosine. Inhibition studies showed that the alanine, aspartate and histidine activities were part of the aromatic amino acid aminotransferase activity. The enzyme was not inhibited by indoleacetic acid, although naphthaleneacetic acid did inhibit slightly. There was evidence of substrate inhibition by hydroxyphenylpyruvate at high concentrations. Addition of the cofactor pyridoxal phosphate only slightly increased the activity of the enzyme. The enzyme was blotted onto a PVDF membrane cleaved by in situ trypsin digest. Three of the tryptic fragments were sequenced. These fragments had approximately 60% sequence similarity with plant aspartate aminotransferases and tyrosine aminotransferases.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2344</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Managing the Risks of Ageing: The Role of Private Pensions and Annuities within a Comprehensive Retirement Policy for New Zealand</field><field name="creator">St. John, Susan, 1945-</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics::340200 Applied Economics::340209 Public sector economics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2345</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Worlds in Collision: The Gay Debate in New Zealand 1960-86</field><field name="creator">Guy, Laurie</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the public debate on homosexuality in New Zealand in the period 1960-86. Its focus is primarily on male homosexuality because the central issue was the continued criminalization of male same-sex sexual acts. The thesis notes irresolvable problems of definition of homosexuality involving discussions of behaviour, orientation and identity. Nevertheless, the debate proceeded on a binary basis, that homosexuals and heterosexuals were two clearly defined groups of people. The thesis begins by noting the repression and invisibility of homosexuals in the 1960s. It then explores the origins and significance of the New Zealand Homosexual Law Reform Society and the gay liberation movement. Because of the significance of religion in regard to the debate, a chapter is devoted to major change and cleavage that occurred within the churches relating to homosexuality in the period reviewed. Finally the intense fifteen months of debate that occurred prior to decriminalization of male homosexual activity in July 1986 is studied at depth. The thesis highlights the intensity of feeling that the debate engendered. This was the result of the clash of fundamentally different worldviews and value systems. Behind the particular issue lay the question of the moral and social status of homosexuals and homosexual acts. So fundamental was this division that from both sides the very future of society seemed to be at stake. Worlds were in collision.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::430000 History and Archaeology::430100 Historical Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2346</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Citizenship Under Neo-Liberalism: Immigrant Minorities in New Zealand 1990-1999</field><field name="creator">McMillan, Katherine Alexandra</field><field name="description">Ideally, a citizen is an individual who is a formal member of a self-governing political community, with individual rights and freedoms that are equal to those of other citizens, and which are protected by law. This thesis investigates how closely the citizenship status of non-Maori ethnic minorities in New Zealand approximated this ideal during the 1990s. Its particular focus is on how the neo-liberal ideology of National and Coalition Governments between 1990 and 1999, and those Governments' understandings of the nature and political significance of ethnicity, affected the ability of those belonging to non-Maori ethnic minority groups to be full and equal members of the New Zealand political community, with an equal capacity for self-governance at the individual level and as members of the political community. The thesis takes the form of a survey of public policy and law over a period of nine years. Five broad areas or aspects of public policy are examined: the collection and dissemination of official 'ethnic' statistics; immigration and citizenship policy; civil rights provided for in domestic and international law; mechanisms for ensuring access to political decision-making; and social policy. The question asked in the thesis is whether the policies developed and administered in each of these areas during the 1990s enriched or detracted from the citizenship status of non-Maori ethnic minorities.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360100 Political Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2347</field></doc><doc><field name="title">&#65279;First language attrition in a second language learning environment: the case of Korean-English late bilinguals</field><field name="creator">Kim, Sun Hee</field><field name="description">This thesis explores L1 attrition among young Korean-English late bilinguals. Thirty Korean immigrants to New Zealand, who had arrived at the age of 12-13 years and had spent at least 2 years in New Zealand, participated in the study. Ten monolingual Korean children aged 12 years served as a comparison group for L1 data. Linguistic data in both L1 and L2 were elicited by a standardised picture-naming test and a story-retelling task supplemented by a stimulated recall protocol. Information related to social variables and language use patterns was elicited through a questionnaire and interviews. Skehan (1996; 1998; 2001) proposes three dimensions of linguistic performance&#8212; accuracy, fluency, and complexity. The general findings suggest that accuracy and lexical diversity in L1 are most susceptible to attrition and that there is general positive transfer from L1 to L2 skills. While there is no direct negative interaction between L1 and L2 proficiency, analysis reveals that increasing L2 fluency and a decrease in L1 use have possible indirect effects on attrition in L1 accuracy but not in L1 lexical diversity. The data suggest that, while the frequency of return visits to the homeland is an important social variable, language use involving the father and siblings is also an important factor in attrition or maintenance of L1 proficiency of adolescent late bilinguals. Qualitative analysis conducted on five cases corroborates the quantitative findings. Analyses of speech samples reveal that synthetic structures with semantic ambiguity are most susceptible to L1 attrition. The qualitative analysis also highlights the role of L2 socialisation in L1 attrition in adolescent immigrant children who negotiate their language use and identities in an L2-dominant environment and show different patterns of attrition in their L1.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420100 Language Studies::420119 Korean</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2366</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experimental and applied behaviour analysis</field><field name="creator">Wardlaw, Grant Ronald</field><field name="description">It is often claimed that applied behaviour analysis is founded on basic behavioural concepts involving the direct extrapolation of data from the experimental laboratory to the analysis of human behaviour. It is claimed that such an approach gives theoretical coherence to a set of procedures, and avoids the pitfalls associated with a collection of unrelated techniques. This presumed experimental base is said to make applied behaviour analysis more rigorous, more effective, more systematic, and easier to teach and learn than other approaches to the modification of human behaviour. There is reason to believe, however, that the link between experimental and applied behaviour analysis is more one of commitment than reality. Previous authors have shown that research findings from the experimental analysis of behaviour are becoming increasingly isolated from other areas of psychology in general. The present study provides evidence that such findings are also isolated from applied behaviour analysis in particular. Experimental data are seldom cited in applied work and, when they are, it is seldom specific or current data to which references are made. It is argued that this state of affairs is attributable to the acceptance, by applied behaviour analysis, of a model of behaviour whose complexity is insufficient to cope with the complex interactive nature of human behaviour. The present work provides an outline of the current applied behaviour analytic model, and then proceeds to discuss some of the major types of data of which the model takes no significant account. An extensive examination of data from the experimental analysis of choice behaviour is given, which reveals the level of complexity to which application may be made. Suggestions as to the practical utilization of these data are made, with particular reference to the areas of self-control and commitment. A case study involving the use of a commitment procedure in the treatment of an exhibitionist and another concerning the application of experimentally-derived procedures to a self-control problem, provide clinical evidence of the usefulness of the direct incorporation of experimental data. Following these applied case studies, a number of other areas of experimental research are examined with respect to their relevance to applied behaviour analysis. Significant data from the study of multiple-schedule interactions, stimulus control, and two specific types of analyses of reinforcement phenomena are outlined and suggestions made concerning their applied potential. Further, data which could determine the limits of the applicability of experimental data, in the context of biological constraints on behaviour, are shown to be capable of further increasing the utility of applied behaviour analytic techniques. Finally, the implications of the data analyzed are discussed in terms of the future training of applied behaviour analysts.</field><field name="date">1977</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2352</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inhibitory dimensional and inhibitory stimulus control in pigeons with forebrain lesions</field><field name="creator">Wild, John Martin</field><field name="description">Lesions were placed in several areas of the telencephalon and diencephalon of the brain of the pigeon and the effects on the acquisition of inhibitory dimensional and inhibitory stimulus control were observed. The experimental tasks consisted of both visual and auditory interdimensional discriminations each of which had two components: In the first the stimuli were presented successively on the one response key (the main key) according to a multiple variable-interval extinction schedule. In the second the multiple schedule still obtained but a changeover key was added which, when pecked, changed the main-key stimulus, together with its associated schedule of reinforcement, to the next in a randomly ordered series. The use of these two components allowed the separation of two aspects of inhibitory control in learning: response reduction and stimulus reduction thereby permitting the assessment of discriminative ability in the absence of the confounding factor of response reduction. Inhibitory dimensional and inhibitory stimulus control were assessed by post-discrimination generalization tests and combined-cue tests, respectively. It was found that lesions to areas considered limbic - hippocampus, septum, anterior dorsomedial thalamus - had no effect on the learning of a visual discrimination. Lesions to the dorsolateral thalamus produced a complete inability to learn this discrimination, presumably due to disruption of visual fibres en route to the telecephalon. Lesions to the Wulst produced a visual discrimination learning deficit in some birds but not in others, an inconsistency not accounted for by differences in lesion size. Wulst lesions also produced an auditory discrimination learning deficit and in this case the larger the lesion, the larger the deficit. Lesions to ectostriatum produced a deficit in the visual task and lesions to Field L, an auditory projection area, produced a deficit in the auditory task, but not in the visual task. However, in most cases the discrimination learning deficit which was produced was confined to the multiple schedule where the animal had no control over the presentation or duration of the stimuli. Once the changeover key was introduced most birds obtained the learning criterion very quickly by "switching out" of the negative stimulus. This effective changeover responding, together with unimpaired inhibitory dimensional or inhibitory stimulus control, suggested that although the initial learning deficit might be described in terms of an inability to withhold responding in the presence of stimuli previously correlated with reinforcement, this inability could not readily be explained in terms of a lesion-induced impairment in an inhibitory process.</field><field name="date">1974</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2353</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Diaries of Genevi&#232;ve Br&#233;ton 1874-1914</field><field name="creator">Burnet, Catherine Margaret</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420200 Literature Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2370</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Class and occupational mobility among farm employees</field><field name="creator">Loveridge, Alison, 1955-</field><field name="description">Class mobility in farming works both ways, some farmer's children are unable to afford a farm, while others from non-farm families do succeed in farm ownership. The literature reviewed in this thesis suggests this situation is related to New Zealand's economic history. In the past small family farms have benefited from both secure markets and governments whose interests have been closely bound up with high productivity. This has led the state to offer cheap credit to prospective farmers with little cap1al of their own. Upward mobility has been possible, but at the same time state support has enabled relatively small farms to remain viable, and many of these are unable to secure farm ownership for all family members. In this thesis I explore class mobility and career patterns among farm employees and consider their wider implications. There are many ambiguities in farm employment in New Zealand which stem from the predominance of petty bourgeois farm owners. Such farmers must deal with the capitalist markets of other sectors when they purchase inputs or sell their product but family workers may act as a bulwark against commercial pressures by accepting lower incomes. Similar conditions may be forced on working class farm employees with no chance of ownership. The high number of people leaving farm employment offers indirect confirmation of such problems and this thesis investigates the context in which departures occurred. Farm employees consist of three groups, those without interest in farm ownership, those with an interest and little chance of success, and those whose family background ensures farm ownership. Many farms only have one employee and take on non-family labour for short periods when the family labour which would otherwise do the task is unavailable. Some of the people they employ are offspring of neighbouring farm owners. This variation in class interests has exacerbated the disinclination of farm employees to lake collective action in the face of poor wages and conditions. By tracing a sample of farm employees through the electoral rolls over a period of ten years, I have been able to contact three groups of farm employees: those who have left for non-farm work in the intervening period; those who have been farm workers for at least ten years; and those who have since become farm owners. This has given me an insight into the proportion of farm employees who take up farming hoping to own their own farm, and the problems involved in succeeding. People who have left farming also provide an important perspective on farm employment. I have correlated outcome of career by various background factors, principally father's occupation, aspiration, and education. Job history is also important to my analysis. All these factors influence class mobility, and may either increase or mask the action of each other in different circumstances. By looking at mobility I will demonstrate the way class relationships impinge on individual lives.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370100 Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2358</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Migration and settlement in Indian, Korean and Chinese immigrant communities in Auckland: a perspective from the political ecology of health</field><field name="creator">Anderson, Anneka</field><field name="description">This research used tuberculosis (TB) as a lens to elucidate how migration, settlement, local agency and support networks influence migrants&#8217; health in New Zealand. The study also examined specific characteristics of TB such as delays in diagnosis and the stigma attached to the disease to gain a broader understanding of TB experience for migrants in New Zealand. The research addressed these aims through the analytical framework of political ecology and incorporation of interviews, participant observation and media analysis. Participants in the research included immigrants from Mainland China, South Korea, and India, and New Zealand health care professionals. The study found that immigration policies, social discrimination and isolation have created structural inequalities between dominant host populations and Asian migrants in New Zealand. These inequalities compounded settlement problems such as language difficulties and limited employment opportunities, resulting in low income levels and perceived stress for Indian, Korean and Chinese people, which has affected their health and well being. Transnational policies and experiences of health care systems in immigrants&#8217; countries of origin and in New Zealand strongly influenced health seeking behaviour of migrants, along with structural barriers such as lack of Asian health care professionals and interpreting services. Local cultural and biological factors including health cultures and physical symptoms also affected these practices. In relation to TB, structural processes along with clinic doctor-patient relationships and social stigmas created barriers to diagnosis and treatment. Factors that facilitated access to health care in general, and TB diagnosis and treatment in particular, included the use of support networks, particularly local General Practitioners from countries of origin, and Public Health Nurses, along with flexible TB treatment programmes. This study shows that the incidence and experience of TB is shaped by migration and settlement processes. It also builds upon other medical anthropological studies that have employed political ecology by demonstrating its usefulness in application to developed as well as developing countries. In addition, the study contributes to the growing area of Asian migration research in New Zealand, illustrating that migration and settlement processes are complex and need to be understood as multidimensional, thus demonstrating advantages in approaching them from a political ecological framework.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Immigration, Migrant Health, Political Ecology, Tuberculosis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2416</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Globalisation and the Return to Empire: an Indigenous Response = Te torino whakahaere, whakamuri</field><field name="creator">Stewart-Harawira, Makere</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420305 New Zealand cultural studies</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2360</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Demonstrative clefts in spoken English</field><field name="creator">Calude, Andreea S.</field><field name="description">This research concerns the structural and discourse related properties of cleft constructions found in spoken New Zealand English. In particular, the main analysis focuses on one cleft type, namely on the demonstrative cleft; examples include (a) 'That's what I had in mind' and (b) 'That's what I thought'. The demonstrative cleft has received little attention in the literature, and this is reflected in its inconsistent classification (some believe it to be a reversed wh-cleft, others classify it together with it-clefts, and others still use the label &#8216;th-cleft&#8217;).  The current work investigates the clefts exemplified in (a) and (b), in terms of 23 different structural and discourse related properties. These properties were identified by consulting existing literature on clefts, and data from the Wellington Corpus of Spoken New Zealand English (about 200,000 words of spontaneous conversation). Additionally, the same excerpts of conversation were also examined for it-clefts, wh-clefts and reversed wh-clefts, whose most significant properties in spoken language are also related here. The data were tagged manually for the various cleft constructions investigated, and difficult examples were cross-checked by and discussed with other linguists.  The thesis consists of three introductory chapters (Chapters 1, 2 and 3), which introduce the data investigated and the constructions analysed. Chapter 4 presents the analysis of the demonstrative cleft. Following this, peripheral and problematic demonstrative clefts, that is, clefts which deviate from the prototypical demonstrative cleft model are discussed in Chapter 5. Finally, Chapter 6 deals with other cleft types in English, namely it-clefts, wh-clefts and reversed wh-clefts, and their most significant properties in spoken language. The thesis concludes with a summary chapter (Chapter 7).  One innovative aspect of the research concerns the fact that in spoken language, clefts can be 'un-integrated' or loosely integrated inside the syntactic structure which they are part of, while still being tightly connected within the discourse portion in which they are found, e.g., 'That's what you have to do when moving into a new house is nest', and 'That is what the government wants you to do is to vote Labour' (termed here double cleft construction). Double clefts are discussed in Chapter 4. The corpus also contains un-integrated wh-clefts, such as 'What I want to do is I want to study clefts', treated in Chapter 5. Previous studies suggest that in spoken language, the distinction between the syntax of clauses and the overall organisation of discourse is not always clear; clauses which do not appear to be syntactically subordinate may nonetheless be subordinate in terms of the discourse role they play. This is problematic for existing syntactic theories which rely on tightly integrated structures. An adequate analysis of un-integrated constructions, in terms of their syntax and discourse function will be of interest both to theoretical syntax and to computational linguistics.  The research contributes to existing knowledge of the grammatical constructions used by speakers of New Zealand English and English worldwide. Given the significant differences between the grammar of spoken language and that of written language, this work helps increase understanding of spoken language and of what it means to be a &#8216;speaker&#8217;.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Spoken grammar</field><field name="subject">clefts</field><field name="subject">cognitive gramar</field><field name="subject">syntactic un-integration</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2415</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teaching and learning with technology as enabler: a case study on flexible learning for postgraduate nurses</field><field name="creator">Honey, Michelle Lorraine Lewis</field><field name="description">The aim of this study was to explore the practice of flexible learning for postgraduate nurses.  Flexible learning is a contemporary approach to learning that utilises the benefits of technology.  Flexible learning can be understood as a continuum, from fully on-line or web-based courses, to those that are on-campus and supported by technology.  Internationally, the rise of flexible learning has been influenced by increased demand for higher education and competition among providers within the context of reduced education funding.  The study population, New Zealand postgraduate nurses are accessing higher education in increasing numbers to advance their practice and to position themselves for new roles and opportunities.  These are often experienced nurses yet inexperienced in higher university education, who combine study, work and other commitments.  The study employed a qualitative case study design because it enabled multiple perspectives to be gained.  Data included documentation, participant observation, survey, students&#8217; assessed work and interviews with key stakeholders: student, teacher and the organisation.  Data collection and analysis occurred simultaneously as an iterative process.  Thematic analysis was conducted on reviewed documentation, participant observation and interviews.  The survey was analysed using descriptive statistical analysis techniques.  Finally, a rubric was constructed as a matrix for analysing assessed work.  The study identifies the elements that contribute to flexible learning and the interconnectedness between the elements within the dynamic context of a university to illustrate that effective flexible learning can be provided by using a student centred approach to ensure the learning needs of postgraduate nurses are met.  Flexible learning was found to improve access, choice, and provide an emphasis on the student as central to learning.  In response to these findings the weighting of recommendations are toward the organisation as it is at this level where greater change can be made to improve support for flexible learning provision.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nursing education</field><field name="subject">flexible learning</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321100 Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2383</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Uttar Pradesh - lagging state of India: economic development and role of banks</field><field name="creator">Arora, Rashmi Umesh</field><field name="description">The present study challenges the negative and static stance of the recent literature on Uttar Pradesh, the most populous state of India, and espouses a balanced and moderate approach. The existing literature focuses only on human development and ignores the underlying social, political and economic changes taking place in the state. It ignores the decline in credit to the state. The present study synthesises and amalgamates various streams of literature on the state to fill the gap. It uses bank credit and its role in UP&#8217;s economic development as a tool to explore the changes and structural and regional shifts in the state. It examines bank credit to various regions, districts, occupations, rural and urban populations, large and small borrowers and gender in UP. This study explores credit in a multi-dimensional framework as a route to growth, development, inequality, globalisation, urbanisation, and empowerment. The study further explores the relationship between bank credit and the state&#8217;s human development. As a critique of the existing literature, the study examines whether UP is really lagging behind other states of India. Through a twin indicator approach, broadly grouped into income and non-income, the study shows that the state does lag on income front. The non-income indicators analysis, however, shows that a number of other states including high-income states are lagging. The study eschews the watertight categorisation of east and west UP as pursued in the existing literature, and adopts a broader regional classification. This showed that, although gradual, change has occurred in UP. The overall findings of the study suggest that structural and non-structural constraints characterise the development of the state. The multiple roles of credit have generated growth, helped in poverty reduction, but also influenced regional inequality and rural-urban inequalities, and widened the gap between small and large borrowers in the state. The empowerment of women through credit from commercial banks remains a distant goal as women receive less than 20 per cent of the total credit. Another significant finding of the study is that the income and non-income factors are strongly correlated, for instance, the strong negative relationship between income and the Human Poverty Index. The study, therefore, underlines the need for increased economic growth to achieve better economic and human development outcomes.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Uttar Pradesh, India, Development, Economic Growth, Bank credit, Poverty</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2386</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Feeding the frontiers: logistical limitations of Roman imperialism in the West</field><field name="creator">Thomas, Christopher Felstead</field><field name="description">This thesis is an examination of the importance of army supply in deciding the success and failure of the frontiers of the Roman Empire with particular emphasis on those frontiers in the Rhine-Danube provinces. It will look at logistics as the reason for the end of expansion of the Roman Empire and the frontiers forming where they did. It will also argue that the failure of logistics was a major factor in the collapse of those same frontier defences and the ultimate fall of the western part of the empire. The need to feed and supply large numbers of troops and their dependents dictated where they could be based. Because of the impossibility of supplying the whole army with imported goods, the suitability of local land for food production was also paramount. The need to have reliable sources of supply locally was met by placing veterans on retirement in villae rusticae in frontier zones. This had the effect of controlling those local sources of supply and also satisfying the increasingly expensive needs of the army praemia militiae. The increased warfare and periodic invasions from the reign of Marcus Aurelius especially on the upper Rhine and upper Danube made supply more difficult. The army placed an increasing number of beneficiarii consularis on important points on the transport network to control and direct the flow of army supplies. The more frequent invasions across the frontiers from the third century caused greater dislocation to the agricultural infrastructure not only on the frontiers but deeper into the more settled and richer provinces. This destroyed the sources of local supply and also often the source of imported supply, forcing Roman armies to stay well inside the imperial boundaries more often than before. The loss of their logistic superiority spelt the loss of their military advantage, and the loss of empire.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::430000 History and Archaeology::430100 Historical Studies::430112 History: Classical Greek and Roman</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2369</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring the artwork-world: perichoretic rehearsals of the divine encounter</field><field name="creator">Jack, Matthew, 1963-</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted at the request of the author.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::440000 Philosophy and Religion::440100 Philosophy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2374</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Microbiological Indicators of Faecal Contamination in Aquatic Environments</field><field name="creator">Turner, Susan Jane</field><field name="description">1. The aim of this research was to determine appropriate microbial indicator systems for use in monitoring the occurrence and source of faecal contamination in aquatic environments. Particular emphasis has been placed on the identification of indicators which might enable faecal contamination of human origin to be distinguished from that of non-human derivation. Two lines of investigation have been pursued; the use of alternative microbial indicator systems for water quality monitoring, and the development of diagnostic molecular methods for identifying the origin of faecal organisms. 2. Field and treatment plant studies were undertaken to investigate the utility of three indicator systems for monitoring water quality impacts in the coastal area surrounding the discharge from Auckland's North Shore City wastewater treatment plant. F-specific bacteriophage (F-phage) and ratios of F-phage to enterococci and faecal coliforms were examined over a twelve month period in which indicator levels at various stages of the wastewater treatment process were measured. These indicators and levels of Clostridium perfringens spores in sediment were measured in four outfall impact studies. 3. F-phage levels in effluent from the treatment plant (median=2.5 x 102 cfu/l00 ml) were too low to enable their use as source-specific tracers of effluent dispersion. However, higher F-phage levels in raw sewage (median=6.2 x l05 cfu/l00 ml) suggested that phage may be an appropriate indicator of raw sewage contamination in the receiving environment. F-phage was detected in coastal waters remote from the sewage outfall, providing presumptive evidence of sewage contamination entering the sea from sources other than the outfall discharge itself. 4. F-phage/enterococci and F-phage/faecal coliform ratios that were determined for sewage and treated effluent derived from the North Shore plant proved to be highly variable and were therefore unreliable for determining the source faecal contamination. 5. The concentration of Clostridium perfringens spores in sediments did not provide a useful means for tracing the distribution of faecal contaminants in the coastal system because the spore levels were found to be similar throughout the study area. This widespread occurrence of C. perfringens spores prevented identification of defined impact zones for any of the potential sources of faecal contaminants examined. 6. Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis was used to investigate whether genetic markers could be identified for Escherichia coli isolates derived from different sources. RAPD profiling was found to be a highly discriminative method able to subtype E. coli strains present in both sewage and in the wastewater stream of a mechanical wood-pulping operation. In the pulp mill effluent, RAPD analysis indicated the presence of a restricted range of E. coli strains compared to the range found in the water intake and sewage effluent discharges. The results obtained provide presumptive evidence for the multiplication of E. coli strains within the wastewater stream. 7. Comparison of RAPD profiles derived from a range of human and environmental E. coli isolates led to the identification of a 1.6-kb marker. present in a subset of human isolates, but found only infrequently in isolates from animal origin. Primers based on sequence information obtained from this region of the genome yielded a direct PCR assay for the 'human' marker. The reliability and utility of the assay was improved when fluorescently-labelled primers and an automated DNA detection system was employed for the analysis of the amplified PCR products. 8. The diagnostic polymorphism was localised to the region immediately downstream of the gene encoding the glycine decarboxylase P-protein (gcvP). Comparison of DNA sequences from this region in 'marker-positive' and 'marker-negative' E. coli isolates revealed an abrupt loss of homology immediately downstream of the transcription termination point of the gcvP gene. The region of non-homology extends for at least 130 base pairs beyond the gcvP transcription terminator. Sequences spanning this region in marker-negative isolates exhibited a high level homology with that determined for E. coli K-12. The origin of the sequence for the same region in marker-positive isolates was unable to be identified. 9. The utility of the marker for environmental monitoring was investigated in a field study of a rural stream receiving bacterial contamination of both human and animal origin. The marker was consistently detected both in isolates derived from sewage effluents and in those found immediately downstream from sewage inputs-despite the presence of a high background of E. coli of animal origin. However the utility of the marker as a sewage-specific tracer was limited by the relatively low numbers of marker-positive d. coli in sewage effluents (approximately 8%). 10. In summary, the work described in this thesis has confirmed the need for multiple indicator systems in water quality monitoring and has identified appropriate areas for further research. The most promising area for future research is in the development of molecular tools which might provide both a better understanding of genetic variation in indicator organisms and enable methods to be developed for the detection of host-specific strains. Location of other polymorphisms likely to be present in the E. coli genome should enable further host-specific markers to be identified which could complement the 'human' marker identified in this study.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2375</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biological studies on turnip yellow mosaic virus in Brassica pekinensis</field><field name="creator">Fraser, Lena</field><field name="description">1. When purified turnip ye1low mosaic virus was inoculated mechanically on to Chinese cabbage leaves, using known numbers of virus particles in 0.1 to 1.0 &#181;1 volumes of inoculum, as few as 10 to 30 particles were required to produce a single local lesion.2. Inoculation of a cotyledon leaf of Chinese cabbage seedlings with turnip yellow mosaic virus produced a rapid transient inhibition in the rate of leaf initiation, so that infected plants developed 0.5 to 1.0 leaf less than healthy plants. 3. The factor that initiated the inhibitory response a t the apical. meristem began moving out of the inoculated cotyledon within 1to 6 hours after inoculation, thus preceding the movement out of the inoculated cotyledon of infectious virus or RNA which was not detectable until about day 5. 4. The transient inhibition of leaf initiation occurred following inoculation with any one of three unrelated viruses, or with infectious turnip ye1low mosaic virus RNA. 5. A factor eluted in an active form from the cut petioles of inoculated 1eaves. 6. It is necessary to inoculate with infectious virus or RNA to initiate the production of the inhibitory factor. 7. No differences were seen in the magnitude or timing of the reduced rate of 1eaf initiation, when the concentration of turnip yellow mosaic virus in the inoculum was varied between 1 &#181; g/ml and 100 &#181;g/ml. 8. Inoculation of the cotyledons of Chinese cabbage seed1ings with turnip ye1low mosaic virus caused a marked disturbance in the mitotic index a t the apical meristem between 6 and 48 hours. 9. A reduction in the accumulation of starch in the chloroplasts of cell s in the apical meristem occurred at 6 t o 24 hours after inoculation of the cotyledon 1eaf. 10. Abscisic acid applied to the cotyledon in a single 20 &#181;1 dose, elicited a response that closely paralleled the events that took place when Chinese cabbage seedlings were inoculated with turnip yellow mosaic virus. A decrease in the rate of leaf initiation began 1 t o 2 days after application and the inhibition of leaf initiation was preceded by a disturbance in the mitotic index in the apical meristem. 11. Gibberellic acid applied with the eluate from virus-inoculated leaves, was able to overcome the inhibition of leaf initiation. 12. The leaf inhibition assay in Chinese cabbage seedlings is a sensitive bioassay for abscisic acid. The minimum detectable concentration of 3 x M is comparable to those reported for the Commelina stomata1 closure bioassay which could detect 10 -10 abscisic acid (Ogunkanmi et a1 . 1973).</field><field name="date">1982</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany::270403 Plant pathology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2376</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Discovery of the novel mouFSnrp gene and the characterisation of its in situ expression profile during mouse neurogenesis</field><field name="creator">Bradoo, Privahini</field><field name="description">Recently, a novel protein family, named as neural regeneration peptides (NRPs), was predicted across the rat, human and mouse genomes by one of my supervisors, Dr. Sieg. Synthetic forms of these proteins have been previously shown to act as potent neuronal chemoattractants and have a major role in neural regeneration. In light of these properties, these peptides are key candidates for drug development against an array of neurodegenerative disorders. The aim of this PhD project was to provide confirmation of the existence of a member of the NRP coding gene family, annotated in the mouse genome. This gene, called mouse frameshift nrp (mouFSnrp), was hypothesised exist as a -1bp frameshift to another predicted gene AlkB. This project involved the identification of the mouFSnrp gene, and the characterisation of its expression pattern and ontogeny during mouse neural development. Through the work described in this thesis, the mouFSnrp gene was identified in mouse embryonic cortical cultures and its protein coding gene sequence was verified. mouFSnrp expression was shown to be present in neural as well as non-neural tissues, via RT-PCR. Using non-radioactive in situ hybridisation and immunohistochemical colocalisation studies, interesting insights into the lineage and ontogeny of mouFSnrp expression during brain development were revealed. These results indicate that mouFSnrp expression originates in neural stem cells of the developing cortex, and appears to be preferentially continued via the radial glial lineage. mouFSnrp expression is carried forward via the neurogenic radial glia into their daughter neuronal progeny as well as postnatal astrocyte. In the postnatal brain, mouFSnrp gene transcripts were also observed in the olfactory bulb and the hippocampus, both of which are known to have high neurogenic potential. In general, the radial glial related nature of mouFSnrp expression appears to be a hallmark of the mouFSnrp expression pattern through out neural development.  This thesis provides the first confirmation of the existence of a completely novel gene, mouFSnrp, and its putative -1 translational frameshifting structure. Further, preliminary data presented in this thesis regarding the mouFSnrp in situ expression pattern during mouse brain development may suggest a key role of the gene in neuronal migration and neurogenesis in mice.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Neural regeneration</field><field name="subject">Neuronal migration</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2431</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of trends and reasons for rising acute medical admissions in Auckland's public hospitals</field><field name="creator">Benipal, Jagpal Singh</field><field name="description">The main purpose of this study was to examine empirically the trends and reasons for rising acute adult medical admissions at two major public hospitals in Auckland from 1997 to 2004. According to recent national and international literature published on the topic, there has been unsustainable growth in the adult medical admissions both in NZ and most of the other developed countries. Overall, the causes of this increase have not been explored sufficiently in the literature reviewed. The NZ research has largely focused on the macro-analysis of hospital throughput data from health policy points of view. Methodology: A mixed methodology research design was applied to address the problem. Phase 1 quantitatively analysed adult medical hospital admission data (N = 277,416) obtained from the two hospitals (Middlemore and Auckland Public Hospitals), and phase 2 qualitatively explored the responses and views of the health professional expert panel (n = 16) in relation to the findings of phase 1 of the study. Findings: Overall, the crude number of admissions and age-standardised admission rates at both hospitals increased more rapidly than actual population increases. Approximately 1/3 of the patients accounted for 2/3 of the total admissions. Five major diagnostic categories accounted for 70%-80% of total acute admissions, with circulatory and respiratory system disorders being the leading causes of medical admissions. There was a strong relationship between age and increased admissions. MMH hospital overall, and its ethnic groups separately, had significantly higher admission rates than APH. Comparison of ethnic groups highlighted significant variations in the admission rates at the two hospitals despite adjusting for age, morbidity and deprivation. Conclusions: Overall the increase and variation in admission rates between the hospitals and ethnic groups was dependent on factors such as the characteristics of the population and patients, hospital admission and administration processes, availability of hospital beds, medical management at the hospital, and availability of primary and community care services. By making changes to those factors in the control of hospitals and District Health Boards, hospitals can potentially influence the trajectory of rising medical admissions. These factors include systems for managing patients with chronic illness, and pathways from community services to hospital. Finally, a number of future research areas, such as a large-scale study to explore the health service utilisation of the 55+ age groups, have been proposed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2419</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The indigenous factor: exploring kapa haka as a culturally responsive learning environment in mainstream secondary schools</field><field name="creator">Whitinui, Paul</field><field name="description">Recent research focusing on improving educational outcomes for M&#257;ori students in mainstream secondary schools in Aotearoa/New Zealand have asserted that building positive student-teacher relationships in the classroom are fundamental (c. f. Bishop, Berryman, &amp; Richardson, 2003; Bishop &amp; Tiakiwai, 2003; Ministry of Education, 2002, 2006). In contrast, attempts to investigate the educational benefits associated with M&#257;ori students participating in cultural learning activities, such as kapa haka, and the implications for improving levels of M&#257;ori student achievement, remains relatively unexplored. To embark on such an investigation, M&#257;ori kapa haka students and teachers from four mainstream secondary schools were invited to take part in an interview process informed by using a Kaupapa M&#257;ori theoretical approach. As a result, the study revealed quite emphatically that not only does kapa haka provide M&#257;ori students with an appropriate &#8216;culturally responsive&#8217; learning experience, but that they also feel more confident and optimistic about school and their education. Moreover, kapa haka provides the opportunity for students to celebrate who they are as M&#257;ori and as &#8216;culturally connected&#8217; learners in mainstream schooling contexts. In addition, M&#257;ori students through the kapa haka experience learn to &#8216;protect&#8217;, &#8216;problem-solve&#8217;, &#8216;provide&#8217;, and &#8216;heal&#8217; their inner self-worth, essence and wellbeing as M&#257;ori. Similarly, most teachers agreed that kapa haka provides M&#257;ori students with a creative, dynamic and powerful way to access their learning potential as cultural human beings. An overwhelming response by both students and teachers is that kapa haka should be timetabled as an academic subject to provide greater access to indigenous and cultural performing art that affirms their identity as M&#257;ori, and our uniqueness as New Zealanders. Finally, the research proposes a &#8216;culturally responsive&#8217; learning strategy to assist what mainstream secondary schools and teachers provide as valid and purposeful learning opportunities for &#8216;culturally connected&#8217; learners who are M&#257;ori.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2377</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dancing to the music of your heart: home schooling the school-resistant child. A constructivist account of school refusal</field><field name="creator">Stroobant, Emma</field><field name="description">School resistance is usually understood as a pathological behaviour or condition indicative of underlying mental disorder for which therapy is &#8216;indicated&#8217; and home schooling is &#8216;contraindicated&#8217;. However, I argue that the psychiatric/psychological classifications commonly used to identify school resistance (i.e. &#8216;school phobia&#8217; and &#8216;school refusal&#8217;) are socio-historical constructs that function to socially and discursively position school-resistant children as &#8216;abnormal&#8217;, &#8216;irrational&#8217;, &#8216;dysfunctional&#8217; and &#8216;sick&#8217; individuals whose problems are likely to be compounded by school withdrawal. Assuming that school resistance and home schooling can be constructed in multiple and competing ways, I explore the perspectives of seven school-resistant children who are being (or have been) home schooled, their mothers, and nine practitioners working with children. I argue that by applying a different set of assumptions to school resistance, the meaning of this phenomenon can be radically transformed and so too can the experiences of school resisters and their families. This research suggests that for some mothers and their school-resistant children, home schooling can provide an acceptable and effective solution to the problems raised by school resistance.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2429</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Orphans of the imagination: exploring boundaries of culture/class in New Zealand education</field><field name="creator">Spencer, Melissa</field><field name="description">At different moments in New Zealand&#8217;s social history anxiety about particular groups of boys has been a focal point of public and official discourses about the state of the society, and education&#8217;s function within it. These moments, in common, are dominated by prevailing perceptions of moral and normative breakdown; of social crises in one form or another. Recent concerns about the so-called problem of boys&#8217; educational underachievement have been no exception. What has shifted over time is the discursive construction of problem boys; from their unequivocal characterisation as &#8216;villains&#8217; in the society to their constitution as &#8216;victims&#8217; of it. In this thesis I utilise a critical analysis of state, public and educational discourses about &#8216;problem&#8217; boys at different historical junctures as a lens to examine continuity and change in the configuration of the state/society relation in New Zealand, and education&#8217;s pivotal role within it. I argue that the discursive production of meanings about education occurs within the wider society and tends to be dominated by fractions of the middle class. The institutionalisation of particular dominant discourses about schooling, however, is mediated by the state formation specific to each moment. Through education, and in other ways, the state has a significant role in the regulation, constitution and re-shaping of individual and collective identities. I maintain that while internal and external socio-economic and political transformation over time has wrought inevitable changes in state form and techniques of governmentality, there are discernable continuities between the liberal/paternal state and its predecessors. Education remains both as a nexus of the state/society relation and as a key site of discursive struggles within and between them. I suggest that the current critical literature on boys and schooling is constrained by its own gender frame of reference. It cannot account for the multidimensional, historically embedded, contextually specific and socially produced understandings about education, gender, class and ethnicity that powerfully inflect contemporary and historical concerns about different groups of boys in New Zealand.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2427</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Georges Bernanos, d&#233;molisseur d'impostures</field><field name="creator">Carlyle, Diane P.

The first consists of a revue of the opinions of the critics on the work of Georges Bernanos, and then proceeds to define the aims of the thesis: (i) to combat the pernicious idea that we are dealing with a "Catholic Opus", one where the term "Catholic" would imply "idealistic" or "out of touch with reality", and to arrive at a different way of approaching the work; (ii) to lay bare the hidden unity of the work since the new interpretation we are seeking will derive from the relation of the parts to the whole; (iii) to show the radical nature of Bernanos's thought which lays bare the roots of the Discontents of our Civilisation and, by so doing, imparts a prophetic tone to his writings. In the second part Bernanos is placed within the context of his times and compared to other intellectuals, both Catholic and non-Catholic, in order to separate the "Catholic" from the "non-Catholic" elements in his work. Next, using the methods of Charles Mauron, we study the Youthful Works. In the third part, following the methods of Lucien Goldmann, we place the Novels in the context of Ecclesiastical Politics. In the fourth part we trace the transformation of the Novelist into the political pundit, then we go back to La Grande peur des bien-pensants to retrace the origins of his political thinking. Chapter twelve, "Birth of the Modem World", traces the development of capitalism in France and concomitant evolution of the value-system and ways of thinking.

The lower molecular weight (&#946;-particle) glycogen was found to be extremely labile, while the higher molecular weight (&#945;-particle) exhibited a far lower metabolic activity, indicating that it may act as a glycogen store for mobilisation in stress situations. These observations, coupled to the existence of Pompe&#8217;s Disease, a glycogen storage disease involving the lysosomal system, supports the hypothesis that &#945; - and &#946; -particulate glycogen may be partially separated from one another within the cell i.e. compartmentalised. By the use of a rapid differential centrifugation technique it was possible to show, both physiochemically and ultrastructurally, the existence of glycogen of a very large molecular size associated with the lysosomal fraction. This glycogen exhibited a different molecular weight distribution from that isolate from the liver as a whole i.e. cytosol + lysosomal. It is suggested that appreciably more than 10% of cellular glycogen is located within the lysosomes and that this is of predominantly high molecular weight. The size-distribution of liver glycogen was shown to be distinctly affected by the anti-inflammatory drugs, salicylate and Indomethacin. By measurement of the incorporation of radioactive glucose into glycogen, salicylate was shown to have a depressing effect on overall liver glycogen metabolism. These effects appear to arise from a stabilisation of the lysosomal membrane by the drugs. The incorporation, via liposomes, of purified anti-1,4-&#945;-glucosidase antibodies into the liver lysosomes of normal Wistar rats and rats with a genetic deficiency of phosphorylase kinase, caused a distinct decrease in 1,4-&#945;-glucosidase activity and in the content of high molecular weight glycogen. These changes were enhanced by prolonged liposomal-antibody treatment and suggested that a possible feedback control mechanism operates in the incorporation of glycogen into lysosomes. The 1-4- &#945; -glucosidase inhibitor, Acarbose, when injected intraperitoneally into normal and phosphorylase kinase-deficient rats similarly disturbed liver lysosomal metabolism, causing distinct and persistent inhibition of enzymes and acute disturbances of lysosomal glycogen metabolism. Again a feedback control mechanism appears to operate, which effects cytosolic carbohydrate metabolism. The biochemical effects closely resembled those occurring in Pompe&#8217;s disease and were confirmed by electron microscopy. A model for the adult form of the lysosomal storage disease has been suggested.</field><field name="date">1985</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2380</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Te Puna : the archaeology and history of a New Zealand Mission Station, 1832-1874</field><field name="creator">Middleton, Angela</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the archaeology and history of Te Puna, a Church Missionary Society (CMS) mission station in the Bay of Islands, New Zealand. Te Puna was first settled in 1832 following the closure of the nearby Oihi mission, which had been the first mission station and the first permanent European settlement in New Zealand. Te Puna, located alongside the imposing Rangihoua Pa, was the home of missionaries John and Hannah King and their children for some forty years. As well as being a mission station, Te Puna was also the site of the family&#8217;s subsistence farm. The research is concerned with the archaeological landscape of Te Puna, the relationship between Maori and European, the early organisation and economy of the CMS, the material culture of New Zealand&#8217;s first European settlers, and the beginnings of colonisation and the part that the missions played in this. Artefacts recovered from archaeological investigations at the site of the Te Puna mission house are connected with other items of missionary material culture held in collections in the Bay of Islands, including objects donated by the King family. The archaeological record is also integrated with documentary evidence, in particular the accounts of the CMS store, to produce a detailed picture of the daily life and economy of the Te Puna mission household. This integration of a range of sources is also extended to produce a broader view of the material culture and economy of missionary life in the Bay of Islands in the first half of the nineteenth century. The humble, austere artefacts that constitute the material culture of the Te Puna household reveal the actual processes of colonisation in daily life and everyday events, as well as the processes of the mission, such as schooling, the purchase of food and domestic labour, the purchase of land and building of houses, the stitching of fabric and ironing of garments. These practices predate, but also anticipate the grand historical dramas such as the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi, glorified but also critiqued as the defining moment of the relationship between Maori and Pakeha and of colonisation.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420305 New Zealand cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2381</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Par erruer: error analysis and the early stages of adolescent foreign language learning</field><field name="creator">Peddie, Roger</field><field name="description">Error Analysis has been widely used in studies of second language learning. At the same time, foreign language learning (as opposed to teaching), has largely been ignored as an object of research. The research had three major aims: to examine the potential of Error Analysis in foreign language learning by the development and trialling of a complex new coding schedule for analysing learner errors in French; to provide some descriptive data on the written errors and performance of foreign language pupils over a complete scholastic year; and to explore the nature of foreign language learning strategies used by the pupils studied. The thesis opens with a statement of purpose and method. This is followed by a short discussion of theories, topics and techniques in second and foreign language learning. The development of two forms of the coding schedule used to analyse errors is described and discussed. Recode checks and the development of 'Coding Confidence Levels' are presented. Procedures used in a longitudinal study of errors are then described. This study acted as an important trial for the coding schedules, known as Foreign Language Error Analysis: French (FLEAF). All written French produced by eight pupils in the same school class was collected over the 1978 New Zealand school year (February to December). The group were in their second year of high school French and had an average age of 14 years 5 months midway through the study. Background information is given about the subjects, including results of selected IEA French (Population II) tests administered during the year. Some description of the year's work is given, followed by general and case study analyses of errors. Selected results from both the longer (FLEAF-L) and shorter (FLEAF-S) coding schedules are then tabulated and discussed. Particular attention is paid to variables coding possible explanations for errors. Detailed analyses of errors in word order, negation and gender are offered, along with a review of correct performances for selected aspects. These analyses lead to two preliminary hypotheses which could in part explain the occurrence of errors. One hypothesis relates to the frequency with which pupils had been required to focus through drills on the point at issue, the other to the number of choices available to the pupil at the time of error. Discussion of Error Analysis and pupil strategies is then presented. It is concluded that Error Analysis has a valid role in developing hypotheses for a theory of foreign language learning. Five such hypotheses, suggested by the longitudinal study, are presented. It is argued that these five could all be classified on one of a proposed five levels of 'Operating Procedures' (McLaughlin, 1978a). Selection of a unique cluster of operating procedures would constitute the learning/performance 'strategy' of a particular pupil. These notions are incorporated into a tentative framework for a theory of foreign language learning.

These texts provide the support for the Auckland child who comes to the new task of reading with a set of responses learnt from his past experience with oral language. Other important questions of the study related to whether children in such a programme could read not only unseen classroom texts, but also texts from a programme with a decoding emphasis. Fifty-two competent readers were chosen by a stratified random sampling method from 242 six-year-old children attending 20 randomly selected schools in Auckland. Strategy usage in oral reading was related to 3 factors: learning opportunities over time, (at 6:0, 6:6 and 7:0); reader proficiency, (Average, High Average, Good and Excellent); and text difficulty, (Easy, Moderately Difficult, Difficult and Phonically Regular). The children&#8217;s performances on oral reading and an oral sentence repetition test at 6:0 and 7:0 were compared. The data comprising errors and self corrections were analyzed at three linguistic levels (graphemic/phonemic, syntactic and semantic), to infer strategies. The Friedman two-way analysis of variance test for related samples was used for most comparisons. Th level of significance was set at p&lt;0.05. The findings suggest that the Auckland child used the facilitating effects of meaning and structure in both reading and sentence repetition tasks. The control which children gained from 6:0 to 7:0 over texts with the decoding emphasis was achieved by attention to both graphemic cues and cues from structure and meaning. The competent novice reader also showed flexibility in selecting different strategies to deal with easy, familiar texts and difficult or novel texts. Such strategies are a necessary part of a model of mature reading which dies not see reading as exclusively the use of anticipatory mechanisms nor solely the use of sequential letter-by-letter processing. The competent novice reader was apparently learning to use either, or combinations, of these processes. The results of the study highlight the complex nature of learning to read and suggest that while some teaching programmes that emphasize a particular learning strategy may be successful, they may not take full advantage of other equally valid strategies which children can develop.</field><field name="date">1979</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2384</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gene sequencing and in vitro synthesis of the rotavirus non-structural glycoprotein</field><field name="creator">Powell, Kevin F. H. (Kevin Frederick Herbert)</field><field name="description">1. Recombinant DNA techniques have been applied to the dsRNA genome of the bovine rotavirus Nebraska Calf Scours Diarrhoea virus (NCDV). The sequence of a full - length cloned copy of genomic segment 10 of NCDV has been determined using the Sanger dideoxynucleoside sequencing technique by subcloning cDNA into M13 vectors. 2. Genomic segment 10 codes for the non-structural protein NCVP5, a protein which appears to be involved in virus maturation (Estes et al., 1983). Determination of the nucleic acid sequence of the gene has enabled the amino acid sequence o f the bovine NCVPS protein to be inferred. Comparison of the inferred amino acid sequence with homologous sequences derived from other virus strains (Both et al., 1983c; Baybutt and McCrae, 1984; Okada et al., 1984; Ward et al., 1985) has enabled conserved regions of the molecule to be identified. A small region of the NCVPS protein has been identified (residues 131-161) which exhibits considerable variability between rotavirus strains. 3. A computer-based algorithm has been utilised to predict the folding pattern of NCDV gene 10 mRNA. This reveals a 'panhandle ' structure which differs from that proposed for the related gene of strain Wa rotavirus (Okada et al., 1984) but both molecules possess a common feature in that the initiation codon falls within a potentially-stable duplex formed with a portion of the 3 untranslated region. 4. A series of four site-directed deletion mutants of the cloned gene were constructed in order to investigate the functional significance of the three N-terminal hydrophobic regions of the NCVP5 protein. Two mutants were constructed using conveniently-located HindIII and BamHI restriction enzyme sites. The other two mutants were generated using M13 vectors and synthetic oligonucleotides. These modifications yielded genes coding for proteins in which portions of the first and second hydrophobic regions had been deleted. 5. DNA corresponding to the 'wild-type' coding region was inserted into an SP6 transcription vector to enable mRNA to be produced in vitro. This mRNA, when incubated in a reticulocyte lysate, directed the synthesis of a protein of the correct size (20 K). The addition of dog pancreatic microsomes to the reaction yielded a protein product (29 K) of a size consistent with the glycosylated ('wild-type') form of the NCVP5 protein. 6. The four variant forms of the NCVP5 gene were also inserted into SP6 transcription vectors and the protein products synthesised by the resulting mRNAs studied. All four mRNAs directed synthesis of variant protein products of the anticipated size. 7. The ability of the four variant proteins to become glycosylated and to associate with membranes was investigated. The topology of the proteins in the membrane was examined by digestion with proteolytic enzymes. Variant proteins altered in the first or second hydrophobic regions retained their ability to associate with membranes, suggesting that the third hydrophobic region, which was not altered, might play a role in membrane association. 8. A model for the disposition of NCVPS in the endoplasmic reticulum is proposed in which the first hydrophobic region is located within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, the second hydrophobic region spans the membrane and the third hydrophobic sequence associates independently with the membrane from the cytoplasmic side leaving the C-terminus of the molecule exposed to the cytoplasm. The model proposed accounts for the experimental observations but is in conflict with current mechanisms proposed for the insertion of proteins into membranes.

Don seedlings</field><field name="creator">Nair, Janardhanan</field><field name="description">Persistence of Colletotrichum acutatum Simmonds f.sp. pinea Dingley &amp; Gilmour in pine nursery soils and its infectivity of Pinus radiata D. Don seedlings were studied. Sampling procedures were compared in the search of soils for fungal propagules. Those most frequently used were soil dilution plate method, surface-soil dilution plate technique, and plating of debris picked from soil. A selective medium for direct isolation from soil was prepared comprising potato dextrose agar as the basal medium and incorporating benomyl (50 ppm), quintozene (7.5 or 75 ppm), streptomycin sulfate (100 ppm), chloramphenicol (100 ppm) and chlortetracycline HCl (100 ppm). Studies in plots at Auckland, Tokoroa and Rotorua indicated that fungal structures within P. radiata debris persisted for long periods; up to 25 months in the Auckland plots. In vitro, the viability of conidia in natural soil declined very rapidly; more than 50% of conidia were non-viable within 4 weeks of their introduction into soil incubated at 15 and 25 C. Similar experiments conducted at different matric potentials indicated that drier soils (-0.3 or -0.4 bar) had higher levels of viable conidia over periods of time compared to wetter soils of -0.1 bar or at saturation. Segments of pine seedlings introduced to soils into which various concentrations of conidia were previously incorporated showed increasing colonization with increasing conidial concentration at both 15 and 25 C after 4 days. Maximum colonization of segments occurred at conidial concentrations 106 ml-1 to 107 ml-1. Artificially-inoculated segments of pine seedlings were introduced into soil and then these were recovered at different time periods. After two months in soil 100% recovery of the fungus was obtained from all leaf, stem and root segments plated. Recovery levels from all the plated stem and root segments after 8.5 months were never lower than 68%. Recovery levels from leaf segments were lower because many of these had decomposed leaving only the central xylem strands. Conidia-laden membrane filters were introduced into soil. A method of microscopic study used after removal of these from soil enabled easy observation of resultant structures. Appressoria were formed while the fungus was in soil. Other potential survival propagules were thick-walled, darkly-pigmented, short hyphae within pine debris. It is considered that the short individual cells of such hyphae could survive as chlamydospores, and these are believed to be the prime means of long-term survival in soil. Several fumigants were tested for effectiveness in eradication of the fungus from soil. All chemicals tested, namely chloropicrin, methyl bromide, "Di-Trapex" and dazomet significantly reduced viability of conidia and the fungus in pine debris. Weeds from a pine nursery were inoculated with conidia; of these, only Epilobium ciliatum Raf. became infected. Infection of healthy parts was infrequent but saprophytic growth in older parts frequently killed the plant. This species is therefore a potential alternative host, although its importance as an inoculum source for infection of pine seedlings is unknown. Experimentally it was shown that infection could occur by rain splash of conidia onto healthy plants. Infection of P. radiata seedlings was studied at several constant and alternating temperatures. Initial infection was greatest at higher temperatures (ca 24 C); while full symptoms of the disease were best expressed at lower temperatures (12 to 18 C). Inoculated seedlings had significantly reduced shoot and root development at 12, 15, 18 C, but not at 6, 9, 23, 24, 27 C, after 53 days. Increase in height of healthy seedlings was significantly greater than that of inoculated seedlings, after 52 days at 18 C. Pathogenicity on P. radiata seedlings of an isolate of C. acutatum f.sp. pinea isolated from soil, "whitish isolate", was comparable to the normal "coloured isolate".</field><field name="date">1980</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2388</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The structure and metabolism of mammalian glycogens</field><field name="creator">Calder, Philip Charles</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2389</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multiple Objective Linear Programming in Radiotherapy Treatment Planning</field><field name="creator">Shao, Lizhen</field><field name="description">The aim of intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is to kill tumor cells while at the same time protecting the surrounding tissue and organs from the damaging effect of radiation. To achieve these goals computerized inverse planning systems are used. Given the number of beams and beam directions, beam intensity profiles that yield the best dose distribution under consideration of clinical and physical constraints are calculated. This is called beam intensity optimization problem. In this thesis, we first review existing mathematical models and computation methods for the beam intensity optimization problem. Next, we formulate the beam intensity optimization problem as a multiobjective linear programme (MOLP) with three objectives. For clinical cases this optimization problem involves thousands of variables and tens of thousands of constraints and existing methods such as multiobjective simplex methods can not handle it. The rest of the thesis is dedicated to developing methods to solve this large MOLP efficiently and to the application in the beam intensity optimization problem. Benson (1998c) argues that solving an MOLP in objective space needs less computation time than solving it in decision space if the number of objectives of the MOLP is much smaller than the number of variables. Moreover, the constraint matrix of the problem relies on the calculation of dose deposited in tissue. Since this calculation is always imprecise solving the MOLP exactly is not necessary in practice. This motivates us to develop algorithms for solving an MOLP in objective space approximately. We summarize Benson&#8217;s outer approximation algorithm for solving MOLPs in objective space and propose some small changes to improve computational performance. Then in order to approximate the true nondominated set we propose a modification of Benson&#8217;s algorithm which is called an approximation version of Benson&#8217;s algorithm. Our approximation algorithm computes an inner and an outer approximation of the nondominated set. We prove that the inner approximation provides a set of &#949;-nondominated points. The geometric duality theory of Heyde and L&#168;ohne (2006) defines a dual to an MOLP and it assures us to be able to find the nondominated set of the primal MOLP by solving its dual MOLP. Based on this we develop a dual variant of Benson&#8217;s outer approximation algorithm to solve the dual MOLP in objective space. We prove that solving the dual provides a weight set decomposition. We compare the primal algorithm and the dual algorithm on small illustrative and on radiotherapy examples. Furthermore, we propose an algorithm to solve the dual MOLP approximately but within specified tolerance. This approximate solution set can be used to calculate an approximation of the nondominated set of the primal MOLP.We show that this set is an &#949;-nondominated set of the original primal MOLP and provide numerical evidence that this approach can be faster than solving the primal MOLP approximately. Considering that the set of nondominated points is infinite, it is not very useful from the planners&#8217; point of view. We address the problem of finding well distributed nondominated points for an MOLP.We propose a method which combines the global shooting and normal boundary intersection methods. By doing so, we overcome the limitation of normal boundary intersection method that parts of the nondominated set may be missed. Discrepancy analysis of the nondominated points from a geometry point of view shows that this method produces evenly distributed nondominated  points. Moreover, the coverage error and the uniformity level can be measured. Finally, we apply the algorithms developed to the beam intensity optimization problem of 3D clinical cases with voxel size of 5mm and 3mm. A technique of reducing the resolution in normal tissue has been used to reduce the computation time. The results clearly illustrate the advantages of our methods.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2478</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The young driver: a highway warrior?</field><field name="creator">Harre, Nicole</field><field name="description">Young drivers have high rates of injury in New Zealand and throughout the Western world. It is commonly perceived that a major reason for this is their tendency to engage in unsafe driving behaviours, something that has frequently been labelled &#8216;risk taking&#8217;. A study of the literature suggested that the term &#8216;risk taking&#8217; has been used in a variety of different ways and may have obscured our understanding of young people&#8217;s motives. Theories and research reviewed on the causes of unsafe driving behaviour amongst adolescents revealed a variety of potential contributors, ranging from the individual to the social. There is little evidence to implicate young women as unsafe drivers, who are most at risk as passengers. A survey of sixth form students (n=626) found high levels of unlicensed driving, breaking the rules associated with a restricted licence, failing to wear a seat belt in the back seat, speeding and being the passenger of a drinking driver. In addition, the survey found significantly more males than females reported: driving, engaging in unsafe driving behaviours, drinking and driving, speeding on the open road, breaking the night curfew associated with being on a restricted licence and dangerous thought patterns. Females were more likely to have been the passenger of a drinking driver after the last party they attended. Interviews with a sub-sample of those surveyed (n=16) revealed a number of scenarios that led to unsafe driving. These included: peer group dynamics, the adolescent sub-culture, emotional stress, an apparent lack of awareness of risk, and practical considerations. The interviews also indicated a lack of policing of the rules associated with the Graduated Driver Licensing System (G.D.L.S.). Interventions aimed at changing the behaviour of young drivers are examined and driver education is looked at in some detail. Problems with methodology made it difficult to reach clear conclusions about the efficacy of past programmes. Health education literature was analysed to ascertain what may be the ingredients of effective programmes for driving safety. An intervention study was carried out that compared a group of sixth form students who received a programme for driving safety (n=176) with a control group (n=146). Measures of attitudes, knowledge and self-reported behaviours yielded no significant differences between the two groups in either the post-test or the follow-up. A variety of reasons for this outcome are put forward, including the programme&#8217;s emphasis on thinking processes and its low fear approach. The recommendations that are made for decreasing the teenage road injury rate include: better policing of the G.D.L.S., education programmes and media campaigns that focus on the young male&#8217;s sense of personal immunity from risk, and increased availability of safe transport on occasions when young people are drinking. It is stressed that comprehensive safety plans that target all age groups are likely to have the greatest impact.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2390</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pakeha discourses of Maori/Pakeha relations</field><field name="creator">McCreanor, Tim</field><field name="description">This thesis uses a discourse analytic approach to the language used by Pakeha in talk about Maori in Aotearoa/New Zealand.

It is suggested that the commonalities described amount to an ideological and linguistic resource base for the construction of a powerful "standard story" of Maori/Pakeha relations, which underpins and legitimates the oppressive status quo.

Aetiological literature reveals a wide range of causal explanations including biogenetic, social and cultural factors.  A major limitation of this body of research is the assumption of schizophrenia as a universal syndrome.  When viewed through an indigenous lens, experiences labelled schizophrenic by Western psychiatry have been found to vary from culture to culture in terms of content, meaning and outcome.  The current project aimed to investigate M&#257;ori ways of understanding experiences commonly labelled &#8216;schizophrenic&#8217;.  The philosophical frameworks that guided the research were Kaupapa M&#257;ori Theory and Personal Construct Theory.  A qualitative approach was used and semi-structured interviews were conducted with 57 participants including tangata whaiora (service users), tohunga (traditional healers), kaumatua/kuia (elders), P&#257;keh&#257; clinicians, M&#257;ori clinicians, cultural support workers and students.  Four categories were derived from qualitative thematic analysis.  These being: making sense of the experiences, pathways of healing, making sense of the statistics and what can we do about the statistics.  Overall, M&#257;ori constructions related to other indigenous constructions of mental illness and wellbeing cited in the international literature but were in stark contrast to current psychiatric constructions.  The current project indicated M&#257;ori participants held multiple explanatory models for extra-ordinary experiences with the predominant explanations being spiritual.  Other explanations included psychosocial constructions (trauma and drug abuse), historical trauma (colonisation) and biomedical constructions (chemical brain imbalance).  Based on these findings, recommendations for the development of culturally appropriate assessment and treatment processes are presented. Over the last couple of centuries a single paradigm, the medical model, has come to dominate the explanation and treatment of illness in Western society.  Via legal and political means, indigenous models of illness and wellness have been wiped out or forced to the margins of many societies.  This thesis aims to challenge the dominant medical model that has privileged psychiatric knowledges while suppressing others by repositioning indigenous construction at the centre of the research via a Kaupapa M&#257;ori framework. Chapter One aims to deconstruct current medical constructions by presenting psychiatry as a culture in itself as opposed to a discipline dedicated to scientific truths.  This chapter posits that the culture of psychiatry has lead many clinicians to suffer from &#8220;cultural blindness&#8221; when working with indigenous and ethnic minority groups.  Chapter One uses the tools of science to question the scientific validity and reliability of the construct &#8220;schizophrenia&#8221;.  I conclude that this construct is &#8220;unscientific&#8221; in itself.  I will also look at three themes highlighted by other researchers regarding the treatment of mental illness throughout Western history: treatments are used as a form of social control; treatments can be dehumanising; and the dominance and power of the medical model to define who and what is considered ill.   Chapter One also acknowledges the significant role of the consumer movement in developing more humane treatments.  Interactions between culture and psychiatry via colonisation are outlined in Chapter Two. I also critique research that is conducted cross culturally in terms of whether researchers attempt to establish the reliability of universal diagnoses or recognise local and unique constructions.  Chapter Two challenges the commonly cited finding of higher rates of schizophrenia for ethnic minorities and indigenous peoples by questioning the validity of foreign cultural constructs to explain indigenous forms of illness.  This chapter recognises indigenous and cultural constructions of what psychiatry labels &#8216;schizophrenic&#8217;.  To illustrate, three &#8216;culture bound syndromes&#8217; will be discussed.  The development of indigenous psychological paradigms is also presented to position the current research within this wider international movement.  Chapter Three summarises M&#257;ori constructions of illness and wellness.  This chapter predominantly draws from early anthropological literature and subsequent psychological studies to represent the resilience of M&#257;ori constructions of experiences commonly labelled schizophrenic.  In accordance with the experiences of other indigenous populations, this chapter also recognises the impact of colonisation on M&#257;ori beliefs and practices relevant to maintaining wellness.  To illustrate the effect of colonisation, disparities in statistics between M&#257;ori and non-M&#257;ori for admissions and readmissions to inpatients units for psychotic disorders will be discussed.  Explanations for these disparities will also be outlined.  Within Chapter Three, the resistance and revival of M&#257;ori constructions is also recognised as a function of the development of bicultural and Kaupapa M&#257;ori Services.  Chapter Four, summarises the theoretical orientation of the research.  This research is qualitative and assumes a post-modern critical paradigm.  Two theoretical frameworks were used within this research (Kaupapa M&#257;ori Theory and Personal Construct Theory) to represent the two worlds in which the research was conducted (Indigenous and Western).  Chapter Five outlines the methodology by recounting a somewhat layered journey.  Within the first section, &#8216;Who am I&#8217;, I have positioned myself by sharing my journey towards conducting this project.  The second section, &#8216;Where did I want to go&#8217;, outlines the research aims and process of consultation.  The final section summarises &#8216;What I did&#8217; in terms of qualitative interviews and the process undertaken for interpretation and presentation of the data.  Chapter Six presents the results of the research according to the four categories developed from qualitative analysis.  These were: &#8216;Making sense of extra-ordinary experiences&#8217;, &#8216;Pathways of healing&#8217;, &#8216;Making sense of the statistics&#8217; and &#8216;What can we do about the statistics&#8217;.  Within this chapter I have attempted to present quotes with as little interpretation as possible (over and above sorting of themes) to allow the reader to make their own interpretations before reading the discussion.  Chapter Seven summarises the major findings from each category and relates the results to the national and international literature.  Clinical and theoretical implications are discussed with recommendations for future research.  The limitations and strengths of the research are highlighted and conclusions drawn from the research journey.  The plan for dissemination is also presented.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">M&#257;ori psychology</field><field name="subject">schizophrenia</field><field name="subject">Kaupapa M&#257;ori theory</field><field name="subject">Indigenous psychology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::220000 Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts-General</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3367</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of diabetic cardiomyopathy and its treatment by copper chelation</field><field name="creator">Glyn-Jones, Sarah</field><field name="description">Diabetes mellitus is estimated to affect approximately 7% of the populations living a western lifestyle. Of the multiple etiologies associated with diabetes, heart failure is the most common cause of death. A specific type of heart disease called diabetic cardiomyopathy is thought to be partially responsible. At this time, no one specific treatment is available for diabetic cardiomyopathy due to the wide variety of possible complex molecular changes, including metabolic disturbances, myocardial fibrosis, LV hypertrophy, and increased ROS production. Abnormal copper metabolism in diabetes has been proposed to form part of the pathway that leads to diabetic cardiomyopathy. Our group have shown that treatment with the copper (CuII) chelator, triethylenetetramine, ameliorates the effects of diabetes on the heart at both the functional and molecular level. This thesis aimed to further these studies by increasing our understanding of the mechanism of triethylenetetramine action on the diabetic heart. This was primarily achieved through the use of microarray technology but included the use of a range of molecular experimental techniques. During this investigation it was determined that the most suitable microarray platform for our studies was the Affymetrix GeneChip&#174; system. Using this system we identified more than 1600 gene changes associated with diabetes in the left ventricle wall. A disproportionate number of significant messenger RNA transcript changes were associated with the mitochondria and further investigation of these genes revealed changes associated with perturbed lipid metabolism and increased oxidative stress. A second study investigated the molecular mechanisms underpinning improved cardiac function in the left ventricle of the heart from diabetic and sham animals treated with triethylenetetramine. There was an observed decrease in diabetic cardiac tissue triglyceride towards normal, possibly through improvement of the structure and stability of the mitochondria. Only a small number of changes in gene expression were detected after triethylenetetramine treatment using microarray technology, and none were detected using real time-quantitative PCR. The final aim of this thesis was to understand the absorption and excretion of triethylenetetramine by both sham and diabetic animals. Our study found differences in the ability of diabetic animals to absorb and metabolise triethylenetetramine compared to sham animals. Also, the length of exposure was found to be an influencing factor in triethylenetetramine metabolism.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Diabetes</field><field name="subject">Copper chelation</field><field name="subject">Diabetic cardiomyopathy</field><field name="subject">Mitochondria</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2421</field></doc><doc><field name="title">DNA and RNA synthesis in leaves during TYMV replication</field><field name="creator">Bedbrook, John Robert Martin</field><field name="description">1.

Diabetes is a disorder characterised by chronic hyperglycaemia and cardiovascular complications. The relationship between these integrally linked conditions has long been recognised, and for a significant portion of individuals the two conditions co-exist as part of metabolic syndrome. The presence of diabetes increases the risk of heart failure up to fivefold and three-fold in women and men, respectively, when compared to individuals without diabetes. While there has been a significant declining trend in cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in the general population over the past two decades, unfortunately such trends have not been seen among diabetic patients. As a result, this has persuaded many health professionals to re-evaluate their current treatment and pharmacological regimens. It is a well established fact that oxidative stress is a contributory mechanism in many agerelated disorders including T2DM, especially in those with poor glycaemic control. Thus far, clinical trials with antioxidant or carbonyl-trapping agents have produced mixed results, suggesting that the mechanisms underlying this disorder may be more complex than previously thought. Although altered systemic regulation of trace metals in diabetes has been previously investigated, it is still unclear whether changed trace metal metabolism would cause heart disease in common forms of diabetes and whether metal chelation can reverse this condition. Our hypothesis is that the accumulation of redox-active trace metals including Cu and Fe in cardiac muscle may, at least in part, result in cardiomyopathy through the generation of excess reactive oxygen species. We believed that the administration of a specific metal chelator should ameliorate this process by increasing the excretion of free systemic Cu and Fe, consequently limiting the production of superoxide oxygen free radicals and arresting the process of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Data from pre-clinical studies conducted in our laboratory using diabetic animal model with diabetes-induced abnormal Cu metabolism have been remarkably consistent in demonstrating that oral dosing with triethylenetetramine (TETA) can effectively remove systemic Cu via increased urinary Cu excretion, improve cardiomyocyte structure, reverse elevations in left ventricular collagen and &#946;1-integrin, and alleviate heart failure, all in the presence of a consistently high circulating blood glucose profile. Taken together, these findings support the beneficial role of TETA in diabetic animal model and lay the foundation for its potential therapeutic effect in humans with diabetes. This thesis describes a series of randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trials that have investigated the metabolism of Cu and Fe and seven other trace metals in patients with chronic T2DM compared with non-diabetic control subjects. This thesis also examines the mechanism of action of TETA and addresses the hypothesis that a decrease in body systemic Cu pool through chelation therapy may improve cardiac complication in diabetic subjects. Trial 1 is a randomised, double-blind, placebo- and diet-controlled study which measured the 6d balance of Cu and Fe and seven other essential trace metals, in twenty male T2DM and twenty age-matched control subjects in whom we later probed systemic metal balance with oral TETA. Basal urinary output and balance of Cu and Fe was significantly elevated in diabetes, and the two output values correlated strongly (p&lt;0.05). 6d treatment with 2400mg/d dose of TETA (maximum Wilson&#8217;s disease dose) has increased the urinary excretion of Cu, which was predicted by basal urinary Cu excretion, thereby causing a positive Cu balance to become negative in diabetes. Regulation of Cu metabolism was shown to be abnormal in diabetes and was selectively modified by TETA, which did not concomitantly modify Fe metabolism. Moreover, TETA did not cause a negative balance in any of the other seven trace metals monitored. These findings are consistent with TETA reversing the accumulation of free systemic Cu in diabetes, which may help to explain its potential therapeutic effects in some diabetic complications. Trial 2 investigated the acute response effect of a single 2400mg dose of TETA on urinary and serum trace metals in the first 10hr and 10~24hr post-dose. The results showed that TETA markedly increased the urinary Cu and Zn excretion in diabetes for the duration of 10hrs with the maximum excretion phase between 4~6hr post-drug (p&lt;0.05). TETA did not change the metabolism of Mg and six other essential trace metals monitored. Trial 3 examined the dose-response effect of TETA, at and below the dose given to patients with the Wilson&#8217;s disease over a 7d period, on Cu and eight other trace metals in a subgroup of seven T2DM and seven control subjects who had completed trial 1. The results of this i i trial showed that there was a linear dose-response relationship over the dose range 300~2400 mg/d on urinary Cu excretion in both T2DM and control subjects. However, there was no significant difference between the two subject groups at any of the four doses tested. In addition, 300mg/d of TETA was effective in mobilizing Cu in both T2DM and healthy control subjects. Trial 4 described the full work-up of a sensitive LC-MS methodology to identify and quantify TETA and its metabolite(s) in human urine. Using the LC-MS, TETA metabolism and excretion was investigated by analysing the urine of seven T2DM and seven control subjects who received escalating doses of TETA (samples obtained from trial 3). I have successfully identified and characterised two major metabolites of TETA in the urine of both T2DM and control subjects, N1-monoacetytriethylenetetramine (MAT) and diacetytriethylenetetramine (DAT), the latter which has not been previously reported. The results from urinary TETA excretion analyses also showed that T2DM may metabolise TETA more extensively than control subjects, which in turn is associated with its higher uptake or bioavailability. Urinary Zn excretion was mainly linked with urinary TETA and MAT in T2DM and healthy controls, respectively, whereas urinary Cu excretion was associated with urinary TETA excretion in healthy controls and urinary TETA+MAT excretion in T2DM subjects. These results suggest that MAT may also be involved in the mechanism by which TETA extracts systemic free Cu in diabetes. The identification of the two major metabolites of TETA and the development of a robust analytical LC-MS methodology reported in this study is an important step to further investigate the pharmacological actions of TETA in diabetic individuals. Collectively, the results presented in this thesis and in association with previous animal and clinical studies from our laboratory have provided consistent supporting evidences for the use of TETA clinically as a safe and effective therapy to prevent the genesis of some diabetic complications, in conjunction with conventional complication modifying therapies.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Transition metals</field><field name="subject">Trace metals</field><field name="subject">Diabetes</field><field name="subject">Trace metal balance</field><field name="subject">Copper</field><field name="subject">TETA</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2422</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aroha mai: nurses, nursing and mental illness</field><field name="creator">Kidd, Jacqueline Dianne</field><field name="description">This research takes an autoethnographical approach to exploring the connections between being a nurse, doing nursing work, and experiencing a mental illness. Data is comprised of autoethnographical stories from 18 nurses. Drawing on Lyotard&#8217;s (1988) postmodern philosophy of &#8216;regimes of phrases&#8217; and &#8216;genres of discourse,&#8217; the nurses&#8217; stories yielded three motifs: Nursing, Tangata Whaiora (people seeking wellness) and Bullying. Motifs are recurring topical, emotional and contextual patterns which have been created in this research by means of the formation of collective stories from the content of the nurses&#8217; stories, artwork, fictional vignettes and poetry. Interpretation of the motifs was undertaken by identifying and exploring connected or dissenting aspects within and between the motifs. Using Fine&#8217;s (1994) notion of hyphenated lives, the spaces between these aspects were conceptualised as hyphens. The Nursing motif revealed a hyphen between the notion of the nurses as selfless and tireless carers, and the mastery requirements of professionalism. The nurses&#8217; hope for caring, belonging, expertise and &#8216;goodness&#8217; were also features of the nursing motif. The Tangata Whaiora motif revealed the hyphen between being a compliant patient and a self-determined person seeking wellness, and also foreshadowed the notion that the nursing identity does not &#8216;permit&#8217; the dual identities of nurse and tangata whaiora. This research has found that nurses who have experienced, or are vulnerable to, mental illness negotiate a nexus of hyphens between societal, professional and personal expectations of the nurse. Ongoing unsuccessful negotiation of their identities is exhausting and leads to enduring distress. At times, negotiation is not possible and the nurse is immobilised in a differend of silence and injustice. At such times, the only resolution possible for the nurse is to leave the nursing profession. Bullying surfaced as a feature of the hyphen between the nursing and tangata whaiora identities, as well as being a part of each identity as colonising, silencing and/or discriminatory acts. Successful negotiation between and among the nursing and tangata whaiora hyphens requires a radical restructuring of the nursing image and culture across the education, workplace and personal/clinical areas. Three strategies are proposed for the discipline of nursing to achieve this change: transformatory education, a conscientisation programme, and mandatory emancipatory clinical supervision.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mental distress</field><field name="subject">nurses and nursing</field><field name="subject">hyphenated lives</field><field name="subject">bullying</field><field name="subject">caring mastery</field><field name="subject">medal model</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::220000 Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts-General</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321100 Nursing</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::379900 Other Studies In Human Society::379902 Indigenous studies</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2414</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Supporting the emergence of a shared services organisation: Managing change in complex health ICT projects</field><field name="creator">Day, Karen Jean</field><field name="description">Although there is a high risk of failure in the implementation of ICT projects (which appears to extend to health ICT projects), we continue to implement health information systems in order to deliver quality, cost-effective healthcare. The purpose of the research was to participate in and study the change management as a critical success factor in health ICT projects, and to examine people&#8217;s responses to change so as to develop understanding and theory that could be used in future change management programmes. The research was conducted within the context of a large infrastructure project that resulted from the emergence of a shared services organisation (from two participating District Health Boards in Auckland, New Zealand). Action research (AR) formed the basis of the methodology used, and provided the foundation for a change management programme: the AR intervention. Grounded theory (GT) was used for some of the data analysis, the generation of themes by means of constant comparison and the deeper examination of the change process using theoretical sampling. AR and GT together supported the development of theory regarding the change process associated with health ICT projects. Health ICT projects were revealed in the findings as exhibiting the properties of complex adaptive systems. This complexity highlighted the art of change management as a critical success factor for such projects. The fabric of change emerged as a composite of processes linked to project processes and organisational processes. The turning point in the change process from the before state to the after state is marked by a capability crisis which requires effective patterns of leadership, sensitive targeting of communication, effective learning, and management of increased workload and diminishing resources during the course of health ICT projects. A well managed capability crisis period as a component of change management can substantially contribute to health ICT project success.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280100 Information Systems	280102 Information systems management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2476</field></doc><doc><field name="title">AP1: A Platform for Model-Based Software Engineering</field><field name="creator">Lutteroth, Christof</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the AP1 system, which serves as a platform for model-based CASE technology. AP1 is a set of libraries and tools that support different activities in the software development process. It provides different layers of reusable CASE functionality, and thus facilitates CASE tool development and integration. Some key problems of software development are addressed, such as the storage and management of artifacts, their creation and modification, and the generation of program code. The main parts of the abstract platform are a typed repository for models and model data, and a generic editor that acts as an integrated software development environment (IDE). The former enables data integration; the latter serves as a basis for presentation integration. Both parts have an extensible and customizable architecture that makes it possible for developers to adapt the system to their own individual needs.  The thesis discusses different data models, explaining why the parsimonious data model was chosen for the repository. A mapping onto the relational data model is given that makes it possible to leverage a RDBMS for data management. On top of the RDBMS, the AP1 system implements new mechanisms for caching, event notification and change control, resulting in a unique architecture. The thesis introduces novel concepts of robustness and reflection for user interfaces, and delineates their implementation in the generic editor. Furthermore, a concept for code generators is presented that offers a particularly high degree of type-safety, which we call generator type-safety.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">model-based software engineering</field><field name="subject">model-based development</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2464</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experimental analysis of the psychological effect of head injury</field><field name="creator">Gronwall, D. M. A. (Dorothy M. A.)</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to investigate the immediate consequences of concussion. Previous work had either concentrated on memory defects only, included cases of cerebral damage as well as concussion, or examined residual defects persisting after the period of impaired consciousness had ended. It was hoped to determine which function or functions might be affected in concussion by testing only young adult cases of 'pure' concussion in the immediate post-traumatic period. In the main experiment a paced serial addition task was administered to a mildly concussed (MC) and seriously concussed (SC) group at twenty-four-hourly intervals during the hospital period, and thirty to forty days after discharge. A normal control and hospital control group were given the task at similar time intervals. Recent concussion impaired performance and SC Ss needed almost five times as long as controls to process each correct response while MC Ss were about twenty per cent slower, However, responses were qualitatively similar in all groups, and concussed Ss differed only in producing many more late response errors. At retest the MC group had regained control level, but although SC Ss had significantly improved PASAT scores they were still poorer than the other three groups. Experiments II and III investigated stages in the information transmission process which may have produced restricted information processing shown by PASAT results. Reaction and movement times were not longer than normal, although central processing time was. MC Ss did not have significantly slower non-symbolic RTs, or symbolic two- and four-choice RTs, but they differed significantly from controls on eight- and ten-choice symbolic trials. Again this difference between groups was not found at retest four weeks later. Results suggested inefficient 'pigeon-holing' (Broadbent, 1971) as a possible factor in reduced information transmission following concussion. However, a message repetition task indicated no difference between concussed and non-concussed Ss in use of this mechanism. Message repetition also demonstrated that patients had no difficulty in auditory perception of verbal material. In the third stage, normal Ss were given message repetition with and without a concurrent distracting task. Performance during distraction was sufficiently similar to that of recently concussed Ss to suggest that the patient group may have been poorer than controls on the same task only because they also had reduced processing capacity. When given PASAT with a secondary paced task, performance of another group of normal Ss was almost identical to concussed Ss in the first experiment. Finally, to test the possibility that reduced processing capacity was the result of increased distractability, that is, processing task-irrelevant stimuli, an attention task (speech shadowing) was given to a small group of MC Ss and normal controls. There were no instances of intrusions or interference from an irrelevant message to indicate a defect in selective attention, although MC Ss had significantly lower shadowing scores. It was concluded that reduction in processing capacity produced by concussion was a function of patients' lower level of arousal, and that performance resembled that reported in the literature from sleep-deprived Ss and cases of brain-stem damage or dysfunction. A feature of results was the extremely competent performance exhibited by concussion patients, given a reduction in total capacity. Similar optimizing behaviour was evident during distraction tasks, and it was suggested that ability to monitor and control distribution of available processing space by instructions ('set') is a general characteristic of ordered behaviour. This ability was not disturbed by degrees of concussion sustained by experimental Ss in this study. Amnesic symptoms of the immediate post-traumatic period were considered in terms of lowered arousal level. It was proposed that these might be explained by a combination of two factors: (i) processing space insufficient to store items while responding to them, and (ii) tagging of items in storage with levels of concurrent background activity, and thus 'state-dependent' memory. Evidence for a processing deficit existing after termination of the period of PTA was reviewed, and the possibility of permanent effect in terms of increased disability following repeated concussions. Some aspects of results important in considering rehabilitation programmes for head-injured patients were noted.</field><field name="date">1972</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2400</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Disclosure Rules, Manager Discretion and the Relative Informativeness of Earnings Components</field><field name="creator">Teixeira, Alan</field><field name="description">This is a study of earnings quality, examining whether components of earnings based on New Zealand (N.Z.) accounting classification systems have different information parameters. The N.Z. environment provides a unique opportunity to examine a period with no legislative backing of accounting standards and a flexible accounting standard. Combined, this gave mangers the ability to clearly identify earnings components they considered to be differentially informative. Informativeness is assessed by the ability of current period earnings to predict next period earnings and the contemporaneous relation between returns and earnings. The results indicate that disaggregated reported earnings are more informative than aggregated earnings in a non-trivial way. In one of the sample periods disaggregated earnings explained 29% of the variance in returns, more than twice the explanatory power of aggregated earnings. N.Z. accounting standard setters replaced SSAP7 with FRS7 in 1994 contending that the discretion available to mangers reduced the informativeness of earnings. Not only do the results not support that contention but earnings informativeness has fallen since FRS7 came into effect, suggesting that standard setters should revisit that decision. The results also have implications for the content and form of the N.Z. Stock Exchange (NZSE) preliminary announcement. "Unusual earnings" reported to the NZSE by companies are shown to be differentially informative to investors yet the NZSE does not always identify these components when the preliminary announcement is summarised and disseminated to market participants. To summarise, the effective codification of earnings brought about by FRS7 has reduced the informativeness of earnings &#8211; locking differences between components into total earnings. The N.Z. results beg the question as to whether similar economic events are locked into the COMPUSTAT summary earnings variables for U.S. data.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350100 Accounting, Auditing and Accountability</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2401</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the etiology of the leaf blotch disease of Eucalyptus spp. caused by Mycosphaerella nubilosa (Cke) Hansf</field><field name="creator">Ganapathi, Alhagananthan</field><field name="description">A detailed study of the leaf blotch disease, caused by Mycosphaerella nubilosa (Cke.) Hansf. on Eucalyptus regnans F. Muell (Mountain Ash) and E. delegatensis R.T. Baker (Syn. E. gigantea Hook. F., Alpine Ash) was made. The taxonomy of the fungus was studied(illustrations provided) and a previously unidentified imperfect state (Colletogloeum nubilosum) was described along with the spermagonial state (Asteromella). The histology and mode of infection process by ascospores and conidia was examined using Scanning Electron Microscopy, and wax and epoxy resin sections. The development of the fungus within the host was studied up to the stage of mature pseudothecia. The fungus was isolated from diseased tissue and Koch's postulates were carried out to prove pathogenicity. Detailed development of the leaf blotch and twig canker symptoms was followed in the field and in glasshouse conditions. The effect of substrate and environmental conditions on growth and sporulation of the fungus was studied. Controlled environment chambers and glasshouses were used. Several day/night temperature combinations (12/6, 18/12, 24/18 and 30/24C) as well as several light levels (50, 75, 150, 200, 300 and 650 &#956;E) were investigated. The optimum temperature for infection was 24/18C and least infection occurred at 12/6C. The optimum light level for infection was 300 to 650 &#956;E while the slowest infection was obtained at 50 and 75 &#956;E. Under constant temperature conditions infection was most severe at 18C for both E. delegatensis and E. regnans. Wetness periods under sprinklers of one to seven days were compared with similar incubation periods in polythene bags. One-day incubation produced very little infection compared with 2, 4 or 7 days. Incubation in polythene bags gave better results than sprinklers. Experiments showed that leaf and stem infection was not affected by nutrient levels. Leaf expansion rates for both the eucalypt species were followed for twelve weeks to determine the optimum leaf size for infection. Fungicide trials in the field and in-vitro suggested that several chemotherapeutants may be effective in controlling the disease. Diseased leaves from field trials were assessed for ascospore discharge to determine fungal viability. From this study it was shown that diseased (inoculated)"plants lost significantly more leaves than controls. If conditions were optimum for infection, tips of inoculated plants were killed, leading to stem distortion, branching and reduced growth. In general, the fungus causes severe damage on susceptible Eucalyptus spp. in sapling stages.</field><field name="date">1979</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany::270403 Plant pathology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2402</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The second language acquisition of Mandarin nominal syntax</field><field name="creator">Charters, Areta Helen</field><field name="description">This thesis establishes a natural acquisition order for 18 nominal structures in Mandarin SLA, and assesses the extent to which that order can be explained as a consequence of cognitive processing demands. The natural acquisition order is based on a longitudinal study of three adults learning Mandarin in a classroom environment in Auckland, New Zealand. Two representatives of an average emergence order are derived from the three individual orders: a ranking of mean emergence times (RMT) and a ranking of mean emergence ranks (RMR). Processing demands are calculated in three different ways: once on the basis of six developmental stages identified in Pienemann&#8217;s Processability Theory (Pienemann, 1998c), once on the basis of a detailed analysis of each nominal structure according to the generative grammar of LFG (Bresnan, 1982, 2001); and finally on the basis of the Minimalist Programme (Chomsky 1995; 1999; 2000). All rest upon a prior analysis of lexical feature structures and constituent structures evident in the learner&#8217;s output over the course of a year. The standard six-stage model of Processability Theory proves unable to differentiate between most nominal structures, because they fall within the single developmental category of so-called &#8216;phrasal&#8217; structures. However, processing demands calculated on the basis either of LFG or of the MP prove to be highly correlated with both individual and average emergence orders. On the basis of these results, various generalisations are made about the relevance of different kinds of syntactic processes to the determination of emergence order. In particular, c-structural complexity and thematic structure are found to be factors most significantly associated with later emergence times. LFG and MP each provide interesting insights into different aspects of syntactic processing that impact on the acquisition of a second language; LFG throws light on the significance of the grammaticalisation of thematic structure; the MP throws light on the processes of lexical construction, and the interactions between this and constituent structure. Both indicate the significance of delays in feature valuation or unification as c-structural complexity increases.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420100 Language Studies::420114 Chinese languages</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2405</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cytokinins and the division or expansion of plant cells</field><field name="creator">Beuning, Lesley L.</field><field name="description">The effect of cytokinins was studied in three systems: the alga Chlorella, callus cultures and etiolated cucumber cotyledons. In Chlorella cultures: 1) A range of concentrations of 6BA and IP had no effect on growth; 2) Low concentrations of an anticytokinin had no effect on growth, whereas higher concentrations appeared to be inhibitory. 3) Characterisation of the Chlorella species suggested that it was surrounded by an impermeable sporopollenin layer which hindered the uptake of cytokinin. 4) The uptake of radioactive adenine occurred readily, whereas the uptake of radioactive 6BA was very slow in both growing and saturated cultures of Chlorella. 5) Extracts isolated from Chlorella and the medium in which Chlorella was growing contained cytokinin-like activity in two bioassays. 6) HPLC analyses of these extracts showed that there were fractions which eluted at the positions of IP and IPA. In callus cultures: A.1) A carrot callus was grown from the secondary phloem of the storage root of carrot. 2) This callus, which was grown on 2,4-D and kinetin, produced roots and shoots when subcultured onto IAA and kinetin. 3) Growth on 2,4-D alone was independent of the presence of kinetin. 4) Growth was inhibited in the presence of an anticytokinin, suggesting that the callus produced a cytokinin. B.1) A tobacco callus was grown from a young leaf of tobacco. 2) This callus habituated to cytokinin independence following subculture onto lower concentrations of kinetin. 3) Subculture of the habituated callus onto a higher concentration of kinetin resulted in the production of roots and shoots. C.1) Cytokinin-dependent soybean and tobacco callus cultures were obtained from the Botany Department, University of Otago. 2) Analysis of the total proteins from suspension and callus cultures of soybean by 1-D polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed one small 6BA-induced change in the proteins from the suspension cultures. In etiolated cucumber cotyledons: 1) 6BA caused the expansion of excised etiolated cucumber cotyledons after a 24h-hour incubation in the dark in a solution containing 6BA, in comparison to cotyledons incubated in water only. 2) The cotyledons curved upwards and in the light microscope the cells of the vascular bundles and the lower epidermis exhibited greater expansion than the upper epidermis. 3) Electron microscopic examination showed that the central vacuole of palisade cells from cotyledons treated with 6BA had expanded and that the cytoplasm had probably lost water and was compressed by the vacuole against the cell wall. 4) In contrast to other research, there was no apparent increase in polysome formation in 6BA-treated cotyledons in comparison to untreated cotyledons examined in the electron microscope. 5) A number of protein extraction methods were tried before a method was found which produced a protein extract suitable for both 1-D and 2-D polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analyses. 6) 1-D and 2-D polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that a number of proteins either increased or decreased following the treatment of cotyledons with 6BA. 7) A number of RNA extraction methods were tried, to obtain RNA suitable for translation in vitro. Only one method produced RNA which appeared to be free of contaminating substances. Weak translation of this RNA was obtained in vitro and it might be possible to develop conditions for optimal translation of the RNA given an adequate supply of an in vitro translation system.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2406</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Magpies: negotiations of centre and periphery in settings of New Zealand poems by New Zealand composers, 1896 to 1993</field><field name="creator">Shieff, Sarah</field><field name="description">The thesis will show that a distinctive New Zealand voice in the arts may be found not in an "essence", as has sometimes been suggested, but at chronologically specific intersections of discourses. Each of the six works I examine has been made in New Zealand and is a mixture of music and language. As generic hybrids, combinations of music and language make appropriate objects of study for a thesis that explores a specific local dialogue between the 'mixture' and the 'essence', the 'hybrid' and the 'authentic', the 'indigenous' and the 'exotic', the 'local' and the 'imported', the 'centre' and the 'periphery.' Like acquisitive magpies, New Zealand artists constantly collect and select their material. They sift, save, reject and synthesise, and in so doing they create new combinations out of old ingredients. One of the characteristics of New Zealand poetry is that it has often been combined with music. There have been many collaborations between poets and musicians since colonial times. These collaborative texts occupy a complex space between art forms, just as New Zealand artists negotiate between orientations, positioning themselves between different cultural traditions. In its own process of selection, the thesis selects six works for close analysis which represent not only different periods but also different forms of synthesis. Each work represents 'New Zealand', yet what this means in practice is different in each case.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2413</field></doc><doc><field name="title">About turn:neural mechanisms underlying visual processing of rotated letters and digits</field><field name="creator">Milivojevic, Branka</field><field name="description">This thesis explores neural activity associated with processing of rotated alphanumeric characters, focusing particularly on linear and quadratic trend components of orientation-dependent activity. Choice of these components was driven by results of reaction-time (RT) studies; judging whether characters are normal or backward (parity task) typically elicit RTs that are linearly related to character disorientation, implying mental rotation of the characters to the upright, while judging whether they are letters or digits (categorisation task) elicits RTs related nonlinearly to disorientation, combining both linear and quadratic component, but not indicative of mental rotation. In Experiment 1 neural activity was monitored using fMRI while participants performed these tasks. In the next two experiments, neural processing was monitored with high-density EEG. In Experiment 2 participants performed the same two tasks, while in Experiment 3 they performed the category task and red-blue colour judgements. In Experiment 1, linear increases in fMRI activation were elicited only by the parity task and were observed in the posterior portion of the dorsal intraparietal sulcus and lateral and medial pre-supplementary motor areas, suggesting a fronto-parietal network underlying mental rotation. Experiment 2 showed that linear increases in parietal negativity between 350 and 710 ms only evident in the parity task, again indicating that mental rotation is only elicited by that task. Contrary to previous evidence, Experiment 2 indicated that both hemispheres may be involved in mental rotation, but rotation is faster in the right hemisphere than in the left hemisphere. Experiment 1 also showed that effects of orientation common to both tasks were best characterised by a quadratic trend, and were restricted to the supramarginal gyrus. This activation was interpreted as representing orientation-dependent shape recognition. Experiments 2 and 3 also revealed orientation-dependent neural activity at three distinct stages prior to mental rotation. First, on the P1 component, there was a difference between oblique and vertical orientations, suggesting the extraction of orientation based on axis of elongation. Next, orientation affected the N1 component, with longer latencies and larger amplitudes with misorientation, and smaller effects for inversion than for intermediate angular rotations. Finally, changes in orientation affected the P2 component differently for the parity and category tasks, probably signalling the perception of orientation relative to a parity-defined memory representation, and serving as a preparation for mental rotation. These experiments identify both the orientation-specific neural processing that occurs prior to the onset of mental rotation, and the subsequent neural correlates of mental rotation itself.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Object recognition</field><field name="subject">Spatial orientation</field><field name="subject">Mental rotation</field><field name="subject">Neural mechanisms</field><field name="subject">fMRI</field><field name="subject">EEG</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2433</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Amplitude resolution by human and ideal observers for Rayleigh noise and other Gaussian processes</field><field name="creator">Hautus, Michael J. (Michael John)</field><field name="description">The ability of human observers to discriminate aural differences in the amplitude of sinusoids, narrow-band noise, and wide-band noise was measured by the rating method of detection theory. Although each sinusoid (always 1000 Hz) was presented at a fixed amplitude, its amplitude on any trial was drawn from one of two Rayleigh probability distributions that differed in mean amplitude. Similarly, the amplitudes of the narrow-band noises were distributed as the Rayleigh distribution by virtue of the reciprocal relation between their bandwidth (100 Hz centred on 1000 Hz) and duration (10 ms). The amplitudes of the wide-band noises were distributed as chi with 82 degrees of freedom. A detection-theoretic model based on chi-square density functions was fitted to the obtained receiver operating characteristics (ROCs) and psychometric functions. The best-fitting ROCs required, on the average, 4.1 degrees of freedom for the 100-ms sinusoids and 7.3 degrees of freedom for the Rayleigh noise. The best-fitting psychometric function for both the Rayleigh noise and the sinusoids required about one degree of freedom. The results obtained for these two waveforms were not significantly different. The obtained ROCs for the wide-band noise were well fitted by the chi-square model with 82 degrees of freedom and the psychometric functions with 6.1 degrees of freedom. The best-fitting parameters for the wide- and narrow-band waveforms were significantly different. Furthermore, the performance of the observers on the nmow-band waveforms was closer to that of the corresponding ideal observer than was their performance on the wide-band waveforms. For the narrow-band noise and sinusoids, the duration of the waveform affected the variability of the best-fitting degrees of freedom for the obtained ROCs. This variability was greater for waveforms of 10-ms duration (Rayleigh noise and sinusoids) than for sinusoids of 100-ms duration; this greater variability was interpreted as stemming from the difficulty of correctly windowing short-duration waveforms. Sound pressure level had no effect on the amplitude resolution of observers for four different levels of Rayleigh noise and of sinusoids. Therefore Weber's Law, and not the near miss to Weber's Law, holds for these waveforms. The chi-square detection-theoretic model provided a good fit to the data from all experiments, but not as good as predicted by statistical theory. It was concluded that the chi-square model provides a close approximation to the underlying mechanisms involved in the amplitude resolution of Gaussian noise processes.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2417</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adolescent gambling in New Zealand: an exploration of protective and risk factors</field><field name="creator">Rossen, Fiona</field><field name="description">Despite a growing appreciation in New Zealand of the harms arising from gambling, there remains a lack of knowledge and awareness of the dangers associated with participation in gambling by young people. Although international research has demonstrated that young people are a high-risk group with regard to problem gambling, research in New Zealand has only investigated the gambling behaviour of those aged 18 and over. This thesis explores a topic that has been largely neglected within New Zealand: the relevance of gambling and problem gambling for New Zealand adolescents. A questionnaire consisting of both standardised and non-standardised items, was administered to a random sample of more than 2000 secondary school students in the Upper North Island. The role of gambling in adolescent life, the prevalence of adolescent problem gambling, and associated risk factors were investigated. This research also adopted a largely unique perspective within the youth gambling field, extending investigations to include the role of protective factors, particularly social connectedness. This investigation of protective factors supports strengths-based approaches to youth behavioural issues, with the potential to aid in the prevention or minimisation of harm, as opposed to approaches that focus upon responding to problems, as is encouraged by dysfunction-based models. This research demonstrates that gambling is part of youth culture in New Zealand. It provides the first body of data detailing the practices, beliefs, and other factors associated with adolescent gambling behaviour within New Zealand. The findings indicate that choices around gambling are strongly influenced by contextual factors and that young New Zealander&#8217;s participate in a wide variety of gambling modes. While most gamble safely, approximately four percent were observed to satisfy the problem gambling criteria. Social connectedness was strongly correlated to problem gambling behaviour and the research points towards the investigation of protective factors, resiliency, and strengths-based strategies in the future. The continuing exploration of common denominators between gambling and other dangerous consumptions also offer promising avenues for future research within the gambling field. This research demonstrates that youth gambling is an issue requiring the attention of families, communities, schools, researchers, government departments, and members of the gambling industries.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2611</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Continuity and change in a hospital ward : an open systems analysis</field><field name="creator">McMorland, Judith Ceridwen Irangani</field><field name="description">Using a voluntaristic theory of action and Buckley&#8217;s (1967) paradigm of complex adaptive systems, explanation of the process of change in organisations is attempted. The specific question addressed is why some changes, rather than others, are incorporated into organisational arrangements. This thesis has three parts. The first is a theoretical statement of Buckley&#8217;s model and an argument for the extension of this scheme in two important respects. The second is an extended case study of a psychiatric ward of a general hospital to which the model is applied. The third is a theoretical re-statement of the original paradigm in the light of this application. Buckley&#8217;s model was used to identify: 1.	The external and internal variety which may affect an organisation 2.	The tension-producing factors within the organisational arrangement which constrain actor&#8217;s choice of response to variety 3.	The processes whereby actors selectively map responses to variety 4.	The processes for the transmission and perpetuation of stable accommodations to variety. Two adaptations were made initially to Buckley&#8217;s scheme. To explain more fully the process of &#8216;mapping&#8217; ((3) above), two constructs are proposed, derived from the concept of the phenomenal &#8216;self&#8217;. These are &#8216;meaning system&#8217; and &#8216;dramatic repertoire of self-presentation&#8217;. Inclusion of Koestlers&#8217; (1967) concept of the open-ended hierarchy of awareness is suggested as a theoretical solution to the problem of homeostasis ((4) above) in systems of action. Argument for the use of an open systems approach in general, and Buckley&#8217;s paradigm in particular, together with the proposed amendments of Buckley&#8217;s scheme is presented in Chapters I and II. The case study is presented in Chapters III-VIII. Chapter III is a review of the historical factors which provide the context for the study, while changes occurring in the nursing, medical and non-medical sub-systems are discussed in turn, in Chapters, IV, V and VI respectively. Chapter VII identifies four scenes of social encounter in the ward and discusses the process of interaction occurring in each. Chapter VIII is an epilogue which examines briefly the outcome of events mentioned in the earlier chapters. Chapter IX is a statement of the conclusions drawn from the case study. The value of Buckley&#8217;s paradigm in the construction of an extended case study is demonstrated and the importance of the concepts of &#8216;mapping&#8217; and &#8216;perpetuation&#8217; is highlighted because they permit explanation of macrosocial processes which remain fully within the social context and point to the importance of identifying the dramatisation of power in social encounters. The initial harnessing of action theory and systems theory concepts was found to be too limited. A theoretical solution is, therefore, proposed in Chapter X which is capable of explaining system elaboration in the two dimensions of &#8216;organisation&#8217; and &#8216;self&#8217;. The model takes into account the dialectic tensions existing between &#8216;self/organisation&#8217; and &#8216;stability/change&#8217;, and differentiates between evolutionary and revolutionary change, making explicit both the constitutive processes of interaction and the interplay of forces affecting the individual and social order.</field><field name="date">1980</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370100 Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2426</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The use of pistis and cognate words in the Apostolic Fathers</field><field name="creator">Gilmour, Thomas Calum</field><field name="description">The Apostolic Fathers is the name given to the body of literature, written in Greek, which dates from immediately after the New Testament period. The works cover the last decade of the 1st century AD, and the first half of the second century. They give a varied picture of the moral and doctrinal state of the early Christian Church in a period characterised by constant threat of persecution and martyrdom on the one hand, and growth in theological and ethical understanding on the other. The works considered in this thesis are the genuine letters of Ignatius; the Shepherd of Hermas; the Epistle of Barnabas and the Didache; the letter to Diognetus; the Clementine Homily (commonly called II Clement); the letters of Polycarp to the Philippians and the Martyrdom of Polycarp. The study begins with an essay on the development of the language of faith. This traces the use of the pistis group from Homer to the New Testament, and shows how the Homeric and Classical Greek usages were taken by the Septuagint and applied in a religious context to God and salvation, and how this process was further developed in the New Testament into a full-blown technical vocabulary of faith. The Apostolic Fathers take this process a step further, and there is a broadening of the meanings of the cognates, together with resultant changes in the linguistic usage. All the occurrences of pistis and its cognates in the Apostolic Fathers are examined in detail. In each case there is comment of the meaning of the words within the wider context in which they are set in each work. The Greek is given, together with a translation, and obscure passages are elucidated.</field><field name="date">1982</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420100 Language Studies::420107 Greek</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2428</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Responses of Cucurbita pepo and Cucurbita maxima to ethrel</field><field name="creator">Hume, Robert James</field><field name="description">Many commercial crops of Cucurbita maxima and C. pepo are grown from Fl hybrid seed in New Zealand. Conventional methods of Fl seed production are labour intensive and expensive. Applying Ethrel sprays at 300ppm at the two and four leaf stage to the seed bearing parent delayed male flowering for sufficient time to allow insect pollination and eliminate 90% of the labour previously needed. After field trials the technique was used on a commercial scale. A satisfactory yield of pure Fl seed with a high germination percentage was produced. The variation between cultivars in response to Ethrel means that each one must be tested. It is shown that the degree and type of epinasty of pot plants sprayed with Ethrel can be used to determine the appropriate concentrations for field trials of C. pepo. The increase in female flower numbers, the shift in position of these flowers on the mainstem and the suppression of male flower numbers is brought about by two mechanisms. Ethrel sprays caused male flower bud abortion and an increase in the number of female flowers developing. More than one flower bud is borne in each leaf axil and if male, the bud aborts and can be replaced by a subsidiary undifferentiated bud which develops as a female. At the two to four leaf stage of plant development and shortly afterwards a large number of flower buds are developing to the stage of sexual differentiation. Spraying with Ethrel at these time is very effective in influencing sex expression. The release of ethylene by Ethrel breakdown continues for several days and the continuous exposure to ethylene is another reason for Ethrel&#8217;s effectiveness. The time course of ethylene release from aqueous Ethrel solutions was determined in some physical systems as well as from cotyledon and leaf surface contact. Some ethylene was released when Ethrel was applied to soil. When Ethrel was dried on surfaces or in soil its breakdown was much reduced, but on rewetting proceeded again. Spraying only one leaf with Ethrel still caused responses from other parts of the plant indicating transmission of a stimulus. This was not caused by aerial diffusion from the sprayed leaf. Although several effects of ethylene were studied major emphasis was placed on epinasty, stimulation of endogenous ethylene and its distribution between plant parts, the abortion of male flowers and the induction of female flowers. When aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG) was applied with Ethrel, the plants show epinastic responses and male flower abortion but not female flower induction, endogenous ethylene production or transfer of stimuli of Ethrel effects within the plant. Ethylene gas was similarly ineffective on plants treated with AVG. Ethylenebiodynthesis is blocked at the stage producing aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) the immediate precursor of ethylene. Assays showed ACC to be below detectable levels in AVG treated plants. Ethrel alone caused high levels of ACC and ACC was found in high levels in plant apices if leaf one was sprayed with Ethrel. ACC is mobile in plants and a firm correlation is shown between female flower bud production and the presence of ACC. It was concluded the ethylene released from Ethrel sprays caused epinasty and male flower bud abortion as well as promoting endogenous ethylene production via ACC. Ethrel sprays release ethylene in sufficient quantity for long enough for very high levels of ACC to be produced and ACC is transported throughout the plant, but preferentially to metabolic sinks, e.g. the plant apices, where embryonic buds respond by developing as female flower buds. Increased ethylene levels were also recorded at these sites. Because ACC has been shown to cause a plant response formerly attributed to ethylene it is now essential to investigate the whole spectrum of &#8216;ethylene&#8217; effects in plants.</field><field name="date">1982</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2430</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Independens long Vanuatu: the churches and politics in a Melanesian nation</field><field name="creator">Myers, Michael David</field><field name="description">In this dissertation I examine the relationship between the churches and politics in Vanuatu, focusing in particular on the role of the Christian churches in the independence movement of the 1970s. I also look at the political involvement of the churches in the two years immediately following national independence. The dissertation is based on fieldwork in Vanuatu from April 1981 to June 1982. In Chapter I, I introduce and defend my national, institutional perspective on the churches. In Chapter II, I discuss the history of Vanuatu, focusing specifically on the history of the missions up to the end of the 1960s. Chapter III looks at the independence movement and recent political history. In Chapter IV I examine the relationship between the churches and politics in two contrasting rural areas: at the Catholic mission station of Walarano, Malakula, and at the Presbyterian area of White Sands, Tanna. Chapter V is concerned with the ecumenical movement in the Pacific and looks at the support of the Pacific churches for the independence movement in Vanuatu. Chapters VI to X are parallel histories of the same period. They all look at the involvement of the churches in Vanuatu politics from about the beginning of the 1970s - when the independence movement began - up to national independence on 30 July 1980. However, each chapter is written from a different perspective. Chapter VI documents the political involvement of the Presbyterian Church; Chapter VII is concerned with Bishop Raweliffe and the politics of Anglicanism; Chapter VIII looks at the political role of the Roman Catholic Church in Vanuatu; Chapter IX focuses mostly on the relationship between the Churches of Christ and Nagriamel; and Chapter X takes a look at the ecumenical movement in Vanuatu and the origins and development of the New Hebrides Christian Council. In Chapter XI I examine the post-independence developments in all the major churches. Chapter XII concludes with a discussion of three issues: localisation, independence and unity, both in the churches and in the nation.</field><field name="date">1984</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370300 Anthropology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::430000 History and Archaeology::430100 Historical Studies::430103 History: Pacific</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2435</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Degradation and utilisation of mucins by anaerobic bacteria from the colon</field><field name="creator">Stanley, Roger Anthony</field><field name="description">Intestinal mucins are high-molecular-weight complex glycoproteins which are thought to be fermented by the anaerobic bacteria in the colon. The aim of this thesis was to investigate the mode and extent of mucin degradation by bacteria. A method was developed to isolate gram quantities of soluble pig colonic mucin and pig gastric mucin. These preparations, along with commercially available pig gastric mucin, were incorporated into bacterial growth media as the sole carbohydrate energy sources. The molecular size and chemical composition of these mucins was determined before and after in vitro digestion by bacteria. Three different studies were done. In the first, type cultures of Bacteroides fragilis were found to be capable of growing on gastric and colonic mucins by cleaving residues from the non-reducing ends of the mucin oligosaccharide chains. Mucin degradation, however, was limited to the removal of only a few residues although this may be significant in vivo as bacteria in the gut lumen must be able to utilise many different complex polysaccharides and thus do not specialise in degrading any one substrate. In the second experiment, bacteria were isolated from the mucus layer of the pig colon. Three of the cultures studied extensively degraded mucins but colonic mucin was always more resistant to attack than the gastric mucins. Up to 80 mol% of the gastric mucin carbohydrates were cleaved and utilised. In contrast these bacteria utilised no more than 46 mol% of the colonic mucin carbohydrates. In the third study, fresh rat faecal material was used to inoculate bacterial media containing either colonic mucin or commercial gastric mucin. The faecal bacteria had completely degraded the gastric mucin after 24 h incubation but 36 h incubation was required to degrade the colonic mucin. However, when bacteria from the colonic mucin tubes were subcultured into fresh colonic mucin it was completely fermented after 24h incubation. It is hypothesis that, although the chemical compositions were similar, colonic mucin contained bonds that were not present in the gastric mucin. Evidence for this was obtained by assaying the mucins using the histochemical periodic acid/Schiff and Alcian blue stains. The Alcian blue reactivity was more conserved than PAS staining during bacterial hydrolysis. Therefore hydrolysis of these Alcian blue reactive groups may be the rate-limiting step in colonic mucin degradation. The molecular basis of the PAS and Alcian blue stains was investigated. PAS stain (0.01% periodic acid) was found to react with terminal neuraminic acid, fucose and possibly galactose residues but not with hexosamine residues. Alcian blue stain bound mainly to sulphate esters but could not be correlated with total sulphate content. When both these colorimetric Alcian blue and PAS stains were use together they provided a valuable tool for assaying the results of chromatography runs. Gastric mucin was show to be composed of separate neutral (Alcian blue negative) and acidic (Alcian blue positive) glycoproteins. Colonic mucin contained only acidic glycoproteins.</field><field name="date">1982</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2434</field></doc><doc><field name="title">PulA, a thermostable pullulanase from an extreme thermophile Caldocellum saccharolyticum</field><field name="creator">Albertson, Gregory David</field><field name="description">The pullulanase gene from Caldocellum saccharolyticum, an obligate thermophilic anaerobe, was sequenced and expressed in E. coli. Expression and substrate induction studies in E. coli showed that while gene expression was substrate inducible and the enzyme was exported into the growth medium in C. saccharolyticum, expression was non-inducible in E. coli and the enzyme remained in the cytoplasm. The nucleotide sequence of the pulA gene was shown to be 2478 basepairs (bp) in length, coding for a protein of 96 kDa. The proposed promoter sequences showed homology to both the standard E. coli sequences and the consensus sequences obtained from other C. saccharolyticum genes. The enzyme from the native organism was purified from the growth medium and shown to have a molecular mass of approximately 120 kDa. Periodic acid-Schiffs staining showed that this enzyme was glycosylated and substrate characterisation revealed that the enzyme debranched pullulan to produce only maltotriose, but hydrolysed amylopectin, amylose and &#946;-limit dextran to produce a number of smaller oligosaccharides. The enzyme was expressed in E. coli from its own promoters and was purified from the cytoplasmic fraction. Substrate characterisation revealed that the enzyme debranched pullulan to produce only maltotriose, but had only limited activity on &#946;-limit dextran and amylopectin, and no activity on amylose. The pullulanase gene was also expressed under the control of a heat-inducible overexpression system in E. coli and a copper-inducible expression system in yeast. Amino acid homology comparisons of the pullulanase to other pullulanase sequences and related enzymes revealed a high degree of homology, particularly around three highly conserved regions. In &#945;-amylases amino acids in these regions are involved in catalytic activity, substrate binding and metal ion binding.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2436</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Social Credit, an analysis of New Zealand&#8217;s perennial third party</field><field name="creator">Miller, Raymond, 1953-</field><field name="description">The main purpose of this thesis is to provide a history and political analysis of the organisation, policies, membership and leadership of the Social Credit party between 1953 and 1986. The introductory chapter describes the methodology and reviews the literature on third parties in general and Social Credit in particular. Chapter Two provides a prelude to the formation of the Social Credit Political League in 1953. It traces the movement's decline as an education and pressure group under the first Labour Government. Chapter Three examines the debate surrounding the decision t o engage in direct political action and describes the process by which the Political League was formed. Chapter Four considers the reasons for and the findings of the Royal Commission on Monetary, Banking and Credit Systems (1956) and accounts for the growing internal debate culminating in the removal of Mr Wilfrid Owen as Leader in 1959. In Chapter Five the impact on the party of Mr Vernon Cracknell's victory in Hobson in 1966 is considered, along with an assessment of his role in Parliament as the sole third party representative. The reasons for his defeat at the 1969 general election and replacement as Leader some six months later are investigated, and Chapter Six is devoted to the brief but stormy experiment with Mr John O'Brien as Leader, followed by his split from the League in 1972 and the formation of the New Democrat Party. The early Beetham years, including attempts to revise the party's monetary reform dogma, broaden the scope of its message, and to give it a more professional organisation are considered in Chapter Seven. I n Chapter Eight the reasons for and the internal consequences of the party's rapid rise in popularity from early 1978 and its decline after March 1981 are analysed. The chapter ends with an account of Mr Beetham's defeat as Leader in 1986. The thesis concludes that Social Credit's history as an electoral organisation has been conspicuously cyclical, that its progress has been regulated largely by the electoral performances of the two major parties and by the presence or absence of minor party competition, that its leadership has been distinctly oligarchic, and that Social Credit has not been one, but several different parties. Why has the party not been more successful? And why has it lasted so long? These questions are addressed in the final chapter.</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2437</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Facilitating independent learning early in the first year of school</field><field name="creator">Watson, Barbara</field><field name="description">This is a study of a) the nature and incidence of independent learning defined as "knowing how to generate and direct the processes of learning...*(see p.3) in new entrant classroom settings and, b) the nature of the teacher-child interactions associated with such independent learning. Systematic observation was used at school entry and three months later, to identify aspects of independent learning and the associated teacher behaviours. Six categories of child directed acts identified the range of behaviours from which independent learning could be inferred. Each category of teacher behaviour that appeared to facilitate independent learning in children was developed as a "mirror image" of each category of child directed acts. The teacher and four children in two new entrant classes were observed over the whole day for five days during two observation periods, one at the beginning of Term three and the other after 12 weeks. Each class was involved in normal classroom activities that covered the whole curriculum. The children were engaging in a considerable amount of independent learning on entry to school and three months later. Many facilitative teaching acts occurred in the interactive style that was demonstrated in all aspects of the curriculum. The teachers spent a considerable portion of teaching time assisting children in one-to-one teaching situations and in small groups, encouraging their responses and fostering and supporting independence in their learning. There was some difference observed between teachers in the attention given to different categories and in the facilitative behaviour occurring in one-to-one interactions and small group teaching interactions. A way of teaching emerges that differs from a teaching agenda determined by didactic, traditional instruction. The two teachers were deemed to be using the children's agenda to foster and support them in independent learning in the various curriculum areas. Some of the practical and philosophical features of the New Zealand education system that may contribute to this particular style of teaching are discussed. The theories of learning and teaching deriving from this study place a value on independent learning (as here defined) in new entrant children and on the teacher&#8217;s role in providing opportunities for it to develop. Independent learning a) ensures the continuation of learning at times when the teacher is directly engaged with other children, and b) derives from a teacher expectation that children will be able to actively process ideas and make some decisions about their learning. It engenders a power in children that sustains the momentum of learning.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2438</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecology of the New Zealand glowworm Arachnocampa luminosa (Skuse) (Diptera : Lycetophilidae) in tourist caves at Waitomo</field><field name="creator">Pugsley, Chris, 1953-</field><field name="description">The New Zealand glowworm Arachnocampa luminosa (Diptera: Mycetophilidae) provides the national tourist industry with a unique attraction. The Glowworm Cave at Waitomo has an international reputation for the bioluminescent display produced by A. luminosa. The aim of the present study was to investigate glowworm ecology in the tourist caves at Waitomo, the results to provide factual information so that scientifically sound management procedures could be devised to ensure the long term survival of the population. The literature on all aspects of A. luminosa is reviewed. A continuous cycle of development occurs with most stages present throughout the year. However, the majority of the larval population pupates in late winter/early spring, producing a new generation in spring/early summer. There are five larval instars; the time for individual development in the Glowworm Cave varies considerably but is estimated to take 5 months on average. Distribution of glowworms is dependent on an adequate food supply, cool, moist climate and a suitable horizontal rock surface. Their diet consists of chironomids with some tipulids, ephemeropterans and trichopterans, most of which emerge inside the cave. Factors likely to influence distribution and productivity of benthic fauna in the cave are reviewed, including the importance of flooding and stream drift fauna in restocking the cave. Mortality is caused by two species of opiliones, cannibalism and a fungal pathogen identified as Tolypocladium sp. (Moniliales). Preliminary experiments with Tolypocladium indicate that the higher temperatures of the Glowworm Cave may be responsible for the prevalence of the fungus compared with non-tourist caves in the district. Observations on cave climate showed that the Glowworm Cave now has a higher range of temperature and relative humidity compared with earlier records and non-tourist caves at Waitomo. This is attributed in part to the free flow of air that occurs between the two entrances of the cave and the outside atmosphere. Reasons for the decline in the glowworm display that has occurred in the past few years are discussed. The installation of an open grille on the Top Entrance of the Glowworm Cave in 1975 is suggested as one of the main factors responsible. Future research projects are mentioned, together with recommendations for cave management related to glowworm ecology.</field><field name="date">1980</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2439</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biosystematic studies in Pomaderris Labill</field><field name="creator">Harvey, Catherine Frances</field><field name="description">Interest in Pomaderris was initiated by the chromosome counts reported by Hair (1963). Chromosome numbers for the following taxa are confirmed: P. kumeraho A. Cunn. 2n = 24, P. aspera Sieber (cultivated) 2n = 24, P. phylici-folia Lodd. 2n = 48, P. rugosa Cheeseman 2n = 48, P. erici-folia Hook. 2n = 36, P. hamiltonii L.B. Moore 2n = 36, P. edgerleyi Hook. 2n = 37, P. novae-zelandiae stat.nov. 2n = 36. In P. kumeraho, breeding experiments, and studies of the ovule show that plants are self fertile, and reproduction is sexual. Microsporogenesis studies show some asyndesis, and the presence of fragments of unexplained origin at meiosis. Half the microspores formed are inviable. The triploid taxa reproduce by agamospermy. The origin of the embryo sac is diplosporous. Although breeding experiments indicate that pollination improves seed set, endosperm chromosome counts in P. hamiltonii show that fertilisation of the endosperm nucleus does not occur. A physiological stimulatory effect from pollination is postulated. At microsporogenesis in the triploid taxa, some restitution occurs at the first meiotic division with the formation of large unreduced pollen grains. The rate of restitution is variable and is affected by both environmental and genetic factors. Restitution is correlated with high univalent frequency, and restituting cells exhibit little Anaphase I movement of chromosomes. Pollen of triploids is highly variable in size, pore number, and viability. P. phylicifolia shows mostly bivalents at meiosis, producing 25-30% viable pollen with reduced chromosome number. Reproduction is mainly sexual, but there is some indication that agamospermy may also occur. P. rugosa shows a high proportion of multivalents at meiosis, and segregation is irregular. Viable pollen with a reduced chromosome number is below 5%. Restitution may occur at meiosis under certain conditions. Reproduction is presumed to be agamospermous. The comparative morphology of the New Zealand and Australian taxa of Pomaderris was also studied from herbarium specimens. The data were analysed using numerical taxonomic methods. Four clusters of O.T.U.s are identified, but many O.T.U.s are intermediate in morphology and do not belong to a cluster. The New Zealand taxa are spread among the four clusters. Each N.Z. taxon is closer to an Australian taxon than to other N.Z. taxa. Pollen of Australian specimens was compared with pollen of known N.Z. polyploids. The existence of polyploids and apomicts among the Australian taxa is suggested. Taxonomy and origin of the New Zealand polyploid taxa are discussed.</field><field name="date">1982</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2441</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Labour mobility and economic transformation in Solomon Islands: lusim Choiseul, bae kam baek moa?</field><field name="creator">Friesen, Wardlow.</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the relationship of labour mobility and socioeconomic transformation in the Solomon Islands, and proposes that one cannot be understood in isolation from the other. Explanation is pursued both at the levels of structure and of agency, and integration of these levels is attempted in some places. This is discussed in the first part of the thesis, within a general discussion of issues of theory and method. The second part of the thesis deals with the structural parameters of labour mobility. Through the twentieth century, the institutions of government, mission and capitalist enterprise have been central in shaping the Solomon Islands social formation. The roles of these formal institutions with implications for labour mobility have ranged from purveyors of ideology to employers of labour. Another major element in the social formation is an original Melanesian mode of production which influences labour mobility through village-level institutions such as the land tenure system, kinship, and household operation. Labour circulation is a major factor in linking village and non-village institutions, and more abstractly in articulating two different modes of production. The third part of the thesis considers the ways in which individual agency operates within structure. The data base are life histories and related information from the Mbambatana language group on the island of Choiseul. This is integrated with national, regional and village-level structural information. Education is important in the way it 'selects' individuals for certain kinds of employment. This selection process occurs within the wage economy generally, but is further refined within institutions of employment. This results in labour mobility 'streams' which have identifiable characteristics related to gender, education, and employment type. Movements within each 'stream' have typical temporal and spatial characteristics. Patterns of labour mobility, especially sequence, are affected by gender and life cycle factors. For men and women the most critical changes take place in the 20s age span, but individual behaviour varies according to marriage and childrearing patterns. From a village perspective, labour circulation is a logical response to the necessity of operating within two different economic systems typified by different modes of production. This process of articulation is manifest in other ways as well, and households or families may adopt different strategies in operating within two different systems. The particular strategy adopted depends on the labour power available, degree of access to land, and employment possibilities of individual members.</field><field name="date">1986</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370400 Human Geography::370402 Social and cultural geography</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2442</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The structure of reovirus</field><field name="creator">Metcalf, Peter</field><field name="description">The arrangement of the capsomers comprising the outer shell or capsid of reovirus has been determined by the computer modeling of images of reovirus replicas prepared by freeze-etching techniques. An optical low-pass spatial filter was used to improve the visibility of the virus images and two types of capsid subunit could then be seen which were termed ring and pentamer-crater capsomers. Sufficient of them could be identified on reovirus particles to make the computer modeling of the particle possible. The capsid was shown by these methods to have T=13,1 triangulated icosahedral symmetry. It is comprised of 60 ring capsomers and 12 pentamer craters surrounded by another 60 incomplete ring capsomers. The same T=13,1 symmetry was found for the single-shelled particles of the two rotaviruses, SA-11 and NCDV, which have 132 uniform capsomers. However, fragments of reovirus capsids, such as are sometimes seen in negatively stained reovirus preparations, were found which had non-T=13,1 symmetry, presumably as a result of capsomer rearrangement. The dimensions of a large number of the triangular subunits of these capsid fragments were measured and it was shown that triangles originating from different parts of the reovirus capsid had non-identical lengths. The lengths found were consistent with the T=13,1 model proposed for the virus. Conditions favouring the formation of crystalline aggregates of reovirus core particles have been found. The unit cell geometry of the two classes of crystals obtained was determined.</field><field name="date">1982</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2443</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aerobiology of the Auckland region in relation to allergic asthma and rhinitis</field><field name="creator">Hasnain, Syed Mohammed</field><field name="description">Auckland, the largest city in New Zealand, with a population of approx. 700,000, is notorius for its high incidence of respiratory allergies, particularly asthma. At a conservative estimate, one in every ten persons in the region suffers from allergic asthma and/or rhinitis (hay fever). In the Auckland Hospital Board area alone, there were 58 deaths from asthma in 1979 and 57 in 1980 (an average of 5 per month). Asthma and rhinitis affect people of all ages. To investigate the reason for the high incidence of these respiratory allergies, an aerobiological study of the qualitative and quantitative composition of the air spora was thus undertaken. To include a reasonably representative cross section of the region for air sampling three localities from near the centre of the city to the western suburban fringe were chosen along a 20km axis encompassing commercial, residential, agricultural, horticultural and forested environments. A Burkard 7-day recording volumetric spore trap was operated continuously at each locality, from 1 September 1979 to 31 August 1980. Counting and identification of spores and pollen grains were undertaken within 5 random microscope fields along each of 12 traverses across the spore trap tapes representing alternate hours of the day on Mondays and Tuesdays. Data were converted to concentrations (numbers m-3 of air). Of a total of 38 spore or pollen categories recorded, 24 displayed seasonal and circadian periodicities. The survey revealed that there was considerable contamination of the atmosphere by spores of various fungi, particularly in summer and autumn with peaks at all sites in autumn. It is of interest that the admission rate of patients with "status asthmaticus" in the two year period January 1979 &#8211; December 1980, was also high in summer and autumn with peaks in both years in April (autumn). Fungal spores &gt;3&#956;m constituted c. 99% of the Auckland air spora in all seasons, even spring, the chief pollen season. Basidiospores were the most abundant type of the region. Amongst indentified basidiospores, Ganoderma and Coprinus predominated. Basidiospores ascribable to Hypholoma, "Calvatia-Bovista" Tilletiopsis, Entoloma and Thelephora were also recorded. Ascospores of various genera were also abundant at all sites. Among them, those ascribable to the genus Leptosphaeria were most common, followed by "Hypoxylon-Xylaria", Pleospora and Venturia. Conidia of Cladosporium were one of the principal components. Other conidia recorded, although in small numbers, belonged to the genera Polythrincium (trifolii), Epicoccum, Pithomyces (chartarum), Stemphylium, Alternaria, Periconia, Torula, Helicomyces, Helminthosporium (Drechslera), Pestalotia, Cryptostroma, Tetraploa, Arthrinium and Monilia. Conidia of "Aspergillus-Penicillium" type were the most prevalent at the city site. A comparison of the air spora at the three localities revealed major quantitative but not qualitative differences. The suburban locality emerged with higher spore concentrations than the urban and forested sites. The relationships between some meteorological factors and the 14 most prevalent categories of the air spora were analysed. Cladosporium and Polythrincium showed a significant correlation with temperature; unidentifiable ascospores were correlated with midnight temperature, humidity and, strongly, with rainfall; Leptosphaeria correlated with rainfall and midnight temperature. Unidentifiable coloured and hyaline basidiospores as well as Ganoderma and Coprinus were positively correlated with temperature. Coloured basidiospores and Ganoderma also showed a significant "negative" correlation with wind speed. On the basis of the aerobiological findings and a potential link with asthma admissions to hospital a total of 67 aqueous and lyophilized extracts from basidiomycetous fungi collected in the Auckland region were prepared in buffered saline, with W/V standardized concentration, for immunological studies. 'Total protein' content of the extracts were estimated. A total of 129 allergic patients both "heterogeneous group" and diagnosed, attending hospital allergy clinic, were tested by the skin prick method. Over 10% of the patients reacted positively to the crude extracts of the following fungi: Ganoderma mastoporum*, Ganoderma applanatum**, Scleroderma albidum*, Coprinus micaceus*, Lycoperdon compactum*, Hydnum crocidens var. badius**, Xeromphalina podocarpi***, Auricularia polytricha***, Agaricus bisporus*,Bovista brunnea*, Panaeolina foenisecii**, Hypholoma acutum**, Calvatia* sp. Pseudohydnum gelatinosum***, Trametes versicolor***, Favolaschia calocera***, Cortinarius*, Tyromyces*** sp. and Hydnum crocidens**. Allergenicity to many of these genera has rarely been investigated or reported. The findings of the investigation suggest that fungal spores in general, and basidiospores in particular, may play an important role in the high incidence of allergic asthma and rhinitis in the Auckland region. * spores alone extracted ** hymenial tissue extracted *** whole sporophores extracted</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2449</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The structure and function of invertebrate septate junctions</field><field name="creator">Green, Colin Richard</field><field name="description">The structure and function of septate junctions have been studied by ultrastructural techniques in a wide range of invertebrate phyla. Techniques have included conventional and tracer impregnated tissue thin sectioning, and freeze-fracture of both fixed and unfixed tissue. Standard and goniometer stage transmission electron microscopy has been used. Work in this study has been concentrated mainly on the lower invertebrate phyla in which the simplest forms of junction might be seen, and on the higher invertebrate phyla. This latter group is of special interest in the transition region between the invertebrate and vertebrate phyla. Six new types of septate junction and a form of tight junction have been found in invertebrate phyla and are described. Two of these new septate junctions occur in each of the phyla Coelenterata, Echinodermata and Hemichordata. The tight junction occurs in the phylum Tunicata. Further data has also been obtained on five of the six previously described types of septate junction. The distribution of all twelve types within the invertebrates and their phylogenetic relationships are discussed. Work with the goniometer stage has aided in interpreting junctional structures. The results have revealed several features of the septate junction that support the idea that it has a mainly occluding function analogous to that of the vertebrate tight junction. In addition, an anastomosing septate junction has been found in the Echinodermata which is postulated to be a structural intermediate between the invertebrate septate junction and the vertebrate tight junction. A hypothesis is proposed suggesting how the septate junction might have evolved into the vertebrate tight junction. Tricellular junctional regions of most of the septate junction types are noted and briefly described.</field><field name="date">1980</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2450</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Unemployment in New Zealand, 1981-1983: a study of the presentation by radio, television and the press of a major social problem</field><field name="creator">Leitch, Shirley R.</field><field name="description">In New Zealand there is a marked scarcity of material on the workings of the indigenous news media.

From the original cloned hybridoma line, a number of variants have been isolated which grow as different types of tumours in syngeneic mice. One particular strain grows with high efficiency as tumours in the spleen. In contrast to the original hybridoma, the progressive spleen-seeking tumour cells appear to have lost their ability to stimulate the immune system.

An important step to managing invasive ant species is determining the factors responsible for their current and potential distribution. This thesis examines the spatial distribution of invasive ant species at a range of scales. The focus is on the Pacific region, specifically Fiji and New Zealand, which have a relatively high number of invasive ant species. Taxonomic checklists of the ant fauna of Fiji and New Zealand are presented. Climate variables were used to model the distribution of, and predict suitable areas for, particular invasive ant species. In general, models had high evaluation success, especially for models that were built and tested within a region. However, the utility of models was far less when transferred and tested in new regions. A better understanding of how climate variables directly and indirectly affect a species is needed to improve the utility of species distribution modeling. On a finer spatial scale, habitat partitioning was evident at Colo-i-Suva Park in Fiji, where distinct ant communities were sampled from litter and canopy habitats. Results suggested that body size, habitat and resource utilisation interact to create opportunities for invasion, and influence the susceptibility of different habitats. Habitat also shaped the assembly of ant communities and mediated inter-specific competition in the Yasawa Islands, Fiji. Similarly, habitat was important in partitioning ant communities in New Zealand; endemic ant species were in forest, and invasive species in scrub and urban habitats. However, there was no evidence that inter-specific competition influenced community composition or the distribution of invasive ant species at regional or local scales in New Zealand. The extent and diversity of exotic ant species arriving at the New Zealand border was also investigated. A high proportion (&gt;64%) of intercepted ants originated from the Pacific. The effectiveness of detecting exotic ant species at the New Zealand border ranged from 48-78% for different pathways, indicating a number of species remain undetected. Future work on invasive ants should focus on species-specific tolerances, and how the physical environment and small scale abiotic conditions influence distribution.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology::270505 Entomology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2495</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Frederick Weld: a political biography</field><field name="creator">Williams, Jeanine Marie</field><field name="description">Frederick Weld arrived in New Zealand early in 1884, an unassuming and shy twenty-year old with high hopes and modest assets.

Nida of the United Bible Societies. The practice of Bible translation in the modern era was greatly influenced by Nida, and still is to a great extent. His &#8216;functional equivalence&#8217; approach to translation gave priority to communicating the meaning of the text instead of merely retaining the form. His approach also included testing the translation to ensure that average readers understood the meaning. Nida&#8217;s approach was expanded upon by the Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL) into what is known as the &#8216;meaning-based&#8217; approach. The difference between it and the functional equivalence approach is mainly one of degree, with the meaningbased approach being freer in several respects than Nida&#8217;s approach. However, there has been a movement away from Nida (as well as SIL&#8217;s meaning-based approach) among many Bible translators. The reasons for this shift are varied, although one major influence has been the growing awareness that the language communities who are the recipients of these translations should have a major part in deciding what kind of translation will be prepared. Such communities often prefer more literal translations. Yet they are seldom given the background information they need to make an informed decision about what approach is appropriate for them, partly because no studies exist which document the objective evaluation and comparison of different approaches to translation of the Bible. This thesis documents actual testing of three types of translation in the Thai language to determine which one most clearly communicates the meaning of the Bible. It was found that the meaning-based translation communicated most clearly for some stories that were tested, the functional equivalence translation achieved the second best results, and a semi-literal translation had the most significant communication problems. The findings also provide dramatic evidence about the limits any translation of the Bible has for people who have never heard its message before. This thesis also describes a new kind of testing of translation quality which the author developed in order to objectively compare different translations in Thai. Subjects were asked to read translated passages and then take a written multiple-choice test about the meaning of the translation. This new kind of testing has several advantages over the kind of testing in general use by most Bible translators.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420100 Language Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2458</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Comparative Form, Function and Ecology of some New Zealand Brittle-Stars (Ophiuroidea)</field><field name="creator">Pentreath, Richard John</field><field name="description">In her classic review of the echinoderms, Hyman (1955), describes the ophiuroids as "the most successful echinoderm group living today".

The mode of action of a novel antitumor acridine 4&#8217;-(9-acridinylamino)-methansulphon-m-anisidide (m-AMSA) has been investigated. Two congeners of m-AMSA, 4&#8217;-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulphonanilide (AMSA) and 4&#8217;-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulphon-o-anisidide (o-AMSA) were also studied for comparative purposes. M-AMSA is being evaluated clinically at present under the auspices of the National Cancer Institute, U.S.A. 2.	Treatment of mice bearing the mast cell tumour, mastocytoma P815, with m-AMSA provided some complete cures. AMSA was almost as effective as m-AMSA but its dose potency was 6-fold lower. o-AMSA was inactive. 3.	m-AMSA was found to have a short half-life in mice. Loss of m-AMSA from plasma was due, in part, to the formation of highly fluorescent covalent protein adducts. The rate of this reaction was similar for all three AMSA congeners, and is probably not required for antitumour activity. 4.	The reaction of AMSA drugs with proteins was shown to occur by nucleophilic displacement of the methanesulphonanilide moiety. Evidence is presented that the thiols are the predominant reaction centres in proteins. 5.	A tissue culture model for the antitumour action of m-AMSA was developed using mastocytoma P815 cells. Profound growth inhibition and eventual killing was demonstrated using drug concentrations and durations of exposure attainable in mice. The potencies of the three AMSA congeners paralleled their antitumour potencies in vivo, except at very high drug concentrations. 6.	The rates of biotransformation of AMSA drugs, and their extent of uptake by cells in culture, could not account for the differing potencies of the three AMSA congeners. 7.	M-AMSA prevented the progression of mastocytoma cells through the cell division cycle under conditions where net cell growth was unaffected. Physiologically attainable drug concentrations inhibited chromosome condensation in cells which were less than 10 minutes from the G2-phase/mitosis boundary at the time of drug addition. The sedimentation rate on alkaline sucrose gradients of DNA from cells treated with m-AMSA was lower than that from untreated cells, suggesting that this agent may cause fragmentation of DNA. 8.	A new method for the investigation of the cell cycle stage selectivity of antitumour drugs was developed. This technique demonstrated that m-AMSA and AMSA have significant cycle stage selectivity, the growth of cells late in cycle being most affected. 9.	Spectrophotometric determinations of binding parameters for the interaction of AMSA derivatives with native DNA indicated that m-AMSA bound with lower affinity that did o-AMSA or AMSA. This conclusion was supported by the helix stabilization caused by these drugs. However, the association constants were sufficiently high for each derivative to ensure that essentially all intracellular drug available for binding to DNA would be bound. 10.	The ration of the association constant for native DNA to that for a single-stranded viral RNA was higher for m-AMSA than for AMSA. This selectivity, if operative in vivo, could account for the high dose potency of m-AMSA.</field><field name="date">1978</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology::270199 Biochemistry and cell biology not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2461</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biophysical studies of macromolecules</field><field name="creator">Wills, Peter Rowland</field><field name="description">Hydrodynamic theories of macromolecular structure have been critically examined and used in the experimental study of the conformation of various biological molecules. This work has been carried out giving careful consideration to ancient and modern wisdom. The fundamental molecular structure of liver glycogen has been investigated using a variety of biophysical techniques, including intensity fluctuation spectroscopy. It has been found that above a certain minimum size, molecules of this material are hydrodynamically equivalent to one another, and behave as if comprised of ideal spherical subunits. Smaller molecules do not have a smooth hydrodynamic surface and display a much higher degree of frictional interaction with the aqueous solvent. It has also been shown that when treated with disulphide-bond breaking reagents, large glycogen molecules are disrupted, but the structure of the subunits is undisturbed. The role of protein in glycogen structure has been confirmed by these studies. Intensity fluctuation spectroscopy has also been applied to the study of protein conformation. The frictional coefficients of bovine serum albumin monomers and dimers have been measured, and an apparent conformational change in the monomer detected upon the binding of salicylate. The unfolding and subsequent aggregation of lysozyme when it is thermally denatured have been observed and the hydrodynamic radii of the native, folded state and the expanded, unfolded state of protein have been measured.

Smith</field><field name="description">One of the traditional aims of the philosophy of science has been to formulate a methodology of science&#8212;that is, a normative theory of scientific method. The rules and standards of such a theory are intended to capture the central features of scientific rationality and to explain the sense in which scientific knowledge progressively grows. Although no particular methodology of science has won universal endorsement, it is generally agreed among philosophers that the broad aim of constructing one is both reasonable and worth pursuing in order to understand the nature of scientific growth. But this aim has also been attacked as fundamentally misconceived by some critics who maintain that no theory of method can do justice to actual science. The objections to the philosophical program of framing a methodology of science come mainly from three quarters. Firstly, there is Paul Feyerabend, according to whom the historical development of science reveals that no set of general normative rules and standards can be given for science. Most of the rules and standards hitherto proposed, he contends, have been violated by scientists and, moreover, were necessarily violated, owing to the incommensurability of revolutionary scientific theories. Secondly, there is Michael Polanyi, who claims that scientific rationality cannot be codified in the explicit rules and standards of any theory of method because much of scientific knowledge and practice is 'tacit' and reflects the personal, unspecifiable contributions of individual scientists. And thirdly, sociologists of scientific knowledge (in particular, those of the Strong Programme) assert that the nature and content of science should be explained in sociological terms rather than by reference to a methodology of science. However, it is argued here that the objections made by Feyerabend, Polanyi and the sociologists to the possibility of a theory of method do not stand up to critical examination. A large part of the anti-methodologists' case is based not only on an overly narrow view of the nature of a theory of method, but also on the mistaken belief that the traditional philosophical and epistemological approach to the investigation of scientific rationality should be replaced by a largely descriptive analysis of scientific practice. This belief is criticised on the grounds that a normative methodology must not be supposed to explain scientific practice, nor can views on the nature of scientific rationality be derived from descriptions of scientific practice. Finally, it is suggested that the positions of Feyerabend, Polanyi, and the Strong Programme have deep affinities with the 'practice-oriented' philosophy of the later Wittgenstein. This may, perhaps, explain why they abandon realist construals of scientific theories, of scientific standards, and of the notion of truth. Like Wittgenstein, they adopt a form of antirealism and conventionalism which leads, ultimately, to a relativist interpretation of scientific standards and knowledge. Coupled with the anti-methodologists' failure to defeat the possibility of a theory of method, this relativism demonstrates the poverty of an attack on method constructed on wittgensteinian lines.</field><field name="date">1984</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::440000 Philosophy and Religion::440100 Philosophy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2463</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessing components of morality: the development of tests for two of John Wilson's moral components</field><field name="creator">Shaw, Robert Keith</field><field name="description">An investigation into the assessment of the moral components which were developed by John Wilson, is reported.

Over the last fifteen years, since the Currie Commission Report, reports by committees investigating the purposes of schools have increasingly emphasised moral and social education as school objectives. The Department of Education appeared to be sympathetic towards the cause of moral education. The submissions made by the public during the Educational Development Conference suggested that, in general, parents and citizens were prepared to consider innovative programmes in social or moral education, although there was little agreement on what form such training or education should take. A number of teachers were supporters of moral education. The primary purpose in constructing tests for Wilson's components was to provide an instrument which would assist in the evaluation of moral education curriculum projects in Auckland secondary schools. Evidence concerning descriptive, content, domain selection, construct and concurrent validity is presented. Kuder-Richardson, retest and criterion-referenced reliability studies were undertaken. It is claimed that an instrument with sufficient validity and reliability has bean produced for the summative evaluation of curriculum projects, and the diagnostic investigation of class groups using the test as a criterion-referenced measure. Auckland intermediate and secondary school pupils were surveyed, using the tests produced and punch card recording in an attempt to identify significant variables. Over 1,100 children completed the tests under controlled conditions. Significant variables identified using the test for PHIL(CC) were socio-economic level for twelve-year-old children, and intelligence for sixteen-year-old children. The effect of schooling appeared to be significant at all levels. Age does not appear to markedly increase children's concern for others. Age was related to performance in the knowledge test. Older children knew more. Other significant variables for GIG were socio-economic level (middle levels performed better) and the effects of schooling. There was some evidence that females know more than males. In both tests it appears that there is considerable interaction between the variables. Suggestions for the further development of the tests are given.</field><field name="date">1976</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2466</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A privileged moment: 'dialogue' in the language of the Second Vatican Council 1962-65</field><field name="creator">Nolan, Ann Michele</field><field name="description">No digital copy at the request of the author - refer to citation field for details of published version.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::440000 Philosophy and Religion::440200 Religion and Religious Traditions</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2470</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Growth and development of intellectually handicapped children</field><field name="creator">Sims, Margaret R.</field><field name="description">There have been no studies in New Zealand designed to investigate the effectiveness of the major "systems-based" intervention programme available for intellectually handicapped children; the service offered by the New Zealand Society for the Intellectually Handicapped. The Society does not have a standardised programme running in all its Preschool/Special Care Centres throughout the country. However, the Auckland branch developed a formalised approach to programming and teaching in 1979. This study attempted to determine the effectiveness of this new approach in terms of the children it was designed to benefit. It was found that children attending Auckland Preschool/Special Care Centres did show greater rates of progress than children attending Preschool/Special Care Centres outside Auckland for a variety of different skills. For Downs Syndrome children these were self-help, cognitive and language skills. For motor-delayed multihandicapped children the skills were selp-help and language. These differences persisted when differences between the social and environmental backgrounds of the children from Auckland and outside Auckland were controlled for. It was also found that Downs Syndrome, motor-delayed multihandicapped and normal children showed different rates of progress for motor, socialisation, cognitive/academic and language skills. Rates of progress were not different for self-help skills although the absolute level of achievement was significantly different for the three populations. The three groups of children showed different rates of growth in a variety of physical measurements, and different absolute sizes in several others. Downs Syndrome children have shorter limbs than either of the other two groups of children. They also have the narrowest jaws and a small thorax. Motor-delayed multihandicapped children have the smallest limb diameters but have the longest faces. Downs Syndrome, motor-delayed multihandicapped and normal children differ in several ways in their social and environmental backgrounds. Parents of Downs Syndrome children are older than parents of the other two groups. Mothers of intellectually handicapped children are less likely to have a job than mothers of normal children. Different health records are evident between the three populations. Normal children tend to be seen as more healthy by their parents. Intellectually handicapped children tend to have less ascorbic acid in their diet than normal children. Downs Syndrome children are more susceptible to minor environmental fluctuations than motor-delayed multihandicapped or normal children. The cumulative effect of this hostile environment can be seen in their short stature and smaller overall body dimensions compared to normal children. Motor-delayed multihandicapped children do not show the same reaction to the environment as Downs Syndrome children. In this more severely handicapped group, the effect of the motor and intellectual handicap over-rides any effect the environment might have. However, nutritional intake is closely related to physical growth in these children. This is because in most cases exercise does not mediate between nutritional intake and physical growth.</field><field name="date">1982</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370300 Anthropology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2471</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies in the Alseuosmiaceae</field><field name="creator">Gardner, R. O. (Rhys Owen), 1949-</field><field name="description">The flowering plant family Alseuosmiaceae comprises three genera of shrubs: Alseuosmia A. Cunn. from New Zealand; Memecylanthus Gilg and Schltr. and Periomphale Baill. (=Pachydiscus Gilg and Schltr.) from New Caledonia. These genera are readily excluded from their traditional position in the Caprifoliaceae by virtue of their alternate leaves, valvate corolla lobes and their southern hemisphere distribution. Four species of Alseuosmia, including one hitherto undescribed species, are accepted here. The New Caledonian genera are poorly represented in herbaria; they may each be monotypic. Condensed tannin (leucocyanidin) and ellagitannin are abundant in all Alseuosmia tissues. Other simple phenolic compounds here (as detected in acid hydrolysates) include quercetin, kaempferol, caffeic acid and p-coumaric acid. Triterpenoid saponins are abundant in leaf tissue; alkaloids and probably iridoid compounds too, are absent. Tannin is found throughout the ovary tissue of Alseuosmia and in the inner and outer epidermises of the ovular integument. The floral vascular anatomy is detailed for the Alseuosmiaceae and reviewed for eight allied families. No features of the vascular system imply particular affinity of the Alseuosmiaceae with any of these allies. Within this family the association of different morphological and anatomical floral features supports the contention that primitive characters tend to be associated with one another in their distribution throughout the members of a taxon. The primary vascular pattern in the stem of Alseuosmia is of an open (sympodial) nature. The mature nodal anatomy is 3-trace trilacunar. All genera have a stem endodermis with prominent Casparian banding, and in Alseuosmia at least this endodermis passes through the secondary and quaternary stages (lignification-suberisation of walls; accumulation of phenolic compounds) as found in a typical root endodermis. All species of Alseuosmia lack rays in the secondary wood, whereas memecylanthus and Periomphale have extremely tall (indefinitely-prolonged?) rays. The vessels of these genera are relatively primitive (end-plate angle c.10-19&#176;, no bars per scalariform plate c.16-37), and thus are comparable to vessels of the Escalloniaceae and Caprifoliaceae. The root periderm has a cortical origin in Alseuosmia and the root pith is persistent. Multicellular uniseriate hairs are found in the leaf axils in all Alseuosmiaceae. Hairs with similar structure and development are found in some genera of Pittosporaceae but not, so far as is known, in other related groups. Within Pittosporum, these uniseriate hairs appear to be homologous with the T-hairs many species have. The chromosome number of 2n=18 probably characterises all the species of Alseuosmia. A. macrophylla A. Cunn. is an obligate outbreeder with an incompatibility mechanism operating at the stylar level, while A. pusilla is self-compatible. Pollinating agents for the species are unknown. No internal barriers to hybridism exist between A. macrophylla and A. banksii A. Cunn. and the hybrid swarm between these species is recognised here as A. X quercifolia A. Cunn. Neither do internal barriers exist between A. macrophylla and A. pusilla, but differences in flowering time and mode of breeding help to keep these species separate in the field. Mature pollen of Alseuosmia is trinucleate: the ovule is uni-tegmic-tenuinucellate. The distinctness of the Alseuosmiaceae is upheld and its affinities are suggested to be with the Escalloniaceae, and to a lesser extent, with the Pittosporaceae.</field><field name="date">1976</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2472</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A dendroclimatic study of Phyllocladus trichomanoides D. Don (tanekaha)</field><field name="creator">Palmer, Jonathan Gray</field><field name="description">This thesis demonstrates some of the potential of Phyllocladus trichomanoides D. Don (tanekaha) for dendrochronological research, especially dendroclimatology. The type of vegetation associated with sites producing a chronology showed no obvious pattern. The resulting non-specific range of suitable sites for dendrochronological sampling was thought to be a favorable species characteristic. Standardization of tree-ring series using a 50-year Gaussian filter resulted in 28% improvement of retained common variance above that obtained from using conventional polynomial filters. The problem of autocorrelation was investigated. Tanekaha had a consistent autocorrelation pattern through both space (i.e. latitudinal and altitudinal ranges) and time (preserved forest and contemporary stands). P. glaucus (toatoa) also showed a spatially consistent yet distinctive pattern. These different diagnostic patterns implied a non-climatic cause (i.e. physiological), illustrating the need to ensure their removal before species chronologies are compared or used for climate modelling. Low order autoregressive models (ARMA(p,0)) were used to filter out the significant levels of autocorrelation. Subsequent comparison of the chronologies showed a consistent and highly significantly correlated pattern between both sites and species. The paucity of information about the physiology of Phyllocladus spp. led to the testing of several climatic variables in response function analyses. The "best" variables (based on only statistical evidence) were minimum monthly temperature, monthly total raindays and an optimal 12 month span of August (t) to July (t+1). Preliminary attempts with response functions using different combinations of predictor (climate variables) and predictand (chronologies) data sets generally failed to verify. Neither the extent of time from which the response functions were based (no analogue situation) nor a supposed "physiological shock" period (poor growth period) were the causes for non-verification. Further investigation showed that, for both the individual and combined chronologies, the temperature response was similar but rainfall varied. The instability through time of the rainfall response was particularly disconcerting since it broke one of the fundamental assumptions used in dendroclimatology. It was therefore concluded that climatic reconstruction could be attempted only on the temperature data. The temperature data of three seasons (spring, summer and autumn) were tried with transfer function models. Of these the summer season explained the most variance and had the highest reduction of error(RE) values. The selected model used the period 1918 to 1982 for calibration and 1853 to 1917 for verification. Summer temperatures from 1982 to 1750 were reconstructed. The reconstruction modeled only c.30% of the variance but was highly correlated to the summer temperature series developed by Norton (1983). This was interpreted as further independent verification of the reconstructed series. The summer temperatures reconstructed from 1982 to 1750 were concluded to have been similar to the recorded pattern from 1853. The same regressors were applied to the buried forest chronology and the summer temperatures reconstructed from 105 BC to AD 175. Because of the non-continuous tree-ring record no comment can be made of actual ambient conditions in comparison to those of today. However, the reconstructed pre-Taupo summer series did show increased variation towards the time of the eruption and more pronounced cool summers than hot ones. Another applied use of a tanekaha chronology was demonstrated with 14C dating. A statistically significant fit of 14C ages was obtained between twelve contiguous decades from the buried forest tanekaha chronology with that from a Northern hemisphere decadal calibration curve based on Sequioadendron giganteum(Stuiver &amp; Becker 1986). This "wiggle-matching" to the calibration curve places the year of the Taupo eruption as AD 177&#177;18 10. An Independent check of the "new" date was conducted using the most reliable data of Healy et al. (1964) with the same calibration series as described above. A date of AD177&#177;4 44 was obtained which supports the wiggle-matched date. The confidence interval of the wiggle-matched date also coincides with the date proposed by Wilson et al. (1980) of AD186 (based purely on ancient written records).</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2473</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The biological control of sapstain of Pinus radiata with microorganisms</field><field name="creator">Kay, Stuart James</field><field name="description">A total of six hundred and sixteen fungal and two hundred and thirty two bacterial isolates were obtained either from the sapwood of Pinus radiata or from other sources, including UV mutagenesis. All isolates were screened on Pinus radiata wood chips for their survival and colonisation attributes. Of these isolates, two hundred and eighty two failed to grow or caused permanent deep seated discolourations or decay and were eliminated from the study. The remaining five hundred and sixty six isolates were assessed for their antagonistic ability against sapstain. In a dual screen on Pinus radiata wood chips, one hundred and twelve fungal and four bacterial isolates inhibited the growth of the known sapstain fungus, Ophiostoma piceae. In a second biological control screen, on Pinus radiata wood blocks, isolates of Gliocladium viride, Gliocladium roseum, Trichoderma hamatum, Trichoderma harzianum, Trichoderma sp., Trichothecium roseum and an isolate of the Thelephoraceae proved inhibitory to the sapstain isolates Ophiostoma piceae and Sphaeropsis sapinea providing between 94 and 100% control. These isolates were considered for further examination in the field. The remaining isolates provided poor or inconsistent inhibition or were mould fungi and, therefore, not suitable for direct application. All fungal and bacterial isolates that had shown inhibitory ability in the initial biological control screen and the remaining non-staining bacteria were examined for their ability to produce non-volatile metabolites that were inhibitory to sapstain. The bacterial isolates were examined in a preliminary dual plate screen in which 91 isolates were identified as producing inhibitory compounds. The best of these bacterial isolates were screened, with the fungal isolates, in a non-volatile metabolite trial utilising filter sterilised culture filtrates. Isolates of Bacillus sp., Fusarium solani, Gliocladium roseum, Gliocladium virens, Trichoderma harzianum, Trichoderma sp., Trichoderma viride and Trichothecium roseum were found to be significantly inhibitory to the growth of Ophiostoma piceae at concentrations of 50% or less. However, the filtrates did not provide adequate sapstain control, when tested on Pinus radiata wood block, to prompt consideration for further examination in the field. Studies are currently examining several of these isolates for the production of biologically active compounds. The six most promising isolates, from the wood chip and wood block trials, were tested in the field for their ability to control sapstain on unseasoned Pinus radiata sapwood and/or peeled logs. These were Gliocladium viride (FK75), Trichoderma hamantum (FK561), Trichoderma harzianum (FK228), Trichoderma sp. (FK247), Trichothecium roseum (FK238) and an isolate of the Thelephoraceae (FK33). The fungi were prepared as mycelial/spore homogenates. For application to the timber, the homogenates were mixed with 0.2% Alcosorb gel, producing 108 cfu/ml suspensions, these suspensions were applied by dipping. Diluted homogenates, 108 cfu/ml, were applied as spray treatments to the logs. All of the biological control agent treatments reduced the level of sapstain on either the logs or timber with Trichoderma harzianum (FK228), Trichoderma sp. (FK247) and Trichothecium roseum (FK238) providing control equivalent to that of the fungicides NP-1 and Diffusol for portions of the trial. Trichoderma sp. (FK247) and Trichothecium roseum (FK238) gave sapstain control in excess of 90% for the first 30 days of the timber trial equalling the control provided by NP-1 and Diffusol. In another trial, Trichoderma harzianum (FK228) was more effective than NP-1, providing 60% sapstain control, after six months, on the internal tissue of Pinus radiata logs. The six isolates selected for the field trials were examined in additional studies. In a dual inoculation study, Trichoderma sp. (FK247) exhibited localised antibiotic ability causing the lysis of mycelium of sapstain fungi. There was no evidence of mycoparasitic action by any of the six isolates. Trichoderma harzianum (FK228), Trichoderma sp. (FK247) and Trichothecium roseum (FK238) were observed to degrade cellulose. However, neither these nor the other isolates caused a significant change in the mechanical properties of Pinus radiata timber when compared to untreated controls. Decreasing pH or the addition of nitrate were identified as having potential for the promotion of biological control agent growth. The potential of mixed biological control agent inoculations was also examined. While these results are preliminary, they are extremely encouraging and provide a basis from which future studies can develop.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2474</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gas transport and storage processes in the lacunar system of Egeria densa Planch.</field><field name="creator">Sorrell, Brian.</field><field name="description">Aquatic macrophytes possess an internal lacunar system of proliferated intercellular airspaces. Lacunar gas exchange processes were investigated in Egeria densa Planch., a submerged freshwater angiosperm. Investigations of oxygen exchange between Egeria shoot segments and the water revealed that up to 17% of the photosynthetically-produced oxygen is retained within the lacunae. A consequence of this partitioning, which results from the relatively low solubility of oxygen in water, is the development of internal lacunar pressures up to 20 kPa above atmospheric pressure. This storage of oxygen in Egeria casts doubts on oxygen-based measurements of productivity in aquatic macrophytes, unless both internal and external sinks are monitored. Pressurisation also revealed that storage is greater in static water than in flowing water, suggesting that boundary layer limitations to oxygen transfer can also affect partitioning. Pressures fall to sub-atmospheric values in the dark, due to respiratory consumption of the internal oxygen. The Egeria respiratory gas exchanges in the dark demonstrated a steady concentration gradient between plant and water within an hour of darkening. However, the material steadily consumes approximately 30% of its respired oxygen from the lacunae, rather than the water. This oxygen supply is again due to the low oxygen solubility. The lacunae also assist the radial oxygen supply into the respiring tissue; it was found that the Michaelis-Menten constant for the respiratory response to oxygen tension in Egeria was some two to three times greater in material with infiltrated lacunae than in uninfiltrated material. Oxygen storage in the stem lacunae resulted in a longitudinal (shoot to root) movement of this gas, which was monitored using a bicompartment apparatus. The root oxygen release rate varied with light intensity and water flow rate in a similar manner to the internal pressure changes. Further experiments, involving measurements of the oxygen flux rates in the Egeria rhizosphere, demonstrated that this root oxygen loss is capable of effecting substantial diurnal oxygen fluctuations in the surrounding sediment. These processes may be interrupted by natural infiltration of the airspaces, but the factors involved here remain uncertain. The mean internal oxygen transport rate in Egeria (6.28 &#956;102 h-1) was consistent with estimates of lacunar oxygen concentration gradients calculated from Fick's Law, suggesting that diffusion is the oxygen transport mechanism in Egeria. However, by connecting shoots into manometers, internal pressure gradients of some 0.9 kPa m-1 were detected. These gradients were 103 -fold greater than the pressure gradient required to account for oxygen transport in Egeria, but were transient features, as the pressure equilibrated throughout the lacunar system 20 - 30 minutes after a dark/light change. Mass flow was therefore proposed as a transitory, but potentially significant, contribution to oxygen transport. Root to shoot carbon dioxide transport was measured using 14CO2 tracing. The CO2 uptake (mean internal transport = 4.96 &#956;1CO2 h-1) represented &lt;10% of the total carbon fixed; the concentration of root-derived carbon in shoot tissue declined rapidly from the root insertion point. These results are compared with those of previous studies, and the significance of the Egeria lacunar system assessed.</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2475</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Circadian organization in the regulation of locomotor activity and reproduction in Rattus exulans</field><field name="creator">Gander, Philippa H.</field><field name="description">The role of the circadian time-keeping system in regulation of locomotor activity and certain aspects of reproduction has been investigated in wild Polynesian rats, Rattus exulans. Locomotor activity is under circadian control and data are consistent with a general model of the pacemaker mechanism as a weakly interacting population of circadian oscillators. Experimental studies and field observations indicate that the action of light in entrainment of this rhythm is primarily non-parametric. Female R. exulans continue to ovulate during prolonged periods in constant conditions and undergo a pattern of change in vaginal cytology through the estrous cycle which closely resembles that of laboratory R. norvegicus. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the estrous cycle in R. exulans is regulated by a similar circadian mechanism to that controlling the timing of ovulation, and hence the duration of estrous cycle, in laboratory rats. Female R. exulans do not exhibit regular fluctuations in either the period of the activity rhythm or intensity of the active phase in association with the estrous cycle. Ovariectomy also has no significant effect on the period of the activity rhythm and no discernible effect on the distribution or intensity of activity. It is therefore concluded that there is no feedback action of the ovaries or estradiol on the circadian pacemaker regulating locomotor activity in R. exulans, which thus differs from laboratory rodents. This proposition is further supported by the observation that there are no significant changes in either period or variability of the activity rhythm in association with the degenerative changes that occur in the female reproductive system in old age. The adaptive significance of these findings is considered. Field studies on breeding patterns of R. exulans throughout its distribution provide several lines of indirect evidence in support of the hypothesis that the onset of breeding in this species in temperate latitudes is regulated by seasonal changes in photoperiod. Accelerated attainment of puberty occurs in juvenile females collected during the non-breeding part of the year and housed in LD 16:8. Juvenile females collected at the same times but housed in LD 8:16 for an identical duration remain immature. Groups of mature females collected during the breeding season do not show a differential response to these light regimes. These results are discussed in relation to field data on breeding patterns in the population from which experimental animals were collected. It is concluded that the onset of breeding in this population is controlled primarily by a photoperiodic mechanism regulating the attainment of reproductive maturity in females. Information on the physiological organization of circadian systems in mammals is reviewed, with particular emphasis on the relationships between locomotor activity rhythms, the estrous cycle, and the effects of photoperiod on reproductive function in rodents.</field><field name="date">1980</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2479</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of the life cycle, biological performance and quality of the black lyre leafroller 'Cnephasia' jactatana (Walker)</field><field name="creator">Ochieng'-Odero, James Patrick</field><field name="description">The thesis answers the general question of whether the quality of artificially reared insect species should be based on performance tests for intended use or whether quality should be based on a more holistic biological approach. The empirical research is carried out using the lepidopteran leafroller 'Cnephasia' jactatana (Walker). The thesis defines biological performance and quality in terms of the success of an insect population in survival and reproduction and regards the laboratory environment as an artificial habitat that insects must colonise in order to survive and reproduce. Changes in biological performance that occurred during 12 successive generations of laboratory rearing were due to selection, acclimatisation and domestication and not adaptation. Artificial colonisation is theoretically successful within a limited range of environmental factors. As the inherent genetic variability of the founder population determines the resilience of the population to changes in performance, the ranges of environmental factors during colonisation should be wide to 'capture' much of the variability. Using body size (weight) as an aspect of overall quality, the thesis presents evidence that the final instar larva of C. jactatana has a threshold mechanism (larval critical weight, LCW) that determines pupal and adult size. There is a proportionate decrease in weight from the maximum weight that a larva attains in the final instar (LMW) to pupa ( described as constant DP ) and to adult (DA). There is a direct relation between the latent feeding period (period between attaining an LCW and LMW), LMW, pupal and adult size, and the reproductive performance (fecundity ). Within the experimental conditions diet quality, temperature, photoperiod and artificial selection had no effect on the larval critical weight, DP or DA, the larval threshold mechanism in C. jactatana is probably a mechanical trigger that initiates pupation. Diet quality, temperature and thermophotoperiods affected pupal size, adult size and reproductive performance. Photoperiod had no significant effects on size and reproductive performance. Positive assortative selections for slow development and low pupal weight significantly decreased pupal and adult size, and reproductive performance. Selection for fast development and heavy pupal weight for three generations had no significant effect on size or reproductive performance. Larval critical weight is demonstrated as useful to define quality indices and predict the performance of laboratory reared insects. The general conclusion of the thesis is that insect quality should be defined more in terms of the success in survival and colonising ability rather than solely on the success for 'intended role' or 'fitness for use'.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2480</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Detection of a signal as a function of interaural differences in the intensity of masking noise</field><field name="creator">Stillman, Jennifer A.</field><field name="description">A series of experiments was undertaken to explore the effect of interaural differences in the intensity of masking noise upon the detection of a signal. The signal was a 2-kHz sinusoid, and the masker was composed of either one or two 800-Hz wide bands of noise. The centre frequencies of the two bands of noise, one above and one below the signal frequency, were varied. On most occasions both noise bands were used to create a spectral notch surrounding the signal. The following factors were manipulated: (1) The width of the notch: from 0 to 1900 Hz. (2) The location of the lower and upper frequency edges of the notch relative to the signal: either equidistant from the signal, or with one edge 150 Hz nearer to the signal than the other edge. (3) The spectrum level of the noise: either 20, 35 or 50 dB SPL. (4) The degree of interaural disparity in the intensity of some components of the noise: either 0 dB, 10 dB or infinite. (5) The ear to which a particular masking noise was sent. (6) The manner in which the noise was presented: either diotically or dichotically. (7) The manner in which the signal was presented: either diotically or monotically. The results of the first two experiments were interpreted as showing that threshold signal levels in the presence of interaural differences in the intensity of masking noise depended principally on the ear in which the signal-to-masker ratio at the output of the auditory filter was larger. To test this possibility, auditory filter shapes were derived from two listeners. These were then used to predict thresholds when there were interaural differences in the spectral envelope of a masking noise. The results of a comparison between the predicted and obtained thresholds were consistent with the previous interpretation. Thus it appears that the detector following the filter can discriminate the output of the two ears and base detection on the better output. This ability may be useful in normal listening, where both wanted and extraneous sounds are subject to change from moment to moment.</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2481</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transcriptional promoters in a replication region of F plasmid</field><field name="creator">Kennedy, Martin A.</field><field name="description">This thesis describes aspects of genetic regulation within and near a replication origin (ori-1) of the F plasmid.

These conceptual models adopt goal attainment as the criterion for assessing UV performance, and address goal attainment from a dynamic perspective by using a network approach. The theoretical models are illustrated and supported by the empirical evidence from the longitudinal case studies. The conceptual models differ from existing models of IJV performance in a number of important aspects, and thus contribute to theory relating to IJV performance in the following ways. These models integrate the concepts from the three research areas of performance, governance structure and dynamic evolution into a conceptual framework addressing IJV performance. Two types (organisational and interpersonal) of IJV network relationships are identified, and complex multiple tiers of network relationships in each type and their influence on JV performance and evolution are discussed. The study highlights the influence of network relationships and their evolution on IJV performance by arguing that IJV performance hinges on whether a trend of institutionalising the mechanism of trust building and conflict resolution and of balancing the network relationships within the IJV arrangement emerges from the process of IJV dynamic evolution. This research was solely undertaken by the author for the purpose of a thesis submitted in fulfilling the requirements for the degree of Ph. D at the University of Auckland.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2486</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ascochytula, Ascochytella, Ascochyta and related fungi, with special reference to Ascochyta paspali</field><field name="creator">Buchanan, Peter Kenneth</field><field name="description">Two Coelomycete genera, Ascochytula Died. and Ascochytella Tassi, were studied in order to determine their generic affinities, especially with Ascochyta. Ascochytula obiones (Jaap) Died., the type species of Ascochytula, is considered to be congeneric with Ascochyta pisi Lib., the type species of the earlier genus, Ascochyta Lib. Ascochytula is thus reduced to synonymy with Ascochyta. Of the thirty-six species and two varieties named in, or directly associated with, Ascochytula, twenty are herein described as species of Ascochyta and four are excluded from Ascochyta. The remaining species were either not examined, or are nomina dubia. The following names are proposed: Ascochyta asparagina (Petrak) comb. nov., A. deformis (P. Karsten) comb. nov., A. dorycnii (Petrak) comb. nov., A. ludwigiana (Petrak) comb. nov., A. moravica (Petrak) comb. nov., A. obiones (Jaap) comb. nov., A. phlomidicola nom. nov., and A. ulicis (Grove) comb. nov. Ascochytella Tassi, which has often been confused with Ascochytula, is also synonymised with Ascochyta. The original thirteen species in Ascochytella were examined, and A. vicina (Sacc.) Tassi chosen as the lecto-type species. Most of the thirteen species are regarded as being either misplaced in Ascochytella, or nomina dubia, and only four, including the lectotype, are accepted as species of Ascochyta. The name, Placodiplodia canthiifolia (Cooke &amp; Massee) comb. nov. is proposed. The type species of Ascochyta, and of six related genera, Ascochytulina Petrak, Coniothyrium Corda. Diplodina Westend., Pseudodiplodia (P. Karsten) Sacc., Scolecosporiella Petrak, and Stagonospora (Sacc.) Sacc. were studied to determine the distinctions between these six genera and Ascochyta. Microdiplodia Allescher and Diplodia Fr. are also discussed, in relationt to Ascochyta. Ascochyta paspali (H. Sydow) Punith. (&#8801; Ascochytula paspali H. Sydow), which causes a leaf stripe disease of Paspalum dilatatum Poir., an important perennial grass of northern North Island pastures, was examined in detail. At some temperatures, under controlled climate conditions, the fungus significantly reduced the yield of P. dilatatum. A. paspali was found to grow systemically, as mycelium within the xylem vessels, and was able to infect all parts of the plant, including the roots and seeds. Green leaves sometimes became infected systemically without production of visual symptoms. Infected seed is suggested as a means for disease spread. No teleomorph for A. paspali was found, and the fungus is thought to over-winter in the dormant grass. The seasonal fluctuation in levels of P. dilatatum and of the disease was studied in two Northland pastures with paspalum as a component. One pasture was studied for fourteen months, and the other for four months. Disease levels, and paspalum levels, were determined by point quadrat analysis and by sorting of randomly cut samples. Levels of both the host and of the disease peaked in summer, while both were at low levels, or apparently absent, over the winter months.</field><field name="date">1982</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2487</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Judgement as play: revealing analogies between aesthetics and ethics</field><field name="creator">Kovach, Vanya</field><field name="description">This thesis is about the similarities of process between aesthetic experience and ethical judgement. I claim that in both cases the activity is best described as a type of play in which elements interact in mutual adjustment and transformation. This conception of play has its roots in Kant's aesthetic theory. Describing aesthetic experience as play results in emphasis on three central characteristics. These characteristics become the basis of constraints on judgement. In the case of ethical judgement these are important because they save from subjectivism a moral theory, particularism, which relies on individual judgement rather than moral rules. Seeing the activity of judgement as play suggests a conception of the outcome of judgement as picturing. This conception helps to make sense of reason-giving within the particularist model. A further analogy with the grounds of aesthetic qualities is used to illuminate the problem of justifying the values put into play. These values are ultimately defended in terms of their relationship to human flourishing. Perennial problems for theories based on human flourishing are avoided by my account because prescriptions for action are not derived from the characterisation of flourishing but from the process of individual judgement which values based on flourishing merely inform. One positive effect of adopting my model of judgement as play is the reduction of problems concerning the motivation to act on ethical judgements.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::440000 Philosophy and Religion::440100 Philosophy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2488</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Politics of insects: discipline and resistance in the cinema of David Cronenberg</field><field name="creator">Wilson, Scott Alexander</field><field name="description">This dissertation examines the films of David Cronenberg which all conduct a consistently thorough examination of the relationship between the ideologically constituted Cartesian subject and the disciplinary structures that surround, control and limit this subject. Cinema, because of the presence of both film form and narrative content, functions as a double articulation of this disciplinary activity. Each film&#8217;s narrative disciplines, on screen, the bodies contained within the plot, even as each film&#8217;s form disciplines both the way in which these cinematic bodies are delivered to an audience, and the way the audience&#8217;s own viewing practices are controlled and composed. Thus it becomes vital to explore the mechanisms implicated in these processes, and to gain an understanding of how Cronenberg&#8217;s cinema works to highlight and critique them. The primary assertion of this thesis is that Cronenberg&#8217;s work functions as a particular style of resistance to hegemony that Slavoj &#381;i&#382;ek labels&#8216;heresy&#8217;. For &#381;i&#382;ek,heresy occurs not when one disobeys one&#8217;s ideological requirements, but when one over-fulfills them, thereby extending these ideological demands and disciplinary discursive structures out to a site of logical absurdity. In assessing and charting this territory, the thesis is constructed in the following manner. The first chapter,which outlines my methodology, applies itself to a brief examination of Cronenberg&#8217;s least discussed commercial feature (Fast Company). Chapter Two is concerned with charting the disciplines applied to the body in Shivers, Rabid and The Fly, while Chapter Three continues a focus on Cronenberg&#8217;s movement and play with framing devices as a means of subverting a stable spectatorial position, utilising eXistenZ, Spider and The Dead Zone as examples. Chapter Four explores the manner with which heretical adherence to a single ideological construction pushes the protagonists towards large-scale disciplinary violations, as detailed in Crash, M. Butterfly and Dead Ringers while the fifth chapter examines notions of discipline and recuperation is focused on Naked Lunch, Scanners and The Brood. A final sixth chapter compares Cronenberg&#8217;s most recent film, A History of Violence, with Videodrome in order to explore the changing face of his disciplinary ambivalence and its relationship to a broader cinematic industry.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cinema</field><field name="subject">Psychoanalysis</field><field name="subject">David Cronenberg</field><field name="subject">Slavoj Zizek</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::220000 Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2500</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Detection and choice</field><field name="creator">Alsop, Brent Llewellyn.</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2491</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A model of New Zealand&#8217;s post-war inflation</field><field name="creator">Hall, V.B.</field><field name="description">Theoretical and empirical literature on inflation is extensive, and it abounds with diverse opinion. Principal works are of overseas origin; no substantial research has been published relating specifically to the New Zealand economy. This study does not attempt to develop a comprehensive theory of inflation, but has as its purpose the formulation of a simultaneous equation model to explain and predict movements in variables relevant to the inflationary process. The research has been conducted with New Zealand data and no econometric work on inflation yet published seems to have produced a model as embracing as the one advanced. This introduction has the following scope and content. First it conveys some idea of the extent of debate over what inflation is, this being done by brief references to various attempts at defining the phenomenon and to some of the different types of inflation advanced. Next, it questions more fundamentally 'what inflation is, and how, if' at all, the subject may be enlightened by further research. This leads on to derivation of an appropriate definition of inflation. Finally, an outline is given of the aspects of inflation to be investigated and the approach to be adopted.</field><field name="date">1971</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2493</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Population structure of Southern Hemisphere humpback whales</field><field name="creator">Olavarria, Carlos</field><field name="description">The humpback whale was almost driven to extinction by commercial whaling in the Southern Ocean. Little is known about the degree of interchange among the remaining Southern Hemisphere populations. This thesis aimed to assess the connectivity among breeding grounds, feeding areas and migratory corridors of humpback whales using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA markers. The population structure of humpback whale populations in breeding grounds across the South Pacific and eastern Indian oceans was investigated, with an interest in the origins of whales in eastern Polynesia, using an extensive collection of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences (n = 1,112; 470 base pairs in length). Samples were obtained from living whales at six breeding grounds: New Caledonia, Tonga, Cook Islands, French Polynesia (Society Islands), Colombia and western Australia. We found significant differentiation, at both the haplotype and nucleotide level, among the six breeding grounds (FST = 0.033; &#934;ST = 0.022) and for most pair-wise comparisons. The differentiation of the eastern Polynesia humpback whales is consistent with the hypothesis of a relic subpopulation, rather than vagrancy or colonization from known neighbouring breeding grounds. Regardless of their origin, it seems probable that islands of eastern Polynesia are now the primary breeding grounds for humpback whales feeding in the management Area VI (170&#176;W &#8211; 120&#176;W) of the Antarctic, as defined by the International Whaling Commission. A population of humpback whales migrates along the western South American coast, with breeding grounds mainly off Colombia and Ecuador and feeding areas off the western coast of the Antarctic Peninsula and in the channels and fjords ofsouthern Chile. We analysed the genetic relationship between humpback whales from these two summer feeding areas of the eastern South Pacific population to assess the potential heterogeneity in the migratory pattern of the population. We compared mitochondrial DNA control region sequences from 132 whales from the Antarctic Peninsula and 52 whales from the Magellan Strait areas. An AMOVA showed significant differences between the two feeding areas (FST = 0.180; &#934;ST = 0.169). A phylogenetic analysis showed both areas are represented in the AE clade that is only found in the Southern Hemisphere in the Colombian breeding ground. Genetic and previous demographic data (based on photo-identification) strongly suggest that both feeding areas are related to the same breeding ground but that heterogeneity exists among the feeding areas of this population, similar to that observed in the North Pacific and North Atlantic populations of humpback whales.Humpback whales migrating through eastern Australia and New Zealand have been linked with those breeding off northeastern Australia, New Caledonia, Fiji and Tonga, forming a single stock (Breeding Stock E). We investigated the relationship between the New Caledonian and Tongan breeding grounds, based on interchange of individual whales (genetically identified) and population genetic differentiation (mitochondrial DNA control region sequences and nuclear DNA microsatellites). We found significantly higher recapture probabilities within each breeding ground compared to the recapture probability between them using genetic identification, and significant differences at the population level in the FST and &#934;ST for mitochondrial and nuclear markers. These analyses suggest differentiation among the Breeding Stock E, supporting a proposed sub-stock division for New Caledonia (E2) and Tonga (E3). Historically, humpback whales off New Zealand coasts were caught during their migratory journeys between Antarctic feeding areas and tropical breeding grounds in the South Pacific. Here we investigated the genetic diversity of New Zealand humpback whales, comparing mitochondrial DNA control region sequence data with that from breeding grounds across the South Pacific (New Caledonia, Tonga, Cook Islands, French Polynesia and Colombia) and eastern Indian (western Australia) Oceans. We analyzed 30 samples collected around New Zealand, revealing 20 haplotypes. All haplotypes were found in New Caledonia and some were also found in other breeding grounds. New Zealand humpback whale haplotype diversity and nucleotide diversity were similar to those from the compared breeding grounds, but were significantly different at haplotype level from the Cook Islands, French Polynesia and Colombia breeding grounds. We found significant differences at haplotype level with the same three locations when a pair-wise AMOVA was performed. Three breeding grounds (western Australia, New Caledonia and Tonga) did not show significant differences at either nucleotide or haplotype levels. This genetic evidence and the available demographic data suggest a closer relationship of the New Zealand stock with New Caledonia and to a lesser extent with Tongan whales, supporting New Zealand as a primary migratory corridor for the humpback whales breeding in these western Pacific Islands.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2564</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fictionalising the facts : an exploration of the 'place' of Aotearoa/New Zealand in the post-war autobiographical fiction of Anna Kavan</field><field name="creator">Sturm, Jennifer</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420200 Literature Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2496</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ma&#772;ori tribal organisations and new institutional economics</field><field name="creator">Findlay, Marama</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the iwi (M&#257;ori tribal) organisations established in New Zealand in the 1980s and 1990s to manage resources being transferred as a result of Treaty of Waitangi settlements and the devolution of government services. The research has two objectives. Firstly, it aims to document iwi organisations&#8217; establishment and operation from the viewpoint of those working inside the organisations. Secondly, it compares insider perspectives with economic theories concerning the causes, consequences and development of economic institutions. To address the first objective, the research gathers qualitative data for three iwi organisations and uses these to construct case reports. An inductive comparison across cases finds that while the underlying motivation for creating the iwi organisations is a desire to live as M&#257;ori, the immediate stimuli are opportunities negotiated with government. Iwi are chosen, in preference to other M&#257;ori groups, because of their size and traditional status and organisational success is dependent on meeting the requirements of both members and external parties. To address the second objective, the research examines a number of theories from new institutional economics which assist understanding of the empirical findings. To adequately explain iwi organisations as a whole, however, and to assess the relative explanatory power of the theories, they must be connected into a single explanatory framework. The research constructs a framework using the concept of social capital, understood as the combination of all the socio-economic institutions operating to make collective action possible. The framework proposes that socio-economic institutions can have an influence and value independent of other forms of capital. Viewing new iwi organisations through the constructed theoretical framework casts them as intermediaries, managing relational contracts between tribal members and external parties. The relational contracts with members constitute bonding social capital and are characterised by informal institutions of high intrinsic value, considerable relationship-specific social capital, transferability across tasks but not persons, and a preference for voice over exit. Relational contracts with external parties are primarily instrumental in value and formal institutions play a significant role; they show variability in the importance of informal institutions, relationship-specific social capital, transferability and preference for exit over voice. The thesis presents an insider&#8217;s view of new iwi organisations and then translates this view into the concepts of new institutional economics. In doing so, it contributes to two discussions: first, on the appropriate way to understand new iwi organisations; second, on the appropriate way for new institutional economics to understand society&#8217;s economic institutions.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2498</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Proteomic biomarker discovery for preeclampsia</field><field name="creator">Atkinson, Kelly Rene LeFevre</field><field name="description">Preeclampsia is a serious multisystem complication of late pregnancy with adverse effects for mothers and babies.  Currently this disorder is diagnosed from clinical observations occurring late in the disease process.  Unknown factors in the maternal circulation, possibly released by the preeclamptic placenta, have been linked to the pathophysiological changes characteristic of the disorder.  The research in this thesis used proteomic techniques to identify putative preeclampsia biomarkers from two sources: secreted from a placental cell line undergoing differentiation, and directly sampled from the serum and plasma of women with late-onset preeclampsia. The first part of this research examined the secreted proteome of a placental choriocarcinoma cell line (BeWo) undergoing forskolin-mediated differentiation.  Development of serum-free culture techniques enabled analysis of these secreted proteins by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE).  Statistical testing revealed the significant involvement of seven spots during this differentiation model, with VE-cadherin and matrix metalloproteinase 2 among the proteins identified. In the second part of this research, maternal serum and plasma proteins were compared from women with preeclampsia and healthy pregnant women.  Serum samples were analyzed using 2DE, and plasma was subjected to difference gel electrophoresis (DIGE).  Bioinformatic analysis of both datasets identified multiple spot clusters able to classify samples according to disease state.  Five of these serum proteins were differentially regulated in preeclampsia, including two isoforms of apolipoprotein E whose isoform-specific expression was confirmed using western blots.  Analysis of plasma from preeclamptic women identified six proteins, again including apolipoprotein E.  Proteins from both studies are linked to preeclampsia pathophysiology through lipid transport, complement, and retinol transport systems. The culture methods and secreted proteomic techniques developed in this work have uncovered proteins in a placental cell line and maternal serum and plasma that are associated with preeclampsia. These methods can be extended to any system where secreted proteins are of interest.  The differentially regulated proteins found in this study provide an important first step towards developing effective biomarkers for diagnosing and/or predicting preeclampsia.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">proteomics</field><field name="subject">pregnancy</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270200 Genetics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2565</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genetic identity and ecology of Bryde's whales in the Hauraki Gulf, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Wiseman, Nicky</field><field name="description">Little long-term research has been conducted in the Hauraki Gulf on Bryde&#8217;s whales; the least studied baleen whale. This thesis investigates this population using photoidentification and sighting records obtained from boat-based opportunistic surveys and genetic analyses of samples from living and `stranded&#8217; whales. Samples from `stranded&#8217; Bryde&#8217;s whales have been collected since 1994 from the North Island of New Zealand. In addition, biopsy samples were collected from whales in the Hauraki Gulf. Fifty-two samples from `stranded&#8217; and biopsied Bryde&#8217;s whales identified 49 unique individuals using 12 polymorphic microsatellites. The sex ratio for both sample collection types were equal with 22 males : 23 females (the sex of four could not be determined). MtDNA D-loop analysis (~800 bp) identified the samples as being consistent with Balaenoptera brydei with 11 haplotypes defined by 16 variable sites. Comparisons with published sequences (373 bp) revealed three shared haplotypes between the North Pacific and Indian Oceans. However, an AMOVA (FST and &#934;ST) showed high levels of differentiation between these oceans, likely resulting from ancestral gene flow. Between March 2001 and February 2006, 1,102 boat-based surveys were conducted during which there were 1,059 sightings over 521 days of Bryde&#8217;s whales (including two birth-length calves) in the Gulf. Since whales with calves, were observed during all months this suggests that the Hauraki Gulf is an important area for breeding whales. The seasonal change in `trip encounter rate&#8217; indicated that some whales leave the Gulf for part of the year. Whales in the Gulf were observed in shallower (12.1 to 59.8 m) and cooler (12 to 24.5oC) water than has generally been reported elsewhere. Balaenoptera brydei corresponds to the form described in the offshore waters of the western North Pacific. In contrast, their habitat use in the Hauraki Gulf was more consistent with the `inshore&#8217; form from the coasts off South Africa.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2612</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hydrodynamic imaging by blind Mexican cave fish</field><field name="creator">Windsor, Shane</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted until 2010, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">biomechanics</field><field name="subject">hydrodynamics</field><field name="subject">cave fish</field><field name="subject">Astyanax fasciatus</field><field name="subject">fluid dynamics</field><field name="subject">hydrodynamic imaging</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2572</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Whakataukii: Maori sayings</field><field name="creator">McRae, Jane.</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2502</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cognitive Support during Object-Oriented Software Development: The Case of UML Diagrams</field><field name="creator">Costain, Gay</field><field name="description">The Object Management Group (OMG) accepted the Unified Modelling Language (UML) as a standard in 1997, yet there is sparse empirical evidence to justify its choice. This research aimed to address that lack by investigating the modification of programs for which external representations, drawn using the UML notations most commonly used in industry, were provided. The aim of the research was to discover if diagrams using those UML notations provided the modifying programmer with cognitive support.  The application of the use of modelling to assist program modification was chosen as a result of interviews that were carried out in New Zealand and North America to discover how workers in the software industry used modelling, and if so, whether UML notation satisfied their needs. The most preferred UML diagrams were identified from the interviews. A framework of modelling use in software development was derived. A longitudinal study at a Seattle-based company was the source that suggested that program modification should be investigated. The methodology chosen for the research required subjects to modify two non-trivial programs, one of which was supplied with UML documentation. There were two aspects to the methodology. First, the subjects&#8217; performances with and without the aid of UML documentation were compared. Modifying a program is an exercise in problem solving which is a cognitive activity. If the use of UML improved subjects&#8217; performances then it could be said that the UML had aided the subjects&#8217; cognition. Second, concurrent verbal protocols were collected whilst the subjects modified the programs. The protocols for the modification with UML documentation, for ten of the more successful subjects, were transcribed and analysed according to a framework derived from the literature. The framework listed the possible cognitive steps involved in problem solving where cognition could be distributed to and from external representations. The categories of evidence that would confirm cognitive support were also derived from the literature. The experiments confirmed that programmers from similar backgrounds varied widely in ability and style. Twenty programmers modified both an invoice application and a diary application. There was some indication that the UML diagrams aided performance. The analyses of all ten of the transcribed subjects showed evidence of UML cognitive support.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280100 Information Systems</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2603</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bridge deck analysis</field><field name="creator">Buckle, I. G.</field><field name="description">In this thesis the structural analysis of two basic types of bridge deck systems are discussed: 1. the nmltibeam bridge deck II. the skewed anisotropic bridge deck. The major difficulty in the analysis of I, the multibeam deck, arises from its lack of transverse bending stiffness; load distribution occurs by shear transference at interlocking shear keys. An analysis method, developed from transfer matrix theory is proposed and shown to be satisfactory for such a structure. Model studies on a quarter scale multibeam bridge deck are described together with field tests on the prototype decks - the southern motorway bridges crossing Slippery Creek. Agreement between theory, model studies and field tests is illustrated. The satisfactory analysis of II, the skewed anisotropic deck, is complicated by its anistropic elastic properties and skewed geometry. An analysis procedure is introduced which is an extension of the finite element technique already established in other plate bending and plane stress problems. Using therefore the matrix displacement method and finite element discretization, the method has been programmed for solution by digital computer. Comparison of the computed displacements with those obtained by experiment on skewed isotropic and anisotropic steel plates is given. The finite element method is seen to be a powerful analytical tool, particularly because of its ability to handle elastic anisotropy and arbitrary geometric shapes.</field><field name="date">1968</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2525</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of coulomb damping on single and multidegree of freedom structures</field><field name="creator">Mayes, Ronald L.</field><field name="description">This study compares the effects of viscous and coulomb damping on the dynamic response of single and multidegree of freedom structures. It was found that coulomb damping was less effective than viscous damping in reducing the steady-state resonant amplitude of all non-linear structures when the steady-state amplitude was greater than two. Also, there is no single, simple relationship relating the amount of viscous damping to coulomb damping for equal resonant steady-state response of non-linear structures. For the earthquake excitation of the single-degree-of-freedom structure it was found that coulomb damping was less effective than viscous damping in reducing the velocity and displacement spectral response values for short period structures whereas for longer period structures coulomb damping was much more effective than viscous damping. Both forms of damping had a paradoxical effect on the acceleration response of non-linear structures in that an increase in damping generally causes an increase in the acceleration response. The closed solution of a multidegree of freedom structure with viscous and coulomb damping subjected to a sinusoidal forcing function is derived and used to obtain approximate values of viscous and coulomb damping from small amplitude vibration tests. It is clear from the results obtained that if coulomb damping is present in small amplitude vibrations of a structure then the concept of equivalent viscous damping will result in the structure being overdamped when subjected to an earthquake ground motion.</field><field name="date">1972</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290800 Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2533</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hydroelastic excitation of cylinders.</field><field name="creator">Small, Arthur Francis, 1946-</field><field name="description">The transverse vibration of a bluff body in a steady fluid flow is a phenomenon that has been observed and discussed through the ages. Named after the Greek God of Wind Aeolius, the Aeolian Tones, such as are emitted by the wind in telephone or power lines, were known to the Greeks, who produced musical sounds from an Aeolian Harp by hanging it in a current of wind. The first recorded association of the transverse vibration with a periodic wake pattern was made by Leonardo Da Vinci, who observed and sketched the process of alternate periodic vortex shedding from a bluff body to form the staggered vortex trail in its wake. It is unlikely that prior to the nineteenth century many structural failures occurred due to hydrodynamic excitation. Wood, stone and brick were the main construction materials, and the elementary design methods used were very conservative ensuring that the structure had high frequency, large mass and a large damping factor. A very high flow velocity was therefore needed to initiate structural oscillations by vortex shedding and, if initiated these structural oscillations would usually be quickly damped out. During the nineteenth century the rapid advancement in the art of civil engineering design and the introduction and development of concrete and steel as a construction material led to the design of streamlined structures with more economical dimensions and consequently lower frequencies, smaller masses and smaller damping factors. Although design codes made a reasonable allowance for static loadings, dynanic loadings caused by earthquakes and hydrodynamic excitation were eirther ignored or underestimated.</field><field name="date">1971</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2531</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Local scour at bridge sites</field><field name="creator">Melville, B. W.</field><field name="description">The problem of local scouring at a circular cylinder in sandy material under threshold conditions was investigated experimentally. The aim of the study was to obtain a better understanding of the mechanism causing scour. Three fixed-bed scour models were constructed: the initial flat-bed model, an intermediate scour model and the final equilibrium scour hole model. The experimental results have shown that although scour is initiated by the high local shear stresses which result from flow acceleration about the cylinder, the subsequent development of the scour hole is due to the establishment of a strong downflow ahead of the cylinder. The scour hole grows in the form of a frustrum of an inverted cone at a slope angle equal to the dynamic angle of repose of the bed material. Erosion occurs in the bottom part of the scour hole. Bed particles from the upper part of the hole slide down into the erosion area as the slope angle is increased by erosion of material from below. The equilibrium depth of scour is attained when the downflow becomes incapable of further erosion. For a particular bed material the downflow should be primarily a function of the mean approach flow velocity and cylinder diameter. Hence the study has shown that the equilibrium depth of scour should also be a function of these two parameters. Additional measurements have shown that the horseshoe vortex, which is initially small, roughly circular in cross-section, and comparatively weak, increases dramatically in size and strength as the scour hole forms. During the development of the scour hole, the horseshoe vortex expands and moves down into the hole, increasing its circulation throughout the scour process, but at a diminishing rate. The shape of the vortex follows that of the scour hole-cylinder combination. Measurements in the wake have added to existing information concerning the shedding and convection of wake vortices in shear flow. The results obtained are consistent with the occurence of span-wise cells of constant shedding frequency, separated at the discontinuities by longitudinal vortices. The vortices accelerate away from the cylinder at speeds initially less than the free stream but becoming constant and approximately equal to the free stream velocity at about 8  cylinder diameters downstream. Based upon a survey of existing material, a design recommendation for the estimation of local scour depths at bridge piers is also presented.</field><field name="date">1975</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290800 Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2537</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Viscoelastic response of polyethylene to temperature and pressure</field><field name="creator">Dao, Kim Chung, 1941-</field><field name="description">Specimens of high-density low-density polyethylene were uniaxially compressed at nominally constant strain-rates ranging from 0.000066 to 0.66 sec-1 at temperatures from 77&#176; to 350&#176;K and hydrostatic pressures from 0.001(latm) to 4 K bar. It was shown that there were significant effects of temperature, pressure and strain rate on both polyethylenes. At small strains (O.O1), the time-temperature and time-pressure superpositions were used successfully to construct the master curves of stress versus reduced strain-rate. These master curves, which were found to have been taken in the range of linear-viscoelastic behaviour of the polymers, were employed to derive the stress-relaxation moduli and the relaxation spectra. The viscoelastic response to temperature and pressure of high-density polyethylene in the transition zone between the &#947; and &#945; relaxations, and that of low-density polyethylene in the transition zone between the &#947; and &#946; relaxations have been found to be controlled by the same molecular motion. This motion, an Arrhenius-type activated process, was identified as involving molecular segments of six to eight carbon atoms with an activation energy of 22 Kcal/mole and an activation volume of 110 cm3/mole.</field><field name="date">1971</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2530</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Digital data processing in radio astronomy</field><field name="creator">Apperley, Mark David</field><field name="description">Research in radio astronomy at the University of Aucklan School of Engineering has been in progress for a period of six years. The program was initiated primarily to provide a variety of topics for post-graduate research in the Department of Electrical Engineering, and at the same time to develop a useful radio telescope installation. Initial work was concentrated on the development of antenna arrays (Lim, 1968) and low noise receivers at a frequency of 42MHz, utilising both phase-switched and correlation interferometer principles (Irving, 1966; Yarrall, 1968; Saunders, 1968). At the beginning of 1969, the Department moved from its former country site into the centre of Auckland city. As no alternative field site was available, the telescope was also moved, but space limitations meant that the city site was inadequate for any useful observations at 42MHz. It became clear that to utilise the site more fully a higher observation frequency would be necessary, and a frequency of 200MHz was chosen, as this was the upper limit of most of the available laboratory equipment, yet still within the range of semiconductor devices. In view of the inadequacies of the site, it was obvious that the performance of the system could be significantly improved by processing the output in a digital computer.</field><field name="date">1971</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2528</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The mechanical properties of glassy poly (methyl methacrylate)</field><field name="creator">Meikle, John Boyd, 1940-</field><field name="description">The mechanical properties of glassy poly (methyl methacrylate) have been examined by means of constant strain-rate tests at differing strain-rates and temperatures.

It was aimed at elucidating the mechanisms of deformation, using optical microscopy to examine slip habits and transmission electron microscopy to examine dislocation substructures. Marked differences were observed in the stress/strain response, slip behaviour, and the substructural rearrangements of single crystals of &#946;-brass when widely different rates of uninterrupted compressive loading were used. Under static loading (strain rates = 10-4 sec-1) the crystals workhardened in a parabolic manner, slip being confined to either of the two (101) [111] or (211) [111] systems. Cross-slip in the statically deformed crystals was evidenced by the wavy appearance of the slip traces. Under dynamic loading (strain rates &gt; 103 sec-1) the crystals exhibited large yield drops followed by a linear rate of work-hardening which was lower than the static work-hardening rate. Slip on the four (-101) [111], (-110) [111], (101) [-11l] and (110) [-111] systems occurred simultaneously. The traces on any one dynamically deformed specimen were both coarser and finer than those observed on specimens statically deformed. The coarse traces belonging to a given {110} &lt;111&gt; slip system always bounded the finer traces of another {110} &lt;111&gt; system. No wavy slip was observed on the dynamically deformed specimens. The substructures present in the statically deformed crystals were consistent with a single mode of slip and exhibited features indicative of high rates of hardening on the active slip planes. The important features of the statically induced substructures were as follows:- (a) There was a predominance of dislocations with Burgers vectors of a[111]. Many of these lay in non-screw high-energy orientations, consistent with the occurrence of cross-slip and the observed high hardening rates of the crystals. (b) Strong tangling developed on the slip planes as a result of a[111] edge segments interacting with other a[111] segments and with loop and dipole debris produced on the slip planes. (c) A partially developed cell structure resulted from this tangling. The dynamically induced substructures were consistent with the simultaneous operation of the four {110} &lt;111&gt; slip systems. It was inferred from the substructural investigations that the lower rates of hardening in the dynamically deformed crystals arose from the distribution of slip over the four systems with a consequent reduction in hardening on each individual system. The interactions between dislocations on intersecting slip planes appeared to be less important in contributing to hardening than the influence of the four systems in reducing the hardening on any one system. A series of interrupted tests indicated that behaviour under staticstatic, dynamic-dynamic and dynamic-static loading sequences was consistent with the uninterrupted static and dynamic behaviour, but that the dynamic reload stress/strain and slip behaviour, and the associated substructural changes were greatly modified by static preloading. The crystals deformed by a "static" type slip mechanism, but exhibited "dynamic" type stress/strain behaviour during the dynamic reload in this sequence.</field><field name="date">1971</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2529</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multivariate analysis of non-linear hydrologic systems</field><field name="creator">Bidwell, V.

M.</field><field name="description">An investigation is made into the coupled lateral-torsional response of torsionally unbalanced &#8220;shear&#8221; buildings to horizontally directed earthquake excitation. Attention is confined to analytical models that have linearly elastic, viscously damped responses. The investigation involves three separate analyses: Firstly, in a preliminary study, the earthquake response of an asymmetric single storey building model is analyzed and general expressions are derived for the location of the centre of stiffness and the orientation of the principal axes. Secondly, an analysis is made of the coupled lateral-torsional response of a partially symmetric single storey building model to a single component of earthquake excitation. A modal solution of the two equations of motion is developed and a general criterion is derived for the existence of full modal coupling. By employing the design spectrum concept, together with conservative rules for the combination of modal maxima, analytical results in dimensionless form are evaluated for an equivalent static shear and an equivalent static torque. The combination expressions are then modified to include an allowance for modal coupling before the final results are computed and tabulated. The results substantiate previous findings which have pointed to a possible link between strong modal coupling and severely coupled lateral and torsional responses. In particular, they indicate that those nominally symmetric buildings which exhibit strong modal coupling are liable to respond more strongly in torsion than has hitherto been recognised by most building codes. This effect has not in the past been quantified in analytical terms. Although the results have practical applications in design, the analysis concerns itself primarily with the determination of realistic estimates for the dimensionless response quantities and no attempt is made to derive design rules. Finally, the partially symmetric single storey model is extended to a special class of partially symmetric multistorey "shear" buildings. The importance of this final analysis derives from the similarity between the results for the single storey model and those for the continuous multistorey model.</field><field name="date">1978</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2547</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The simulation of water quality in the Waikato and Tarawera rivers.</field><field name="creator">Rutherford, J.

The equations governing the concentration of dissolved oxygen in a polluted waterway are developed and a review is made of the various finite difference schemes which available for solving them. Models are developed for predicting dissolved oxygen concentrations in two polluted New Zealand rivers, the Waikate and the Tarawera. It was found that the models used previously in other waterways were not adequate for either of these rivers. The model of the Waikato River uses the well-known Streeter-phelps equation to model the exertion of BOD but includes the effects of the macrophyte and phytoplankton communities on the concentration of dissolved oxygen. The model of the Tarawera River uses the Monod equations to predict the concentrations of active biomass in the porous pumice sediments on the river bed, and successfully accounts for the high rate of oxygen uptake which has been observed. The way in which these models could profitably be developed is also discussed.</field><field name="date">1975</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2538</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The work-hardening behaviour of polycrystalline copper during interrupted tensile testing</field><field name="creator">Davies, Graeme John, 1937-</field><field name="description">The work described in this thesis represents the results of an investigation undertaken with the dual intention of (a) establishing the apparatus and techniques necessary for carrying out investigations into the work-hardening behaviour of metals under-going plastic deformation, and (b) examining the work-hardening behaviour of polycrystalline copper during interrupted tensile testing. The first part of the investigation required the development of the basic apparatus for investigations of the type envisaged. This apparatus included a tensile testing-machine, apparatus for the production of meta1 single crystals, apparatus for the determination of the orientation of metal single crystals and apparatus for the strain-free machining of metal single crystals. Details of the design and construction of this apparatus are presented. The second part of the investigation required the assessing of the existing knowledge of work-hardening and the establishment of a programme aimed at contributing further to this knowledge. A review is presented of information which pertains to the results of interrupted tensile tests such as those where the temperature dependence of the flow stress is examined, or the yield phenomenon produced by unloading is examined. Some omissions and anomalies in this information are noted and a programme of interrupted tests of the types described in the review is outlined for polycrystalline copper. As a result of this programme, the following conclusions are made concerning the work-hardening behaviour of polycrystalline copper during interrupted tensile testing: (a) polycrystalline copper obeys the Cottrell-Stokes law irrespective of the grain size or purity. (b) copper single crystals of polyslip orientations obey the Cottrell-Stokes law. (c) polycrystalline copper exhibits a yield phenomenon produced by unloading at all temperatures and strains. The magnitude of the change in flow stress associated with the yield phenomenon increases with decreasing temperature and is not significantly dependent on grain-size or purity. The magnitude of the change in flow stress increases with increasing strain and passes through a maximum. (d) the magnitude of the change in flow stress associated with the yield phenomenon produced by unloading in polycrystalline copper increases as the amount of unloading increases.</field><field name="date">1961</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2523</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of the flow properties of New Zealand wood pulp suspensions</field><field name="creator">Duffy, Geoffrey G.</field><field name="description">One of the most important process operations in the pulp and paper industry is the transport of pulp in pipe lines. Because pipe friction losses are much higher than with water under comparable conditions, accurate design correlations for each pulp are important to the industry. The purpose of this investigation was to design and build a flow rig suitable for investigating a wide range of pulp conditions, to obtain pipe friction loss data for New Zealand pulps, and to produce design correlations and procedures for the industry. This thesis is therefore concerned primarily with describing the experimental equipment and procedures, presenting pipe friction loss data for a variety of New Zealand pulps, including a design correlation for them, and developing design methods for computing friction losses. It includes, in addition, data on drag reduction observed at high velocities of flow, and a discussion of flow mechanisms in each regime of flow. The equipment was designed to produce friction loss data from three pipe diameters simultaneously for each consistency of pulp. Flow rate was controlled without throttling the flow. Pipe friction loss data are presented for five Kraft pulps and one neutral sulphite semi-chemical pulp. Data were obtained from 1,2,3 and 4 in. diameter PVC pipes for a wide range of consistencies and flow rates up to 0.8 ft3/sec. Standard Lampen mill evaluations on hand sheets made from the pulps are presented, as well as data on the characteristics of the fibres. The Kraft pulps exhibited the characteristic maxima and minima but the semi-chemical pulp did not exhibit these turning points. For Kraft pulps head losses before the respective maxima were increased by refining the pulp and using rough pipe; and decreased by adding short-fibre Tawa and by drying and reslushing the pulp. In comparison with maxima for the unbeaten Kraft Pulp, the maxima of the head loss curves for all Kraft pulps were shifted to lower velocities by the above-mentioned operations. This would reduce the friction loss in many practical cases. In particular, rough pipe lowers the magnitude of friction loss in this regime, and can therefore yield a considerable economic advantage. A single design correlation for Kraft pulps is presented for the regime of flow before the maxima in the head loss curves. The limits of the correlation are given. Friction losses of New Zealand pulps were found to be lower than those previously reported in the literature. Two methods of design are presented for the regimes at velocities above the maxima in the head loss curves. A procedure is suggested for pulp and paper mills to obtain their own limits for the design correlation and to verify the correlation proposed in this investigation for their own pulps. A design correlation for the Tawa NSSC pulp is also presented. Mechanisms of flow are discussed for Kraft pulps and a semi-chemical pulp. Visual observations in an artificially roughened pipe for the regime of flow before the maxima of the head loss curves have confirmed fibre-wall contact in this regime. Data obtained at the first sign of permanent plug disruption have been correlated with data at the onset of drag reduction. Fully developed turbulence was found to occur at the maximum level of drag reduction. Some velocity profiles are reported for the transition regime using a modified annular-purge probe. In addition the disruptive shear stress of fibre networks has been correlated by three different methods. Data for the onset of drag reduction are presented and compared with data previously obtained from large diameter pipes from other investigations. This correlation is used as a method for designing piping systems at high flow rates.</field><field name="date">1972</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2532</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stress-strain and strength properties of an Auckland residual soil</field><field name="creator">Meyer, V.

The study was concerned with an estimation of the maximum possible peak-to-peak amplitude of simple idealised models subjected to pulses of a sinusoidal nature. The study was mainly centred around the maximum response of the single degree of freedom elastoplastic system and the effect upon it of viscous damping and a transition region between the elastic and plastic states. The extension of the approach to the two degree of freedom elastoplastic system was also investigated. The study was undertaken within the context of the earthquake engineering field. The investigation shows up certain basic characteristics of the transient response of fully yielding structures which appear to be common for widely varying types of exciting function. It also shows that the response of fully yielding structures to earthquake motions is probably a function of the characteristics of the largest pulses of an earthquake. A brief review of the study of the inelastic response of structures in the earthquake engineering context is also presented.</field><field name="date">1965</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2524</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A new vision interface : "defining what instead of how" : making image analysis functions transparent to the user by coupling them to handling tasks in an intuitive interface for materials handling applications</field><field name="creator">Sly, Ian M. P.</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses the need for adaptability in vision systems that measure system state information in a sensory feedback role for the control and coordination of flexible discreteitem materials handling operations, such as those performed by a robotic palletising system. In addition, this thesis addresses the need for vision systems that are more easily configured by users, such as factory technicians and operators, who have lower skill levels than those generally required to (re-)configure a machine vision system. In response, a unique coupling mechanism and intuitive human-computer interface have been developed, hiding the complexity of image analysis from the end-user and simplifying the way that a machine vision system is configured. The mechanism couples machine vision-related "visual checks&#8221; to materials handling tasks in a generic framework of materials handling activities. Visual checks which define what control information is required are implicitly linked to image analysis functions which define how that information is extracted from digitised images of a materials handling system. Consequently, this research has developed a set of task - visual check "building blocks" that can be used in various combinations to define the sequence of actions and image analysis required to perform a variety of materials handling operations. In addition, a number of pre-defined task &#8211; visual check combinations and mechanisms for manipulating them have been developed, providing solution templates that can be used immediately or modified to suit application-specific requirements. These developments have been realised together with several aesthetic, ergonomic and functional features in a machine vision configuration interface, known as SlyVision. SlyVision's modularity, extensibility and upgradeability expressed to both the end-user and the system developer through its underlying object oriented architecture and intuitive user interface design make important contributions to its overall adaptability. Demonstrations involving a typical palletising and a de-palletising operation have shown how SlyVlsion is used to specify visual checks and configure the associated machine vision components without requiring the end-user to select or apply image analysis techniques or functions. In addition, the relative simplicity of the configuration process is demonstrated. Consequently, these developments assist people with limited understanding of machine vision technology to set up and maintain a vision system, thereby improving their ability to keep pace with frequent changes in their materials handling operations, while limiting the cost in time, money and effort required to (re-)configure a vision system.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290500 Mechanical and Industrial Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2506</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of microstructure on the fracture toughness of a high strength steel</field><field name="creator">Clark, N. E.</field><field name="description">The relationship between heat treatment, microstructure, fracture topography and room temperature fracture toughness has been determined for a high strength low-alloy steel, En 25. 0ptical, transmission and scanning electron microscopy were used to characterize the structure and morphology while fracture toughness, notched impact and tensile tests were used to determine the mechanical properties. The as-quenched microstructure was predominantly autotempered lath martensite. A little retained austenite was observed in all as-quenched martensite. Austenitizing at 1200&#176;C instead of the conventional 850&#176;C resulted in a 30 percent increase in as-quenched fracture toughness with no loss in tensile strength. Step quenching from 1200 to 850&#176;C for 15 minutes before oil quenching resulted in embrittlement of the austenite grain boundaries and consequently a loss of fracture toughness. The superior fracture toughness of the coarse grain l200&#176;C material was maintained for tempers up to 200&#176;C. Severe intergranular embrittlement and a considerable reduction in toughness were observed when the coarse grain 1200&#176;C material was tempered in the 300-400&#176;C tempered martensite embrittlement range. The fine grain 850&#176;C material also exhibited a drop in toughness in the 300-400&#176;C tempering range but in this case the fracture mode was mainly transgranular cleavage. Transgranular cleavage fracture was tentatively associated with the precipitation of lath boundary cementite, Fe3C. Tempering the fine grain material above 400&#176;C eliminated cleavage and brittle intergranular fracture and resulted in a significant increase in toughness. A little brittle intergranular fracture was observed in the coarse grain material tempered at 500&#176;C. The transverse fracture toughness for material of yield strength less than 1200 MPa was controlled by the major MnS stringer population. The fracture profile was zig-zag, each peak or trough terminating at a MnS stringer. A shear fracture mechanism has been proposed to account for the observed zig-zag fracture mode. The longitudinal fracture toughness was significantly greater than the transverse fracture toughness for tempers of 400&#176;C and above. Mixed microstructures containing lower bainite and martensite did not have inferior relative toughness to wholly martensitic structures. Relationships were found between relative toughness and yield strength and relative toughness and shear lip thickness. There was no meaningful relationship between notched bar impact and fracture toughness data.</field><field name="date">1976</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2543</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship between fracture toughness and shear lip size</field><field name="creator">Lai, M.

The size of the shear lips, BSL, measured at the free surfaces of the specimens was found to be independent of the specimen thickness and to be related to the true plane strain fracture toughness, KIC, through the expression BSL = 0.41(KIC/&#963; ys)2.02, where &#963;ys is the 0.2% proof stress of the material. A rationale for this behaviour is that BSL is approximately equal to the size of the plane stress plastic zone, ry, at the surfaces of a plate specimen, which from theoretical analysis, has been shown to be rY = &#928;/8(KIC/&#963;YS)2. The ASTM standard plane strain fracture toughness test method has been proven to be insensitive to detect excess yielding in the specimens tempered at temperatures higher than 450&#176;C. At high tempers, yielding fracture mechanics approaches were used to determine the true KIC values. The fracture toughness versus shear lip size relationship is believed to have considerable importance in the analysis of service failures and in the preliminary study of specimen size effect in plane strain fracture toughness determination.</field><field name="date">1977</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2546</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Semi-rigid joints for moment-resisting steel framed seismic-resisting systems</field><field name="creator">Clifton, George Charles, 1955-</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the development of new semi-rigid joints for moment-resisting steel framed (MRSF) seismic-resisting systems. Intended as the weak link in the seismic-resisting system, in accordance with a strong column, weak joint philosophy, the joints and systems were designed and detailed to withstand the design level ultimate limit state (500 year return period) earthquake with minimum damage. To meet economic criteria, the joints and systems were also required to be cost-effective to design, fabricate and construct when compared with conventional MRSFS. Four joint systems between the beams and columns of a MRSF were considered. These were the: Ring Spring Joint (RSJ), where the beams are clamped to the columns with flush endplates and compressible ring spring elements Post-tensioned Tendon Joint (PTJ), where the beams are post-tensioned onto the columns with post-tensioning technology Flange Bolted Joint (FBJ), where the beams are bolted to the columns through flange and web plates that are designed and detailed to undergo dependable cyclic extension and compression under inelastic rotation demand Sliding Hinge Joint (SHJ), where the beam is pinned to the column at the top flange level and is connected at the bottom flange and the bottom of the web by a unique asymmetrical sliding shear detail The RSJ, FBJ and SHJ were developed through to the experimental stage, with large-scale tests on representative joints undertaken. The FBJ and SHJ were further developed, through small-scale static and dynamic testing, finite element and numerical integration time-history analyses into fully designed and detailed systems. Design procedures and detailing requirements for the two fully developed systems are presented, together with details of experimental testing, finite element analyses of joint components and numerical integration time-history analyses of complete structural systems. Design and detailing requirements for the joints and the frames are covered and fully worked design examples for the Flange Bolted and Sliding Hinge Joints are presented. The results demonstrate that the semi-rigid, strength-limited joints developed, when used in properly designed moment-resisting steel frames, have considerable advantages over conventional rigidly jointed frames for meeting strength, stiffness, ductility, damage-resistance and economic criteria.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290800 Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2509</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sulphuric acid, oxygen pressure leaching of a base-metal sulphide ore</field><field name="creator">Tegg, G. J.</field><field name="description">The investigation reported in this thesis was the initial phase of an experimental programme initiated in 1969 at Auckland University to study the application of hydrometallurgical techniques to the recovery of base-metals from New Zealand sulphide ores. The principal aim was to design and build a suitable autoclave for conducting pressure leaching experiments and with this to evaluate the sulphuric acid leaching kinetics of a bulk lead-zinc-copper-iron concentrate, under a range of experimental conditions that might have process potential. The effects of temperature, oxygen partial pressure, initial acid concentration, excess or deficiency of acid, initial particulate surface area, agitation, catalyst additions (cupric and ferric sulphate) and time on the rate of leaching of sphalerite, galena, chalcopyrite and pyrite were investigated. Galena was found to dissolve with the formation of hydrogen sulphide and lead sulphate. The hydrogen sulphide inhibited the dissolution of both sphalerite and chalcopyrite but not galena. The effect of experimental variables on the rate of oxidation of hydrogen sulphide to sulphur are reported. This reaction was found to take place on the surface of sulphide particles between adsorbed species and the rate determining step was the oxidation of adsorbed ferrous ions by dissolved oxygen. Scanning electron micrographs are presented which show that the lead sulphate forms as a non-coherent crystalline layer on the galena surface. Conversion reaction kinetics were consistent with rate control by liquid phase diffusion in the pores of this layer. The rate of conversion was independent of oxygen partial pressure, initial acid concentration and hydrodynamics but was directly proportional to the initial particulate surface area. A very low temperature dependence was exhibited. Sphalerite was found to exhibit linear leaching kinetics up to extractions of eighty percent after reaction inhibiting hydrogen sulphide had been removed by oxidation. The rate of linear leaching was directly proportional to oxygen partial pressure and surface area but independent of acid concentration and hydrodynamics. The ultimate sulphide oxidation products were elemental sulphur and sulphate ions with the former usually accounting for over ninety percent of the reacted sulphide sulphur. The dissolution reaction producing sulphur was electrochemical in nature and the cathodic reaction involving the discharge of oxygen was found to be rate controlling. Soluble iron catalysed this reaction and a mechanism is proposed that involves the chemisorption of ferrous ions and dissolved oxygen at the mineral surface. Scanning electron micrographs are presented which show that certain crystal faces are preferentially attacked and that dissolution occurs by a pitting action. They also explain why sphalerite dissolution is severely curtailed at temperatures exceeding the meltinq point of sulphur. For extractions exceeding eighty percent the dissolution rate decreased rapidly due to a decrease in cathodic area and to the agglomeration of residues. Chalcopyrite and pyrite dissolved much more slowly than sphalerite and were extensively coated by elemental sulphur because the oxidation of hydrogen sulphide was catalysed on their surfaces. Some practical implications of the leaching results are discussed.</field><field name="date">1975</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2539</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of UHF communications on overhead earth-wires in power transmission networks</field><field name="creator">Castle, N. J.</field><field name="description">The motivation for this research is a proposed UHF surface wave communication system in which the waveguides are the stranded, overhead earth wires of Power System transmission lines. Attention is confined largely to an investigation of certain aspects which affect the overall surfaces wave transmission loss, a full-scale system having been set up in the laboratory for experimental purposes. For the prediction of transmission loss the stranded conductor is assumed to be equivalent to a solid conductor of the same diameter but with surface anisotropy in the form of two mutually orthogonal surface impedances the major reactive component of which is attributed to the effects of the helical stranding. This reactance is determined from a consideration of the fields which are assumed to exist within the cavities between the strands, and externally. From a comparison between experimental and theoretical loss characteristics there is sufficient inducement to accept the anisotropic model of the stranded conductor for practical design purposes. Approximate equations are developed to simplify the calculation of transmission loss and the notion of &#8216;capture cross-section&#8217; is employed for the estimation of the efficiency of conical horn launchers. It is deduced from &#8216;sensitivity&#8217; relationships that the horn loss is relatively insensitive to small changes in the fictitious surface reactance representing the effects of helical stranding, which tends to justify the assumptions upon which the anisotropic model is based. On the other hand, variations in the helix angle are shown to have a marked effect upon the calculated horn loss. This influences the choice of the stranded conductor used as the waveguide for the experimental verification of the model. The Author&#8217;s experimental research is described at length, the principal objective being to establish the anisotropic model as an acceptable theoretical substitute for the stranded conductor. To reduce the horn loss, dielectric sheaths are ted to the waveguide in the vicinity of the horn apertures. The discrepancies which then appear between theory and experiment are attributed both to the scattering of the surface wave by the boundary discontinuities at the ends of the sheaths and to the anomalous behaviour of commercial-grade PVC dielectric. Considering the increase in the transmission efficiency which may be realised by fitting dielectric sheaths to the conductor near the horn apertures it is concluded that a theoretical investigation of the scattering properties of the discontinuities  s in order. Thus, the remainder of the Thesis is devoted, to this scattering effect as it may be encountered in the proposed scheme, the theoretical analysis following the lines of earlier documented research. A short-cut method is applied for the determination of certain &#8216;half-plane&#8217; functions which appear in the expressions for the scattered power. Theoretical results are presented together with a discussion of some experimental measurements and a brief theoretical examination of the effects on the horn loss of varying the thickness of the dielectric sheaths. It is argued that the horn loss may be reduced if the dielectric thickness is graded in steps to a value at the horn apertures consistent with the desired &#8216;power capture&#8217;. The Thesis is concluded with an Addendum which outlines a number of topics suggested by the Author for future research.</field><field name="date">1976</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290900 Electrical and Electronic Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2542</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of streaming on thermoacoustic systems</field><field name="creator">Starr, Rhys Adam</field><field name="description">Although the current thermoacoustic theory has so far proved successful in allowing us to analyse and understand thermoacoustic systems, there are inherent limitations associated with it. These are related to the fact that this theory is based on linear approximations. As designers search for ways to increase the efficiency and power density of thermoacoustic devices the accuracy of the linear theory decreases significantly, as a variety of non-linear effects start to become important. For example, when the pressure amplitude is increased, in order to increase the power density. This thesis concentrates on the non-linear effect of acoustic streaming. Acoustic streaming is a steady flow that is superimposed upon the acoustic Oscillations. An expression for the streaming velocity is developed for a parallel plate channel having an arbitrary gap width, so that the solution is valid for both thin and wide boundary layers. The solution includes thermal effects arising from the presence of an axial temperature gradient along the channel, and arbitrary phase between the pressure and velocity. An essential feature of the streaming velocity is the generation of circulating loops, which can cause heat to be convected within the channel. An expression for the transverse steady state temperature was also derived, for similar conditions as outlined for the streaming velocity. It was found that when an axial temperature gradient is present the magnitude of the transverse steady state temperature increases significantly as the width of the channel increases. The implication of this is that a significant amount of heat can be convected along the channel due to the action of the streaming velocity. When no axial temperature gradient is present, the transverse steady state temperature reduces to a small constant value outside the boundary layer. A numerical finite difference scheme was developed to model non-linear flow within the two-dimensional channel. The model solves for the conjugate fluid-solid problem enabling the temperature difference induced along the channel to be predicted. The model compared very well to experimental data. It was also found to be in excellent agreement with the analytical solutions for the streaming velocity and the transverse steady state temperature. The effect of streaming on the energy flux density was examined for a wide channel, having a temperature gradient along its length. A fourth-order expression was developed, which yielded a solution in terms of the transverse steady state temperature and second-order mass flux, which for certain conditions could be of a similar magnitude as the second-order terms. For a thermoacoustic core, it was proposed that a toroidal flow could form and convect heat from one heat exchanger to the other. To analysis this effect toroidal flow was incorporated into an expression for the temperature difference induced across a thermoacoustic couple. This result was found to be in excellent agreement with experimental data. The effect of toroidal streaming on the thermoacoustic core was also considered. In addition, a second-order expression for the work flux was derived that included a previously ignored term due to acoustic streaming.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290500 Mechanical and Industrial Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2508</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The propagation of seismic waves through nonlinear soil media</field><field name="creator">Larkin, T. J. (Thomas J.)</field><field name="description">This study is concerned with a theoretical, laboratory and in situ investigation of the propagation of seismic stress waves through soil media. Analyses are carried out to predict the surface response that results from earthquake motions being transmitted through the upper layers of the earth. The nature of the near surface geological layers affect to a marked degree the intensity of surface motion. The mathematical models presented are used in the evaluation of site response to earthquakes. The theoretical methods used depart from the traditional viscoelastic approach and use a nonlinear hysteretic soil model to describe the complex dynamic stress-strain relationships evident in soil response. The dynamic soil model is based on previous laboratory work carried out at this university. The theoretical solutions formulated are limited to one-dimensional situations. Three methods of analysis are presented for the propagation of seismic shear waves through nonlinear soil media and conclusions are drawn as to the best approach. The results of these analyses are generally significantly different from those obtained using a viscoelastic soil model. Seismic dilatational waves are also considered important and a method is presented to calculate the response of hysteretic soil media to these disturbances. The outcome from these dilatational and shear wave analyses is more accurate surface response spectra for use in aseismic structural design.</field><field name="date">1976</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290800 Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2545</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effect of Dosage Rate on The Chemical and Sensory Changes Occurring During Micro-oxygenation of New Zealand Red Wine</field><field name="creator">Dykes, Stuart</field><field name="description">The technique of micro-oxygenation involves the deliberate addition of continuous, metered amounts of oxygen into a vessel of bulk wine during the maturation period (between the end of fermentation and bottling).  The aim of the process is to improve the sensory properties of red wine, particularly the mouthfeel characteristics associated with the various polyphenol constituents.  The success of the process appears to depend strongly on the ability to control the rate of oxygen dosage.  The effect of dosage rate on the chemical and corresponding sensory changes of a red wine is the central theme of this thesis.  A method of dosing oxygen (at typical micro-oxygenation rates) into small volumes of wine (&lt;100 litres) was developed using a dense polymer membrane diffuser.  It was clearly demonstrated that wine could be reliably oxygenated at very low rates using a coiled length of FEP as the diffuser material.  Oxygen dosage was regulated by adjusting the oxygen pressure inside the tube.  The advantage with a dense polymer diffuser is that no bubbles are generated and the oxygenation efficiency is 100%.  The diffuser was fully modeled and characterised for use in the laboratory scale trials detailed in Chapters Four and Six.   The small scale oxygenation equipment was used to conduct a fully replicated experiment to investigate the evolution of a Cabernet Sauvignon wine under four oxygenation treatments at dosage rates of 0, 10, 23 and 36 mg/L/mth.  The total period of the trial was 105 days.  HPLC analysis indicated that the rate change of low molecular weight polyphenols is directly related to the oxygen dosage rate.  The concentration of the majority of the identifiable monomers, most notably the anthocyanins decreased throughout the course of the trial.  The rate of decrease was directly related to oxygen dosage rate.  Thiolysis results showed an increase in mDP for all treatments over the course of the trial until day 77 when they were observed to decrease for all treatments.  The decrease in mDP coincided with an addition of SO2 which was investigated in a subsequent trial.  Spectrophotometric results indicated that the rate of formation of non-bleachable pigments was directly related to the rate of oxygen dosage with significant differences between the high rates (23 and 36 mg/L/mth) and the low rates (0 and 10 mg/L/mth).  The trend for all treatments was for increased levels of stable pigments.  The sensory results show that the measured organoleptic temporal development exhibits a similar oscillatory behaviour compared to the anecdotally derived curve presented in figure 1-2.  The distinction between the respective phases described in section 1.1.1 was, however less clear.  The most significant factor in the model weighting was mouthfeel and astringency which correlates with the observed changes occurring in the wine polypenols during maturation.  Overall the laboratory scale trial showed that the chemical polyphenol development was directly related to the oxygen dosage rate.  The sensory evolution also appeared to be accelerated with higher oxygen dosage rates, although the oscillatory nature of the sensory response given a single linear input indicates a complex underlying mechanism driving the changes.  The effect of SO2 on the development of wine polyphenols with and without oxygen was also investigated.   The presence of SO2 was found to have a significant effect on both mDP and the concentration of non-bleachable pigments.  mDP was observed to decrease over the six week trial period irrespective of whether oxygen had been added or not.  The mDP for the treatments without SO2 increased steadily over the course of the trial.  Similarly the formation of non-bleachable pigments was suppressed and even retarded with SO2 present whereas for the treatments without SO2 a steady increase was observed.  The implication of these results is that SO2 may have a much larger effect on tannin development than oxygen. The use of electrochemical micro-oxidation (or ELMOX) was examined ostensibly to determine proof of concept and also compare the performance of glassy carbon and titanium as electrode materials against traditional micro-oxygenation.   Notable transformations occurred with titanium showing higher levels of ethanal than the other treatments both chemically and by sensory measure.  A greater rate of stable pigment formation was also observed for the titanium compared to the other treatments.  The respective dosage rates for the glassy carbon ELMOX and traditional micro-oxygenation treatments were too low to be able to discriminate any significant differences compared to the control wine.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Micro-oxygenation</field><field name="subject">Red Wine</field><field name="subject">polyphenols</field><field name="subject">wine oxidation</field><field name="subject">computational fluid dynamics</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2578</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Elastic analysis of soil media.</field><field name="creator">Ramsay, Graham</field><field name="description">Elastic Solutions can be used to predict stresses and displacements in loaded soil media provided the non-linear stress-strain behaviour of the soil is recognised and allowance made for it in calculating displacements. This thesis examines the methods of elastic analysis suitable for examining problems in Soil Mechanics and the determination of suitable stress-strain parameters. The use of the Finite Element method in Soil Mechanics is reviewed, and a computer program for examining linear elastic plane stress and plane strain problems is presented. The program has been used to examine a range of problems involving infinitely long excavations of rectangular cross-section in the surface of a stratum overlying a rigid base. The excavations were analysed for a uniform vertical loading in the base of the excavation and for lateral wall loads representing the effect of the release of the insitu stresses during excavation. Cases in which the lateral movement of the walls is completely restrained are also considered, and the effect of wall restraint on the vertical displacements due to the vertical base loading is shown to be small. Results obtained by the author suggest that care should be exercised in the use of the Finite Element method to analyse problems involving loaded rigid footings or the stresses behind rigid retaining walls, and that the solutions in these cases may be inaccurate. The solutions available for surface loadings on layered elastic strata are reviewed and results obtained from a Fourier Series approach are presented for a range of problems involving surface loadings on a single rigid base elastic stratum. Uniform vertical and horizontal strip loadings and rigid strip footings with vertical, horizontal and moment loadings are considered. A uniform vertical strip load on the surface of a multilayer stratum overlying a half space or rigid base is also analysed. The computer programs and full mathematical derivations for the strip loading cases are presented, and the extension of the solutions to rectangular loadings is discussed and the basic mathematical derivations outlined. The application of the Fourier Series solutions to the calculation of consolidation settlements is discussed. Work by other investigators suggests that a hyperbolic model may be suitable for approximating soil stress-strain curves and that fundamental stress-strain behaviour should be examined in tests in which the bulk stress remains constant during the application of the shear stress. Equipment designed to carry out slow drained triaxial tests in which the bulk stress is constant during the shearing phase is described, and the results of a short series of tests used to proof test the equipment are presented.</field><field name="date">1973</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2536</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Numerical modelling of wave runup on breakwaters</field><field name="creator">Palmer, Gavin Noel</field><field name="description">The design of rubble mound breakwaters is typically based on empirical formulae and physical modelling. One limitation of this approach is that different aspects of wave interaction with a breakwater, such as the elevation of the runup tip and armour stability, are treated separately. Therefore the development of a numerical model of wave runup on a rubble mound breakwater was the primary objective of the research described in this thesis. Because of the range of slope conditions encountered with rubble mound breakwaters and revetments, two types of armour layer are considered. The first is impermeable and so only the flow within the external region is modelled. The flow is assumed to be governed by the unsteady one-dimensional shallow water wave equations and only regular waves are considered. It is shown how the use of the finite element method with a mesh of isoparametric elements that deforms and is fitted to the runup tip has a number of advantages over the traditional use of the finite difference method with a fixed grid. Reasonably good results were obtained for the numerical modelling of wave runup on a riprap armoured l:3 impermeable slope indicating that the numerical model may, in conjunction with a physical model, be of practical use in the design of revetments. Wave runup on smooth and Dolos armoured 1:1.5 impermeable slopes was modelled poorly. Therefore the model is more appropriate for wave runup on a revetment than a rubble mound breakwater. The second type of armour layer is permeable and so the flow within the external region and armour layer is modelled simultaneously by coupling numerical models for the respective regions. It is concluded that this approach is unlikely to give acceptable results for the runup of regular waves on a steep, permeable armour layer unless it also accounts for the non-hydrostatic distribution of pressure within the external region. An experiment is described in which continuous time histories of wave runup and dynamic pressure due to regular waves on smooth and Dolos armoured 1:1.5 slopes were measured. The results are used to discuss the assumption of hydrostatic pressure. A method of assessing armour stability requirements which takes into consideration the effects of armour unit interaction is proposed. It is recommended that this is examined further.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290800 Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2514</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Site response to earthquakes with reference to the application of microtremor measurements.</field><field name="creator">Parton, Ian M.</field><field name="description">It is generally accepted that some areas of the earth's surface are more prone to earthquake occurrence than others. Furthermore, within these earthquake-prone area the distribution of earthquake epicentres is non-uniform. Ttis has led to a system of regional zoning for earthquake resistant design in most countries. Observations of localised damage resulting from earthquakes has only recently led to the general acceptance of the fact that the degree of damage may be influenced by the characteristics of the soils in the affected area. Where the damage is related to gross instability of the soil resulting in large permanent deformations, association of the damage with local soil conditions is readily apparent. A somewhat less obvious effect of soil conditions on building damage is that subsurface soil layering can influence the intensity of ground shaking, and the frequency content of the surface motion, even though the soils underlying structures may remain perfectly stable during an earthquake. The frequency characteristics of the surface motion are important as the existence of a predominant ground frequency may lead to resonance of structures during prolonged shaking. In Chapter 2 a brief resume of existing knowledge of the occurrence, origin and nature of earthquakes is presented. Basic wave models and wave types are outlined.</field><field name="date">1972</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2535</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A dual channel solar radiometer</field><field name="creator">Wakeman, Philip E.

The system used is a two receiver multiplying interferometer with the addition of phase switching. A computer controlled phase cancelling system is used to make the interferometer fringe track the source (i.e the sun), thereby producing a rectified output. An outline of the design of comb-line filters is given. These low loss transmission filters are used at the receiver inputs to attenuate strong out of band interfering signals. Operational amplifiers are used to gain stabilize the RF preamplifiers. Very low sensitivity of gain to temperature change is shown to result from the use of this technique.

Basecourse saturation results in increased flexural strains in the asphaltic layer and increased rutting leading to cracking of the surface layer. To obtain a physical and quantitative understanding of the deformation characteristics of saturated granular basecourse materials and the associated failure mechanisms of the pavement structure, laboratory testing equipment was developed including an automated kneading compactor, dynamic triaxial apparatus and a constant head permeameter. Tests were carried out on 250 mm diameter compacted samples of a basaltic aggregate having a maximum particle size of 38 mm. Dynamic tests were performed on both unsaturated and saturated samples. Characterisation tests established variations in resilient moduli and Poisson&#8217;s ratio with deviator and confining stress for use in multi-layer elastic analyses. The results of a testing program where samples were subjected to stress states simulating traffic loading, indicated that saturation approximately doubles resilient deformations and increases creep rates by as much as a factor of 10. These changes are caused by loss of capillary stress on saturation and increases in dynamic pore water pressures as a result of applied lateral pressures. A fundamental relationship between the creep rate and the resilient strain amplitude was established, and provides a simple key for the comparative study of different aggregates and the assessment of rut depths in design applications. To assess the effects of dissipation on the magnitude of the dynamic pore water pressures in a pavement structure, a permeability study was carried out on compacted basecourse samples. The permeability characteristics measured were used in a computer analysis to establish the effects of dissipation. Graphs were established showing the effects of permeability and traffic speed on the pore water pressure response. The permeability tests also showed that fines were transported at hydraulic gradients in excess of l resulting in clogging of pore channels and large reductions in permeability. Comparative analyses were carried out to assess the response of saturated and unsaturated pavement sections using the deformation characteristics established in conjunction with a multi-layered elastic computer program. Results of the analyses indicated that the increase in rut depth due to basecourse creep deformation may be 100 times larger for a saturated pavement compared to an unsaturated pavement.</field><field name="date">1975</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2540</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A finite element for the elastic stability analysis of frameworks.</field><field name="creator">Davidson, B.

The theoretical model treats an off-axis unidirectional ply as an inhomogeneous material, and considers the effect of rigid body rotations of the fibres within the matrix material. Linear analytical, and nonlinear finite element solutions are developed for the model. The differences between the new model and the traditional homogenous orthotropic characterisation are functions of both the strain level, and the relative modulus ratio (Ef/Em) of the constituent materials. For relative constituent moduli typical of most common FRP materials, there are significant differences between the new Rigid Body Motion (RBM) model and homogenous orthotropic characterisations at strains greater than 1%. In a 30&#176; case with Ef/Em = 100 and a strain level of 2%, the RBM theory predicts a longitudinal modulus 11% higher than the linear orthotropic theory. At small strain levels the RBM theory reduces to the homogenous orthotropic approximation. A simple and reliable methodology is developed and verified for the experimental characterisation of off-axis tensile FRP specimens. The method applies a tensile load to a thin walled tubular specimen through a high strength, small diameter length of steel wire. The low torsional stiffness of the wire allows one end of the tube to rotate, thus preventing any torsional constraint. Analytical and experimental verifications both indicate that the required tensile load can be applied to tubular specimens without significant torsional constraint. The wire based testing method is used to measure the off-axis stiffness properties of carbon/epoxy tubular specimens at a range of fibre orientations.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290500 Mechanical and Industrial Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2513</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Simple shear compaction of basecourse aggregates</field><field name="creator">Peploe, Ross John</field><field name="description">The objective of this research project has been to develop a computer controlled cyclic simple shear apparatus and to investigate the repeated load behaviour of local basecourse aggregates with regard to their shear modulus and volume change properties. A detailed discussion of the construction of the apparatus and the development of the control systems is presented. A review of the litreature regarding cyclic load testing of basecourse aggregates has been undertaken and presented in this thesis. A large number of shear displacement controlled cyclic simple shear tests were carried out using three types of local Auckland aggregate. A comparison of the performance of these materials is presented with particular emphasis placed on the shear modulus, volume change and particle degredation properties. High repitition cyclic simple shear tests have revealed an apparent stiffness recovery for granular specimens between test runs. This behaviour is difficult to explain, however it is thought to be related to the transition from a dynamic to a static state of friction within the specimen. The volume change properties of granular specimens have been found to be equivalent to the 'normally consolidated - over consolidated' behaviour of fine grained soils. This observation is consistent with that reported by Youd (1970) who performed similar tests using specimens of sand. The implications of this result are discussed with respect to the potential application to highway engineering. A number of shear stress controlled cyclic simple shear tests have been performed to investigate the applicability of a stability threshold for basecourse materials. The stability threshold, or shakedown behaviour, has been observed and is incorporated in a philosophy for pavement design. An example of this method has been performed to show the potential merits of including stability threshold data in the pavement design procedure.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290800 Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2510</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The plug flow of paper pulp suspensions</field><field name="creator">Moller, Klaus</field><field name="description">The investigation reported in this thesis is part of a programme of research concerning the flow behaviour of paper pulp suspensions commenced at the University of Auckland in 1969. A primary aim of the research was to supply the industry with reliable pipe friction data for the pulps manufactured in New Zealand mills. Secondly, it was hoped to increase the fundamental understanding of the mechanisms of flow of the suspensions in pipes and so devise a more satisfactory method of correlation than the one used at present. Pipe friction data were obtained for two N.Z. groundwood pulps, two N.Z. Kraft pulps and one imported Kraft pulp in 1, 2, 3 and 4 inch pipes for a wide range of consistencies and velocities. The data were of the same form as previously reported in the literature, but for a given set of conditions the friction losses were lower for the N.Z. pulps. For Kraft pulps the curves of head loss versus velocity exhibited the usual maxima and minima, but for groundwoods the decrease in head loss from the maximum to the minimum and the subsequent rise were replaced by an approximately level portion. The data in the regime before the maxima in the head loss curves for Kraft pulps were correlated to allow extrapolation to the larger pipes used in the paper mill. This regime incorporates the majority of practical flow situations for consistencies over two per cent. The limits of the regime were approximately defined by values of the dimensionless friction factor. The correlation method used was a slight modification of that employed by previous authors. The data for groundwood pulps were correlated in a similar way. The head losses predicted by the new correlations were consistently lower than those calculated from previous equations. Observation of the flow in perspex pipes confirmed the mechanisms of flow proposed by some previous authors, but disagreed with the mechanisms proposed by others. The mechanisms of flow of groundwood pulps were found to be essentially similar to those of Kraft pulps except that the groundwoods exhibited a plug cleavage phenomenon at very low velocities. The different shapes of friction curve for the two types of pulp were attributed directly to their macroscopic properties. A flow model was developed on the basis of the observed flow behaviour in pipes in which the suspensions move as a fibre/water plug surrounded by a sheared water annulus. The model assumed that the annulus formed as a result of the action of the hydrodynamic shear stress on the fibre network comprising the plug. The analysis resulted in an expression relating the average velocity and the longitudinal pressure gradient in the pipe and also incorporated the pipe radius, the viscosity of the suspending medium &#956; and a pseudo shear modulus for the fibre network G. The plug flow model was found to apply to the data in the regime before the maximum in the head loss curve. The relation between the pressure gradient and the pipe diameter as predicted by the model was slightly erroneous for some pulps, although it was the same as that in the standard empirical correlation used in design by the industry. This led to the conclusion that the deflection of fibre ends on the plug surface also contributed to the formation of the annulus, as proposed by previous authors. The relative importance of the two mechanisms of annulus formation was used to explain the occurrence of the maxima and minima in the head loss curves for chemical pulps. The plug flow model was found to be closely related to both the direct correlation method used in the past and to the standard pseudoplastic model for non-Newtonian pipe flow. The model was also applied to analogous flow in a rotational viscometer. The values of the pseudo shear modulus G calculated from the rotational viscometry data were the same as those calculated from pipe flow data under certain conditions. However, limitations in the equipment and the effect of gravitational settling restricted the results to a narrow range. The behaviour of the pulp suspensions in batch settling tests varied markedly from pulp to pulp. There was a high correlation between the pseudo shear modulus G obtained from pipe flow data and the final height of the suspension in a settling test. Likewise there was a relationship between the effective viscosity of the suspending medium &#956; (as modified by the proportion of fines in the pulp) and the initial settling rate in a batch test. This suggested that a simple and accurate method of determining pipe friction data from batch settling test data is possible. Settling tests also showed that air content and the presence of acidic and basic ions, but not the viscosity of the suspending medium, increased the strength of fibre networks. A further correlation method to incorporate all flow regimes was suggested from the results of the present investigation and from indications in the literature that fibre networks behave like Bingham plastics when they are sheared.</field><field name="date">1972</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2534</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of soil-pile interaction under static loads</field><field name="creator">Goldsmith, Peter R.</field><field name="description">This model study is concerned with attempting to identify some of the mechanics of pile-soil interaction under the influence of static loads, as a pre-requisite to defining the mechanics of the soil response to pile transmitted dynamic (i.e. seismic) lateral soil loads. The emphasis has been directed at the mechanics of the response of the soil to loads transmitted through the pile, rather than the more usual approach of defining an analytical pile model and assuming a soil response. The work contained herein follows the incremental deformations occurring within a soil mass throughout the process of installation through to the ultimate lateral loading condition. To enable this to be done the comparatively recent developments in soil mechanics involving the application of the techniques of stereophotogrammetry and radiography, have been employed. The study is mainly involved with short rigid models in dry dense sand. A more general aim of the research project has been to attempt to draw the more research orientated and practical aspects of the statically loaded pile problem closer together. To this end, state-of &#8211;the-art reviews of both the axial and lateral loading situations have been conducted and an attempt made to relate them to the mechanics of soil response, as identified both in this research project and from full scale tests reported in the literature. An attempt has been made to apply some of the more general observations resulting from the study, to the Type A prediction, (i.e. before the event), of the ground line displacements of a full scale pile under real site conditions when subjected to various loads.</field><field name="date">1979</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290800 Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2549</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The flow behaviour of particulate solids and capsules in wood pulp fibre suspensions</field><field name="creator">Walmsley, Michael Richard Walter</field><field name="description">This thesis describes an investigation into the flow behaviour of particulate solids and capsules in wood pulp fibre suspensions. Emphasis is placed on measuring pipe friction loss and stability of solids-fibre slurries and fibre-capsule mixtures in straight horizontal pipes. It is shown that low concentrations (1-3 %v) of wood pulp fibre form a structured carrier fluid with ability to support particles while behaving like a liquid of low viscosity. At moderate flow velocities fibres damp turbulence and friction losses become lower than water. If solids are preferentially injected into the fibre suspension as a central core, or in a capsule as dry solids, pipe friction loss is reduced further, as is pipe wear. At very low fibre concentrations (&lt;1%v), fibres reduce the friction loss of conventional solid-water mixtures and act as a drag reducing additive. The network strength properties of five wood fibre suspensions are reported and their application to slurry flow is discussed. Settling data for particulate solids, coherent dense-phase cores and capsules are presented and various mechanisms of support are described. Two flow techniques for transporting coarse and dense-phase particle suspensions are proposed, along with strategies for injecting solid particulates into a pipeline. Pipe friction loss data are presented for solids-fibre mixtures of wood chips (7-15 mm), coarse (+2-10 mm) and fine (+0.5-1.0 mm) coal, sand (+0.32-2.0 mm), iron ore (+0.05-0.28 mm), and cylindrical capsules (loaded with dry solids) flowing in 54, 79 and 101.6 mm diameter PVC pipes. Some pipe friction loss data are presented for solids transported as a central core supported by an annulus of fibre suspension. The key flow parameters are also optimized and a preliminary cost comparison is made. Coarse coal suspensions (up to 4O %v) with fibre concentrations of 0.7 to 1.0 percent have been shown to exhibit friction losses about 40 percent below that of the equivalent coalwater slurry. Adding 0.8 percent fibre to water is shown to reduce capsule friction head loss up to 50 percent.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290600 Chemical Engineering</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291400 Materials Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2518</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Outage probability in mobile radio systems</field><field name="creator">Sowerby, K. W. (Kevin W.)</field><field name="description">Outage probability calculations are presented for the analogue land mobile radio situation where in order to obtain satisfactory radio reception both a sufficient CNR and CIR need to be achieved simultaneously. Such calculations can be used in the design and analysis of mobile radio systems and may be particularly useful for investigating the effects of cochannel interference in cellular systems. The outage probability expressions are derived using previously reported statistical descriptions of mobile radio propagation. Attention is generally focussed on situations where signals suffer Rayleigh fading and/or lognormal shadowing. However calculations for Nakagami-m, Rice and Weibull fading are also considered. The rapid growth in cellular mobile radio systems has stimulated the development of outage probability calculations for multiple interferer situations. Previously, while single interferer situations had been treated exactly, multiple interferers had been treated by approximate methods. In this thesis exact multiple interferer outage probability expressions are presented for the Rayleigh fading and the joint 'fading and shadowing' (Suzuki) situations. Similar expressions, but for more limited cases, are also presented for lognormal and Nakagami-m statistics. Using results from these expressions the accuracies of several approximate outage probability methods are assessed. The exact outage probability expressions for multiple Suzuki interferer situations are closely related to those for multiple Rayleigh interferer situations. Indeed, the exact analytic expressions for Rayleigh statistics form an integral part of the corresponding outage probability expressions for Suzuki statistics. These latter expressions can be readily evaluated using Gauss-Hermite numerical integration. In order to demonstrate the use of such calculations for mobile radio system analysis several theoretical examples are presented. Outage probability calculations for multiple interferer systems which employ diversity reception as a means of improving communications reliability are considered. Similarly, the extension of outage probability concepts to digital systems is briefly outlined.</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290900 Electrical and Electronic Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2516</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Local scour at bridge piers</field><field name="creator">Chiew, Yee Meng</field><field name="description">Local scour at cylindrical bridge piers in both uniform and non-uniform cohesionless sediments was investigated experimentally. The aim of the study was to improve understanding of local scour around bridge piers with sediment transport. Three empirical functions which relate the equilibrium depth of scour with approach velocity, flow depth and sediment size were obtained for uniform sediments. The effects of armouring and sediment sizes were also investigated for non-uniform sediments. The experimental results for the variation of equilibrium scour depth (normalised with the pier diameter) with approach velocity show that the equilibrium scour depth reaches a maximum at the threshold condition of the bed sediment. Above the threshold velocity, the scour depth first decreases and then increases again with increasing velocity to a maximum at the transition flat bed condition. At still higher velocities, the equilibrium scour depth decreases due to the formation of antidunes. Lesser scour depths are recorded with ripple forming sediment at threshold conditions because the bed associated with a ripple forming sediment is unable to remain planar. In live-bed conditions, the effect of rippling diminishes for increasing velocity and becomes negligible for UO/UOC &gt; 2. The experimental results for the variation of equilibrium scour depth with flow depth show that the trend for live-bed scour of increasing scour depth with increasing YO/D until a maximum influence of YO/D is reached, is similar to that for clear water scour as shown by Ettema (1980). A flow depth adjustment factor, K(YO/D), which is related to YO/D with D/d50 as the third parameter is presented which indicates to a designer the sequence of estimation of the effect of flow depth on the equilibrium depth of scour. The effect of sediment size on the eguilibrium scour depth is presented in terms of the relative size of pier to sediment, D/d50. A family of curves, at various values of UO/UOC, which relate dav/D and D/d50 for live-bed scour was obtained. The curves show that the equilibrium scour depth increases almost linearly for increasing values of D/d50 until it reaches the value of D/d50 = 50 after which the scour depth becomes independent of D/d50. A similar trend was obtained by Ettema (1980) for clear water scour. For design purposes, the data for large values of YO/D are presented in terms of a sediment adjustment factor, K(D/d), which is shown to be independent of the flow velocity. Both flow depth and sediment size functions include results by Shen et al (1966), Ettema (1980), Chee (1982), and the present study. Armouring and sediment size play an important role in reducinq the equilibrium scour depth for non-uniform sediments. The latter is particularly significant in laboratory experiments where the size of the pier is generally small relative to the size of the coarse particles in non-uniform sediments. Experiments were conducted under dynamic equilibrium conditions where there is continuous sediment input from upstream of the scour hole such that at equilibrium, the amount of sediment entering the bridge site is equal to that leaving. Both the effects of armouring and sediment size diminish for increasing velocity. At high velocity where all the sediment particles are mobile, the non-uniform sediment behaves like a uniform sediment. Hence, armouring does not occur and the equivalent size used for sediment adjustment is based on the d50 size of the sediment bed. At low velocity, armouring at the base of the scour hole is prominent and adjustment of D/d is based on the d90 size of the original mixture. An alternative condition can exist in natural rivers in contrast to the dynamic equilibrium conditions simulated in this study. This is where the upstream river is armoured such that there is little or no sediment input to the scour hole. It is postulated that, in this case, the equilibrium scour depth can approach the maximum equilibrium scour depth for clear water conditions (i.e. dav/D + 2.3) when the approach velocity is equal to the critical velocity of the non-uniform sediment. Finally, a design flow chart is presented for estimation of the equilibrium depth of local scour for design purposes. In live-bed scour where bed features are present, the results show that half the height of the bed features can be added to the estimated equilibrium scour depth.</field><field name="date">1984</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290800 Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2520</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The one dimensional behaviour of sand</field><field name="creator">Alexander, Robert Charles Koch</field><field name="description">This study examines the one dimensional response of sand. For this purpose a compression shear apparatus based on a multi-ring consolidometer has been developed in which one dimensional loading and unloading tests can be performed without wall friction, and in which simple shear distortion of an enclosed sand can be evaluated. The apparatus is also used to examine one dimensional unloading following horizontal shearing of a vertically loaded sample, which is of special interest for one dimensional behaviour in liquefaction associated phenomena. The one dimensional experimental results obtained from this apparatus are modelled using a mechanistic theory proposed by Dr G. R. Martin.

In heterogeneous media the material parameters may vary with position, dependent variable value and/or time. The governing equation of a physical problem in heterogeneous media is therefore likely to involve variable coefficients. For this reason the solution of variable coefficient partial differential equations (PDEs) is an important engineering problem. In this thesis ways of solving linear variable coefficient PDEs using the boundary element method have been investigated. The application of the boundary element method to these equations is hampered by the difficulty of finding a fundamental solution. In the literature several methods have been proposed to overcome this problem. A survey of these methods has been undertaken in this study from which it is concluded that the most promising approach is the dual reciprocity boundary element method (DR-BEM). The DR-BEM is tested in this thesis for a range of elliptic variable coefficient PDEs. The results of these test problems indicate that the DR-BEM is a promising method for solving elliptic variable coefficient PDEs. However, in some cases, such as problems in highly heterogeneous media, it is found that a large number of internal solution nodes are necessary to ensure accurate results. This can make the DR-BEM computationally expensive. Some new approaches for improving the efficiency of the DR-BEM are proposed. For problems in highly heterogeneous media a subregion approach is recommended. The use of the DR-BEM for linear parabolic variable coefficient PDEs is also investigated. It is found that by combining the DR-BEM with the coupled finite difference &#8211; boundary element method a wide range of parabolic problems can be solved without requiring domain integration. This time-stepping approach can become expensive for variable coefficient PDEs (particularly for large-time solutions) as it requires the solution of a large number of associated elliptic problems with large numbers of internal nodes. Also, it is found that for some problems in highly heterogeneous media the error at each time-step can accumulate leading to poor large-time solutions. To avoid these limitations semi-analytic approaches for solving parabolic equations are investigated. A new semi-analytic method - the separation of variables dual reciprocity method (SOV-DRM) - is proposed which constructs the solution as an eigenfunction expansion. The eigenvalues and eigenvectors are determined using the DR-BEM. This method allows parabolic problems to be solved without requiring time-stepping or domain integration. This method is found to produce accurate results for a range of problems including some problems involving heterogeneous media. Two other semi-analytic methods are also investigated. These methods are implemented and compared with the SOV-DRM. It is concluded that each method has specific strengths and weaknesses and that the choice of method is largely problem dependent.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2551</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Two-phase gas-liquid flow with particular emphasis on holdup measurements and predictions</field><field name="creator">Chen, J. J. J. (John Jiunn Jye)</field><field name="description">The work described in this thesis is an analytical and experimental study of two-phase gas-liquid horizontal flow in a conduit with particular emphasis on holdup measurements and predictions. Holdup and pressure drop, their inter-relationships, and their flow pattern dependence were investigated. A simple method for flow pattern determination was presented so that the appropriate prediction method may be selected for a particular situation. The results were discussed by comparison with a wide range of experimental data and the relevant literature. Two simple devices for holdup measurements were developed in this work and their behaviours were also found to be flow pattern dependent. The results are as follows: In the analytical study, the original Lockhart-Martinelli formulation was treated analytically for ideal stratified flow giving equations which agree with experimental pressure drop and holdup data and the more rigorously derived relationships of Johannessen and Taitel &amp; Dukler. For ideal annular flow, the derived equations predicted pressure drop in large diameter pipes reasonably well giving results which are in agreement with the modified equation of Baker. Poor prediction was achieved for small diameter pipes. The holdup equations derived for annular flow were also in poor agreement with experimental data although a slight modification resulted in an equation that was not only suitable for holdup prediction, but also may be used to represent the original Lockhart-Martinelli holdup correlation over the entire operating range. A correlation was presented for the frictional pressure drop in annular flow based on laboratory air-water data and geothermal steam-water data. The correlation was found to predict pressure loss values which agreed with data from various different sources. The correlation exhibited a point of inflexion which was believed to be due to the transition from a ripple wave type of interfacial disturbance to one of roll wave-droplet entrainment. An extensive literature survey showed that such a transition at high gas rate occurs at all flow orientations and is governed by a critical liquid rate given by a definite value of the Weber number defined in terms of the liquid phase. The Butterworth form of holdup equation was justified by assuming ideal stratified and annular turbulent-turbulent and viscous-viscous flows. A full set of equations for stratified flow covering the cases of liquid-gas, turbulent-viscous and viscous-turbulent were also derived. It was found that the variation in the coefficients and exponential factors in the Butterworth equation was due to at least three factors: the flow pattern, the flow regimes of the phases, i.e., viscous or turbulent, and the range of the value of the ratio of the liquid holdup to the voidage. Furthermore, experimental data were found to behave according to whether the flow pattern was stratified, slug and plug or annular. Equations for determining these flow patterns were presented, based on the derived stratified flow equations, and were checked to be in agreement with the flow pattern maps of Mandhane et al and Taitel &amp; Dukler, and the experimental flow pattern observations of this work. Since the derivation from the original Lockhart-Martinelli formulation did not yield a completely satisfactory relationship for the holdup and pressure drop in annular flow, such a relationship was examined in terms of the film flow equations, Newton's law of viscosity and the Prandtl&#8217;s mixing length. This was also compared with the analysis of Levy of annular-mist flow using the mixing length theory. Throughout the analysis, the results were compared with various sources of laboratory air-water data and geothermal steam-water data, and the discrepancies, if any, were discussed. The rise velocity of Taylor bubbles in conduits was also examined in terms of the film flow equations, the Newton's law of viscosity, the Prandtl&#8217;s mixing length theory and the universal velocity distribution equations. The rise velocity of a Taylor bubble as derived by the Prandtl's mixing length theory has the same form as that derived by Dumitriscu and Davies &amp; Taylor who used the classical potential flow theory. The analysis was extended to justify the Armand equation for holdup for slug and plug flows. Thus, to summarise the analytical work presented in this work, given a set of input conditions, the flow pattern may be predicted as one of three: stratified, slug and plug, annular. From a knowledge of the flow pattern, appropriate methods of holdup and pressure drop prediction may be chosen. The interrelationships between holdup and pressure drop for stratified and annular flow have also been shown. In the experimental study, the application of two simple devices, developed in this work, one of which was subsequently patented, for holdup measurement was investigated. Both devices were found to be flow pattern dependent in their behaviour and require calibrations. During the study of these two devices, pressure drop, holdup and flow pattern data were also generated and were used for the comparison with the analytical part of this work.</field><field name="date">1979</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2548</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Low-cost power generating technology for small-scale stand-alone applications.</field><field name="creator">Elder, Julian M.</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a theoretical basis and the practical implications for using small-scale (up to 50 kW) low-cost power generating systems comprising an ungoverned turbine, a three phase self-excited induction generator, a variable VAr source for voltage regulation, and an electronic load governor. The thrust of this work is towards the reduction of cost by replacing the more conventional synchronous generator by an induction machine and, by eliminating the site-specific fully-governed turbine. An electronic load governor, utilising zero-voltage switching to minimise waveform distortion, is used to regulate the system frequency by controlling the generator loading. The performance of the load governor is analysed in conjunction with both synchronous and induction generators, and the conditions under which the governed system is stable are determined. The induction machine is shown to have better operating characteristics than the synchronous machine and has the further advantages of low maintenance and ready availability making it particularly suitable for isolated applications. A theoretical explanation of the process by which an induction machine self-excites when capacitance is connected across its terminals is developed, and methods of guaranteeing excitation are proposed. It is shown that the remanent magnetism, present in the rotor, plays a significant role in the machine excitation and the conditions leading to loss of remanence are investigated. Once excited, the operation of the induction generator is analysed for both balanced and unbalanced loadings. The practical implications of these results are taken into account in proposals for single phase supplies, these being more desirable in smaller systems. A range of static VAr sources, including a switched capacitor VAr source and an inductively loaded ac-to-dc converter, are considered for controlling the machine&#8217;s excitation. The VAr sources are compared on the basis of harmonic distortion and system stability. The thesis considers the application of these devices to micro-hydro and wind generating systems. Preliminary investigations have been carried out into the use of two-speed induction machines to improve the efficiency of CSCF Constant Speed Constant Frequency wind generating schemes and into the use of centrifugal pumps as ungoverned turbines. Practical results obtained from laboratory experiments and tests on existing micro-hydro installations are included. It is shown that significant reductions in cost are obtainable by employing the methods discussed in this thesis. The resultant systems may incur a reduction in efficiency but there is little reduction in performance and in many respects the quality of supply is improved.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290900 Electrical and Electronic Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2521</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A separate texture/edge image coding system.</field><field name="creator">Knowles, David John</field><field name="description">Digitised pictures have both cosmetic and scientific image aspects. This thesis presents an image coding system that compresses monochromatic digital image information in such a way that the cosmetic-or viewed-image aspects of a reconstructed picture are indistinguishable from the original to a (human) observer. The coding system is concerned with viewed aspects of digitised images and is based on a simplified 2-channel model of the human eye, with the image information being separated into slowly varying texture information and rapidly changing edge information corresponding to those two channels. Each of the two types of image data is coded using techniques suited to its individual characteristics. Texture information is coded using predictive waveform coding where the predictive filter coefficients are generated by linear predictive coding (LPC) techniques. Since the waveform prediction is not perfect, this thesis evaluates several different methods of differential pulse code modulation (DPCM) coding the residual prediction error. This signal is then used to improve the texture coding quality. Image edges are isolated from the digital image data by an asymptotically optimal edge detector known as the Laplacian of Gaussian (LOG) filter. Using two image edge models, the LOG isolated edges produce contours which are used to define edge position, shape, and "sharpness". The edge position data is then compressed using a chain-coding system. The thesis also considers the effect the edge characteristics have on the coding system and develops two methods for reducing the number of coded edges. Reconstruction of the coded image is in two parts corresponding to the two channels of the coding system. The texture information is reconstructed by predicting texture pixels and adding the decoded DPCM error signal. Edge information not contained in the texture coding channel is reconstructed using only edge information corresponding to the high spatial frequency channels of the human eye. These two channels are added together producing the final coded image reconstruction. Also considered are the effects of varying the original image sampling density. The 2-channel coding system is applicable to a wide variety of images, producing coded images with a high visual quality and coding bitrates as low as 0.6 bits/pixel (256 x 256 pixel images), while maintaining a relatively low computational overhead both at the encoder and the decoder.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290900 Electrical and Electronic Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2515</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An empirical study of management controls in product development</field><field name="creator">Akroyd, Christopher Lorin</field><field name="description">Product development is critical for many firms, because in many industries the development of products has become a primary source of competitive advantage. To manage this process many firms use management controls, but the effect of those controls on product development is not clear. Recent research in the product development field suggests that the role of management control is to reduce uncertainty rather than the traditionally-assumed focus of promoting goal congruence, and that organisation members use management controls in an interactive style rather than in the traditionally-assumed diagnostic style. The objective of this thesis is to provide empirical insight into management control practices in product development with particular reference to the interface between organisation members across different functions and hierarchal levels within the organisation. It examines both the role of management controls; either to promote goal congruence or to reduce uncertainty, and the style in which management controls are used; either interactively, diagnostically, to set boundaries, or influence beliefs during the activities that take place during the product development process for different types of product development project. To better understand how this takes place this thesis reports on the boundary objects (i.e. numbers, documents and models) that organisation members use during the product development activities to accomplish management control in practice. Empirical field material was collected during a nine-month intensive longitudinal field study, informed by practice theory (ethnomethodology), which was carried out at a large Australasian multinational company within the consumer foods industry. A participant observation approach was used to collect material from a wide range of sources within the company, including interactions and meetings involving executive managers, functional managers, and product development project teams who were members of the technology, marketing, sales, operations and finance departments. The empirical results indicate that the role of management control changes during the product development process alternating between reducing uncertainty and promoting goal congruence. The style in which management controls are used also differs depending on the stage of the product development process and the nature of the product development projects. Finally, management control was accomplished through the use of different boundary objects for each type of product development project.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Management Control</field><field name="subject">Product Development</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2505</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Brave New Zealand: the construction of a New Zealand identity</field><field name="creator">Skilling, Peter D.</field><field name="description">In 1999, Helen Clark&#8217;s New Zealand Labour Party came to power at the head of a coalition government. Central to the new government&#8217;s agenda was the strengthening of national identity. In the face of increasing globalisation and individualism, the Government saw national identity as something that should be both internally protected (as the guarantor of social cohesion) and externally projected (as a source of value in global markets). The two orientations were related in crucial ways, as New Zealand identity was increasingly narrated around the attitudes and behaviours - such as creativity, innovation and entrepreneurialism - deemed necessary for global economic competitiveness. Drawing on elements of both liberal and critical political theory, and paying particular attention to the discourses deployed by political actors, I describe and critically analyse Labour&#8217;s nation-building project, situating it within a broader project of economic transformation, which was itself a response to a reading of globalisation. Through a detailed examination of the Government&#8217;s political practice in its main statements of intent and in three key policy areas &#8211; cultural, food production and immigration policy - between 1999 and 2007, I ask two questions. Firstly, what constraints were imposed on the assertion of a unique national identity by the Government&#8217;s simultaneous embrace of global economic liberalism? And, secondly, what have been the implications of this assertion for the rights and liberties of individuals and groups within and beyond the state?  Implicit in the nation-building project was an attempt to manage internal difference for the sake of &#8220;the nation&#8221;. Internal diversity could be accepted &#8211; even celebrated &#8211; in the Government&#8217;s project, but only insofar as it was willing and able to contribute to an officially sanctioned vision of a shared national purpose. On this corporate conception of the state, individuals were no longer seen as subjects related by the common recognition of rules of conduct, but as role-performers related in the pursuit of a putative common purpose. The emphasis placed on the trope of the nation asserted a commonality of vision and interests that elided questions of the distribution of costs and benefits, and that marginalised dissenting ideas and perspectives.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2577</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Not just &#8216;old men in raincoats&#8217;: effectiveness of specialised community treatment programmes for sexually abusive children and youth in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Fortune, Clare-Ann Gabrielle</field><field name="description">This study addresses the hitherto limited research on sexually abusive children and youths in New Zealand (NZ).

These included a history of childhood sexual and physical abuse (38%, n = 263 and 39%, n = 272 respectively), behavioural (63%, n = 442) and mental health problems (65%, n = 457), drug and alcohol misuse (22%, n = 156) and a history of suicide ideation or deliberate self-harm (27%, n = 187). They often had poor social skills (46%, n = 326) and had struggled to establish appropriate peer relationships (44%, n = 306).  Many of the children and youth came from multi-problem and chaotic family backgrounds (e.g., 55%, n = 387 of parents were divorced or separated, 38%, n = 267 were exposed to domestic violence and 32%, n = 222 had family member(s) with a substance abuse problem) and had experienced numerous out-of-home placements (57%, n = 389). Factors associated with resiliency were also investigated. It was found that children and youth primarily victimised male and female children (12 years or younger) (70%, n = 1407), who were acquaintances (57%, n = 1295) or relatives (32%, n = 730). Very few victimised strangers (7%, n = 86 of victims were strangers). They engaged in both &#8216;hands on&#8217; (e.g., penetrative acts) and &#8216;hands off&#8217; offences (e.g., voyeurism). Study Two was a naturalistic treatment outcome study to explore treatment outcomes and involved 682 sexually abusive children and youth who attended three specialised community treatment programmes in New Zealand. The main outcome of interest was sexual recidivism (prevalence rate of re-offending during the follow-up period) with secondary outcome variables of general and violent recidivism. The follow-up period ranged from 1 year to 10 years (mean 4.5 years, SD = 2.2). Three groups were compared: the &#8216;Comparison&#8217; group (referral or assessment only, n = 300), &#8216;Treatment Dropout&#8217; group (those who prematurely terminated their involvement in treatment, n = 165) and the &#8216;Treatment Completer&#8217; group (those successfully completing treatment, n = 217). To allow for triangulation of offences that were dealt with through the youth and adult justice system&#8217;s recidivism data were collected from multiple sources (Child, Youth and Family , Youth Court, and Police criminal charges and convictions data). Post-treatment sexual, general (nonsexual and non-violent) and violent recidivism are reported from each data source as well as overall sexual, general and violent recidivism. Sexual, general and violent re-offending that occurred while the children and youths were attending treatment are also presented. Changes in behavioural problems and the psychological functioning of sexually abusive children and youth between assessment and the end of treatment (as assessed by the Child Behavior Checklist, Youth Self Report and Millon Adolescent Clinical Inventory) contribute additional outcome measures. This naturalistic outcome study found that the treatment programmes were effective in reducing sexual recidivism amongst sexually abusive children and youth who completed treatment compared with those who did not complete treatment. Less than 3% (2.8%, n = 8) of Treatment Completers sexually re-offended compared with 6% (n = 17) of the Comparison group and 10% (n = 16) of the Treatment Dropout group. Treatment Dropouts were found to be at highest risk of sexual, general and violent recidivism. Recidivism for the three special populations (children, females and &#8216;special needs&#8217; youth) are also presented. The results from the psychological measures indicate a general pattern of reduction in behavioural and psychological problems between assessment and end of treatment. Logistic regression analysis was used in Study Three (N = 682) to explore factors associated with the risk of sexual and nonsexual (violent and general offending) re-offending post-treatment and dropping out of treatment. The factor predictive of sexual recidivism risk was having three or more victims and was associated with a decreased risk of sexual recidivism. Older age at first known sexual offence was associated with increased chance of nonsexual recidivism. Dropping out of treatment and having a history of nonsexual offending were associated with a decreased risk of nonsexual recidivism. Older age at referral and having no external mandate to attend treatment were associated with increased risk of youth dropping out of treatment. A history of mental health problems was associated with a decreased risk of treatment dropout. Conclusions This is the first study of the characteristics and treatment outcomes of sexually abusive children and youth in New Zealand. Its strengths include the large sample size, length of the follow-up period, use of a comparison group and data triangulation to determine recidivism. This study, therefore, compares favourably with international studies. This research enhances understanding of the individual, family and offending characteristics of sexually abusive youth in New Zealand as well as children, females and special needs youth. The Cognitive Behavioural Theory (CBT) based approach of the community programmes in New Zealand was found to be effective in reducing recidivism amongst children and youths who completed treatment. Specific recommendations relevant to treatment programmes and statutory agencies around programme development, referral processes and identification of sexually abusive children and youth are made. Directions for future research are also discussed. These include research exploring outcomes, other than recidivism, for those attending the Maori programmes, possible exploration of typologies within New Zealand sexually abusive children and youth, and subsequent follow-up research.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Youth offending</field><field name="subject">Recidivism</field><field name="subject">Sexual offending</field><field name="subject">Sexually abusive behaviour</field><field name="subject">Children and Youth</field><field name="subject">Outcome study</field><field name="subject">Treatment</field><field name="subject">Adolescence</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2609</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dynamic pricing of wireless network resources in a competitive provider setting</field><field name="creator">Roggendorf, Matthias</field><field name="description">The ongoing convergence of cell-based wireless systems, from proprietary standards for data transmission toward a unifying approach based on the Internet Protocol (IP), as well as the increasing ability of wireless computer networks to support Quality-of-Service, opens up a tremendous potential for new business models and is expected to significantly alter the way mobile and wireless services are provided. An important field of study is about understanding the implications on the competitive structure of the wireless market. With the technical barriers between di erent technologies more and more diminishing, it becomes possible for customers to select network access on-demand instead of entering long-term contracts with a single wireless network provider based on factors such as connection speed, level of mobility and prices. In such a setting, wireless network providers, but also the regulatory bodies designing the principle market rules, need to learn about new ways of allocating resources among customers to reach their objectives. With resources being available on-demand, pricing becomes an important factor for controlling demand and distributing resources among users. Instead of being fixed over longer periods, pricing can be used for signalling the congestion levels in di erent wireless networks and to let users communicate their willingness-to-pay to the market. Besides presenting a classification framework for pricing in wireless networks and providing a comprehensive review of the relevant literature, the main contributions of this thesis are on the development of behavioural strategies, which di erent entities can follow in the described scenarios. In the first scenario we regard wireless resources as a public good, which should be efficiently allocated among active customers. By letting each provider use a second price auction, with each customer being able to bundle resources from multiple providers, we develop a bidding strategy, which allows customers to distribute their demand among providers. The bidding strategy resembles truth-telling in such a market and is shown to be the best strategy a user can follow to fulfill his demand. We examine the properties of the system analytically and present the results of an extensive simulation study. In the second scenario we model a free market for wireless resources on which prices are determined at the time of request. With customers having more than one option to obtain resources, the task of a provider becomes setting prices so that it maximises revenue under partial or full competition. We discuss the constrained maximisation problem and analyse the situation of a two-provider setting as a game. Simulation is used to analyse the game under uncertainty and to understand if a steady-state situation arises. While the results make use of multiple simplifications to allow us to understand the main model variables, the findings can potentially be of interest for providers and market authorities to develop new ways for resource allocation using dynamic pricing as a tool for reaching their design objectives.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wireless</field><field name="subject">Pricing</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2880</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Primary-school children's conceptions of light and their relation to the historical progression of optics</field><field name="creator">Noble, Ann-Marie</field><field name="description">The current study assessed children&#8217;s ideas on light and optics using a cross-sectional design.  Given current literature and theory within cognitive psychology, history of science and science education, it was expected that (i) older children would be more likely than younger children to have a modern scientific understanding of light concepts; (ii) for many of the light concepts, there would be a parallel between the pattern of progression and change in children&#8217;s conceptions of light and scientists&#8217; conceptions of light throughout history, and, finally; (iii) employing a historical lens would allow for a better understanding of not only the age-related patterns in children&#8217;s ideas of light but also children&#8217;s age specific alternative conceptions of light. A Light Core Concepts Questionnaire (LCCQ) was administered to participants (N=757) from across a wide age group (6 to 12 years).  The participants were representative of ethnic groups attending a range of primary schools situated in a large New Zealand city.  None of the participants had received classroom instruction in light and optics.  The verbally delivered LCCQ was used to elicit children&#8217;s responses about prerequisite concepts necessary for a scientific understanding of the physics of light and employed two-choice, multi-choice and open-ended questions.  Some questions were specifically designed to compare children&#8217;s conceptual understanding on light and optics with ideas adopted throughout the history of science. The results of the current research found that with increasing age (6 to 12 years old) children&#8217;s modern scientific understanding for many concepts on the physics of light increases.  In comparison with other research, a higher proportion of children participating in the current study held correct views at younger ages.  On easily observable phenomena, children as young as 7 years could identify common light sources and knew that some objects are reflectors of light.  By age 12, the majority of children could correctly identify more abstract concepts such as what causes colours in rainbows. Results of the present research indicate there is a parallel between the age-related patterns of children&#8217;s ideas on light and the historical progression of scientific knowledge of the physics of light.  With regard to light and vision, both early scientists and children held a similar range of alternative beliefs, that is, extramission, intromission or Eastern Islamic theories.  Similar beliefs were shared about other concepts that were accepted as true theories in the history of science.  For example, colour is the property of the object and when an object is placed in water it becomes distorted because water is less perfect than air. The results indicate that the pattern of alternative conceptions held by children as they relate to history provides further understanding of why there are differences in children&#8217;s beliefs about light and optics across age groups.  For more difficult concepts, children and early scientists initially formulate similar theories based on their observations and what appears to be commonsense.  As they reconceptualise their ideas, children and scientists formulate similar more abstract theories.  In addition to discussing the value of the history of science as a lens to better understand children&#8217;s conceptions, the implications of these results are discussed as they relate to specific kinds of interventions or instructional approaches to elicit successful conceptual change in the classroom.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">science education</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2626</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparative morphological, anatomical and embryological studies of Prumnopitys taxifolia and P. ferruginea (Podocarpaceae), and the hydrodynamics of their saccate pollen grains</field><field name="creator">Salter, Joshua</field><field name="description">Prumnopitys taxifolia (Banks et Sol. ex D. Don) de Laub. (matai) and P. ferruginea (D. Don) de Laub. (miro) are two New Zealand podocarps with morphologically very different reproductive structures. In P. taxifolia the pollen cones are sessile on spicate fertile branches, whereas in P. ferruginea they are solitary on short scaly peduncles. Likewise, in P. taxifolia the ovulate strobilus is an attenuated spicate structure bearing globose seeds, whereas in P. ferruginea the reduced ovulate strobilus bears a dorsi-ventrally flattened, usually solitary seed on a slender scaly peduncle. Such differences throw doubt on the validity of the current delimitations of the genus Prumnopitys. A comparative embryological study of these two species was done in parallel with a morphological and anatomical study of the reproductive structures to fill gaps in their known reproductive life cycles, and to determine whether there are any differences in the male and female cones or in their embryogeny that are of taxonomic significance at the generic level. In addition the hydrodynamic properties of their saccate pollen grains were compared with that of the pollen of several other conifers and the spores of three ferns and one lycopod. Morphology and Embryology Embryologically these two species are shown to be more similar to each other and to the Chilean Prumnopitys andina than to other podocarp genera. For instance, in both species: the long tapered archegonia have prominent neck cells with a thickened cap overlying them; five free nuclear mitoses occur before cell formation in the proembryo; meiosis can result in both linear and non-linear tetrads of megaspores; the microgametophyte typically forms 7 or 8 prothallial cells before dispersal. However, new morphological and anatomical differences have emerged from this study. In the pollen cones of P. taxifolia, the microsporangia are free with a transverse stomium located close to the cone axis; in P. ferruginea they are fused with the transverse stomium located basally. In P. taxifolia ovules, a tanniniferous layer develops in the epimatium and not in the integument, and fusion of epimatium/integument/nucellus is greatest dorsi-ventrally; in P. ferruginea ovules a prominent tanniniferous layer develops only in the integument, and fusion of epimatium/integument/nucellus is greatest laterally. Furthermore, observations of insect predation point to biochemical differences between P. taxifolia and P. ferruginea. An undescribed species of gall midge appears to be specialized exclusively for the P. taxifolia life cycle, and several other insect larvae prey on the developing and mature seeds, whereas the ovules/seeds of P. ferruginea appear to have almost no insect predators. Morphologically, anatomically and biochemically, P. taxifolia and P. ferruginea may therefore be sufficiently different to warrant being two separate genera; comparable differences have been used to distinguish other genera in the Podocarpaceae. Since embryogeny is likely to be under less evolutionary pressure than morphology and anatomy, and since P. taxifolia (along with P. andina) is regarded by some as basal in the conifers, with P. ferruginea less so, their embryological similarity does not necessarily indicate close relationship, only that they are closer to each other than to the other podocarps. Although their morphological and anatomical differences may be of taxonomic significance, a better understanding of the other species currently in Prumnopitys is necessary before the relationships within the genus can be clarified. Pollen Hydrodynamics Despite the morphological differences in their ovulate cones, P. taxifolia and P. ferruginea have very similar pollination mechanisms involving an inverted micropyle, a pollination drop and saccate pollen. Saccate grains have sometimes been referred to as 'non-wettable' due to their buoyant properties, while non-saccate pollen grains have been described as 'wettable'. The hydrodynamic properties of saccate pollen grains of seven podocarp species in five genera, Dacrydium Sol. ex G. Forst., Dacrycarpus (Endl.) de Laub., Manoao Molloy, Podocarpus L'H&#233;r. ex pers. and Prumnopitys Phil. have been tested in water, together with saccate and non-saccate pollen of four other conifer genera, Cedrus Trew (Pinaceae), Cephalotaxus Siebold &amp; Zucc. ex Endl. (Cephalotaxaceae), Cupressus L. (Cupressaceae) and Phyllocladus Rich. ex Mirb. (Phyllocladaceae), and spores of three fern species and one lycopod species. All four spore types studied were non-wettable, whereas the bisaccate and trisaccate pollen types, like all the other conifer pollen types, were wettable, enabling the grains to cross the surface tension barrier of water. Once past this barrier, grain behaviour was governed by presence or absence of sacci. Non-saccate and vestigially saccate grains sank, whereas saccate grains behaved like air bubbles, floating up to the highest point. In addition, the grains were observed to float in water with sacci uppermost, consistent with the suggestion that distally-placed sacci serve to orientate the germinal furrow of the pollen grain towards the nucellus of an inverted ovule. Observations of pollen grains in the pollen chambers of naturally pollinated Prumnopitys ovules confirmed this. The combination of buoyancy and wettability in saccate pollen has implications for the efficiency of the typical podocarp pollination mechanism. Since saccate pollen, inverted ovules and pollination drops are also characteristic of the Pinaceae, the similarities in the pollination mechanisms and the pollen grains of P. taxifolia and P. ferruginea have no taxonomic significance at the generic level.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2566</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In a different voice: a case study of Marianne and Jane Williams, missionary educators in northern New Zealand, 1823-1835.</field><field name="creator">Fitzgerald, Tanya G.</field><field name="description">This thesis is a case study that examines the educative activities of two Church Missionary Society (CMS) women, Marianne Coldham Williams and her sister-in-law Jane Nelson Williams, during the period 1823-1835. This study examines the role and status of these two missionary women in the early CMS mission station at Paihia in northern New Zealand. Marianne and Jane Williams were missionary educators whose primary task was to establish schools for local Maori pupils and resident missionary pupils. These first mission schools were established according to a perceived hierarchy of "need." Consequently, the first schools, established in 1823 were for Nga Puhi women and girls followed by a school for the missionary daughters in 1826. A school for Nga Puhi men and boys was not established until 1827 and a school for the missionary sons was delayed until 1828. Through the re-formation of Maori women as Christian women, Maori society was to replicate the "pleasantries" of (Pakeha) "Christian society." The schoolroom, not the pulpit became the central site to instigate changes in Maori society and the CMS initially charged Marianne and Jane Williams with the responsibility for this task. One of the strategies developed by Marianne and Jane Williams to survive in a frontier society was to form a network based on their sister-hood. Through the exchanging of letters between the two women in New Zealand and their "sisters" in England, a reciprocal friendship was created that provided Marianne and Jane with the support they sought. These letters and diaries provide valuable autobiographical accounts of the daily lives and missionary activities of Marianne and Jane. This study, therefore, presents a challenge to prevailing historical narratives that position men at the centre of missionary activities. Missionary policy documents and manuscript material written by early nineteenth century missionary women and men reveal that in New Zealand women played a critical role in the "Christianising" and "civilising" policies and practices. In placing women at the centre of historical inquiry and as historical agents, this study re-presents the historical narrative in a different voice.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2568</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Le Matuamoepo: competing 'spirits of governing' and the management of New Zealand-based Samoan youth offender cases</field><field name="creator">Suaalii, Tamasailau M.</field><field name="description">This thesis considers the 'spirits of governing' that currently frame youth justice approaches to Samoan youth offending in New Zealand, today. It claims that, in the current management of Samoan youth offending cases, three main spirits of governing are in play. These are the spirits of neo-liberal risk management cultural appropriateness, and faaSamoa. All three spirits operate simultaneously, in multilayered and intersecting ways. Gaining insight into this complexity is critical to building an understanding of the points of tension that may arise in the operationalisation of 'culturally appropriate' youth justice policies in the case of Samoan youth offenders. To highlight the complex character of these spirits of governing and their relationships, the thesis first describes each spirit of governing and then considers how they compete, intersect and/or diverge through a close analysis of seven youth justice cases. Analysis of each of the seven cases is based on interviews with a Samoan youth offender, a family representative, their CYFS social worker, police youth aid officer, Youth Court youth advocate and a community intervention programme worker. The key sites of government examined in this work are those of the family, the Youth Court, the youth justice family group conference and a community intervention programme service. The thesis reveals that to gain nuanced understanding of the complexities of managing a Samoan youth offender case, it is not simply a question of knowing what 'spirits of governing' are at play, one also needs to examine how they play. I contend that these three 'spirits' have specific relationships with each other. In youth justice, neo-liberalism opened up space for cultural appropriateness which, in turn allowed for the circulation of the faaSamoa. These three 'spirits', however, can not be reduced to each other because of their differing understanding of governmental strategies, techniques and subjects. In particular, they differ on their understanding of the role of families, of collaboration and of cultural expertise. Consequently, for example, while these three 'spirits of governing' 'agree' on the value of cultural appropriateness, they do not 'agree' on how it should be defined and measured. Too often when politically sensitive programmes or policies, such as those involving ethnic-specific cases, do not work, the response from politicians and programme personnel alike is to couch their failures in overly simplistic terms. This work seeks to indicate the importance of developing culturally nuanced models of analysis that can engage in the complexities of governing across cultural divides, in the improvement of practice in the field and in the development of a sociology capable of enhancing cross-cultural understanding.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370100 Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2570</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New Zealand defence acquisition decision making: politics and processes</field><field name="creator">Greener, Peter</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2569</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A theory for schooling improvement: consistency and connectivity to improve instructional practice</field><field name="creator">Annan, Brian</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the problem of how to speed up the process through which professional educators learn how to significantly improve disadvantaged students&#8217; academic achievement. The problem is addressed through three questions: (i) What are the most effective national and international examples of school improvement? (ii) What is the condition of the evidence base for making claims of effectiveness? (iii) What can be learned about developing and implementing effective school improvement from those national and international examples? The thesis begins by searching international and national school improvement literature to find those initiatives with the strongest evidence of effectiveness. One initiative in England (the National Literacy and Numeracy Strategies) and four initiatives in the United States (Success For All, Direct Instruction, The School Development Programme &amp; a district-wide reform in New York District #2) were considered to have strong evidence of effectiveness. Two initiatives in New Zealand (the Numeracy Development Project &amp; the Strengthening Education in Mangere and Otara project commonly called SEMO) had evidence that showed promise. It is argued that patterns of investment in different types of evaluation and ease of access to achievement information account for the difference between the strong international evidence and promising evidence in New Zealand. A series of investigations in the middle of the thesis focus on the processes set up in the initiatives to help practitioners learn effective reform practices. Three models of learning processes are developed which reveal a strong preference for vertical learning in England and the United States and a more balanced vertical-horizontal learning preference in New Zealand. Despite those contrasts, three characteristics were found to be common to all seven effective initiatives. They are a sharp focus on instructional improvement, a set of standardised practices, and, learning connections to transfer the reform ideas into practice. The latter part of the thesis transforms those three characteristics into a theory for schooling improvement which contribute to a faster and more effective reform process.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2575</field></doc><doc><field name="title">TV love: television and technologies of intimacy</field><field name="creator">Crozier, Susan</field><field name="description">TV Love is a study of the emotional and imaginative possibilities summoned and sustained by television programmes, possibilities that are here gathered under the rubric of love. By taking seriously a vernacular claim to love particular television programmes, this thesis intervenes in conventional practices of academic television criticism. It does so in order to develop an approach that would allow a focus on what television programmes make possible for the viewers who love them. I argue that the transactions between viewers and television texts constitute forms of emotional training that not only reproduce social subjectification, but also enable diverse forms of intimate experience. This is especially important for those subjects who struggle to find forms of psychic sustenance in an off-screen context. The critical approach taken in this thesis is termed reparative, following the work of Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, in so far as it describes a process of restoring value to much maligned cultural objects. As a rationale for critical practice, reparation recognises the inadequacy of the social context in which diverse subjects must make a possible world for themselves. In particular, reparation describes the processes by which queer subjects have been able to mark out the terms of their own possibility in the face of difficult social or psychic conditions. The value of reparative criticism is not limited to queer readers or viewers, although queerness frequently demonstrates what is at issue between the conventions of academic television criticism and the alternate mode developed in this thesis. While academic criticism most often focuses on the ideological lessons presumed to be delivered by television programmes, this frequently overlooks the smaller scale emotional work that subjects carry out every day. Television programmes can both enable this emotional work and be the subject of its labours. In order to develop a fuller and more useful practice of television criticism than currently exists, TV Love contends that it is necessary to attend to the affectively enlivening potential of television for its viewers. The first chapter considers television as a technology of intimacy in terms of its domestic location and critically analyses television scholarship that has sought to address the specificity of that context. The second chapter further develops this theoretical overview by examining approaches that more explicitly deal with the affective engagements television allows. It then moves on to outline the particular reparative approach taken in this thesis. Chapter Three considers the series of documentaries that began with Seven Up in 1964 and, in a departure from the conventional discussion of class associated with the documentaries, this chapter focuses on the affective training the series carries out over its four decade history. The situation comedy Bewitched is the focus of the fourth chapter, which explores the way in which sitcoms can be profoundly imbricated in the very experience of childhood and family life. The repetition of a favourite programme from childhood, even years later, can generate emotional returns that demonstrate this intimate connection. Chapter Five continues the discussion of situation comedy with an analysis of the seventies hit The Mary Tyler Moore Show. In particular this chapter attends to the reiterations of the Mary Richards character across other textual contexts in order to identify the emotional competencies the Mary character makes possible beyond her seventies context. Chapter Six takes on the heritage criticism that has framed academic thinking about the serial drama Brideshead Revisited and presents an alternate reading in which high-cultural forms serve to connote homosexuality. The final chapter examines a series of programmes about the late Diana, Princess of Wales in order to identify the affective politics those programmes might be seen to enable.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::379900 Other Studies In Human Society::379901 Gender specific studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2567</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Internationalizing the entrepreneurial high technology, knowledge-intensive firm</field><field name="creator">Coviello, Nicole Elizabeth</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2581</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Whakapapa and the state: some case studies in the impact of central government on traditionally organised M&#257;ori groups</field><field name="creator">Carter, Lynette Joy</field><field name="description">This thesis examines modern iwi governance systems and their effect on whakapapa as an organisational framework in M&#257;ori societies. The main question addressed was; can whakapapa survive as an organisational process, or will it be stifled, as M&#257;ori societies struggle to establish a strong identity in contemporary New Zealand. As an organisational framework for M&#257;ori societies, whakapapa works through a series of principles that function through relationships between people, and between people and other elements that make up the world. Contemporary M&#257;ori groups continue to claim that they are whakapapa-based societies. This thesis examines that claim by investigating to what extent of "being M&#257;ori" today is about adherence to those principles and to whakapapa-based processes and relationships, and how much is it about being shaped by non-M&#257;ori constructs that have been formed by state-intervention and legislated changes to M&#257;ori social organisation. If being Maori today has as much or more to do with the latter, what place does whakapapa have in contemporary M&#257;ori society, and to what level and to what extent can the principles of whakapapa be upheld as the basis for contemporary M&#257;ori societies. A series of stories and case studies were used to answer the questions posed in the thesis. The case studies demonstrated the ways in which whakapapa worked in everyday situations, and how the people who take part in whakapapa-based relationships understood them to work. They also demonstrated how state intervention through legislation has challenged the way M&#257;ori groups structure themselves when new circumstances have required compromise and change. The institutionalised evolution of M&#257;ori societies is examined in more detail using one example of a modern tribal structure, Te R&#363;nanga o Ng&#257;i Tahu. The Ng&#257;i Tahu example typifies the implications for M&#257;ori if they choose to move from a whakapapa-based organisational model of governance to a centralised legalbureaucratic model of governance. The adoption of the new centralised governance structures, such as Te R&#363;nanga o Ng&#257;i Tahu, will mean that M&#257;ori hap&#363; and iwi societies are in danger of disappearing to be replaced by a generic group,shaped by legislation and integrated into the wider nation-state of New Zealand. Whakapapa can only remain at the core of M&#257;ori societies, if M&#257;ori allow it to, but when M&#257;ori adopt centralised "generic" system of governance, hap&#363; and iwi societies, become censored versions of their former selves.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2573</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Model-based strategies for automated segmentation of cardiac magnetic resonance images</field><field name="creator">Lin, Xiang, 1971-</field><field name="description">Segmentation of the left and right ventricles is vital to clinical magnetic resonance imaging studies of cardiac function. A single cardiac examination results in a large amount of image data. Manual analysis by experts is time consuming and also susceptible to intra- and inter-observer variability. This leads to the urgent requirement for efficient image segmentation algorithms to automatically extract clinically relevant parameters. Present segmentation techniques typically require at least some user interaction or editing, and do not deal well with the right ventricle. This thesis presents mathematical model based methods to automatically localize and segment the left and right ventricular endocardium and epicardium in 3D cardiac magnetic resonance data without any user interaction. An efficient initialization algorithm was developed which used a novel temporal Fourier analysis to determine the size, orientation and position of the heart. Quantitative validation on a large dataset containing 330 patients showed that the initialized contours had only ~ 5 pixels (modified Hausdorff distance) error on average in the middle short-axis slices. A model-based graph cuts algorithm was investigated and achieved good results on the midventricular slices, but was not found to be robust on other slices. Instead, automated segmentation of both the left and right ventricular contours was performed using a new framework, called SMPL (Simple Multi-Property Labelled) atlas based registration. This framework was able to integrate boundary, intensity and anatomical information. A comparison of similarity measures showed the sum of squared difference was most appropriate in this context. The method improved the average contour errors of the middle short-axis slices to ~ 1 pixel. The detected contours were then used to update the 3D model using a new feature-based 3D registration method. These techniques were iteratively applied to both short-axis and long-axis slices, resulting in a 3D segmentation of the patient&#8217;s heart. This automated model-based method showed a good agreement with expert observers, giving average errors of ~ 1&#8211;4 pixels on all slices.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">medical</field><field name="subject">image</field><field name="subject">segmentation</field><field name="subject">automatic</field><field name="subject">cardiac</field><field name="subject">MRI</field><field name="subject">registration</field><field name="subject">atlas-based</field><field name="subject">model-based</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2641</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Revisioning evangelical theology: an exploration, evaluation and extension of the theological method of Stanley J. Grenz</field><field name="creator">Harris, Brian S.</field><field name="description">In spite of the rapid growth of evangelicalism there is a paucity of reflection on its theological method. The transition from modernity to postmodernity, with the accompanying call for a postfoundationalist rather than a foundationalist method, has provided additional challenges to evangelicalism. Canadian theologian Stanley J. Grenz has proposed a model for evangelical theological construction that utilizes scripture, tradition and culture as the sources for theology, and the Trinity, community and eschatology as its focal motifs. He supplements these with the belief that the Spirit guides the church, and that the community of faith will therefore be pneumatologically guided as it communally attempts to discern truth in a changed context. Grenz believes that his theological method moves beyond foundationalism as it appeals to a trio of interacting sources, rather than to the single source of scripture. In exploring and evaluating Grenz' theological method, this thesis tests the research proposition "that Stanley Grenz' theological method effectively revisions evangelical theology." To ascertain the validity of the proposition, it utilizes four evaluative questions which explore the originality, theological coherence, appropriateness and effectiveness of Grenz'method for evangelical theology. The application of his model in his text, Welcoming but Not Affirming, serves as a test case to determine the implications of his method. Concluding that Grenz' model makes only a modest contribution towards revisioning evangelical theological method, the concluding chapters of the research explore ways to supplement Grenz' model to allow a stronger affirmation of the research proposition. Utilizing Wolterstorff's concept of control beliefs, it proposes that Grenz' model would be more effective if he added a control belief to guide his theological construction, and motivates for adopting the control belief the gospel liberates.ln addition, it argues that Grenz' three focal motifs for theology need to be preceded by the gathering motif of the cross, arguing that if seen outside of this gathering motif, the motifs of Trinity, community and eschatology lack adequate substance. Noting the often acrimonious context in which theological revisioning takes place, the research ends with a plea for the empowerment of imagination in theological construction.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::440000 Philosophy and Religion::440200 Religion and Religious Traditions::440204 Christian theology (incl.

(Patricia Mary)</field><field name="description">New Zealand families segregating the Huntington disease (HD) phenotype were investigated for linkage of the HD locus to the anonymous DNA locus G8, from chromosome 4p16.3. Linkage of the two loci was indicated in the largest family assessed. The results from this family together with those from 10 other smaller families were consistent with the existence of a single locus (that is, genetic homogeneity for HD). One crossover between the HD locus and the G8 marker locus was detected. Overall, the results of the linkage analysis indicate a distance of 4cM separating HD from G8. The usefulness of G8 as a marker in predictive testing for HD was examined in the New Zealand families. In agreement with overseas findings, G8 and DNA contiguous with G8 are useful for predictive testing in some families. The main limitation for predictive testing is the family structure which often results in the unavailability of key individuals for testing and thus prevents prediction in others. Sequence analysis of three sites which produce restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) detected by G8 revealed that single point mutations were responsible for the presence or absence of the polymorphic sites *H1, *H2 and *E. The sequences were highly conserved between individuals in the regions investigated. The conservation of sequence provided the potential for the use of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify each polymorphic region for more rapid assessment of these RFLPs. The three regions were amplified successfully from genomic DNA. In addition, amplification of the three regions was possible with template DNA which was degraded or crude or isolated from tissue which had been fixed in formalin. However, the results of the subsequent analyses of the amplified products by restriction enzyme digestion showed that there are problems that can render the PCR unreliable. The presence of non-target sequences hindered detection of the genotype in the *H1 and *H2 regions and masked the true genotype of a person in the *E region. Thus, the potential of the PCR for presymptomatic diagnosis of HD remains to be realised. However, when the problems are overcome a very rapid analysis of RFLPs linked with HD using the PCR will be possible, as will be retrospective analyses.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2601</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Selected ecological aspects of the Manukau Harbour</field><field name="creator">Henriques, P. R. (Paul R.)</field><field name="description">Several ecological aspects of the Manukau Harbour related to its benthic flora end fauna, water chemistry, sedimentology, and bacteriology were investigated. Vertical colour aerophotographs were taken of all vegetated tidelands within the Harbour and six vegetation types were indentified, mapped, and discussed in terms of their ecological significance. Meadows of the intertidal seaweed Gracilaria secundata var. pseudoflagellifera near the Manukau Sewage Oxidation Ponds were found to have increased virtually logarithmically in extent since the commencement of operations of the Manukau Purification Works. The possible relation of this increase to contributions of mutrients and fine sediments from the Ponds is considered. The effects of stress, sediment type, and the presence of macrovegetation on benthic faunal community structure are studied. The majority of the findings are somewhat inconclusive; however it is found that mangrove swamps and eelgrass flats clearly appear to increase faunal species diversity. Water and sediment nutrients were examined and found to be at high levels in the north-east region of the Harbour. It is concluded that sediments probably undergo less temporal variation in nutrient levels than do overlying waters and might therefore provide a more cost-effective method of studying cultural eutrophication in the Manukau and similar harbours. Sediment particle size distribution was looked at and it was determined that sediments are extremely fine near the Manukau Sewage Oxidation Ponds, coarser but still muddy in most of the inlets of the Harbour, and sandy in most of the open Harbour intertidal flats remote from pollution sources. Counts of coliform bacteria were made and levels in intertidal sediments were found to be generally higher than in overlying waters but not less temporally variable. It was also determined that waters and sediments of the north-east region of the Harbour are of poor sanitary quality. Several management considerations are discussed in relation to the results of the study. Further research needs are outlined terms of 22 research projects addressed to waste water management, land erosion control, and tidelands managements.</field><field name="date">1977</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2598</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tui sociodynamics: foraging behaviour, social organisation, and use of song by tui in an urban area.</field><field name="creator">Bergquist, Carol A. L. (Carol Anne Lillias)</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the behavioural ecology of the tui, Prosthemadera novaeseelandiae, a member of the Meliphagidae (honeyeaters), in the suburban Auckland region of the mainland of New Zealand. Tui are highly nectarivorous but observations show differences in degree of importance between the three food categories; nectar, fruit and insects according to season. when foraging for nectar tui are not responsive to flower colour but use all flowers with nectar concentrations greater than 7% (wt. per wt.) and use fruit when nectar availability falls. Foraging observations are significantly different for male and female tui with males taking more nectar and females taking more insects, in response to greater protein requirement as well as a result of status affecting foraging. There is also a seasonal difference in method of prey capture with the more energetically expensive hawking occurring in times of greater nectar availability or when very few insects in relation to nectar are taken. Colour-banded tui are shown to move in family groups over distances ranging from 5 to 35km in search of nectar for much of the year, but are localised into small foraging areas during breeding when nectar is abundant. Group members remain together and nest near each other, female offspring nesting closer to parents than male offspring. There is differential access to both natural and artificial food resources and the various asymmetries of sex, age and residency determine relative status at food sources but are not absolute. Loud song is the most conspicuous behaviour and is used to mediate avoidance between individuals and between groups. An artificial food source is partitioned temporally and spatially during breeding with the local higher status birds that use the feeders having significantly greater breeding success. Unlike results published for most passerines, both sexes of tui sing throughout the year and songs in their repertoire show sexual, seasonal, behavioural and individual variation. Pairs duet and both sexes will match songs with mates and with neighbours; resulting in apparent dialect areas corresponding with group boundaries. Avian spirochaetosis is identified as one of the causes of death in a population with 13-30% annual loss. Losses are readily compensated for as the nesting cycle is short and the breeding season is long. This, together with an opportunistic foraging strategy, great mobility and prolonged association in family groups explains the continued presence of tui in suburban areas.</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2576</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The continuing effects of low birth weight</field><field name="creator">Macarthur, Barton A.</field><field name="description">Perinatal associations of low birth weight and its long term sequelae were surveyed and the resulting hypotheses examined in a study of 240 children classified by birth weight, gestational age and sex. Subjects were placed in small for gestational age, pre-term appropriate for gestational age, control, pre-term small for gestational age, low birth weight with gastroenteritis and very low birth weight groups. Assessment was blind and, where necessary, groups were randomly selected. Data were gathered from four stages of the subjects&#8217; development; the pregnancy, the newborn period, pre-school and school age. Analysis of pregnancy data showed that some aspects of the intrauterine environment provided by a number of mothers was less than optimal. In the neonatal period, the low birth weight groups were at some disadvantage and, further, there were aspects where there was some evidence that either the treatment or the condition for which it was required could possiblY influence subsequent development. The pre-school period was marked by sex differences, particularly in cognitive functioning. Disadvantage in all instances was confined to the low birth weight male groups. Some events in the prenatal, perinatal and neonatal periods appeared to be associated with poorer performance on intelligence tests more than four years later. Among these influences were mothers' smoking habits, temperature, duration of tube feeding and gastroenteritis while in hospital. Assessment at school revealed the same pattern of cognitive development among the subgroups that had been apparent at the pre-school stage. The pre-term males found adjustment to school difficult and made slow progress in reading in comparison with the females belonging to the same group. At this age the term - small for gestational age group was still lagging behind in physical development. It was concluded that the low birth weight males constituted a group who were &#8216;at risk&#8217; because of slower cognitive development. This was particularly evident in so far as the pre-term males were concerned.</field><field name="date">1977</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2599</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The arts in the New Zealand curriculum: from policy to practice</field><field name="creator">Mansfield, Janet Elaine</field><field name="description">In this thesis I portray through a history of music and art education in New Zealand the forms knowledge production took in these subject and the discourses within which they were embedded. This enables a more comprehensive understanding of curriculum and unearths connections with what Lyotard (1984) described as 'grand narrative' used to legitimate knowledge claims and practices at certain historical moments. Through such histories we may chart the progress of European civilization within the local context and provide the historical raison d'&#195;&#170;tre for the present state of affairs in music and arts areas of the New Zealand curriculum. Curriculum and its 'reform' representing in part the distribution of public goods and services, has been embroiled in a market project. I seek to expose the politics of knowledge involved in the construction of the notion of The Arts within a neo-liberal policy environment. This environment has involved the deliberate construction of a 'culture of enterprise and competition' (Peters, 1995: 52) and, in the nurturing of conditions for trans-national capital's freedom of movement, a withdrawal from Keynesian economic and social policy, an assault on the welfare state. The thesis delves beyond the public face of policy-making. It follows and scrutinizes critically the birth of The Arts in the New Zealand Curriculum to the production of the first draft of the proposed policy presented by the Ministry of Education in 1999. I examine it as a site of the 'accumulation of meaning' (Derrida, 1981: 57) through a discussion of the history of meaning of 'art' and 'art' education. There is much of value in the Draft document. In particular, the arts have been invested with a new intellectual weight and the professionalism, passion and dedication of those involved in its writing shines through in each of the subject areas within the arts. However, through a process of analysis, I will show that there has been, in fact, a fashioning of a new container for the isolation of artistic knowledge. This is despite official sentiments mentioning possibilities within the document for flourishing separate Music, Art, Dance, and Drama education that implies increased curriculum space. The Draft Arts (1999) document both disguises and rehashes the 'master narrative' of universal rationality and artistic canons and is unlikely to work towards revitalising or protecting local cultural identities though not through lack of intention. I use Lyotard's notion of 'performativity' to critique notions of 'skills' and their 'development' which are implicitly and explicitly stated within the 'levels' of development articulated in the Draft Arts (1999) document. It is argued that this conflation works to enforce cultural homogeneity. There are clear dangers that the Draft Arts' (1999) conception of 'Arts Literacies' might operate as mere functional literacy in the service of the dominant culture's discourse of power and knowledge-one which celebrates the art-as-commodity ideal. It is argued that the Education Ministry's theoretical and epistemological construction of The Arts as one area of learning is unsound, and in fact represents a tightening of modernism's hierarchical notion of culture. New Zealand, now post-colonial or post-imperialist, both bi-cultural and multi-cultural, is situated on the south-western edge of the Pacific Rim. Culturally, it now includes Pacific Island, Asian, and new immigrants, as well as Maori and people of European descent. This therefore necessitates aesthetic practices which, far from promoting a set of universal principles for the appreciation of art - one canonical rule or 'standard' - recognise and reflect cultural difference. Merely admitting cultural difference is inadequate. By working away critically at the deeply held ethno-centric assumptions of modernism, its selective traditions concerned with 'practices, meanings, gender, "races", classes' (Pollock, 1999: 10), its universalising aesthetics of beauty, formal relations, individuality, authenticity or originality, and self-expression, of 'negativity and alienation, and abstraction' (Huyssens, 1986: 209), it is possible to begin to understand the theoretical task of articulating difference with regard to aesthetics. The development of the arts curriculum in New Zealand is placed within the modernism/postmodernism and modernity/postmodernity debates. These debates have generated a number of questions which are forcing us to re-examine the assumptions of modernism. The need for the culture of modernism to become self-critical of its own determining assumptions in order to come to understand its cultural practices, is becoming an urgent theoretical task, especially in disciplines and fields concerned with the transmission of acquired learning and the production of new knowledge. The culture of modernism is often taken as the historical succession of twentieth century avant-gardes (B. Smith, 1998) yet the culture of modernity, philosophically speaking, strictly begins with Ren&#195;&#169; Descartes several hundred years earlier, with a pre-history in the Florentine renaissance and the re-discovery of Graeco-Roman artistic and literary forms going back to the thirteenth century. Aesthetic modernism identifies with consumer capitalism and its major assumptions are rationalist, individualist and focus upon the autonomy of both the 'work of art' and the artist at the expense of the artwork, its reception and audience within its localised cultural context. The ideological features of humanism/liberalism - its privileging of the individual subject, the moral, epistemological and aesthetic privileging of the author/artist - are examined as forces contributing to modernism's major values (or aesthetic). Such approaches, it is argued, were limited for dealing with difference. The security and reproductive nature of modernistic approaches to curriculum in the arts areas are destabilized by thinking within the postmodern turn, and the effects of the changes questioning the basic epistemological and metaphysical assumptions in disciplinary fields including art/literature, artchitecture, philosophy and political theory, are registered here, within the field of the education in and through the arts. In a seminal description or report on knowledge, Jean-Fran&#195;&#167;ois Lyotard defines postmodernism as 'incredulity towards metanarratives' (1984: xxiv). Postmodernism, he argues, is 'undoubtedly part of the modern', 'not modernism at its end but in its nascent state and that state is constant (1984: 79). After Lyotard, postmodernism might be seen, therefore, not just as a mode or manner or attitude towards the past, but also as a materializing discourse comprising a dynamic reassessment and re-examination of modernism and modernity's culture. The thinking subject (the cogito) seen as the fount of all knowledge, its autonomy, and transparency, its consideration as the centre of artistic and aesthetic virtuosity and moral action, is subjected to intellectual scrutiny and suspicion. The need for an aesthetics of difference is contextualised through an examination of western hierarchies of art and the aesthetics of marginalized groups. I use the theories of poststructuralist, Jacques Derrida and Jean-Fran&#195;&#167;ois Lyotard, to examine the concept of difference. These theoretical inspirations are used as methodological tools for offsetting the privileging of the liberal individual and individualism. Rather than the mere consideration of difference in curricula, I seek to insert and establish the principle of an aesthetics of difference into relations of pedagogy and curricula. The implications for professional practice resulting from a recognition of a politics of representation are examined and a politics of difference. I argue that art education in all its manifestations can no longer avoid the deeper implications of involvement with representation, including forms of gender, ethnicity and class representation as well as colonial representation. The Western canon's notion of 'artists' and their 'art', often based upon white bourgeois male representations and used in many primary school classrooms, are part and parcel of 'social and political investments in canonicity', a powerful 'element in the hegemony of dominant social groups and interests' (Pollock, 1999: 9). Difference is not appreciated in this context. School art, music, and drama classrooms can become sites for the postmodern questioning of representation of 'the other'. In this context, an aesthetics of difference insists upon too, the questioning of images supporting hegemonic discourses, images which have filled the spaces in the 'chinks and cracks of the power/knowledge-apparati' (Teresa de Lauretis, 1987 cited in Pollock, 1999: 7-8). What would an 'eccentric rereading', a rediscovery of what the canon's vicarly cloak disguises and reveals, mean for music, and for the individual arts areas of the curriculum? I hope to reveal the entanglements of the cultural dynamics of power through an examination of the traditions of Truth and Beauty in imagery which are to be disrupted by inserting into the canon the principle of the aesthetics of difference. Art education as a politics of representation embraces art's constitutive role in ideology. This is to be exposed as we seek to unravel and acknowledge which kinds of knowledges are legitimised and privileged by which kinds of representations. Which kinds of narratives, historical or otherwise, have resulted in which kinds of depictions through image? A recognition of the increasing specification of the subject demands also the careful investigation of colonial representation, the construction of dubious narratives about our history created through visual imaging and its provision of complex historical references. How have art, music, dance, drama been used in the service of particular political and economic narratives? Through revisioning the curriculum from a postmodern perspective, suggestions are made for an alternative pedagogy, which offsets the ideological features of humanism/liberalism, one in which an aesthetics of difference might pervade cultural practices - 'systems of signification', 'practices of representation' (Rizvi, 1994). I draw upon Lyotard's notion of 'small narratives' (1984), and present an investigation of what the democratic manifestation of 'the differend', and multiple meaning systems, might indicate in terms of 'differencing' music education as a site in which heterogenous value systems and expression may find form.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2585</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The geography of power resources in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Farrell, Bryan H.</field><field name="description">For a century the development of power resources has contributed much to the geography of New Zealand.

Knockdown of connexin proteins, using an antisense oligonucleotide (AsON) approach, has been shown to significantly reduce the inflammatory response and increase the rate of wound closure after corneal laser surgery. The challenge remains to find delivery systems that are easy to apply, but can still effectively deliver the AsONs to the target site. This thesis aimed to evaluate the efficacy of several in-situ gelling formulations to deliver Cx43 AsONs to the wounded tissues of a rat corneal scrape wound model. Methods: Formulations were characterised in terms of their rheological behaviour, microstructure and spreading ability. They were then evaluated for their irritation potential, precorneal retention and ability to control the release of the model hydrophilic drug pilocarpine hydrochloride both in vitro and in vivo. The stability of the AsONs in these formulations was assessed using Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer. Finally, formulations containing the stable AsONs were applied to a rat corneal scrape wound model and penetration depth, wound size after 12 hours and cellular dynamics underlying the wound healing response were analysed. Results and Discussion: Systems based on gellan gum, xanthan gum, carrageenan and alginate underwent sol-to-gel phase transition upon addition of the cations present in tear fluid. All tested systems exhibited favourable contact angles and were found to be non-irritant. Systems based on gellan gum, xanthan gum and carrageenan showed the longest ocular retention and exhibited the slowest release characteristics both in vitro and in vivo. AsONs were found to be stable in all formulations apart from the chitosan system, where precipitation occurred. This formulation also exhibited the slowest wound healing rate due to induction of a pro-inflammatory response. Conversely, delivery of the AsONs by gellan gum and carrageenan formulations resulted in significant reduction in wound size, inflammatory response and Cx43 levels. Conclusion: In-situ gelling systems based on gellan gum and carrageenan are able to successfully deliver Cx43 AsONs to the wounded tissues and therefore improve the healing response after corneal surgery.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2606</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multi-scale effects on deformation mechanisms of polymer nanocomposites : experimental characterisation and numerical study</field><field name="creator">Dong, Yu, 1977-</field><field name="description">In order to make much stiffer, light weight and high performance material products, polymer nanocomposites play an emerging role in the material innovation. Unlike other thermoplastics, polymer nanocomposites are fabricated by introducing a small amount of solid nano-scale fillers (normally less than 5 wt%) such as nanoclay, carbon nanotubes or nanofibres into a plastic resin to dramatically enhance its stiffness, strength and thermal properties. The difference between nanocomposites and conventional fibre composites is that the added fillers are extremely small, only one-millionth of a millimetre thick, and provide a much larger interface area per unit volume for greatly improving the interfacial bonding effect between nanofillers and the polymer matrix.      More importantly, polypropylene (PP)/clay nanocomposites have quite a high potential to form such innovative materials and replace the conventional plastics in many automotive and packaging applications. Nevertheless, the growth of PP/clay nanocomposites faces an obstacle of hydrophobic polymer&#8217;s low interactions with hydrophilic clay. Maleic anhydride (MA) grafted PP (MAPP), commonly used as a compatibiliser, has been proven to facilitate a good clay dispersion within the PP matrix through its functionalised MA groups. But despite the great attention from the manufacturers and researchers in recent years,commercial PP/clay nanocomposites with reliable material properties are still limited in availability. The major problem stems from the complex influences of the material selection and processing methods.      The present work developed a comprehensive approach from the material formulation and processing, experimental characterisation to the numerical modelling of PP/clay nanocomposites based on the finite element analysis (FEA) of micro/nanostructures. Initially, effects of the material selection including the clay type and content, MAPP content and PP matrix viscosity were investigated for the mechanical property enhancement of PP/clay nanocomposites. These nanocomposites were prepared using twin screw extrusion and injection moulding processes with a well-known Taguchi design of experiments (DoE) method in order to statistically detect the significant factors for influencing their mechanical properties. The preferred material formulations were then determined by Pareto analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the technical and economic considerations. The fundamental material characterisation was also conducted on those formulated nanocomposites using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA). Overall mechanical properties of neat PP and corresponding nanocomposites were determined by the general tensile, flexural and impact tests. Finally, computational models were established by implementing both the representative volume element (RVE) technique and innovative object-oriented finite element (OOF) analysis to predict the tensile moduli of PP/clay nanocomposites in comparison to the experimental data and available composites theoretical models.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nanotechnology</field><field name="subject">Computer Simulation</field><field name="subject">Mechanical Engineering</field><field name="subject">Material Science</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2642</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Narrative identity: Ricoeur and early childhood education</field><field name="creator">Farquhar, Sandy</field><field name="description">The thesis argues that who we are, what we aspire to, and how we enact social and cultural practices are a result of the way we narrate stories about ourselves as both individuals and members of communities. The question &#8216;Who am I?&#8217; is frequently answered with reference to what is important to us: our commitments and what we determine as good, valuable and right. Our identity is thus inextricably woven into our understanding of life as an unfolding story, bound by an ethical commitment to what we value. In this way, understandings of narrative and identity become part of the social and cultural context of education, drawing upon complex relationships between individual and community. It is through narrative that we construct truth about ourselves in relation to others. The central concern of the thesis is the interplay between the &#8216;capable&#8217; child subject and various readings of texts that form the educational landscape in Aotearoa New Zealand: in curriculum documents with their emphasis on relationships, reciprocity, community, culture and language; and in policy documents with their emphasis on economic rationality. The thesis examines some important narratives that emerge from readings of these curriculum and policy documents, and the impact of those narratives on identity formation in early childhood education. Examined in turn are a liberal narrative, an economic narrative and a social narrative. Each of these narratives emphasises particular discourses and rationalities within education. The thesis finds these narratives inadequate to explain understandings of the self of early childhood education. The thesis argues that Ricoeur&#8217;s hermeneutical approach enables a range of narrative possibilities for early childhood education. The use of Ricoeur&#8217;s narrative theory in the thesis is twofold: a methodological approach for the study, and a critical exploration of the formation of &#8216;narrative identity&#8217; (for both the individual and the group) through an examination of selected narratives. The thesis responds to the tensions of these narratives through Ricoeur&#8217;s understandings of &#8216;intersubjectivity&#8217; and &#8216;just institutions&#8217; and provides educators with an ethical framework by promoting Ricoeur&#8217;s understandings of the &#8216;good life&#8217; and a &#8216;capable subject&#8217;.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ricoeur</field><field name="subject">Early Childhood Education</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::220000 Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2625</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structural and functional characterisation of staphylococcal superantigen-like protein 11 (SSL11)</field><field name="creator">Chung, Matthew C.</field><field name="description">Staphylococcus aureus is a human pathogen with significant socioeconomic impact. It is the causative agent of many life-threatening disease states, including sepsis, staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome and necrotizing pneumonia. S. aureus is associated with 1% of all hospital stays and estimated costs of US$9.5 billion / year (for 2000 and 2001) in the USA alone (Noskin et al., 2005). Recently, a novel family of virulence factors produced by S. aureus was identified, which share sequence and structural homology to the infamous superantigens (Arcus et al., 2002; Williams et al., 2000) &#8211; proteins that cause a range of symptoms, including food poisoning and toxic shock. This family of staphylococcal superantigen-like proteins (SSLs) includes 14 members, of which 11 (SSLs 1-11) are closely linked within a mobile genetic element, called a pathogenicity island (Kuroda et al., 2001). To date, the literature suggests that the SSLs exhibit important host immune-evasion functions that are distinct from the superantigens. SSL5 has been reported to inhibit leukocyte rolling, a key process in their recruitment to sites of infection (Bestebroer et al., 2006). SSL7 inhibits serum-mediated killing of bacteria (Langley et al., 2005). This thesis describes the investigation into the structure and function of the related protein, SSL11. The binding specificity of SSL11 has been identified as the trisaccharide Neu5Ac&#945;2-3Gal&#946;1- 4GlcNAc, where Neu5Ac is essential for interaction, whereas the NAc sidechain of GlcNAc is not, but is highly favoured. The interaction between the related carbohydrate, sialyl Lewis X (sLex, or Neu5Ac&#945;2-3Gal&#946;1-4[Fuc&#945;1-3]GlcNAc), and SSL11 has been characterised at an atomic level by X-ray crystallography. The dissociation constant of SSL11 binding to sLex was determined by surface plasmon resonance to be in the micromolar to sub-micromolar range. Investigation into the effects of SSL11 on neutrophils reveals that nanomolar concentrations of SSL11 inhibited neutrophil rolling on a P-selectin surface in vitro. Additionally, SSL11 was rapidly internalized, exhibited a cytoplasmic distribution and caused changes in actin, visible by 2-D gel analysis. The characterization of the interaction between SSL11 and the previously-identified ligand, Fc&#945;RI (the myeloid immunoglobulin A receptor), is also described. The dissociation constant - II - of SSL11 binding to Fc&#945;RI was determined by surface plasmon resonance to be in the micromolar to sub-micromolar range and was found to be sialic acid-dependent. Binding of SSL11 to Fc&#945;RI inhibited the binding of its native ligand, IgA. The sialic acid-dependent glycan-binding site of SSL11 is the sole site of interaction with the neutrophil surface, shown by neuraminidase treatment of cells and complete abrogation of binding by a site-directed functional knockout mutant. Residues involved in glycan binding were found to be conserved in SSLs 2-6, giving rise to a potential related function between this subset of the SSL family.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2613</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In the character of Shakespeare: canon, authorship and attribution in eighteenth-century England</field><field name="creator">King, Edmund (Edmund George Coghill)</field><field name="description">At various points between 1709 and 1821, Shakespeare&#8217;s scholarly editors called into question the authenticity - either in whole or in part - of at least seventeen of the plays attributed to him in the First Folio. Enabled largely by Alexander Pope&#8217;s attack, in his 1723&#8211;25 edition of Shakespeare, on the Folio&#8217;s compilers, eighteenth-century textual critics constructed a canon based upon their own critical senses, rather than the &#8216;authority of copies&#8217;. They also discussed the genuineness of works that had been excluded from the 1623 Folio - Pericles, The Two Noble Kinsmen, Edward III, the Sonnets, and the poems published in The Passionate Pilgrim. Although these debates had little effect on the contents of the variorum edition - by 1821, only Pericles, the Sonnets, and the narrative poems had been added to the canon&#63719;arguments and counter-arguments about the authenticity of Shakespeare&#8217;s works continued to abound in the notes. These would, in turn, influence the opinions of new generations of critics throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In this thesis, I return to these earlier canonical judgements, not in order to resuscitate them, but to ask what they reveal about eighteenth-century conceptions of authorship, collaboration, and canonicity. Authorship in the period was not understood solely in terms of &#8216;possessive individualism&#8217;. Neither were arguments over Shakespeare&#8217;s style wholly contingent upon new discourses of literary property that had developed in the wake of copyright law. Instead, I argue, the discourse of personal style that editors applied to Shakespeare emerged out of a pre-existing classical-humanist scholarly tradition. Other commentators adopted the newly fashionable language of connoisseurship to determine where Shakespeare&#8217;s authorial presence lay. Another group of scholars turned to contemporary stage manuscript practices to ascertain where, and why, the words of other speakers might have entered his plays. If, however, Shakespeare&#8217;s plays were only partly his, this implied that Shakespeare had written alongside other writers. In the last part of my thesis, I examine the efforts of eighteenth-century critics to understand the social contexts of early modern dramatic authorship. Pope represented the theatre as an engine of social corruption, whose influence had debased Shakespeare&#8217;s standards of art and language. Other eighteenth-century commentators, however, had a more positive understanding of the social aspects of authorship. Drawing on contemporary discourses of friendship and sociability, they imagined the Elizabethan stage as a friendship-based authorial credit network, where playwrights collaborated with their contemporaries in the expectation of a return on their own works. This language of sociable co-authorship in turn influenced the way in which Shakespearean collaboration was understood. Conceptions of Shakespearean authorship and canonicity in the period, I conclude, were - like authorship in the Shakespeare canon itself - not singular, but manifold and multivocal.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2615</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Laser scanning in vivo confocal microscopy of corneal microstructure in inherited and acquired corneal disease</field><field name="creator">Niederer, Rachael Louise</field><field name="description">Purpose The cornea requires maintenance of clarity, shape, thickness and surface cellular integrity to retain normal vision. In vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) enables microstructural analysis of the in vivo cornea, allowing fresh insight into corneal microstructure in health and in inherited and acquired corneal disease. Recently, the introduction of laser scanning IVCM has utilised point scanning with coherent light to push forward the boundaries of real-time in vivo imaging. This related series of studies aimed first to validate the role of laser scanning IVCM and then to utilise laser scanning IVCM to examine corneal microstructure in normal subjects, following penetrating keratoplasty and in corneal ectasia and corneal dystrophy. Methods Subjects were assessed with slit lamp examination, corneal topography and laser scanning IVCM. Basal epithelial, sub-basal nerve plexus, keratocyte and endothelial cell and innervation density were quantified. Results Laser scanning IVCM generated high quality images of corneal microstructure. Comparison with slit scanning confocal microscopy illustrated good correlation between the two microscopes, although differences existed between optical section thickness and image contrast. High repeatability and inter-session and inter-observer reproducibility was demonstrated with laser scanning IVCM. The subsequent studies examined corneal microstructure alterations with age, following penetrating keratoplasty, and in corneal ectasia and corneal dystrophy. Laser scanning IVCM highlighted alterations at every level of the cornea and good agreement was observed between the in vivo and ex vivo results following penetrating keratoplasty. Conclusions In vivo confocal microscopy allows rapid analysis of corneal microstructure in health and disease, offering clinicians and researchers an exciting bridge between clinical and laboratory observations.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2608</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Surface composition of industrial spray-dried dairy powders and its formation mechanisms</field><field name="creator">Kim, Esther Hee-Jung</field><field name="description">Spray-dried dairy powders are common ingredients in many food and dairy products. Some of the properties of these powders that are important in their storage, handling and final application are expected to be determined by the surface composition of the powder. Therefore, an understanding of the mechanism behind the formation of the surface composition of the powder and the ability to control the surface composition will be very useful in the improvement of product quality and the development of new products. The aim of this thesis was to understand the mechanism behind the formation of the surface composition of industrial spray-dried dairy powders. To achieve this, a comprehensive research on the surface composition of industrial spray-dried dairy powders was undertaken, using electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA, also known as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)). This involved the investigation of the effects of the composition of the concentrate before drying, manufacturing processes, processing conditions and storage on the surface composition of the powder. The distribution of milk components (including triglycerides in milk fat) within the powder particles was also investigated to obtain further insight in the processes occurring within the particles during powder production. It was found that the surface composition of industrial spray-dried dairy powders (skim milk powder, whole milk powder, cream powder and whey protein concentrate) is significantly different from the bulk composition. Particularly pronounced was the accumulation of fat on the powder surface, deteriorating several powder properties (flowability, wettability and oxidative stability). The fat content of the powder appeared to be the critical factor in determining the surface composition of the powder. Results showed that there is redistribution of components within the particles during the spray-drying process. A kind of solid/solute segregation seems to occur. Fat and proteins are preferentially accumulated near the surface of the particles whereas lactose in the interior of the particles. It was also observed that there is some fractionation among the different milk fat present in the powders, with the accumulating of high melting triglycerides in the free-fat and even more at the surface of the powders. The redistribution of components was found to be affected to a large extent by the spray-drying conditions employed (feed solids content, drying temperatures and degree of homogenization). The subsequent fluidized bed drying and handling processes appeared to have little effect on the surface composition of the powders. However, during long-term storage, there was a release of encapsulated low-melting triglycerides towards the surface of powder, thereby lowering the melting points of the surface free-fat and the inner free-fat. Based on the findings in this work and theoretical considerations, possible mechanisms behind the formation of the surface composition of industrial spray-dried dairy powders, from powder production, through storage, to its final application, were suggested.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2913</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cytotrophoblast differentiation in the first trimester of human pregnancy</field><field name="creator">James, Joanna</field><field name="description">In the first trimester of human pregnancy specialised placental cells, termed cytotrophoblasts differentiate into extravillous trophoblasts (EVTs), which grow out from the placenta and invade into the maternal decidua, acting to physically attach the placenta to the decidua, and adapt the uterine spiral arteries to support pregnancy. A proportion of these EVTs also temporarily occlude the spiral arteries for approximately the first 10 weeks of gestation, preventing maternal blood flow to the placenta and creating a low oxygen environment in which placental and fetal development occur. The processes of trophoblast outgrowth and invasion, and the establishment of a low oxygen environment, are essential for the success of pregnancy, and inadequate trophoblast invasion into the uterus has been associated with recurrent miscarriage, pre-eclampsia and fetal growth restriction. However, the exact mechanisms that control the differentiation of cytotrophoblasts down the extravillous trophoblast lineage are poorly understood. Since the extent of this invasive process is unique to human implantation, animal models are of limited value in studying trophoblast invasion. Existing in vitro models have major limitations in that many are very difficult to quantify while others many not study the correct trophoblast population. The research in this thesis has focussed on the development of novel models by which to study cytotrophoblast differentiation, and the use of these models to further understand cytotrophoblast differentiation down the EVT lineage, and the regulation of EVT outgrowth by oxygen. Methods Outgrowth from first trimester villous explants was characterized using immunohistochemistry. Explant viability was investigated using dual staining with chloromethylfluorescin diacetate (CMFDA) and ethidium bromide, by examining DNA laddering, and by immunostaining sectioned explants over 96 hours of culture. The extended viability of cytotrophoblasts in multilayered cell islands in villous tips was exploited to isolate these cells using sequential trypsin digests of cultured villous explants. The trophoblast population obtained were characterized by immunohistochemistry. Finally, villous explants were cultured in either 1.5% or 8% oxygen and the frequency and area of outgrowths was quantified in order to determine the effect of gestation and oxygen on EVT outgrowth. Results Approximately 1/4 of explants cultured in 20% oxygen produced EVT outgrowth. Outgrowth formation and expansion resulted from proliferation of cells in the tips of anchoring villi, and EVTs within the outgrowth did not proliferate. The percentage of explants producing outgrowth declined as gestation increased from 8 to 12 weeks. Dual staining with CMFDA and ethidium bromide revealed degeneration of the syncytiotrophoblast by non-apoptotic mechanisms within 4 hours of culture, but this syncytiotrophoblast layer was able to be regenerated. The majority of cytotrophoblasts died within one week of culture, but despite this explants were able to produce EVT outgrowth for up to 3 weeks due to the extended survival of a specific set of cytotrophoblasts located in cell islands in the tips of anchoring villi. These surviving cells were able to differentiate into EVTs, but not regenerate the surrounding syncytiotrophoblast in the villus tip. Trypsinization of first trimester villi after extended explant culture resulted in the isolation of a viable population of &#8216;putative EVT progenitors&#8217; that did not syncytialise in culture, but were able to proliferate. 20% of these cells differentiated down the EVT lineage within 96 hours of culture. The putative EVT progenitors expressed markers previously localised to cytotrophoblasts in cell islands of anchoring villi, including &#945;v&#946;6 integrin and FGFR-2. The addition of exogenous FGF-4 did not affect the differentiation of these cells into EVTs, nor did FGF-4 alter the frequency of EVT outgrowth from explants. Culture in 1.5% oxygen significantly reduced the frequency and area of outgrowths in comparison to 8% oxygen. HLA-G and &#945;1 integrin were both expressed throughout outgrowths with no difference in expression of these proteins between oxygen concentrations. Gestation influenced the response of explants to oxygen, with a significant differential response to oxygen concentration in placentae under 11 weeks of gestation but no differential response in placentae of 11 or 12 weeks. Conclusions In the first trimester, oxygen and gestational age regulate extravillous trophoblast outgrowth in both an independent and interdependent manner. The cytotrophoblast population in the first trimester does not consist of one homogenous bipotent population. Rather there are at least two separate populations: 1) EVT progenitors that exist in the tips of potential anchoring villi that are likely to be committed to EVT differentiation and 2) monolayer villous cytotrophoblasts which are likely to be committed to syncytiotrophoblast differentiation. The second population is easily isolated by traditional enzymatic digestion methods whereas the first much smaller population can be isolated by exploiting their prolonged survival in explant culture.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321014 Obstetrics and gynaecology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2607</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genetic and demographic investigation of population structure and social system in four delphinid species</field><field name="creator">Oremus, Marc</field><field name="description">Population structure, genetic diversity and social system were investigated in four species of dolphins, thought to present contrasting habitat preferences and social organisation: spinner dolphins, rough-toothed dolphins, long-finned and short-finned pilot whales. To overcome methodological limitations, I combined molecular markers (mitochondrial DNA, -or mtDNA-, and microsatellite loci) and observational data (photo-identification and mass strandings) where possible. Genetic samples were obtained from skin biopsies of free-ranging (n = 243) and stranded (n = 375) dolphins.  As with many species of delphinids, spinner dolphins (Stenella longirostris) form communities in which social and reproductive boundaries are poorly understood. In French Polynesia, capture-recapture analyses based on photographs of distinctly marked individuals (DMIs) and microsatellite genotypes (12 loci) indicated a community of about 150 dolphins around Moorea that is relatively closed on a generational time scale. Distinct communities, likely to follow a similar demographic pattern, were observed around neighbouring islands (Tahiti, Raiatea, Huahine and Bora Bora), as indicated by photo-identification data and restricted gene flow (FST = 0.143, n = 154). Surprisingly high levels of insular mtDNA genetic diversity (average pi = 1.44%, suggesting Nef ~ 100,000) contrasted with demographic characteristics of these communities. There was no evidence for a recent bottleneck effect, suggesting that this pattern is the result of metapopulation structure, based on numerous insular communities connected through male and female gene flow. Investigation of the worldwide mtDNA diversity and phylogeography of long-finned and short-finned pilot whale species revealed a complex evolutionary history (Globicephala melas, n = 434; and G. macrorhynchus, n = 134, including published and unpublished sequences). Strong genetic differentiation between long-finned pilot whales from the North Atlantic (G. m. melas) and Southern Hemisphere (G. m. edwardii) indicated severely restricted gene flow, although shared haplotypes suggested some recent contact between the two subspecies. Low genetic distances among haplotypes and a star-like phylogeny suggested a recent worldwide expansion for this species. Higher levels of diversity (although low compared to other cetaceans) were found in short-finned pilot whales, in particular among samples from around Japan. Phylogeographic studies suggested that Japanese samples originate from three distinct populations, one of which could be the ancestral population of the species. Overall, my results confirmed that worldwide mtDNA diversity is low in the two species, probably due to a recent worldwide population expansion and, potentially, to a matrilineal social structure.  The molecular ecology of the mass strandings of long-finned pilot whales around New Zealand was investigated to test the hypothesis that individuals stranding together are part of an extended matrilineal group. Analyses of mtDNA sequences indicate that more than one haplotype was found in five of the seven mass strandings investigated (n = 275), demonstrating that groups are sometimes composed of unrelated maternal lineages. This was further supported by analyses of relatedness within and between strandings based on microsatellites (14 loci). These analyses discount kinship as the only factor causing large mass strandings in long-finned pilot whales. Parentage analyses confirmed some aspects of previous studies in the North Atlantic, suggesting a social system with at least some level of male and female philopatry to the maternal group, and infrequent paternities within the group. In a detailed study of a large mass stranding (Stewart Island 2003, n = 122), there was no correlation between position of the whales on the beach and genetic relatedness (based on 20 microsatellite loci), discounting the assumption that kinship bonds are maintained during these traumatic events. This was further supported by the striking separation of stranded mothers and dependant calves. This disruption of kinship bonds could help explain the behavioural distress of stranded individuals and the tendency of many whales to re-strand even after being re-floated.  Finally, a study of rough-toothed dolphins (Steno bredanensis) in the Society Archipelago, French Polynesia, provided new insights in the ecology of this poorly-known species. Although traditionally viewed as a pelagic dolphin, analyses supported a pattern of local communities, in some ways similar to spinner dolphins, with fine-scale population genetic structure (FST = 0.60, p &lt; 0.001 based on mtDNA, n = 65) and local fidelity. These communities also showed a low level of mtDNA haplotype diversity (four unique haplotypes at Moorea compared to 18 for spinner dolphins), suggesting the potential influence of a matrilineal social structure similar to long-finned pilot whales.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dolphin</field><field name="subject">molecular ecology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2621</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Seeking the prize of eradication: a social history of tuberculosis in New Zealand from world War Two to the 1970s</field><field name="creator">Dunsford, Deborah, 1953-</field><field name="description">Between World War Two and the 1970s, the danger of TB disappeared for most New Zealanders. Conducted against a background of rising living standards, the anti-TB campaign saw dramatic declines in TB mortality and incidence. But tuberculosis proved far more opportunistic than expected. Its continued entrenchment at low levels among New Zealand&#8217;s poor frustrated the campaign&#8217;s ultimate goal of eradication.In the 1940s, the Health Department&#8217;s total commitment to the anti-TB campaign indicated the danger TB represented across society. The nationwide mass X-ray programme reflected the confidence in technology and medical science of the day. It operated for nearly 30 years but its value was largely symbolic. It was a costly means of identifying cases and a more targeted scheme may well have sufficed. BCG vaccination was introduced as the final block in a wall of anti-TB measures and the mass vaccination of school children sought to protect an entire at-risk age group. The timeframe of the anti-TB campaign witnessed the final years of sanatorium treatment. In spite of the isolation and uncertain outcome, these institutions offered many patients a positive experience, safe from the stigmatising attitudes common in society. The drug revolution allowed treatment at home and a reliable cure that, nevertheless, brought its own problems of compliance.The decline in TB was not shared equally. High Maori TB rates fell, but still lagged European rates and, from the 1960s, a growing Pacific Island immigrant population also challenged the goal of eradication. Attempts to control TB at the border reflected racist attitudes of the time. The Health Department grappled with the ethnic diversity of TB incidence and different cultural attitudes to the disease. Now curable, TB&#8217;s potential for stigmatisation faded, yet also persisted for those high-risk groups exposed to poverty. By the late 1970s, mainstream society was beginning to stigmatise ethnic minorities and immigrants as &#8216;responsible&#8217; for TB.This thesis contributes to the history of tuberculosis and public health in New Zealand and internationally. It reveals the shifting ground beneath a public health campaign, not just in medical developments, but in the diversity of the targeted population. The thesis highlights the need for a dynamic and layered approach to public health that anticipates change and diversity and continually adjusts its activities and messages to meet them.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::430000 History and Archaeology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2932</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Input-specificity of sensory-induced neural plasticity in humans</field><field name="creator">McNair, Nicolas A.</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis was to investigate the input-specificity of sensory-induced plasticity in humans. This was achieved by varying the characteristics of sine gratings so that they selectively targeted distinct populations of neurons in the visual cortex. In Experiments 1-3, specificity was investigated with electroencephalography using horizontally- and vertically-oriented sine gratings (Experiment 1) or gratings of differing spatial frequency (Experiments 2 &amp; 3). Increases in the N1b potential were observed only for sine gratings that were the same in orientation or spatial frequency as that used as the tetanus, suggesting that the potentiation is specific to the visual pathways stimulated during the induction of the tetanus. However, the increase in the amplitude of the N1b in Experiment 1 was not maintained when tested again at 50 minutes post-tetanus. This may have been due to depotentiation caused by the temporal frequency of stimulus presentation in the first post-tetanus block. To try to circumvent this potential confound, immediate and maintained (tested 30 minutes post-tetanus) spatial-frequency-specific potentiation were tested separately in Experiments 2 and 3, respectively. Experiment 3 demonstrated that the increased N1b was maintained for up to half an hour post-tetanus. In addition, the findings from Experiment 1, as well as the pattern of results from Experiments 2 and 3, indicate that the potentiation must be occurring in the visual cortex rather than further upstream at the lateral geniculate nucleus. In Experiment 4 functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to more accurately localise where these plastic changes were taking place using sine gratings of differing spatial frequency. A small, focal post-tetanic increase in the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) response was observed for the tetanised grating in the right temporo-parieto-occipital junction. For the non-tetanised grating, decreases in BOLD were found in the primary visual cortex and bilaterally in the cuneus and pre-cuneus. These decreases may have been due to inhibitory interconnections between neurons tuned to different spatial frequencies. These data indicate that tetanic sensory stimulation selectively targets and potentiates specific populations of neurons in the visual cortex.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Neural Plasticity</field><field name="subject">LTP</field><field name="subject">Visual Cortex</field><field name="subject">Sensory Stimulation</field><field name="subject">Spatial Frequency</field><field name="subject">Orientation</field><field name="subject">EEG</field><field name="subject">fMRI</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380103 Biological psychology (neuropsychology, psychopharmacology, physiological psychology)</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3285</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using the common-sense model of self-regulation to explore the factors associated with intentional non-adherence to preventer medication for asthma</field><field name="creator">Main, Jodie Jane</field><field name="description">Daily use of inhaled preventer medication is recommended for most people with asthma. However, research suggests many do not adhere to this regime. The current thesis comprises two research studies utilising the common-sense model of self-regulation as the theoretical basis to explore how people make decisions about inhaled preventer use in asthma. The purpose of Study One was to compare a self-report and an objective measure of adherence to preventer medication for asthma and to examine the illness representations and treatment beliefs associated with these measures. Accordingly, 1,936 U.K. General Practice patients who were using preventer medication for asthma completed a questionnaire assessing illness and medication perceptions and gave consent for information to be obtained from their medical records. Adherence to preventer medication was calculated from the Medication Adherence Report Scale (MARS) and an objective measure, the proportion of prescribed medication that the participant collected over the previous year. Results show that nearly nine out of ten participants (88.4%) reported some non-adherence to their preventer medication. The most common form of non-adherence was using preventer inhaler only when feeling breathless. The relationships between participants&#8217; representations of their asthma and their beliefs about their preventer medication and adherence measures were tested using structural equation modelling. Seeing asthma as a condition that was not present when asymptomatic was associated with more non-adherence (&#946;=.22 p&lt;.001) and also with collecting a smaller proportion of prescribed preventer medication over the past year (&#946;=-.15, p&lt;.001). Seeing asthma as an acute condition, as a condition without serious consequences, and as a condition that could not be controlled by treatment were also representations associated with non-adherence. Those who did not see the need for preventer medication at all, or did not see the need for preventer medication when asymptomatic were more likely to be non-adherent. The relationship between illness representations and self-report adherence was mediated by the belief that medication was necessary. Having identified a number of key beliefs that were associated with use of preventer medication in asthma, Study Two explored the way in which these beliefs may be developed through the process of appraisal of the influence of medication use on symptom experience. Using quantitative methods, 77 patients from a New Zealand General Practice completed a questionnaire measuring the reasons for experimenting and stopping medication, illness representations and treatment beliefs. Thirty percent of the sample reported actively experimenting with their medication. These participants were more likely to hold the belief that medication did not help in the absence of symptoms (Mann-Whitney U=343.5, p&lt;.05) and to report trying to avoid thinking about asthma (Mann-Whitney U=330.5, p&lt;.05). Fifty-one of the participants were subsequently interviewed about their experiences with using medication and transcripts of these interviews were subjected to a qualitative analysis. Participants&#8217; responses suggested that the process of appraising whether medication is necessary was influenced by the match between what the participant expects to happen when using the medication and what actually does happen. The process of deciding when medication is necessary is influenced by the threshold at which medication is deemed to be necessary and the speed at which symptoms return if medication is stopped. These findings have implications for the development of interventions to improve adherence to preventer medication for asthma. They suggest that a key component of self-management education is educating patients about the nature of asthma as a chronic condition that is present even in the absence of symptoms. Additionally, they provide evidence that many patients are involved in an active process of appraising the success of their medication. Health professionals should be aware of that this process is likely to be influenced by patients&#8217; expectations of medication, the level of symptoms at which they believe action is required to control asthma and the speed at which symptoms return if medication is discontinued. Future research could take the form of a randomised controlled intervention to assess whether discussion of these factors with patients could improve quality of life for people with asthma.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Asthma</field><field name="subject">Adherence</field><field name="subject">Health Psychology</field><field name="subject">Common-Sense Model of Self-Regulation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2630</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A comparative study of the cultural diplomacy of Canada, New Zealand and India</field><field name="creator">Mark, Simon</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the concept and practice of cultural diplomacy. Cultural diplomacy is carried out by a government to support its foreign policy goals or diplomacy (or both) by using a wide range of cultural manifestations for a variety of purposes. The thesis examines aspects of the cultural diplomacy of Canada, Qu&#233;bec, New Zealand and India in order to investigate how cultural diplomacy presents a national image abroad (potentially as part of a national brand); its role in the protection of cultural sovereignty; and how it advances domestic objectives. The thesis argues that cultural diplomacy, in presenting a national image abroad, frequently emphasises a state&#8217;s modern-ness or its cultural distinctiveness. This raises the question of the link between national image and national brand and highlights the limitations inherent in national branding. For some states, cultural diplomacy plays a role in the protection of cultural sovereignty. Canadian cultural diplomacy supports the international activities of domestic cultural industries and has sought to maintain the right to provide this support within the multilateral free trade framework. Qu&#233;bec&#8217;s cultural diplomacy has sought to protect the province&#8217;s cultural sovereignty from a perceived threat from the Canadian federation. Cultural diplomacy helps advance domestic objectives. The cultural diplomacy of Canada has asserted the right of the federal government to be Canada&#8217;s only diplomatic voice, and to counter Qu&#233;bec&#8217;s claims to sovereignty. Qu&#233;bec&#8217;s cultural diplomacy has asserted the province&#8217;s constitutional rights and distinctiveness within the Canadian federation. In a similar way, the international exhibition Te Maori advanced the interests of Maori in New Zealand. Cultural diplomacy&#8217;s domestic impacts include positive international recognition for a state&#8217;s culture, which contributes to a state&#8217;s sense of being a distinctive national community and to its confidence, economic prosperity and nation-building. The thesis concludes that cultural diplomacy remains a valuable tool of diplomacy and is likely to become more important to governments, particularly to their public diplomacy and as a contributor to soft power, because of cultural diplomacy&#8217;s promulgation of a distinctive national identity, the increasing importance of a cultural aspect in economic interests, and the intrinsic appeal of culture to globalised populations.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360100 Political Science::360102 Comparative government and politics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2943</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Restraint of trade at common law</field><field name="creator">Dempster, Hamish Leslie</field><field name="description">This is a collection of essays about the restraint of trade doctrine as laid down in the courts of the United Kingdom and the British Commonwealth. Generally, I will not give an account of the restraint of trade doctrine in the United States of America, for even although each individual state (apart from the civil jurisdictions California and Louisiana) and the federation itself, has a common law system, for reasons peculiar to those jurisdictions, the restraint of trade case law there has become so vast and so confused as to be unsuitable for my purposes. More importantly, however, the common law restraint of trade doctrine in the United Kingdom and the British Commonwealth has been laid down by courts without any significant consideration of the state of the law in the United States. Davies v Davies (1887) 36 Ch D 359, 370 by contrast, the period during which the Privy Council operated as a supra national court of final appeal has resulted in considerable harmony in the doctrine within the British Commonwealth. Even now the House of Lords is influential in Australia and Canada and the influence is increasingly reciprocal. By way of an exception I will discuss the purposes of the anti-trust legislation in the United States. This is necessary because I intend to show that the common law restraint of trade doctrine was not able to be, and was never intended to be, a means of regulating the economy in contradistinction to the United States anti-trust legislation and related legislation in the British Commonwealth. This account is not merely a description of the law relating to the restraint of trade doctrine although I do purport to describe the law. There are other accounts of the restraint of trade doctrine which do that well. Accounts of the restraint of trade doctrine include: Matthews &amp; Adler, The Law Relating to Covenants in Restraints of Trade (London, 2nd ed 1907); Sanderson, Restraint of Trade in English law (London, 1926); Heydon, The Restraint of Trade Doctrine (London, 1971); Trebilcock, The Common Law of Restraint of Trade; A Legal and Economic Analysis (Toronto, 1986); Dean, The Law of Trade Secrets (Sydney, 1990); Mehigan &amp; Griffiths, Restraint of Trade and Business Secrets: Law &amp; Practice (London, 2nd ed 1991); Holdsworth, History of English Law IV (3rd ed, 1945) 343-54, 373-9; VIII (2nd ed, 1937) 56-42. There are other, less detailed accounts in contract law textbooks. The purpose of this dissertation is to describe aspects of the doctrine as it developed between the medieval period and the twentieth century and then to use that account as a basis for an analysis of how the law has taken a number of paths during the twentieth century which cannot be justified by the rules and their justifications which existed in the law prior to that time. Such a development has had important consequences for the restraint of trade doctrine and even the law in general, most of which have been detrimental. I do not intend to give a continuous historical narrative covering the whole of the doctrine. The history has been described before. For example, I do not intend to give a discrete account of the process by which the absolute rule against general restraints of trade gave way to the rule of reason, although I do mention this process where relevant for other purposes. The history, so far as it is relevant, is integrated into each chapter. I will argue that historically the restraint of trade doctrine was a rule or complex of rules, of a certain form and content. The form and content of the rule are important because they bear on the meaning of the class term "restraint of trade" which is an element of the rule. The meaning of that term began to change around the year 1890. Beginning first with certain classes of trade combination, courts began to classify as restraints of trade covenants which did not in fact restrain trade. Then the courts similarly treated the exclusive dealing contract and certain forms of property transaction. Another trend in the law which added to the confusion about the meaning of restraint of trade was the failure by the courts to make definitive findings one way or another as to whether a particular covenant was in restraint of trade. The courts were then faced with a dilemma. The law required a court to refuse to enforce a covenant in restraint of trade unless the covenantee could justify the restraint by presenting evidence to the court from which the courts could assess whether or not that particular restraint was within the reason for the restraint of trade doctrine or not. Such considerations were entirely inapt in the case of covenants which, in accordance with the traditional view, did not restrain trade. Yet if the courts did not validate these contracts, catastrophic consequences would have followed for the parties to such contracts and, indeed, to contract as an institution. To solve the dilemma the courts began to interpret the famous statement of the restraint of trade doctrine by Lord Macnaghten in Nordenfelt v Maxim Nordenfelt Guns &amp; Ammunition Co [1894] AC 535, 565 (HL) literally, rather than contextually. Ultimately this has resulted in the obscuring of the rule underlying the restraint of trade doctrine itself. There were many minor confusions along the way. It is important that the doctrine is coherent and its use consistent with its justifications because it is still a fruitful cause of legal change. In the last year the force of the rule has caused a radical restructuring of Association Football in Europe Bosman&#8217;s case. The rule has even penetrated the collective consciousness of the community at large. The broad thrust of the development and the detail will be outlined in the next thirteen chapters.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::390000 Law, Justice and Law Enforcement::390100 Law</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2675</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Trade unions and the common law in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Harrison, Rodney</field><field name="description">The purpose of this thesis is to examine and evaluate the present common law relating to trade unions in New Zealand.

These developments have occurred as a result of questions which have been raised, on both sides of the Atlantic, about the role of the juvenile court in combating delinquency. In the United States the resulting re-appraisal of the court&#8217;s function has been characterised by an emphasis on the fact that the court is part of the criminal justice system, and that it therefore cannot ignore the need to protect society against harmful conduct and to observe the requirements of due process. In England and Scotland, on the other hand, the movement has been towards the creation of tribunals which pay less attention to the child&#8217;s offence and which exercise a jurisdiction which tends to blur the distinction between offenders and non-offenders. From an analysis of this contrast the thesis moves to an examination of a significant similarity between the emerging Anglo- American systems. Although different solutions have been adopted to the problem of re-defining the role of the Juvenile court, the reforms in each of the countries studies have been accompanied by a desire to narrow the jurisdiction of the court. The conclusion which emerges from an examination of British and American experience is that, instead of seeing the juvenile court as an all-purpose delinquency-control agency, it should be viewed as an agency whose inherent limitations must be recognised if best use is to be made of its distinctive capabilities. This conclusion raises four related problems which the thesis considers in detail. First, attention is given to the task of attempting to define the court&#8217;s role, and an effort is made to determine which functions it can effectively and appropriately perform. Second, on the basis of this analysis, consideration is given to the formulation of criteria which indicate with precision the types of case which should be referred to court. Third, the design of an effective sieving device is discussed: machinery must be created which will ensure that the court receives only those cases which are appropriate to its re-defined role. Fourth, reference is made to the types of informal services which are required to deal with the cases diverted from the court. Against this comparative and theoretical background aspects of New Zealand&#8217;s system for dealing with young offenders are considered. This part of the study takes the form of an historical analysis of its development and a description of the system in operation. Because of the conclusion reached regarding the importance of limiting court intake particular attention is focused on the procedures and criteria employed in making the decision as to whether or not a child should be prosecuted. Hence the fieldwork on which much of the New Zealand material is based concentrates on the Youth Aid/Social Welfare conference. An attempt is made to describe and analyse the day-to-day working of this type of sieving device. The findings are discussed, and certain features of the conference system are criticised. The thesis concludes with comments on some of the difficulties which must be taken into account in implementing a policy which emphasises the informal handling of young offenders.</field><field name="date">1975</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::390000 Law, Justice and Law Enforcement</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2672</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of the common law defences of fair comment and qualified privilege to a defamation action with particular reference to New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Tobin, Rosemary</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::390000 Law, Justice and Law Enforcement</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::390000 Law, Justice and Law Enforcement::390100 Law</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2674</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rogernomics and the Treaty of Waitangi: the contradiction between the economic and Treaty policies of the fourth Labour government, 1984-1990, and the role of law in mediating that contradiction in the interests of the colonial capitalist state</field><field name="creator">Kelsey, Jane</field><field name="description">During the 1970s and early 1980s the historic contradiction between Maori and the colonial state publicly resurfaced, with high-profile Maori demands for the recognition of Maori sovereignty. By 1984 those demands became broader-based. They focused on the Crown's affirmation in the Treaty of Waitangi of continued Maori control over economic resources, independent political authority, and the protection of the Maori way of life. In the face of these pressures, the Labour Party, and later the fourth Labour Government, committed itself to a policy of recognising the Treaty of Waitangi. At the same time, New Zealand's under-developed capitalist economy was in crisis. Advocates of market liberalism within the Fourth Labour Government secured a power base from which they launched the New Zealand version of their paradigm, known as Rogernomics. The two policies were logically irreconcilable, and embodied the deeper, real contradiction of the colonial project itself. Once that logical contradiction became apparent, and the electoral implications became too costly, the Treaty policy gave way. The primary focus of this thesis is the role played by colonial law, legal ideology, and the legal intellectuals in mediating those contradictions during the 1980s. They helped to secure a passive revolution, whereby Maori demands were defused, and Maori resistance was subsumed within the political and judicial forums of the colonial state. This development is analysed within the framework of the dual state, whereby metropolitan and colonial social formations co-exist within the one national boundary, both dominated by the capitalist mode of production. In this thesis, that duality comprises Pakeha within New Zealand, and Maori within Aotearoa. The specifically legal dynamics are situated within the complex interactions of the economic, political, juridical, and ideological levels of that dual state during the 1980s. The thesis concludes that the colonial state did secure a passive revolution over Maori between 1984 and 1990. But this was, at best, a temporary reprieve. By the end of the Fourth Labour Government, in October 1990, many Maori remained committed to the anti-colonial struggle. It appeared that the fundamental contradictions of colonial capitalism, and the crisis of constitutional legitimacy for the colonial state, had not been resolved. They had merely been deferred.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::390000 Law, Justice and Law Enforcement::390100 Law::390110 Indigenous laws</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2871</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Traditionalizing sustainable development: the law, policy and practice in Papua New Guinea</field><field name="creator">Kwa, Eric L. (Eric Lokai)</field><field name="description">In 1987, the World Commission on Environment and Development published its long awaited report: "Our Common Future". The report contained a detailed discussion of global environment and development problems and a set of recommendations which the Commission suggested could alleviate many of those problems. At the core of the Commission's recommendation was the 'sustainable development' concept which the Commission strongly suggested countries should adopt as the principal vehicle for overcoming many of the global environmental and social ills. But, what is sustainable development? What are its core values? How can sustainable development be utilized to arrest and resolve global societal problems? Does sustainable development have a universal application? Under what conditions can sustainable development be successfully implemented? These are some of the key issues that are addressed in this research paper. In this paper I look at the origin and definition of the sustainable development concept and identify the relevant principles of the concept. I also identify the tools that are necessary for the implementation of the concept. The underpinning of my argument is that sustainable development can be successfully implemented by countries particularly developing countries because the concept has strong roots in traditional cultures which are dominant in developing countries. I explore this position and the various issues that have been identified above by adopting Papua New Guinea (PNG) a developing country as a case study.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::390000 Law, Justice and Law Enforcement::390100 Law</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2873</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An inquiry into the necessity for the harm requirement in criminal offences: an existential study</field><field name="creator">Garrett, Elisabeth Helena</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::390000 Law, Justice and Law Enforcement</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2869</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vessel source pollution and key international conventions: a case for change</field><field name="creator">Gray, J.A. (John Andrew)</field><field name="description">Pollution from vessels cannot be controlled effectively without the involvement of flag States. They have the primary responsibility for ensuring that the vessels which fly their flags comply with all applicable international rules and standards relating to vessel source pollution. Compliance with such rules and standards involves additional operating costs for ship-owners. Thus, in the highly competitive international maritime transport industry, there are many incentives for flag States not to prejudice their pursuit of comparative advantage by ensuring that their flag vessels comply with the applicable rules and standards. Enforcing their flag vessels to comply is not a rational choice. Accordingly, flag States must be given reasons to ensure that their flag vessels do comply with pollution control rules and standards if the problem of vessel source pollution is to be resolved. Neither of the two international Conventions which regulate the control of vessel source pollution, namely MARPOL and UNCLOS III, gives flag States reasons to ensure the compliant operation of their flag vessels. For that reason, neither Convention can claim to be an effective means for controlling pollution from vessels. There is, however, emerging evidence of flag State commitment to the control of vessel source pollution in response to the application of regional Port State Control measures. From the perspective of flag States, one aspect of the application of the concept of Port State Control is of concern - that is the legal basis of the control measures which are being taken against their flag vessels for violations of MARPOL's rules and standards.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::390000 Law, Justice and Law Enforcement::390100 Law</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2868</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a microarray for potyvirus detection and identification</field><field name="creator">Wei, Ting, 1968-</field><field name="description">Potyvirus is the largest and one of the most economically important of the virus genera infecting plants. The complexities of potyvirus identification resulting from many different species, mixed infections, emerging new viruses, new hosts, and new vectors, etc., often requires the use of multiple detection methods which is time consumable and costly. Therefore an assay that can test for a range of potyviruses simultaneously, with good specificity and sensitivity, is desirable. This study looked at the feasibility of producing an oligonucleotide microarray for detection and identification of potyviruses at both species and strain level. Thirty plant samples with suspected potyvirus infections were collected from field and research laboratories in New Zealand and partial NIb gene, complete CP gene and 3&#900;UTR were sequenced. Twelve definitive potyviruses, one tentative potyvirus, one non-potyvirus, and one novel potyviruslike sequence were identified, six of which were first records for New Zealand. Sequence analysis showed that NIb and CP genes and the 3&#900;UTR contained both conserved and variable sequences which were used to design both species and strain level specific probes. Four Potyvirus species were chosen for a &#8220;proof of concept&#8221; study and probes were designed using two different software programs (ROSO and CAG software). A total of eighty five probes including 33 perfect-match and 52 mismatch probes were selected to represent the four targeted potyviruses. Each probe was synthesized with spacers of either 6 or 12 poly-cytosine or poly-thymine at the 5&#900; terminus. Arrays showed high specificity to the targets when tested using nineteen different geographically diverse potyvirus isolates representing the four target species, four distinct but closely related New Zealand potyviruses, and four healthy plant species. Factors affecting the hybridization efficiency, e.g. the size of the target fragments, secondary structure of probes and targets, label type, strandedness, Tm and GC content of probes, were also investigated. The approaches and protocols developed in this study should form a useful basis for developing other potyviruses arrays and the results also provide useful insights into issues of generic interest for the development of arrays for detecting other pathogens.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3070</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A cyclical perspective of the common law</field><field name="creator">Cadenhead, John.</field><field name="description">This thesis is an attempt to use synthesis and analysis in respect of certain models of tort obligation to show that the common law has evolved and been shaped by recurring cycles. It was not possible to analyse the entirety of the wide sweep of tort obligation, so the models of trespass, trespass on the case, deceit and special relationship negligence were synthesised and then historically compared. From these models distinct recurring cycles of the common law became apparent, which alternated between expansionary and conservative stages. At one time the common law seeks a vehicle for new flexible remedies and obligations, and at another, it seeks the certainty of fixed rules. The cycle is incessant as for every swing in one direction, at a certain point on the pendulum, there will be a reaction. This thesis explores the pathology of those cycles through such selected models, including the symptoms exhibited by the initial ad hoc characteristics of the birth of a remedy or obligation, the maturing phase of a remedy or obligation created by the emergence of categories of liability, the abstraction from such categories of a general principle, and either the over-extension of such general principle, or the narrowing of such general principle leading to the obligation's ultimate demise as a flexible vehicle of liability. In the event of the death of an obligation or remedy, as a flexible vehicle of liability, the common law will seek to find or create another avenue of flexible remedy. The thesis does not seek to investigate the reasons or causes of such cycles, but is content to examine the symptoms exhibited by the various phases of such cycles. The initial two chapters summarise the general theory of such cyclic perspective and briefly outline the template of such cycles created by the early origins of the common law. The cycles of 'trespass' and 'deceit' show the rise and fall of those respective obligations from flexible remedies to narrow moribund obligations. The concepts upon which they were based of contra pacem and honesty were to prove excessively narrow and restrictive to survive the inevitable attrition caused through the natural accumulation of rules. A study of the cycle of these two obligations is rewarding as they both show a complete lifespan of an obligation through the various phases of a cycle up to the point of its death as an instrument of flexibility. The protean action on the case and the modern pragmatic case-by-case negligence formula, based on the open-ended elements of &#8216;foresight', 'proximity' and 'just and reasonableness', illustrate the problems caused by a remedy or obligation whose conceptualisation is vague and uncertain. The common law itself until 1875, apart from equity, had the ability through the action on the case to provide the common law with flexibility when needed. The closest that the common law in modern times has come to emulating the action on the case has been the remedial use of the negligence mechanism. While the action on the case did not survive the procedural reforms of the 19th century, it had developed general rules that limited the scope of such open-ended action. These general over-arching rules are important to a study of modern negligence liability. This thesis will endeavour to show that the modern open-ended negligence formula should be limited by comparable general rules to resist the inevitable pressure upon it to define its fault component or duty mechanism too narrowly. Synthesis by use of the tool of comparative legal history shows the constant tension in the common law between the quest for certainty through rules, on the one hand, and the ability to administer individual justice, despite the presence of a general rule, on the other. A comparison of the life cycles of the models selected shows a certain symmetry concerning the reasons and justifications advanced in constructing liability in either an expansionary or conservative phase of the common law. A cyclic perspective of the common law treats it as a dynamic constantly moving instrument that reflects the policy moods of contemporary society. Such a view of the law is not one-dimensional and may provide answers as to the past and present evolution of the common law and may give clues as to its future direction.

The combined pressures of endemic social needs and international demands for tighter drug control measures inevitably raise questions as to whether certain criminogenic effects were produced by this legislative activity. They include: Did premature restrictions cause amplification of the range of substances that became the subjects of abuse? Do the restraints that are now imposed have a scope and severity disproportionate to the social harm threatened by the proscribed conduct? These questions cannot be conclusively answered in a study of this nature, but the historical approach illustrates the complex relationship, both on a domestic and an international scale, between legislative action and conduct which is deemed criminal. An attempt is made to evaluate the assistance available to New Zealand courts from overseas judicial interpretations of legislation enacted within the same context of international obligation. As is then demonstrated, the major drug offences provide fertile ground for nurturing the technical requirements of proof of guilt. Already in New Zealand, in response to the demands and resources of accused persons faced with high penalties upon conviction, the concept of possession has been judicially analysed in great depth and detail. A comparative study is made of the requirements of the corresponding possessory offences in some other jurisdictions; each of the major offences against the Act is then analysed by analogy with the elements of possession. The statutory defences are also examined in relation to this analysis. Although an appraisal of the morality of current legislative policy is not seen as being within the scope of this study, an attempt is made to gauge the effect of Parliament's extension of police powers of search and seizure, and of the power to use listening devices, on the ways by which the courts have weighed socially important contending interests in the most delicate of balances. The courts' evident acceptance of the need for 'undercover' police detective operations in relation to drug offences is documented, as are the judicial restraints applied to the use of evidence so obtained. Sentencing policy in this context is a subject of increasing public interest and concern. An analysis is made of the principles of sentencing as they emerge from New Zealand Court of Appeal judgments over the period 1970-1979. It will be shown that aspects of that policy received recognition in the 1975 Act. However, because of the apparent emphasis on deterrence, many problems continue to tax the sentencing tribunal. This study does not purport to be exhaustive. It excludes detailed consideration of the administrative provisions in the Act and eschews analysis of offences against sections 11, 15 and 16 (concerning theft, etc., of controlled drugs, false statements, and obstruction of officers). The discussions of liability for secondary participation, and the inchoate offences, are confined to such points as are seen to be directly related to the context of drug offences. With some exceptions where subsequent information has come to hand, the law is stated on the basis of the materials available to the writer on 1 May 1980.</field><field name="date">1980</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::390000 Law, Justice and Law Enforcement::390100 Law</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2865</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Constitution of Fiji</field><field name="creator">Sahu Khan, Muhammad Shamsud-Dean</field><field name="description">The Constitution of Fiji though similar to many others adopted within the Commonwealth since the end of the Second World War departs in many respects from the Constitution of the United Kingdom and that of New Zealand. The Constitution of the United Kingdom is wholly unwritten and that of New Zealand is only partly written as contained in the Constitution Act of 1852. Fiji not only has a written Constitution; the Constitution also incorporates the rules or principles which are accepted as constitutional conventions in the United Kingdom and New Zealand. In this thesis attention has been given to the position of the Governor-General as the representative of the Queen and the powers conferred upon him. The fact that he is a local appointee makes his position even more delicate. The problem is accentuated in that the exercise of some of his powers are made nonjusticiable by the Constitution. It is also suggested in this work that the fact that the Constitution of Fiji has an entirely different basis from that of the United Kingdom or New Zealand renders many of the principles adopted in those countries inapplicable. The notion of parliamentary sovereignty propounded by Dicey and others does not apply. The Constitution, not Parliament, is supreme. Judicial review of legislation is inevitable and the courts are intended as guardians of the Constitution. There are other important differences many of which are the result of the political decisions made on behalf of the three main races in Fiji before the Constitution was drafted. The separate Fijian administration and the powers of the Council of Chiefs are illustrations of these provisions. The fact the indigenous Fijians enjoy a privileged position through the separate Fijian Administration and the Council of Chiefs is discussed. The system of representation in the House of Representatives with a combination of the communal and multiracial electorates provides an unusual, perhaps questionable, experiment towards a solution of the tensions and problems associated with a heterogeneous society. Likewise the fundamental rights provisions have special significance in a multi-racial society like that of Fiji. As a background to the above matters a comprehensive survey of the constitutional history of the country is attempted. The role of the judiciary has been given significant emphasis throughout the thesis as it is felt that the judiciary is linchpin of the Constitution of Fiji. Concluding observations have been offered on ways of making the spirit of the Constitution, as enshrined in the preamble to the Constitution, a reality; and to engender a national outlook amongst the people of all ethnic groups.</field><field name="date">1975</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::390000 Law, Justice and Law Enforcement::390100 Law</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2870</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Basic equality and its applications</field><field name="creator">Smith, Nicholas Mark</field><field name="description">Equality is a prominent value in modern moral, legal and political philosophy. There is, however, much controversy over the meaning of the concept and its moral implications. In this thesis I argue that the recent scepticism expressed by some writers about the prospects of reaching any agreement about what equality means is not well founded. The idea is not an empty one. The difficulty in pinning down its exact meaning and implications for our social ethics is caused by its abstractness, not its vacuity. The moral significance of equality can be expressed in the idea of basic equality &#8211; the requirement that persons are to be treated as equals and accorded equal concern and respect. That idea is morally justifiable and plays an important role in modern moral theory. If we accept that human beings are equal in important respects and that a commitment to basic equality as a moral ideal makes sense because of our shared human condition, then it follows that respect for that value is implicit in each instance of our moral decision making. The abstractness of basic equality means that it cannot serve as a straightforward rule which can be easily applied to disputes about who should or should not receive equal treatment. There is no list of prohibited grounds of differentiation that applies in all circumstances. Thoughtful moral judgments about the denial of basic equality typically demand sophisticated assessments of whether the interests of all affected parties have been taken into account and different sorts of denial of basic equality will require consideration of different factors. Attempts have been made in recent equality law jurisprudence to find a less abstract concept of equality that can inform the interpretation of the law. These are unsuccessful because basic equality cannot be reduced to some simpler, rule like, standard. These understandable attempts to make this area of law more manageable are not good explanations of what is morally important about the idea of equality. Clarity about the meaning and purpose of contemporary discrimination law is not likely to be achieved by further attempts to say what this law is really about. The law is difficult to apply because it is in the same broad terms as the idea of basic equality. The central moral quandaries of recent jurisprudential thought about basic equality concern the appropriateness of different treatment on grounds which can be used to discriminate against people. The difficulties that courts have with these issues are not remarkable because the moral issues are intractable. Issues such as indirect discrimination or the fairness of affirmative action policies require in depth consideration of the interests and concerns of all affected parties and will not be resolved by the application of any simple algorithm based on a less abstract definition of equality. These issues are difficult to resolve, not because we do not know what equality is but because weighing the competing concerns of affected parties while paying attention to other important values is a complex and often difficult task.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::390000 Law, Justice and Law Enforcement::390100 Law</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2876</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A behavioural and functional imaging investigation of Stroop task performance in late proficient bilinguals</field><field name="creator">Badzakova-Trajkov, Gjurgjica</field><field name="description">In this thesis, Stroop task performance was investigated (using behavioural, electrophysiological and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques) in late and proficient adult bilinguals currently living in the second language (L2) environment. Monolingual participants, matched for age and handedness, were recruited as controls. The Stroop colour-word task was considered an appropriate tool to test the general hypothesis that bilingualism might influence executive or cognitive control processes. In Study One, a dual-task paradigm was used for assessing the lateralisation of language functions (given the linguistic nature of the Stroop paradigm used here) in the bilinguals (Macedonian-English/M-E). Bilinguals showed a more bilateral hemispheric involvement, for both languages, compared to monolinguals. These findings also provided supporting evidence for the hypothesis of greater right-hemispheric involvement for language in bilinguals. In Study Two, two behavioural Stroop task paradigms (manual and verbal) were used in order to assess the magnitude of the Stroop effect between the groups. Bilinguals (M-E, German-English/G-E) showed a trend of smaller interference scores across both languages compared to monolinguals. In Study Three, manual Stroop task performance with concurrent electroencephalograph (EEG) recording revealed that bilinguals had temporal shifts in the N400 component (of about 30-40 ms) for the interference comparison for both languages compared to monolinguals. Also, relative to monolinguals, M-E bilinguals (for both L1 and L2) and G-E bilinguals (for L2) had fewer electrodes over frontal and central sites with a significant amplitude difference in the interference comparison (i.e., a reduced interference effect). In Study Four, the neural substrates engaged during Stroop task performance were investigated using fMRI. In general, monolinguals showed greater activation in regions such as the prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate (regions associated with good executive control). This suggested that relative to bilinguals, monolinguals require more neural resources to accomplish conflict resolution. Taken together, Stroop task performance in late and proficient bilinguals currently living in the L2 environment differed from that of monolinguals across all methods of investigation. It appears that cognitive processing changes at the executive level can be observed as a result of bilingualism. The results also provide some evidence for changes in L1 processing following late L2 acquisition, as similar results across both languages and tasks were observed for the M-E bilinguals. It is also possible that slight modifications to cerebral laterality as a result of the late learning of (and continuous exposure to) a second language could contribute to these differences in executive functioning. The language environment might therefore be a major factor in the lateralisation of language processing and executive functioning in bilinguals. These conclusions, though tentative and require further investigation, have important implications for language and executive processing in general and for theories regarding cognitive flexibility in bilinguals.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bilingualism</field><field name="subject">Stroop</field><field name="subject">fMRI</field><field name="subject">EEG</field><field name="subject">interference</field><field name="subject">language</field><field name="subject">behavioural</field><field name="subject">laterality</field><field name="subject">executive</field><field name="subject">control</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380102 Learning, memory, cognition and language</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3365</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Digital surface curvature</field><field name="creator">Rugis, John</field><field name="description">The theoretical basis for this thesis can be found in the subject of differential geometry where both line and surface curvature is a core feature. We begin with a review of curvature basics, establish notational conventions, and contribute new results (on n-cuts) which are of importance for this thesis. A new scale invariant curvature measure is presented. Even though curvature of continuous smooth lines and surfaces is a well-defined property, when working with digital surfaces, curvature can only be estimated. We review the nature of digitized surfaces and present a number of curvature estimators, one of which (the 3-cut mean estimator) is new. We also develop an estimator for our new scale invariant curvature measure, and apply it to digital surfaces. Surface curvature maps are defined and examples are presented. A number of curvature visualization examples are provided. In practical applications, the noise present in digital surfaces usually precludes the possibility of direct curvature calculation. We address this noise problem with solutions including a new 2.5D filter. Combining techniques, we introduce a data processing pipeline designed to generate surface registration markers which can be used to identify correspondences between multiple surfaces. We present a method (projecting curvature maps) in which high resolution detail is merged with a simplified mesh model for visualization purposes. Finally, we present the results of experiments (using texture projection merging and image processing assisted physical measurement) in which we have identified, characterized, and produced visualizations of selected fine surface detail from a digitization of Michelangelo&#8217;s David statue.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3105</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of periconceptional undernutrition and twinning on ovine pregnancy</field><field name="creator">Rumball, Christopher William Henry</field><field name="description">Events around conception such as maternal undernutrition and twinning may have effects on offspring physiology and disease risk in adulthood.  Periconceptional undernutrition alters offspring physiology and adult pathology without affecting birth size, while twinning affects birth size and physiology but with inconsistent effects on adult pathology.  We investigated the effects of these two periconceptional events and their interaction on maternal cardiovascular adaptation to pregnancy and fetal growth, physiology and endocrinology in late gestation in sheep.  Pre and/or postconception undernutrition resulted in increased uterine blood flow in late gestation, but no change in maternal blood volume.  Preconception undernutrition alone resulted in a relatively large placenta with a small, slow-growing fetus in late gestation.  In contrast, postconception undernutrition alone resulted in a fetus with rapid late-gestation growth that was maintained through a maternal fast.  Fetuses of ewes undernourished throughout both periods were similar in growth rate and size to controls.  Maternal fasting also demonstrated that plasma levels of C-type natriuretic peptide are acutely and independently regulated by nutrient supply in mother and fetus. Fetuses of ewes undernourished both pre- and postconception had increased glucose disposal following a glucose challenge.  Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis tests in these fetuses showed decreased pituitary adrenocorticotropin hormone response to direct stimulation but increased adrenal response to decreased cortisol negative feedback. Twin fetuses grew more slowly in late gestation than singletons. Twins also had a smaller insulin response to arginine and a greater insulin response to glucose, but periconceptional undernutrition abolished this difference.  Twins had suppressed baseline hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function and decreased adrenal sensitivity compared to singletons, but increased fetal pituitary adrenocorticotropin hormone response to direct stimulation and decreased cortisol negative feedback. These studies suggest that firstly, fetal size is a poor reflection of fetal growth trajectory, physiology and endocrinology.  Secondly, pre- and postconception undernutrition affect late-gestation fetal growth in different ways, while undernutrition in both periods alters fetal endocrine status in late gestation.  Thirdly, the biology of twin fetal development is fundamentally different from that of singletons, which may explain the inconsistency of the relationship between birth weight and adult disease risk in twins.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">developmental origins of health and disease</field><field name="subject">sheep</field><field name="subject">pregnancy</field><field name="subject">fetal programming</field><field name="subject">nutrition</field><field name="subject">twins</field><field name="subject">hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis</field><field name="subject">glucose-insulin axis</field><field name="subject">fetal growth</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270600 Physiology::270603 Animal physiology-systems</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321206 Preventative medicine</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321205 Nutrition and dietetics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3290</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design and evaluation of software obfuscations</field><field name="creator">Majumdar, Anirban</field><field name="description">Software obfuscation is a protection technique for making code unintelligible to automated program comprehension and analysis tools. It works by performing semantic preserving transformations such that the difficulty of automatically extracting the computational logic out of code is increased. Obfuscating transforms in existing literature have been designed with the ambitious goal of being resilient against all possible reverse engineering attacks. Even though some of the constructions are based on intractable computational problems, we do not know, in practice, how to generate hard instances of obfuscated problems such that all forms of program analyses would fail. In this thesis, we address the problem of software protection by developing a weaker notion of obfuscation under which it is not required to guarantee an absolute blackbox security. Using this notion, we develop provably-correct obfuscating transforms using dependencies existing within program structures and indeterminacies in communication characteristics between programs in a distributed computing environment. We  show how several well known static analysis tools can be used for reverse engineering obfuscating transforms that derive resilience from computationally hard problems. In particular, we restrict ourselves to one common and potent static analysis tool, the static slicer, and use it as our attack tool. We show the use of derived software engineering metrics to indicate the degree of success or failure of a slicer attack on a piece of obfuscated code. We address the issue of proving correctness of obfuscating transforms by adapting existing proof techniques for functional program refinement and communicating sequential processes. The results of this thesis could be used for future work in two ways: first, future researchers may extend our proposed techniques to design obfuscations using a wider range of dependencies that exist between dynamic program structures. Our restricted attack model using one static analysis tool can also be relaxed and obfuscations capable of withstanding a broader class of static and dynamic analysis attacks could be developed based on the same principles. Secondly, our obfuscatory strength evaluation techniques could guide anti-malware researchers in the development of tools to detect obfuscated strains of polymorphic viruses.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">obfuscation</field><field name="subject">software security</field><field name="subject">program transformation</field><field name="subject">global state monitoring</field><field name="subject">slicing</field><field name="subject">distributed computing</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280300 Computer Software</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3107</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Being aged' in the Everyday: uncovering the meaning through elders' stories</field><field name="creator">Wright-St Clair, Valerie A</field><field name="description">It&#8217;s like the sun and the tide. The aim of this study was to understand the meaning of &#8216;being aged&#8217; through the everyday experiences of those who are aged. Philosophically, this interpretive study was informed by hermeneutics and interpretive phenomenology. The writings of two twentieth-century philosophers, Hans-Georg Gadamer and Martin Heidegger, guided the study&#8217;s design and research methods. The phenomenon of interest is &#8216;being aged;&#8217; a thing which is ordinarily taken-for-granted in the everyday. However, much is already spoken and empirically &#8216;known&#8217; about the phenomenon by those who are not yet aged. Methodologically the study&#8217;s design sought to &#8216;put aside&#8217; those voices and listen in closely to what elders themselves had to say about being in their everyday lives. Individual research conversations were conducted with fifteen participants; four Maori elders aged 71 to 93 and eleven non-Maori elders aged 80 to 97 years. All were living in private residences on Auckland&#8217;s North Shore and recruited by way of the general electoral roll. The conversations were focused on gathering the stories of particular everyday events as well as the person&#8217;s reflections on aging. Anecdotes drawn from the conversations formed the research text. Hermeneutics informed the interpretive engagement with this text. As a non-Maori researcher, cultural integrity of the text and the interpretations was enhanced through partnership with a Maori advisor. Dwelling hermeneutically with the anecdotal text was a way of listening to the spoken and unspoken words. Four overarching notions were illuminated and form the study&#8217;s findings. They are my interpretive descriptions of the ordinary ways of &#8216;being in the everyday,&#8217; the experiences of &#8216;being with others&#8217; in advanced age, the announcing of being aged in the uncomfortableness of &#8216;experiencing the unaccustomed&#8217; and how &#8216;aging just is&#8217; there in an everyday way. Reflecting phenomenologically on the findings, the meaning of being aged is in its ordinariness. My thesis is that being in the ordinary everyday in advanced age both conceals and reveals the phenomenon of being aged.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hermeneutic</field><field name="subject">phenomenology</field><field name="subject">everyday</field><field name="subject">aging</field><field name="subject">elders</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321007 Geriatrics and gerontology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3080</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Engaging reluctant writers: the nature of reluctance to write and the effect of a self-regulation strategy training programme on the engagement and writing performance of reluctant writers in secondary school English</field><field name="creator">Hawthorne, Shaun</field><field name="description">The studies reported in this thesis examine the way engagement and motivational theories provide insight and understanding into how to engage, more effectively, reluctant writers at the secondary school level. Models of &#8216;writing engagement&#8217; and &#8216;reluctance to write&#8217; are proposed which represent a synthesis of findings from literature reviews and from a series of four studies employing a range of quantitative and qualitative methods. Study One investigated the beliefs of experienced teachers of English about the nature of reluctance to write. The teachers were interviewed separately and asked to describe the characteristics of reluctant writers that they had taught displayed. The teachers identified the behaviours and beliefs that they believed these students exhibited and described what they tried to do to improve student engagement with writing. Study Two developed a tool to measure different levels of engagement with writing. A questionnaire was piloted with 99 Year 10 students from four different secondary schools and then further tested and refined with 265 Year 10 students from two secondary schools. The final version of the resulting instrument was later used in the final phase of this project as a means of measuring improvements in reported engagement levels as the result of an intervention. Study Three explored student beliefs about what hindered or aided their engagement with writing in the English classroom. Four focus groups were conducted involving 28 students from the two schools that had participated in the questionnaire study. The focus groups were divided into two types: engaged and reluctant writers. Results from the focus group study clarified the differences and similarities between the two groups of writers and helped to refine understanding of what was important in engaging writers with school based writing. The results suggest that interest in a topic and the perceived relevance of the task to the student are the main factors influencing engagement. Other findings suggest that reluctant writers are more likely to be influenced by teacher, self-belief and knowledge and skill factors than engaged writers who are more likely to want choice and control over their writing. Some gender differences also appeared. In particular, girls appeared to be more aware of the influence of self-belief factors on engagement, and reluctant girls appeared to be particularly influenced by teacher factors. Finally, Study Four was an intervention study exploring the impact a self-regulation strategy development treatment had on the engagement and writing performance of Year 10 students. Students&#8217; ability to self-regulate during the writing process had been identified in each of the previous studies, and in prior research, as an important factor affecting writing engagement and achievement scores. This study specifically sought to measure if the intervention had a differing impact on reluctant versus non-reluctant students. Four treatment groups completed the writing engagement questionnaire before and after the intervention period. Pre and post samples of writing performance were also taken. Findings from this study showed that the reported levels of motivation to engage with writing, of reluctant writers, improved significantly as a result of the treatment and that the treatment had a significantly positive impact on the writing performance of all groups of students. The results from this research suggest that the proposed models of engagement with writing and reluctance to write include important aspects of the two constructs. The study also shows that a self-regulation strategy development intervention set in a regular classroom environment can have positive impacts for all students, and suggests that reluctant writers benefit the most from such interventions.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3128</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The nature of the relationship of the Crown in New Zealand with iwi Maori</field><field name="creator">Healy, Susan</field><field name="description">This study investigates the nature of the relationship that the state in New Zealand, the Crown, has established with M&#257;ori as a tribally-based people. Despite the efforts of recent New Zealand Governments to address the history of Crown injustice to M&#257;ori, the relationship of the Crown with Iwi M&#257;ori continues to be fraught with contradictions and tension. It is the argument of the thesis that the tension exists because the Crown has imposed a social, political, and economic order that is inherently contradictory to the social, political, and economic order of the M&#257;ori tribal world. Overriding an order where relationships are negotiated and alliances built between autonomous groups, the Crown constituted itself as a government with single, undivided sovereignty, used its unilateral power to introduce policy and legislation that facilitated the dispossession of wh&#257;nau and hap&#363; of their resources and their authority in the land, and enshrined its own authority and capitalist social relations instead. The thesis is built round a critical reading of five Waitangi Tribunal reports, namely the Muriwhenua Fishing Report, Mangonui Sewerage Report, The Te Roroa Report, Muriwhenua Land Report, and Te Whanau o Waipareira Report.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2930</field></doc><doc><field name="title">S'an&#233;antir ou s'&#233;panouir: avatars d'asc&#233;tisme anorexique dans la litt&#233;rature fran&#231;aise du XIXe au XXIe si&#232;cle</field><field name="creator">Wrigley-Brown, Lynette</field><field name="description">Intrigued by a striking resemblance between certain behaviour, characteristics and preoccupations in characters from French literary texts, on the one hand, and in modern-day anorexics on the other, we have undertaken a study of representations of abnegation.  In reading female ascetic piety, particularly in an extreme and sterile form known as &#8220;scrupulosity,&#8221; as it is seen in Madame Gervaisais, by the Goncourt Brothers, and in the representation of adolescence in L&#8217;Histoire de ma vie, by George Sand, I aim to explore similarities and differences between these two &#8220;conditions.&#8221;  Next, certain texts by Zola, Vincent van Gogh and Simone de Beauvoir allow me to study a wide range of responses to the same questions as those which motivate anorexia nervosa and scrupulosity: questions of balance between the spiritual and the material, of perfectionism, of excessive obedience, of refusal of pleasure, and of a capacity for self-destruction.  Paradoxically, all the &#8220;characters&#8221; studied here (including those &#8220;characters&#8221; created by means of autobiography or letter writing) are represented as possessing tendencies which define these two &#8220;conditions,&#8221; tendencies which are capable of leading either to extraordinary fulfilment, an unheard of creativity, or to self-destruction motivated by a desire for perfect virtue.

Grof contends that the human psyche, when stimulated by new material originating from loss experiences, may spontaneously reorganise itself. This process either unfolds gently as spiritual emergence or overwhelms the individual as SE. This thesis examines Grof&#8223;s holotropic theory, using Shakespeare&#8223;s Hamlet as an illustration, to establish theoretically how SE might be experienced and observed in an adolescent. Hamlet&#8223;s powerful responses to the death of his father, the loss of his inheritance and the remarriage of his mother are explored via Grof&#8223;s extended cartography of the human psyche and a close analysis of Hamlet&#8223;s soliloquies. As counselling verbatim, the soliloquies provide an important opportunity to discuss how significant experiences of loss have the potential for developmental transformation in adolescence. The possible incidence of SE in adolescence raises questions about how we identify, understand and support young people undergoing this process of transformation. In addition to analysing Hamlet&#8223;s experiences in the light of Grof&#8223;s theoretical framework, the thesis discusses the broader literature on grief and loss and the work of a range of other developmental, spiritual, transpersonal and integral psychologists and philosophers. The thesis engages Grof&#8223;s ideas critically and assesses their relevance for adolescent counselling practice and counsellor education in the New Zealand context. This thesis challenges some widely accepted views among counsellors and educators. It argues for the acknowledgement and identification of the SE experience and recommends that further research be conducted with adolescents. It concludes that an understanding of the deeper dimensions of personal experience can assist professionals to be more effectively engaged with young people throughout their educational journeys.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2931</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Embedded speech recognition systems</field><field name="creator">Cheng, Octavian</field><field name="description">Apart from recognition accuracy, decoding speed and vocabulary size, another point of consideration when developing a practical ASR application is the adaptability of the system. An ASR system is more useful if it can cope with changes that are introduced by users, for example, new words and new grammar rules. In addition, the system can also automatically update the underlying knowledge sources, such as language model probabilities, for better recognition accuracy. Since the knowledge sources need to be adaptable, it is in&#176;exible to statically combine them. It is because on-line modi&#175;cation becomes di&#177;cult once all the knowledge sources have been combined into one static search space. The second objective of the thesis is to develop an algorithm which allows dynamic integration of knowledge sources during decoding. In this approach, each knowledge source is represented by a weighted &#175;nite state transducer (WFST). The knowledge source that is subject to adaptation is factorized from the entire search space. The adapted knowledge source is then combined with the others during decoding. In this thesis, we propose a generalized dynamic WFST composition algorithm, which avoids the creation of non- coaccessible paths, performs weight look-ahead and does not impose any constraints to the topology of the WFSTs. Experimental results on Wall Street Journal (WSJ1) 20k- word trigram task show that our proposed approach has a better word accuracy versus real-time factor characteristics than other dynamic composition approaches.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Speech Recognition</field><field name="subject">Embedded Systems</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290900 Electrical and Electronic Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3279</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The mechanism of anti-tumour activity of the DNA binding agent SN 28049</field><field name="creator">Drummond, Catherine</field><field name="description">SN 28049 is a novel DNA intercalating anti-cancer drug developed at the Auckland Cancer Society Research Centre as part of ongoing research into topoisomerase II poisons with high activity against solid tumours. SN 28049 was curative against murine Colon 38 tumours, a model of colorectal adenocarcinoma which is generally unresponsive to topoisomerase II poisons (1), while two clinically used topoisomerase II poisons, doxorubicin and etoposide, were respectively moderately active and inactive against this tumour. The aim of this thesis was to use human tumour cell lines in order to develop an understanding of the mechanism of anti-tumour activity of SN 28049. Topoisomerase II poisons induce DNA double strand breaks which signal through multiple pathways, and two of these, the &#947;-phosphorylation of histone H2AX (&#947;-H2AX) and the induction of p53 protein were investigated in HCT 116 colorectal carcinoma cells and in NZM3, NZM6 and NZM52 melanoma cells. SN 28049 induced only a small increase in &#947;- H2AX phosphorylation, comparable to that mediated by doxorubicin and etoposide. However, a low concentration of SN 28049 (25 nM) stimulated p53 protein expression in HCT 116 cells to levels in excess of those observed in response to doxorubicin or etoposide. The activation of p53 by SN 28049 cells was investigated using the HCT 116 line and an isogenic line lacking p53 expression. As assessed by expression of the representative p53 transcriptional targets FAS, p21WAF1 and survivin, SN 28049 was considerably more active than doxorubicin or etoposide in stimulating the p53 pathway. However, there was little evidence of SN 28049 inducing either G1 arrest or apoptosis in these cells. SN 28049 instead induced p53-dependent G1 tetraploid arrest following mitotic failure in the absence of cell division. In response to a five-hour drug exposure and further growth in the absence of drug, HCT 116 p53 +/+ cells arrested with a &#8216;4N&#8217; DNA content, expressing high levels of G1-phase cyclin E. At later times, senescence associated &#946;-galactosidase (SA-&#946;-Gal) activity increased, indicative of senescence. Under similar conditions, HCT 116 p53 -/- cells continued cycling with a DNA content of &gt;4N. In contrast, doxorubicin added under similar conditions to HCT 116 p53 +/+ cells caused cycle arrest with an &#8216;8N&#8217; DNA content and signs of senescence, while etoposide induced only signs of senescence. The activity of SN 28049 and a series of its analogues was also compared to that of doxorubicin and etoposide in both the HCT 116 p53 +/+ and p53 -/- lines using growth inhibition assays. When cells were cultured at a density that allows exponential growth, SN 28049 selectively inhibited HCT 116 cells expressing wild-type p53, and the selectivity was related to potency. However, responses to SN28049 were not distinguished qualitatively from doxorubicin and etoposide. In contrast, under conditions of high cell density, SN28049 and several active analogues maintained selectivity for HCT 116 p53 +/+ over p53 -/- cells while doxorubicin and etoposide lost their selectivity. The ability of SN 28049 to activate p53 was retained at high cell density. It is concluded that SN28049 has two cellular actions. The first, shared with doxorubicin and etoposide, is mediated by topoisomerase II-induced DNA damage, is cell cycle non-specific and leads to cell cycle arrest. The second, which is unique to SN28049 and is most easily observed in a cell line (HCT 116) growing at high cell density to ensure minimal expression of active topoisomerase II, involves bypass of mitosis and entry into a G1 tetraploid phase and is characterised by high expression of p53 and its downstream products. It is hypothesised that this second cellular action could explain the high in vivo activity of SN 28049.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3079</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sustainability in karst resources management: the case of the Gunung Sewu in Java</field><field name="creator">Sunkar, Arzyana</field><field name="description">Although land is abundant, biophysical constraints on Gunung Sewu Karst in Java, Indonesia, limit soil fertility and water availability. Gunung Sewu farmers depend heavily on the land for their survival yet they have a scarcity of the resources needed for productivity. Faced with the need to survive, they have developed cultural, physical and social self-insurance strategies to increase the return from those resources available to minimise the risks to their food security and income. Strategies for land use choices are driven by socio-economic circumstances (social, economical and cultural needs), while strategies for income are driven more by the physical environment. The study confirms that human adaptation strategies are as important as environmental circumstances in determining the consequences of people&#8217;s interaction with the land. The rocky desertification that occurs in the area reflects the unsustainability of current rural practices, although this cannot be blamed entirely on current practices. Historical analysis of Gunung Sewu land use shows that environmental degradation is often triggered by external social factors such as population growth, politics and economic problems as much as, or more than, by the limitations imposed by biophysical factors. Therefore, the sustainability of current resource management in the area cannot be measured by the current extent of land degradation. Instead, there is a need to focus on the causes that underpin the dynamics of a system, not the effects (impacts), i.e. the underlying causes of people&#8217;s motivation and behaviour with respect to resource management must be considered. In effect, sustainability indicators for resource management in Gunung Sewu should be addressed through causal indicators portraying the interactions between people and environment. A system dynamics approach coupled with steps from PICABUE methodology are used to develop sustainability indicators. From a system dynamics perspective, five interacting sub-systems make up the resource management system of Gunung Sewu, i.e. water, demography, food production, economy and culture (where water is treated as exogenous factor). Out of these subsystems, culture is the most influential but the least influenced. The sustainability indicators for the system are soil conservation effort, interest in traditional farming, education level, births, onfarm income, outmigration, rice consumption and crops consumption, each crammed with sensitive parameters, most of which belong to the culture sub-system. This suggests the important of cultural indicators in an evaluation of the resource management sustainability of a resource-poor area.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gunung Sewu Karst</field><field name="subject">sustainability</field><field name="subject">resource management</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="subject">system dynamics</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370400 Human Geography</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3366</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development and Evaluation of Nanoparticulate Drug Delivery Systems for Anticancer Drugs</field><field name="creator">Ganta, Srinivas</field><field name="description">The main aim of this study was to develop nanoparticulate drug delivery systems for chlorambucil (CHL) and asulacrine (ASL). CHL is a DNA alkylating agent. In an attempt to alter the pharmacokinetics (short half-life, rapid clearance and high volume of distribution) and improve the anticancer activity, CHL was incorporated into a lipid nanosphere (LN) formulation. The LN were composed of soybean oil as the internal oil phase, egg lecithin as the primary emulsifier, cholesterol as the phospholipid layer stabilizer, and water as the external phase. PEG-modified (long circulating) and DOTAP-modified (cationic) LN were prepared to evade the reticulo-endothelial system and enhance cellular delivery, respectively. LN prepared by ultra-sonicater and microfluidizer had an average particle size below 200 nm, with a CHL encapsulation efficiency of over 97%. Zeta potential of the LN ranged from -30.6 to +41.5 mV. The LN exhibited good physical stability over six months at 4&#176;C and 25&#176;C. In vitro evaluation on SKOV-3 cells showed that the cytotoxicity and the pro-apoptotic activity of CHL were significantly enhanced when given in the LN formulation compared to the CHL solution (P&lt;0.05). An altered pharmacokinetics with increased plasma AUC and elimination half-life, and reduced clearance were observed after intravenous administration of CHL incorporated LN compared to a CHL solution (P&lt;0.01). A marked reduction in the tissue distribution of CHL was also noted when it was given in LN. In addition, CHL incorporated in LN showed greater anticancer activity compared with the CHL solution in colon-38 tumour-bearing mice (P&lt;0.01). These results suggest that LN could be an effective parenteral carrier for CHL delivery. ASL is an inhibitor of topoisomerase II. In an attempt to improve its efficacy by altering the pharmacokinetic profile, ASL was formulated as a nanocrystal suspension (NS). The NS was consisting of ASL nanoparticles produced by high pressure homogenization and stabilized by stabilizers. The lyophilized NS exhibited good stability over three months at 4&#176;C and 25&#176;C. The dissolution and solubility of ASL were enhanced in NS form compared to un-milled ASL (P&lt;0.05). Initial peak plasma concentration and AUC were remarkably reduced in the plasma after intravenous administration of NS compared to the ASL solution (P&lt; 0.01). This suggests reduced systemic exposure to the drug.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320500 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3081</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Frequency selective wallpaper for mitigating indoor wireless interference</field><field name="creator">Sung, Hui-Hsia</field><field name="description">This thesis presents an effective technique for interference control with the use of frequency selective surfaces (FSSs) in indoor wireless environments. An FSS with a bandstop frequency response was applied to an existing wall as a wallpaper to transform the wall into a frequency- selective (FS) wall. The FS-Wall can be made to deliberately filter out undesired interference, and accordingly improve wireless system performance. In-situ measurements have shown that the FS-Wall prototype can attenuate 5.3GHz{5.8GHz (IEEE802.11a) transmissions by 15dB in addition to the unmodified wall attenuation, whereas other radio services, such as cellular telephony at 1.8GHz, experience only little attenuation. The FS-Wall created performed consistently (with acceptable attenuation levels) with varying signal incident angles from 0&#177; to 56&#177;. The 15dB reduction in signal strength is considered sufficient to isolate a system from external interference, and could potentially improve a WLAN system throughput by 2.2 times. The FSS performance has been examined intensely by both equivalent circuit modelling and practical measurements. Factors that influence FSS performance such as the FSS element dimensions, element conductivities, dielectric substrates adjacent to the FSS, and signal incident angles were investigated. By keeping the elements small and densely packed, a largely angle- insensitive FSS was developed as a promising prototype for FS-wallpaper. Such an FS-wallpaper can be applied directly to the wall (with no intervening spacing) with insignificant mutual interaction between the FSS and the wall. Accordingly, the resultant FS-Wall can be modelled by cascading the effects of the FS-wallpaper and the wall. Good agreement between the modelled and the measured results was observed, which suggests that the equivalent circuit model can be used confidently to assist FSS design. Fabrication techniques and practical installation issues associated with the development of FSS for indoor wireless applications were also investigated in this thesis. With the use of an angle-insensitive bandstop FSS, this research has demonstrated a feasible solution for mitigating external interference into indoor wireless systems. This research work has linked the fields of antenna design, communication systems and building architecture.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3071</field></doc><doc><field name="title">More than wives?: a study of four Church Missionary Society wives in nineteenth century New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ross, Catherine R.</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3075</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the Green Prescription physical activity intervention: a cluster randomised controlled trial in primary health care</field><field name="creator">Elley, Carolyn Raina</field><field name="description">This thesis assesses the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the 'Green Prescription' physical activity intervention amongst less-active adults in primary care, using the Auckland Heart Study (AHS) questionnaire to assess change in activity. The validity of two physical-activity questionnaires, the AHS and the GSS questionnaires, was assessed initially, comparing their performance with 7-day activity diaries and pedometers amongst less-active adults in primary care. A cluster randomised controlled trial was then conducted in the waikato region of New Zealand, with 42 general practices randomised to give the Green Prescription or 'usual care'. A systematic screening process identified less-active 40-79 year-old patients. Main outcome measures included change in physical activity, quality of life (SF-36), coronary risk, and blood pressure, over a twelve-month period. Costs of the programme and offset costs of primary and secondary health care utilisation, productivity, and exercising, were collected prospectively for cost-effectiveness analysis from a societal perspective. The AHS questionnaire was found to have adequate reliability and validity, and to be the most appropriate measurement tool for use in primary care research. In the Green Prescription trial, 74% of general practitioners (n=117) and 66% of screened eligible patients (n=878) participated. Follow-up rate, at one year, was 85% (n=750). Mean total energy expenditure increased by 9.4 kcal/kg/week (p=0.001) and leisure exercise by 2.7.kcal/kg/week (p=0.02) or 34 minutes/week more in the intervention group than the control group (p=0.04). The proportion of the intervention group undertaking 21/2 hours/week of leisure exercise increased by 9.72% (p=0.003) more than in the control group (NNT=10.3). SF-36 measures of 'general health', 'role-physical', 'vitality', and &#8216;bodily pain' improved significantly more in the intervention group (p&lt;0.05), as a result of the Green Prescription intervention. There was a trend towards decreasing blood Pressure, no increase in adverse events, and no statistically significant difference in four-year risk of coronary heart disease. The cost of delivering the Green prescription was $170.45 per participant from a funder's perspective and $37.16 (95%CI:-$945.21,$1019.53) from a societal perspective. To increase leisure-time exercise by one hour per week cost $25.36 per month from a programme funder's perspective and $5.47 (95%CI:-$138.90,$149.84)per month from a societal perspective. The AHS questionnaire was considered reliable and valid. The Green Prescription intervention is effective in increasing physical activity and improving quality of life over 12 months without evidence of adverse effects. The intervention is more cost-effective than other physical activity interventions reported in the literature and may be cost-saving in terms of long-term health gains.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3095</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The molecular pathology of the hyper immunoglobulin M syndrome</field><field name="creator">Ameratunga, Rohan</field><field name="description">The Hyper Immunoglobulin M syndrome (HIM) is a rare primary immune deficiency disorder characterised by an inability to produce immunoglobulin isotypes other than IgM and IgD. The B cell-surface antigen CD40, and its conjugate T cell counter-structure, CD40 ligand (CD154), mediate immunoglobulin isotype switching to IgE and IgG4 in the presence of cytokines such as interleukin 4. Patients with the X-linked form of the hyper IgM syndrome (XHIM) have mutations in the CD40 ligand gene which is the molecular basis for impaired immunoglobulin isotype switching in XHIM. This thesis is a tale of two HIM patients, one with XHIM (patient H1) and the other (patient M1) with a novel immune defect which has yet to be fully characterised. Analysis of Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) products of the CD40 ligand gene from patient H1 revealed two mutant transcripts, one missing exon 4 and the other missing both exons 3 and 4. In addition, the cells of patient H1 also produce small quantities of wild type cD40 ligand transcripts. Molecular analysis has shown that this complex splicing defect is precipitated by a point mutation at the invariant 3&#8217; splice acceptor site with a g&#8594;c substitution at position -1 (tcacGTA) of intron 3. RT-PCR studies have shown that the cells of the mother of patient H1 produce both wild type and deleted CD40 ligand transcripts, consistent with her carrier state. Genomic sequencing of intron 3 has shown that she is heterozygous for the point mutation (tcacgEGTA), confirming her carrier status. Analysis of other family members, including the sister and the maternal grandmother, has indicated that they have not inherited the mutation. Patients with XHIM are predisposed to Pneumocystis carinii pneumonitis and to Cryptosporidiosis. Studies of T cell function in patient H1 has identified a defect in antigenspecific proliferation which provides an explanation for the susceptibility of XHIM patients to opportunistic infections. In contrast to patient H1, the cells of patient M1 have wild type CD40 ligand sequence and express normal amounts of cell surface CD40 ligand indicating that he does not have XHIM. Flow cytometry and in vitro antibody synthesis studies have shown that the B cells of this patient are able to undergo immunoglobulin isotype switching both in vivo and in vitro. Unlike the mild T cell defect shown in XHIM patients, a severe T cell defect is present in this patient who also has impaired CD40-induced B cell function. The impaired CD40 function may be secondary to the T cell defect. The demonstration of wild type CD40 ligand transcripts in the patient with a splicing defect may explain the milder phenotype seen in some XHIM patients. The identification of the T cell defect should result in re-classification of XHIM as a combined immune deficiency disorder The characterisation of patient M1 extends the phenotypic spectrum of the hyper IgM syndrome to include a severe T cell defect in the context of normal CD40 ligand structure and function.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3088</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Relationships between reductive metabolism, DNA damage and antitumour activity of the hypoxia-activated prodrug PR-104 in preclinical models</field><field name="creator">Singleton, Rachelle</field><field name="description">Hypoxia is a characteristic of solid tumours and a potentially important therapeutic target. PR-104, a prodrug designed to target hypoxic cells, is currently in phase II clinical trial. PR- 104 is converted systemically to the alcohol PR-104A which is reduced selectively under hypoxia to its hydroxylamine and amine metabolites. This thesis aims to determine the mechanism(s) of cytotoxicity of PR-104 in preclinical tumour models. Specific objectives were to identify biomarkers of response to PR-104, and to ascertain which features of tumours determine their sensitivity to PR-104 monotherapy. PR-104A demonstrated hypoxia-selective cytotoxicity for all nine human tumour cell lines investigated in culture, but with widely differing hypoxic/oxic differentials because of large differences in aerobic cytotoxicity. Hypoxic cytotoxicity correlated with DNA interstrand crosslink (ICL) frequency (measured using the alkaline comet assay), suggesting ICL are invariably responsible for hypoxic cytotoxicity. There was a similar relationship between ICL and aerobic cytotoxicity, except for four lines with very low rates of aerobic PR-104A reduction. Nonetheless, monotherapy activity of PR-104 in tumour xenografts of all nine cell lines showed a strong correlation with ICL at 24 hours (r2 = 0.733, p&lt;0.001) indicating that DNA crosslinking is the dominant mechanism of cytotoxicity in the pharmacologically relevant dose range. A hypoxia-selective increase in the DNA double strand break marker &#947;H2AX was also observed in all cell lines after PR-104A in vitro, with kinetics and cell cycle distribution consistent with DNA replication arrest at ICL. This marker also correlated with cytotoxicity in tumours (r2 = 0.465, p&lt;0.001). The wide variation in &#947;H2AX levels between cell lines at equivalent cytotoxicity suggested &#947;H2AX is less useful than ICL as an absolute biomarker, but has possible utility for comparing response of aerobic and hypoxic cells within the same tumour. Reduced PR-104A metabolites in tumours also correlated with cytotoxicity (r2 = 0.585, p&lt;0.05), but less well than for ICL. Unexpectedly, the results suggest that rates of intratumour activation of PR-104A are not primarily determined by hypoxia (measured using pimonidazole binding) or expression of the major hypoxic reductase cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase, and that aerobic nitroreduction is a major contributor to its monotherapy antitumour activity.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hypoxia</field><field name="subject">DNA damage</field><field name="subject">biomarkers</field><field name="subject">bioreductive agents</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3286</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The metabolism of steroids by human mammary tissues</field><field name="creator">Couch, Ronald Alexander Fyfe</field><field name="description">Human mammary tissue was incubated in vitro with [7-3H] dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHA-sulphate) and in agreement with other investigators this steroid conjugate was metabolized to DHA and other steroid products.

(Margaret Jane)</field><field name="description">Transplacental glucose transport is vital to fetal growth. Although the presence of glucose transporter-1 (GLUT1) and GLUT3 has been demonstrated in mammalian placenta, the factors regulating these genes remain unclear. Therefore, the overall aim of these studies was to clone ovine GLUT1 (oGLUT1) and oGLUT3 cDNAs, and to use these to investigate gene expression during ovine placental development and function. Ovine GLUT1 (~2.2 kb) and oGLUT3 (483 bp) cDNAs were isolated and cloned. Sequence analysis demonstrated that oGLUT1 showed high homology (97 - 99%) with other mammalian species, whereas oGLUT3 did not (84 - 88%). Northern analysis demonstrated that oGLUT1 mRNA abundance increased from d 45 to d 120 of gestation, then decreased towards term (d 145 &#177; 2), whereas oGLUT3 mRNA abundance increased throughout gestation. Western analysis showed oGLUT1 protein levels increased during late gestation, indicating post-transcriptional regulation of oGLUT1. Localisation experiments revealed spatio-temporal differences in ovine placental GLUT expression. In early gestation (d 45), oGLUT1 protein was restricted to fetal trophoblast cells. By mid gestation oGLUT1 immuno-signal was predominantly localised to maternal villous and endometrial tissue. By late gestation oGLUT1 mRNA was most strongly localised to maternal syncytiotrophoblast and villous tissue, whereas oGLUT3 was predominantly localised to fetal trophoblast cells. Placental oGLUT expression was regulated differently by acute (3 - 8 h) versus long-term (&gt;6 d) alterations in late gestation maternal glucose supply. No evidence was found for regulation of placental oGLUT gene expression by long-term maternal undernutrition, but oGLUT1 and oGLUT3 mRNA and oGLUT1 protein were elevated by short-term (24 - 48 h) maternal hypoglycemia. Acute maternal hyperglycemia transiently increased oGLUT1 and oGLUT3 mRNA abundance, whereas oGLUT1 protein (but not mRNA) levels increased after long-term maternal hyperglycemia. Infusion studies provided no conclusive evidence for regulation of placental oGLUTs by long-term administration of growth hormone (GH) or insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) to the late gestation fetus. Following acute (4 h) fetal IGF-1 infusion, placental oGLUT3 mRNA abundance was greater in growth restricted (placental embolisation) than in normal fetuses, although the reason for this difference remained equivocal. This thesis describes isolation, cloning and sequence analysis of oGLUT1 and oGLUT3 cDNAs. These studies confirmed the presence of GLUTI and GLUT3 mRNA in ovine placenta, and demonstrated ontogenetic and nutritional regulation of placental oGLUT1 and oGLUT3. In addition, these results indicated that regulation of placental oGLUTs may occur at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321019 Paediatrics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3090</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Binding capacity of albumin and renal disease</field><field name="creator">Dromgoole, Sydney Herbert</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">1973</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3091</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gene expression in presympathetic neurons of the rostral ventrolateral medulla of the rat</field><field name="creator">Comer, Alison Mary</field><field name="description">The rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVL) contains a population of bulbospinal neurons which are critically involved in the tonic and reflex control of blood pressure. They project to the intermediolateral cell column of the thoracolumbar spinal cord and excite sympathetic preganglionic neurons. The RVL region also contains the C1 adrenergic group of neurons, some of which are also bulbospinal RVL vasomotor neurons. The objective of this study was to investigate RVL neurons at the cellular and molecular level, to gain a better understanding of the properties of this heterogeneous population of neurons. Two main approaches were used to achieve this. The first studied the expression of several genes in RVL micropunches and single acutely dissociated RVL neurons using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The second utilised antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotides (aODNs) to reduce expression of two adrenaline-synthesising genes, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) or phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT), in C1 adrenergic neurons in the RVL. Semi-nested RT-PCR analysis of tissue micropunched from the RVL region of adult rats established the expression of mRNA transcripts for glyceraldehydes 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), neuron-specific enolase (NSE), TH, PNMT, the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), noradrenaline transporter (NET), glycine transporter 2 (GLYT2), neuronal glutamate transporter (EAACI) and glial glutamate transporter (GLT). The expression of mRNA for glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD67) and the gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) transporter (GAT-1) was also detected in rat brainstem. The micropunch technique combined with RT-PCR offers a simple non-radioactive way to identify genes being expressed in the RVL and other medullary regions. Single neurons were acutely dissociated from the RVL of 13 - 2l day old rats, and classified as spinally projecting or non-spinal by the presence or absence of retrogradely-transported fluorescent beads injected into the upper thoracic segments. Dissociated bulbospinal RVL neurons did not exhibit any spontaneous firing, and there was no evidence of any pacemaker-like properties. A fast-activating (spike-like) inward current could be elicited by depolarising voltage steps, and could be abolished by application of tetrodotoxin. Extracellular application of either kainic acid or L-glutamic acid onto RVL cells under voltage-clamp conditions elicited dose-dependent inward currents. Individual neurons were collected by aspiration into a glass micropipette and the cell contents analysed by RT-PCR. Detection of either GAPDH or NSE mRNA was used as the criterion for selecting cells for further analysis, and 80% of the neuron samples tested expressed one of these genes. A subpopulation of spinally-projecting neurons expressed PNMT or TH (50%), indicating that they were catecholaminergic. Bulbospinal RVL neurons were also found to express mRNA for the MR (45% of those tested), the GR (5%), NET (10%), and EAAC1 (58%). GLT, GAD67 and GAT-1 were not expressed in any bulbospinal neurons, but they were detected in 5 - l0% of non-spinal neurons tested. Expression of mRNA for MR, EAAC1 and NET was also observed in subpopulations of PNMT-positive and -negative bulbospinal neurons. Expression of NET protein, assessed by immunohistochemistry, was found to be similar to NET mRNA expression in C1 adrenergic neurons in the RVL. These results indicate that single-cell RT-PCR is a powerful method for elucidating the functional characteristics of a defined neuronal population, and that it is possible to perform whole-cell patch-clamp recording prior to RT-PCR analysis, allowing linkage of the molecular analysis of mRNA expression to the electrophysiological properties of these neurons. The method is very sensitive, enabling low copy-number mRNA transcripts to be detected, and can be used to provide key information about blood-pressure regulation at the molecular and cellular level. The final part of this study used aODNs to attempt to knockdown expression of TH or PNMT in C1 neurons in the RVL. The aODNs were either injected or infused unilaterally into the RVL of adult rats in vivo, and 4 - 14 days later the animals were sacrificed and the expression of TH or PNMT protein assessed using immunohistochemistry. Immunoreactivity for TH was unchanged by injection or infusion of an aODN targeting TH mRNA. Immunoreactivity for PNMT was decreased in 2 out of l0 infusion experiments, but this was achieved using an aODN with one base pair mismatch to the PNMT mRNA sequence, and could not be repeated with aODNs of the correct sequence. This study was the first attempt to target the PNMT gene with aODNs, and although preliminary in nature, it provided some useful information for future studies of this system. Antisense ODN suppression of genes in the RVL may prove to be an interesting future avenue for investigating the functional significance of specific genes being expressed in the RVL region.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3092</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Involvement of zinc in Alzheimer's disease</field><field name="creator">Cuajungco, Math P</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321021 Psychiatry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3093</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The metabolism of cortisol in the human feto-placental unit</field><field name="creator">Dormer, Robyn Alethea</field><field name="description">A method for assaying cortisol and cortisone using chromatography on either Paper or Sephadex LH-20 columns, followed by competitive protein binding, has been applied to umbilical cord and maternal plasma samples.

Maternal plasma gave a mean value of cortisol of 42.3 &#177; 4.5 &#181;g/100 ml (n = 6) and of cortisone of 6.2 &#177; 0.9 &#181;g/100 ml (n = 6). The mean value of cortisol in mixed cord plasma of live anencephalic fetuses was 3.3 &#177; 1.8 &#181;g/100 ml (n = 3) and of cortisone was 13.6 &#177; 3.2 &#181;g/100 ml (n = 3). Further assays employing a radioimmunoassay for cortisol, and competitive protein binding for cortisone have been applied to cord plasma samples of prematurely-delivered fetuses, after treatment of betamethasone to the mother (12 mg/day for one or two days). The mean value of cortisol in samples from fetuses delivered up to 24 hours after treatment was 2.6 &#177; 2.2 &#181;g/100 ml (n = 4) and the mean value of cortisone was 2.2 &#177; 2.2 &#181;g/100 ml (n = 14). For those fetuses delivered over 72 hours after betamethasone treatment, mean levels of cortisol and cortisone were respectively 10.4 &#177; 3.2 &#181;g/100 ml and 9.4 &#177; 3.4 &#181;g/100 ml (n = 3) compared to control values without betamethasone treatment of 8.2 &#177; 3.5 &#181;g/1 0 ml and 9.6 &#177; 3.7 &#181;g/100 ml (n = 3) respectively. Kinetic parameters of the human placental 11&#946;-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase system were assessed using a microsomal preparation in 50% glycerol buffer. The Michaelis constant for cortisol was 1.88 x 10-6M, in the presence of NADP, and 0.56 x 10-6M, in the presence of NAD. Vmax values varied with concentration of cofactor, increasing from 0.031 to 0.076 &#181;moles cortisone produced per minute per mg protein with increasing concentration of NADP from 0.036 mM to 1.2 mM. The value of vmax, for an initial concentration of 1.2 mM NAD, was 0.0598. Substrate inhibition was not evident at the level of cortisol employed (up to a cortisol concentration of 1 x 10-4M). Corticosterone, cortisone, progesterone and pregnenolone inhibited enzyme activity. The results of this study suggest that fetal cortisol is produced by the fetal adrenal, and fetal cortisone originates primarily from the conversion of maternal cortisol to cortisone across the placenta, by the action of the 11&#946;-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzyme.</field><field name="date">1976</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3094</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Neural progenitor cells in the Huntington's Disease human brain</field><field name="creator">Curtis, Maurice A</field><field name="description">The recent demonstration of endogenous progenitor cells in the adult mammalian brain raises the exciting possibility that these undifferentiated cells may be able to generate new neurons for cell replacement in diseases such as Huntington's disease (HD). Previous studies have shown that neural stem cells in the rodent brain subependymal layer (SEL), adjacent to the caudate nucleus, proliferate and differentiate into neurons and glial cells but no previous study has characterised the human SEL or shown neurogenesis in the diseased human brain. In this study, histochemical and immunohistochemical techniques were used to demonstrate the regional anatomy and staining characteristics of the normal and HD brain SEL using light and laser scanning confocal microscopy. The results demonstrated that the normal and HD SEL contained migrating neuroblasts, glial cells and precursor cells but there were more of each cell type present in the HD brain, and that the increase in cell numbers correlated with HD neuropathological grade. The normal and HD SEL was stained with a proliferative marker, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), to label dividing cells. The results showed a significant increase in the number of dividing cells in the HD brain that correlated with HD grade and with CAG repeat length. Furthermore, the results showed that neurogenesis had occurred in the SEL as evidenced by co-localisation of PCNA and the neuronal marker &#946;III-tubulin. Also, gliogenesis had occurred in the SEL as evidenced by the co-localisation of PCNA with the glial marker GFAP. These studies also revealed a 2.6 fold increase in the number of new neurons in the HD SEL. PCNA positive cells were distributed throughout the SEL overlying the caudate nucleus but most notably the ventral and central regions of the SEL adjacent to the caudate nucleus contained the highest number of proliferating cells. I examined the SEL for mature cell markers and demonstrated many of the same cell types that are present in the normal striatum. With the exception of neuropeptide Y (NPY) neurons, there was a reduction in the number of mature neurons in the HD SEL. The NPY neurons were more abundant in the HD SEL suggesting they play a role in progenitor cell proliferation. The results in this thesis provide evidence of increased progenitor cell proliferation and neurogenesis in the diseased adult human brain and indicate the regenerative potential of the human brain. These findings may be of major relevance to the development of therapeutic approaches in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3114</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intracellular signalling by arachidonic acid metabolites</field><field name="creator">Berry, Elicia Bee Ean</field><field name="description">In intrauterine tissues, pro-inflammatory cytokines and prostaglandins (PGs) have been identified as key mediators in the maintenance of pregnancy and parturition. The rise in PGD2 detected in the amniotic fluid before labour prompted the research presented in this thesis which describes the effects of 15-deoxy &#916;12,14 -prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2), a non-enzymatic metabolite of PGD2, on amnion-derived WISH and JEG3 choriocarcinoma cells as models of the amnion and chorion trophoblasts, respectively.15d-PGJ2 induced apoptosis in both cell lines in a concentration-dependent fashion (2.5-10 &#181;M). Apoptosis was characterised by condensation of chromatin (visualised after Hoechst 33342 staining), appearance of nucleosomal DNA fragmentation upon electrophoresis and flow cytometry analysis, and activation of caspase-3. Apoptotic cell death was inhibited in the presence of serum (0.5% w/v) and albumin, not serumderived growth factors (insulin growth factor (IGF)-1, IGF-2 or epidermal growth factor (EGF), was determined as the key survival factor. Since 15d-PGJ2 is reported to activate peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)-&#947;, the activities of PPARs were assessed using JEG3 cells transfected with a PPAR-response element reporter construct (pTK-PPREx3-luc). The PPAR-&#947;-specific ligand, rosiglitazone, induced PPRE mediated activity in a concentration-dependent manner, while the PPAR-&#947;-specific irreversible inhibitor, GW9662, fully inhibited this induction. However, GW9662 only partially inhibited 15d-PGJ2-induced luciferase activity, suggesting that 15d-PGJ2 may also activate either of the other isoforms. The expressions of PPAR-&#945; and -&#948; were identified in amnion, choriodecidua and placental membranes and PPAR-&#948; was significantly increased all tissues with labour. PPAR-&#945; expression was reduced in chorio-decidua, but was significantly higher in placenta with labour. The changes observed with labour suggest that regulation of PPAR expression and function may have a role in the mechanisms that maintain pregnancy or initiate labour. The anti-inflammatory effects of 15d-PGJ2 were also investigated by measuring interleukin (IL)-1&#946;-stimulated prostaglandin and cytokine productions by WISH cells after treatment with 15d-PGJ2 for 3 hours. 15d-PGJ2 exerted differential effects that were dependent upon its concentration. At low nanomolar physiologic concentrations (1-10 nM), 15d-PGJ2 inhibited IL-1&#946;-stimulated PGE2, but not cytokine (IL-6/IL-8) production or cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expression. This effect was attenuated by GW9662, by transfection with dominant negative PPAR constructs, and was reproduced by rosiglitazone. At micromolar (1-10 &#181;M) concentrations, 15d-PGJ2 inhibited IL-1&#946;-stimulated COX-2, PGE2 and cytokine productions and these effects were not blocked by GW9662 or mimicked by rosiglitazone. GW501516 (PPAR-&#948; agonist) also inhibited IL-1&#946;-stimulated PGE2 production, but only at high concentrations (1 &#181;M). IL-1&#946;-induced NF-kB DNA binding activity was significantly inhibited by 15d-PGJ2 (10 &#181;M) and GW501516 (1 &#181;M), but increased by rosiglitazone (10 &#181;M). In conclusion, this is the first report of an effect of 15d-PGJ2 at low nanomolar physiologic concentrations and 15d-PGJ2 mediates its actions through PPAR-&#947; (&lt;0.1 &#181;M) and PPAR-&#947;-independent(1-10 &#181;M) pathways, the latter through inhibition of NF-kB and/or activation of PPAR-&#948;. Further studies on the effect of physiologic concentrations of 15d-PGJ2 on primary gestational tissues will provide understanding on the role(s) 15d-PGJ2 plays in fetal membrane remodelling and its involvement in the inflammatory processes associated with labour and parturition.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320500 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3111</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies into the release mechanisms of human placental lactogen in vitro</field><field name="creator">Choy, Vernon John</field><field name="description">A procedure to study the in vitro release of HPL was developed.

The aim of work presented in this thesis was to study various T cell responses in mice to one protein of M. leprae, designated the 18 kDa protein. Mice were immunised with recombinant 18 kDa protein and lymph node cells tested later in proliferative T cell assays. The in vitro response was specific for the 18 kDa protein and proliferation dependent on the immunising dose as well as in vitro antigen concentration. The proliferative response required CD4+ T cells, which recognised the antigen in the context of major histocompatibility class II molecules. The T cell response was tested in various recombinant and congenic pairs of mouse strains. BALB/cJ (H-2d), BALB.B (H-2b), B10,BR (H-2k), and B10.M (H-2f) mice were all high responder strains, while the C57BL/10J (H-2b) mouse strain was a low responder. By comparing the genetic characteristics of these high and low responding strains, it was deduced that both H-2 and non-H-2 gene(s) contributed to the magnitude of responsiveness.F1 progeny mice from high and low responder parents responded in a way that showed that high responsiveness was inherited in a dominant manner. Limiting dilution assays indicated that the frequency of cells proliferating in response to the 18 kDa protein correlated with high and low responsiveness of cells from secondary lymphoid tissue. The low frequency of C57BL10/J responding lymphocytes to the 18 kDa protein probably accounted for the reduced in vitro IL-2 production observed in this mouse strain. The T cell response of mice immunised with either the 18 kDa or M. leprae antigens revealed the following. The 18 kDa protein-primed lymph node cells responded to both M. leprae and. M. tuberculosis, suggesting a shared 18 kDa protein T cell epitope by these pathogens. The M. leprae-primed lymph node cells showed no significant response to the 18 kDa protein, but responded similarly to M. leprae and M. tuberculosis antigens. The results were obtained using both bulk cultures and limiting dilution experiments. This indicated that the l8 kDa protein was probably not a dominant antigen in primary murine immune responses against M. leprae. Proliferative T cell epitopes on the 18 kDa protein were examined in several mouse strains. Each mouse strain responded to one dominant region after immunising with 18 kDa protein. The dominant T cell epitope was not identical in all strains. The peptide consisting of residues 106-l25 of the 18 kDa protein was dominant in BALB/cJ and BALB.B mice, whereas the B10.BR mice responded to peptide 31-50 and C57BL/10J mice to peptide 16-35. Lymph node cells primed with individual synthetic peptides and challenged with 18 kDa protein in vitro revealed additional T cell epitopes which were not recognised following immunisation with 18 kDa protein. Cytotoxic T cell epitopes on the l8 kDa molecule were investigated, using an in vitro-priming system. Only one region of the 18 kDa protein elicited cytotoxic T cell responses. This T cell epitope was restricted to mouse strains of H-2b haplotype. The cytotoxic response was a feature of CD8+ T cells and the lysis of target cells depended upon peptide concentration. Cells infected with a recombinant retrovirus carrying the 18 kDa gene were used to prime mice for the induction of cytotoxic T cells in vivo. Cytotoxic T cell responses were detected but none were specific for the 18 kDa protein. Inflammatory T cell responses to the 18 kDa protein were investigated in a number of mouse strains, using a delayed-type hypersensitivity footpad assay. The C57BL/10J mouse strain elicited a similar or even greater response than other strains tested, in contrast to proliferative T cell responses where C57BL/10J was a low responder strain. The number of immunizations influenced the type of immune response elicited in mice. Multiple immunisations with the 18 kDa protein resulted in a reduced delayed-type hypersensitivity response concomitant with the appearance of antigen-specific IgG antibodies. Several 18 kDa-specific T cell lines derived from BALB/cJ, B10.BR, and C57BL/10J mouse strains were generated. T cell lines from the BALB/cJ strain showed characteristics of TH1 and TH0 phenotypes and one line responded to peptide 46-65 of the 18 kDa protein. The B10.BR- and C57BL/10J-derived T cell lines responded to peptide 31-50 and 106-125 respectively and secreted IL-3 upon stimulation, but neither IL-2 nor IL-4 were detected. Various subsets of T cells might play different roles in the immune response against pathogens. The T cell subsets involved in protection might not be identical to those eliciting a strong immunological reaction. T cell responses against intracellular parasites are discussed in relation to factors that govern protective immunity.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3110</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A genetic study of cleft lip and cleft palate: Auckland, 1960-1976</field><field name="creator">Chapman, Cyril James</field><field name="description">A study of cleft lip and cleft palate was carried out in order to determine whether or not any differences in incidence between Europeans and Polynesians were accompanied by differences in recurrence risks, and to test the genetic hypotheses currently favoured as explanations of familial agggregation of these disorders. An incidence study vas undertaken on all live births in the Auckland urban area for the years 1960 to 1976.Family information was obtained from these probands and from other affected persons or their close relatives, by interview at the cleft palate clinic at Middlemore Hospital. The ascertainment probability for cleft 1ip and cleft palate probands was about 95% and was not correlated with any of the demographic characteristics measured on the probands. After correction for ascertainment, the incidence of cleft palate in Maoris was estimated to be 1.867/1000 1lve births. For Europeans the estimate was 0.643/1000. The corresponding figures for cleft lip with or without cleft palate were 0.397/1000 and 1.195/1000. The sex ratio for cleft palate was 0.485 with heterogeneity between the races. For cleft lip the sax ratio was 0.649 overall. There were no secular or seasonal trends in the incidence of facial clefts and no significant effects of maternal age, or paternal age. The mean birth rank for probands with cleft lip with or without cleft palate was higher than expected. For probands with cleft palate, mean birth rank was not significantly elevated. The pattern of additional malformations in these probands was similar to those reported in similar studies from other centres. The recurrence risk for cleft palate was 1.8% overall. Although it was s1ightly higher in polynesian families than in European families, the difference was nowhere near statistical significance. For cleft lip the recurrence risk was 2.6% overall, with the risk being slightly higher in Polynesian families, but again not significantly higher than in European families. Using current analytical techniques, no discrimination was possible between a generalized single autosomal locus model and a multifactoriar threshold model. A consideration of the parameter estimates for both models suggests that the multifactorial threshold model is the more appropriate one to use for the calculation of recurrence risks in complicated family situations. It is concluded that further family studies of this nature would no longer be warranted unless hypotheses can realistically be tested on the samples available. However, incidence studies in special populations will remain important for hypothesis testing. Following on the work using animal models, a study of face shape within and among races in New Zealand may provide clues to the aetiology of facial clefts, particularly isoleted cleft palate. It will be important to follow changes in incidence over time and discover what effects intermarriage and cultural changes might have on the incidence of facial clefts.</field><field name="date">1981</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321207 Indigenous health</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3096</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Insulin-like growth factor-1 after hypoxic-ischemic brain injury: effects and modes of action on neuronal survival</field><field name="creator">Guan, Jian</field><field name="description">Insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF)s naturally occur in the central nervous system (CNS) and have an important role in cell proliferation and differentiation during brain development and maturation. IGFs, IGF binding protein (IGFBP)s and their receptors are expressed in damaged brain regions suggesting a role for the IGFs system after brain injury. It is now known that neurons can die some hours, even days after an injury. This programmed death is termed delayed neuronal death (DND). The process of DND might provide a therapeutic window of opportunity for insulin/IGFs to reduce brain damage after an insult. Unilateral hypoxic-ischemic (HI) brain injury was induced using a modified Levine rat model. Intracerebral ventricular (ICV) administration was chosen for the delivery of the peptides. The effects of IGF-1 on neuroprotection were tested when given either before or after the HI insult. The dose response of IGF-1 on neuronal rescue was also determined. The distribution of IGF-1 after HI injury was examined following central administration of 3H-IGF-1. The mode of action of IGF-1 on brain rescue was studied by comparing the treatment effects of IGF-1, IGF-2, des-N-(1-3)IGF-1 (des-IGF-1), insulin, N-terminal tripeptide of IGF-1 (GPE) and (+)-5-Methy1-10,11-dihydro-1H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclo-hepten-5,10-iminemaleare (MK801). IGF-1 reduced cortical infarction and neuronal loss when given after, but not before, an HI insult in a dose dependent manner. HI brain injury enhanced the penetration of IGF-1 into the brain parenchyma after ICV administration possibly via perivascular pathways and white matter tracks. The effective dose of IGF-I did not alter cortical temperature and serum glucose concentration. Insulin did not alter the outcome at an equimolar dose to IGF-1. The treatment effect of des-IGF-1 was only found at a higher dose. IGF-2 counteracted the treatment effects of IGF-1 on neuronal rescue and tissue uptake of 3H-IGF-1. An equimolar dose of GPE showed a similar response to IGF-1. MK801, an N-methy1-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist did not show significant effect in this model. In summary, IGF-1 was neuroprotective after HI brain injury. The effect of IGF-1 on neuronal rescue depends on the dose and time of delivery. The treatment effect of IGF-1 was independent of hypoglycaemia and hypothermia. The results suggest that this effect is mediated via type one IGF receptors. Distinctive treatment effects by des-IGF-1 and IGF-2 suggested a critical role for IGFBPs on neuronal rescue with IGF-1. A secondary mode of IGF-I action on brain rescue could be through the proteolytic production of GPE. In summary, IGF-1 can improve neuronal outcome in vivo suggesting possible clinic application as a therapeutic agent.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3116</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The physiology of circulating insulin-like growth factor binding proteins: studies in the sheep</field><field name="creator">Gallaher, Brian William</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321019 Paediatrics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3098</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Respiratory sensation in asthmatic subjects and matched controls</field><field name="creator">Gaeta, Helen</field><field name="description">Asthmatics most "at risk of death" from their asthma are those that have severe asthma with a history of severe life threatening attacks (SLTAs). Some asthmatics are poor perceivers of the severity of their asthma. It is not known whether these two groups form a homogeneous population. The aim of this thesis was to establish whether this was the case by comparing the sensitivity of asthmatics classified as severe with a history of severe life threatening attacks, asthmatics without a history of SLTAs, mild and moderate asthmatics, and matched controls to externally added resistive loads during inspiration. It also aimed to establish whether poor sensitivity to externally added resistive loads during inspiration was associated with diminished amplitude or increased latency of scalp potentials evoked by inspiratory occlusion. Two studies were conducted to meet the first aim. The first study tested the applicability of the equal variance normal-normal model of signal detection theory as a descriptor of subjects' performance when discriminating between different levels of externally added resistive loads during inspiration. Twelve subjects rated their capacity to distinguish between pairs of resistive loads ranging from 2-33cmH2O/L/s presented during a single inspiration. Data were collected for 100, 200 and 300 single breath trials. The results showed that the model fitted the data well; that 200 trials provided performance indices that were sufficiently precise to distinguish between relatively low, average and high levels of sensitivity; and that, for the modality tested, respiratory sensation complied with Weber&#8217;s Law. The second study applied the validated procedure to test the ability of 25 asthmatics classified either as severe, or mild or moderate, and 25 matched controls to distinguish between pairs of external resistive loads ranging from 2-33cmH2O/L/s presented during a single inspiration. Analysis of the data (ANOVA) showed that there were no significant differences in the ability of subjects to distinguish between resistive loads regardless of whether they were severe asthmatics with or without a history of SLTAs, mild or moderate asthmatics, or matched controls. It was concluded that asthmatics with poor sensitivity to the respiratory sensation tested and asthmatics most "at risk of death" from their asthma were not a homogeneous group, but poor sensitivity coupled with severe asthma, and a history of SLTAs most likely increased the risk of death to that patient. Four studies were conducted to meet the second aim. The first three studies were concerned with determining the reproducibilty of the scalp potential evoked by inspiratory occlusion (designated respiratory event related evoked potentials, RREP) and establishing a reliable recording protocol for the RREP that was relatively free of artefact. The results showed that the RREP was relatively stable over time and the best recording sites were cephalic electrode pairs C3-Cz and C4-Cz (10-20 International System). The fourth study examined the relationship between the ability of 25 asthmatic subjects and their matched controls to distinguish between levels of resistive loads added to inspiration and the latencies and amplitudes of the first positive and first negative components of the RREP. Correlation analysis showed that there was no relationship between sensitivity to added resistive loads during inspiration and RREP component parameters. It was concluded that diminution or absence of the early components of the RREP was not indicative of impaired perception of respiratory sensation though some issues regarding the appropriateness of the analysis still require resolution.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320600 Medical Physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3100</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Collagen fibres, force and intracellular calcium in rat cardiac trabeculae</field><field name="creator">Hanley, Peter John</field><field name="description">A thin cardiac muscle preparation of rat (ventricular trabeculae) was used in the two studies described in this Thesis. First, I investigated the mechanisms by which volatile anaesthetics decrease cardiac contractility using trabeculae loaded with a fluorescent Ca2+ indicator. Second, I employed confocal laser scanning microscopy to determine the three-dimensional microstructure of perimysial collagen fibres over the range of sarcomere lengths (1.9 - 2.3 &#181;m) in which passive force increases steeply. The volatile anaesthetics halothane (0.23 &#8211; 3 %) and isoflurane (0.48 - 4%) produced dose-dependent decreases in the amplitudes of the intracellular Ca2+ transients and twitch force. They also produced changes in cellular autofluorescence, consistent with an increase in the concentration of the reduced forms of nicotinamide adenine nucleotides and flavoproteins. When the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator signals were corrected for changes in cellular autofluorescence, the volatile anaesthetics did not significantly change diastolic [Ca2+]. In the presence of halothane or isoflurane, restoration of Ca2+ transients to control levels, achieved by elevation of external [Ca2+], did not restore peak force. Moreover, maximal Ca2+-activated force, elicited using ryanodine tetani, was reduced by halothane and isoflurane. Thus, the negative inotropic actions of halothane and isoflurane in cardiac muscle reflect both reduced availability of Ca2+ and decreased responsiveness of the contractile system to Ca2+. Reconstructed three-dimensional images showed that perimysial collagen fibres are wavy (as distinct from coiled) cords which straighten considerably as sarcomere length is increased from ~1.85 &#181;m (near-resting length) to ~2.3 &#181;m. These observations are consistent with the notion that the straightening of these fibres is responsible for limiting cardiac sarcomere length to ~2.3 &#181;m.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320600 Medical Physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3102</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the projections of the superior cerebellar peduncle and the rubrothalamic and nigrothalamic projections in the rat, and their relevance to the homologies of the anterior parts of the ventral nucleus of the thalamus in the mammalian brain</field><field name="creator">Faull, Richard Lewis Maxwell</field><field name="description">Since there has been no detailed study of the projections of the superior cerebellar peduncle (S.C.P.) with the most recently developed silver impregnation technique - the Fink-Heimer method - such a study has been carried out in the albino rat following complete unilateral destruction of the S.C.P. In order to assist with the interpretation of the thalamic terminations of the S.C.P., studies have also been made of the thalamic projections of the red nucleus and substantia nigra. The results are based on experiments in 56 animals: 22 for the investigation of the Projections of the S.C.P., 12 for the investigation of the rubrothalamic projections, and 22 for the investigation of the nigrothalamic projections. Oblique electrode approaches were devised which enabled the placement of discrete peduncular, rubral or nigral lesions with only the minimum of incidental damage to the surrounding Structures. The rubrothalamic projections were studied by the method of successive degeneration. The animals were generally killed after a survival period of 5 to 7 days and the axon degeneration was demonstrated with the Fink-Heimer silver impregnation technique. To analyse and record the experimental results, the patterns of degeneration were identified with the light microscope and meticulously plotted on diagrams of the brain using a projection system. To gain the fullest possible picture of the fibre projections, experimental material was analysed in coronal, sagittal and horizontal planes. The principal results of this investigation in the rat are as follows: (i) The confirmation of Ramon y Cajal&#8217;s (1903) original description that the fibres in the S.C.P. project caudally via ipsilateral and contralateral descending pathways to the pons and medulla and rostrally via a contralateral ascending pathway to the midbrain and diencephalon. (ii) The demonstration: (a) that the ipsilateral descending pathway terminates in the parvocellular reticular formation of the pons and medulla; (b) that the contralateral descending pathway terminates topically in the nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis, the pontine nuclei and the inferior olive, and also in the magnocellular nuclei of the reticular formation and the nucleus reticularis paramedianus;(c) that the contralateral ascending pathway terminates mainly in the red nucleus in the midbrain and throughout the Vm-V1 complex of the thalamus, and also in various other midbrain, subthalamic and thalamic nuclei. (iii) The demonstration: (a) that the cells of the red nucleus project to the Vm-Vl complex; (b) that the substantia nigra projects by a dorsal tegmental route to Vm and to adjacent parts of the V1 complex in the thalamus, and that the pars compacta of the substantia nigra projects to the striatum. (iv) The identification of the Vm-V1 complex as the homologue in the rat thalamus of the nuclei ventralis lateralis et anterior thalami of the higher primates on the basis of the distribution of cerebellar, rubral and nigral afferents to these nuclei.</field><field name="date">1975</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3103</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The potential cancer preventative properties of sweetpotato anthocyanin-rich polyphenolic complex</field><field name="creator">Asadi, Khalid</field><field name="description">Anthocyanins are a widespread source of naturally occurring colorants distributed in fruits, vegetables, and beverages such as red wine.

Reproductive efficiency is a major component of this objective. With the use of cryopreserved semen and artificial insemination, bull fertility is a large factor in herd reproduction. General semen characteristics such as volume, sperm concentration, sperm motility and sperm morphology characteristics are classic methods of assessing fertility. For over 50 years, scientists have attempted to correlate normal sperm morphology with male fertility. Confounding reports as to this correlation may be due to the variability associated with the methods used to determine normal morphology. Due to subjectivity and variability, development of objective and consistent analysis methods receive considerable attention. One subjective method is computer assisted sperm head morphometry analysis (ASMA). Precise and objective sperm head size and shape can be quantified using ASMA. The objectives of this dissertation were to 1) develop processing and analysis methods for the accurate quantification of bull sperm heads, 2) assess the inherent instrument, sample and observer variability associated with the analysis of bull sperm heads and, ultimately, 3) quantify the effects of cryopreservation on bull sperm head size and shape and 4) determine the relationship of sperm-head morphometry and post-thaw fertility of cryopreserved bull semen. A standard semen sample dilution, sperm staining method and microscope magnification level improved the instrument performance in assessing bull sperm head morphometry. There were no significant replication or observer effects detected on sperm head measurements. The heads of bull spermatozoa did show a significant decrease in dimensions after cryopreservation, indicating an effect among all bulls. Furthermore, in a subsequent study, no significant differences between pre-freeze and post-thaw sperm head measurements of two groups of bulls with high and low non-return to oestrus rates were detected. However, the change in sperm head width/length pre-freeze and post-thaw was weakly correlated with the post-thaw fertility among bulls. These results indicate that when standard methods of sample preparation and analysis are used, ASMA is an objective method of analysing bull sperm head dimensions. Measurements provided by the ASMA system show that uniform results are acquired among different observers. A single analysis of one slide, analysing 100 sperm heads, provides precise information regarding the sample. Because sperm head dimensions are affected by cryopreservation, samples of fresh semen will have to be utilised in future studies to determine whether differences in sperm head morphometry are detectable between fertile and subfertile bulls and to quantify the dimensions of spermatozoa of fertile bulls. Furthermore, pre-freeze measurements of morphometry do not appear to be correlated with post-thaw fertility of cryopreserved bull semen, based on non-return to oestrus rates.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3124</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dynamic expression patterns of major lens membrane proteins</field><field name="creator">Grey, Angus Cheverton</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320600 Medical Physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3108</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship of structure to function of the superantigen Staphylococcal enterotoxin A</field><field name="creator">Hudson, Keith R</field><field name="description">The relationship of structure to function in the superantigens of Staphylococcus aureus 1 Enterotoxins were isolated from expression in E. coli using the pGeX vector. Yields of up to 20 mg/litre of culture of purified toxin were achieved. 2 Recombinant SEA, SEB, SED and SEE produced by this system were identical to the wild type enterotoxins by several biological and biochemical criteria. 3 The unique T-cell receptor binding site of SEA and SEE was identified by the use of a panel of hybrids between these two toxins. Four different assays showed that the different V&#946; specificity of these toxins was determined by G200, S206 and N207 in SEA and at P206 and D207 in SEE. 4 Residues on both SEA and HLA-DR were identified that directly interact upon binding, thus defining the MHC class II binding site of SEA. The requirement of zinc for SEA binding to HLA-DR allowed the identification of the MHC class II binding site on SEA. This requirement was shown to be due to zinc bridging between these proteins. The zinc binding residues in SEA were demonstrated to be H187, H225 and D227. 5 Histidine 81 in the &#946;-chain of HLA-DR1 was shown to be the fourth residue in the tetravalent coordination of zinc. 6 This investigation in conjunction with the crystal structure of SEB and other mutational studies has collectively identified the T-cell receptor binding site of the enterotoxins. This study also located the MHC class II binding site of SEA and on the crystal structure of SEB the zinc coordinating residues cluster together, well separated from the T-cell receptor binding site. Thus proving that these superantigens cross link the T-cell receptor and MHC class II antigen. 7 The location of the zinc coordinating residues together with the crystal structures of SEB and HLA-DR1 allowed the construction of a structural model of how SEA binds to HLA-DR1. This model predicts that SEA binds across the end of the peptide groove and significantly that the orientation of the T-cell receptor in the recognition of the SEA-MHC class II complex is different to the orientation used to recognise peptide-MHC. This non conventional recognition of superantigen is compatible with the influence of polymorphism in both the T-cell receptor and MHC class II on superantigen recognition.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3120</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of metabolic insult on amino acids in the ciliary epithelium, lens, and retina</field><field name="creator">Hu, Guo Min</field><field name="description">Ischaemic insult deprives ocular tissue of oxygen and essential metabolites leading to anatomical and functional changes. One way to gauge the effect of ocular ischaemia is to determine changes in amino acids likely to be modified due to the intricate interrelationship between cellular metabolism and these compounds. Such an approach, using quantitative silver-intensified immunogold detection of a range of immunoglobulins, can provide a metabolic profile of cells (metabolome). Despite the known alterations in the ciliary epithelium and lens function secondary to ocular ischaemia, little is know about the metabolic profile in both normal ocular tissue and in ocular tissue exposed to metabolic insult. The major goal of this thesis was to investigate the metabolome of the ciliary epithelium and lens under normal and ischaemic conditions, in parallel to that of the retina, with complete spatial and single cell resolution. The results showed that a glutamate/glutamine cycle exists between the ciliary epithelium and lens, in analogy to the metabolic relationship between neurons and glia in the retina. with the localisation of glutamine synthetase and glutamate transporters, amino acids including glutamate and glutamine accumulate in the ciliary epithelium for secretion, so that lens amino acid levels can be sustained. Experimental manipulations reported in this thesis include enzyme inhibition and exposure to acute ischaemia, both leading to fluctuations of the amino acid levels/distributions in the ciliary epithelium and retina, and changes in amino acids associated with cellular metabolism. In the ischaemia/reperfusion experiments, despite recovery of anatomical features, there were persistent metabolic changes in the ciliary epithelium after four days reperfusion, which results in lower amino acids both in the ciliary epithelium and lens. Further, studies of glutamate transporters led to the discovery of a unique mechanism of glutamate release involving the cystine-glutamate transporter at the photoreceptor ribbon complex. In conclusion, the results offer a parsimonious explanation for the common association of altered ciliary body function and cataract secondary to ischaemic insult and provide evidence for highly conserved amino acid metabolic pathways within ocular tissues.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320900 Optometry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3097</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chronic hepatitis B virus infection in Polynesians</field><field name="creator">Abbott, William</field><field name="description">Genetic differences between Polynesians and Europeans may contribute to the many differences in disease frequency that occur between these races. This thesis describes studies that were designed to determine if genetic influences contribute to the high prevalence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in Polynesians. Alleles suitable for gene flow measurements were identified and used to find associations between European genes and indices of chronic HBV infection in Polynesians. An ecologic study found a negative association between European genes and the prevalence of chronic HBV infection in five Polynesian ethnic groups (p&lt;0.05). In a case control study, there was a positive correlation (r=0.90, p=0.04) between the percent of European genes in a Polynesian ethnic group and the difference in the percent of European genes between the HBV carriers and the anti-HBs positive controls in that ethnic group. Thus, the possibility that genetic factors are a major cause of the high prevalence of chronic HBV infection in Polynesians cannot be excluded. A twin study or candidate gene studies will be necessary to take this work further. We attempted to identify candidate genes in the Tcr &#946; chain variable region (V &#946;)locus that might contain polymorphisms that influence the human in vivo immune response to the HBV. V&#946;7.4 was associated with the immune response to a vaccine containing recombinant HBsAg in two separate studies (p&lt;0.0001 and p=0.05). The frequency of.V&#946;7.4 was low in the cord blood of neonates born to HBsAg positive mothers (p=0.001). The frequency of V&#946;5.1 was high in the cord blood of neonates of HBeAg positive mothers (p&lt;0.001). Thus the V&#946;7.4 and V&#946;5.1 genes may be preferentially used in the human immune response to the HBV and may be an appropriate place to seek polymorphisms that influence the immune response to the HBV and susceptibility to a chronic HBV infection.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3109</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dynamic chondron function in articular cartilage</field><field name="creator">Hing, Wayne Anthony</field><field name="description">This study examined the behaviour of articular cartilage chondrocytes and the role of the pericellular microenvironment in modifying cellular behaviour during dynamic loading events. While the structural composition and metabolic function of the chondron have been examined previously, little is known about its physiology. Consequently, it was hypothesised that 'the chondrocyte behaves dynamically within the chondron microenvironment, and that the microenvironment plays a critical role in minimising the volume regulatory activity required to maintain the health of the chondrocyte throughout the physicochemical changes associated with the loading cycle.&#8217; Four research objectives addressed the hypothesis. The first was to develop an environmental perfusion chamber and experimental protocols for dynamic imaging of articular chondrocytes in vitro and ex vivo using time-lapse video microscopy. The system developed, which was composed of a chamber and unique complimentary heating system, enabled temperature control, media perfusion and variable delivery of environmental factors, over long imaging periods without fluctuations in focus or loss of cell viability. Secondly was to examine short and long term behaviour of chondrocytes cultured in agarose gel, alginate beads and vibratome prepared explants. The results showed dynamic activity of cytoplasmic organelles, constant changes in position of the chondrocyte within the microenvironment and cellular secretory events that influenced its organisation. Unique information regarding these biological responses will be vital for future research. Thirdly was to examine the role of the microenvironment and its territorial and interterritorial matrices in volume regulation of intact tissue. The microenvironment occupies a critical position between the bulk of the cartilage matrix involved in load bearing deformation and physical changes and the chondrocyte, which attempts to minimise its volume regulatory response while maintaining active metabolic management of the matrices. Fourthly was to examine the role of the microenvironment in volume regulation isolated chondrocytes. Its robust structure appears responsible for physical and chemical protection of the chondrocyte. This study provided the first evidence that the microenvironment can influence the volume regulatory response of the chondrocyte. The composition and integrity of the microenvironment influence the ability of the chondrocyte to respond to osmotic challenge and the intact microenvironment functions efficiently in vivo to minimize the exposure of the chondrocyte to dynamic osmotic challenges that could compromise function.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3121</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring the nexus of loneliness, stigma, health complaints, and primary medical care in older New Zealanders</field><field name="creator">Hector-Taylor, Loma Helen</field><field name="description">The nexus or linkages between loneliness, stigma, health complaints, and primary medical care in older New Zealanders was explored from a social constructionist perspective. The intent of the studies was the support and explanation of the underlying arguments of the thesis. For this age group loneliness is a clinical condition which merits greater recognition, diagnosis, and treatment from general practitioners than it presently receives. As a society we silence and stigmatise loneliness in our senior citizens making it likely that they will present indirectly to their doctors when experiencing severe effects of the condition. This behaviour will increase their risk of inappropriate medical intervention at possible cost to themselves and to society. A cross sectional, randomly selected survey of 300 New Zealanders over 60 years old, aimed to establish the patterns of loneliness in the sample using quantitative analysis. The second qualitative study used the methodology of discourse analysis to identify the themes concerning loneliness and medical care in the accounts of older adults, and how these were used. Fourteen people, deemed by their doctors to be lonely and to need frequent medical care, were interviewed in order to further knowledge of the dynamics of loneliness and the medical encounter. Fifteen percent of the sample of 300 had moderate to severe loneliness scores. The sociodemographic indicators of loneliness were extremely easy for a practitioner to recognize. Less than 2% of the total of self reported doctor visits were explicitly for loneliness. According to Barsky's (1981) model, the most likely pathways to the doctor were through symptom amplification and lowered self ratings of health, with a less likely pathway through focusing on and worrying about symptoms, leading to perceived need for medical care. The predictive variances in regressions of loneliness on all health outcomes, except for self reported visiting of more than one doctor for symptoms, were lower for chronic than for situational loneliness. The most important conclusions from the second study were the identification of three rhetorical strategies or "etcetera clauses" which provided a social prescription for the indirect presentation of loneliness by older people. Loneliness may be discussed with the doctor; if it affects your physical health; if you are consulting for another reason; and if the doctor picks it up. Also, the individual doctor defines loneliness as a worthy, or non-worthy, condition for consultation.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321021 Psychiatry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3119</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Child Immunisation: reactions and responses to New Zealand government policy 1920-1990</field><field name="creator">Day, Alison Suzanne</field><field name="description">My thesis has explored the history of child immunisation in New Zealand from a socio-medical perspective. The framework has been hinged around the actions and immunisation strategies of the Health Department over the period 1920 to 1990 and the responses of parents to those actions and strategies. One of the most important concepts considered was how the Health Department decided on and then implemented immunisation policy during the period. Health professionals played a significant role in the delivery of immunisation to children and have impacted on a number of policy changes. After World War Two, with an increase in the number of vaccines on offer, the specialised expertise of the World Health Organization and the Epidemiology Advisory Committee in policy determination became very influential. The responses to departmental immunisation policies by parents demonstrated a significant change during the period, although most apparent in the 1980s. From a situation of wariness (and perhaps indifference) in the 1920s and 1930s to almost total vaccine acceptance from the 1950s, the 1980s were, by contrast, illustrative of parental assertiveness especially concerning side-effects. The advent of feminism in the 1970s and the issues of informed consent in the mid-1980s assisted in raising levels of parental awareness in immunisation which continued into the 1990s. Ethnic and socio-economic background also contributed to different levels of acceptance of immunisation, which will be addressed. Opposition to immunisation tended to wax and wane during this period. Two groups were dominant, although at opposite ends of the time spectrum. Both were small but vocal in their views. Nevertheless, neither group made much impression on New Zealand parents, although they were both an irritant to the Health Department. Overseas experiences in immunisation were interwoven throughout my thesis to set the New Zealand events in an international context. The introduction of a particular vaccine was compared and contrasted with similar schemes elsewhere to give an appreciable understanding of New Zealand&#8217;s position. Vaccine controversies overseas were also examined to determine their influence in New Zealand. Immunisation policy has been shaped by a myriad of factors and influences from both inside and outside the country. There were extensive changes over the years in the way parents, health professionals and the Health Department perceived immunisation which will be examined in my thesis.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">immunisation</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::430000 History and Archaeology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3144</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experimental manipulation of fetal growth</field><field name="creator">Bloomfield, Francis Harry</field><field name="description">The experiments described in this thesis investigated the effects of low doses of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I on fetal growth and metabolism in normally growing and growth-restricted (IUGR) late-gestation ovine fetuses. Intra-amniotic and intravenous routes of administration were studied. The aim of the first experiment was to investigate the effects of daily intra-amniotic injections of IGF-I for l0 days to fetuses with IUGR induced by placental embolisation. Embolisation produced asymmetrical IUGR with moderately severe effects on the gut. Gut weight, gut wall thickness and crypt mitoses were reduced. Villus enterocytes in the ileum contained numerous vacuoles, suggesting either functional adaptation or delayed maturation. IGF-I treatment increased amniotic fluid IGF-I concentrations 5-fold, but decreased plasma concentrations. The effects of embolisation on the gut were reversed, except for the enterocyte vacuolation in the ileum which was more pronounced with IGF-I treatment. Fetal gut uptake of glutamine from the circulation was reduced in IGF-I treated animals, but uptake from amniotic fluid may have increased. Fetal liver and spleen size were reduced. The distribution of placentome types was also altered with IGF-I treatment. The aim of the second experiment was to investigate the clearance of 125I-IGF-I from amniotic fluid. The half-life of 125I-IGF-I in amniotic fluid was 24 hours. Significant amounts of 125I-IGF-I remained unbound for up to 144 hours in both amniotic fluid and plasma. The predominant binding protein in amniotic fluid was IGFBP-3, and the proportion of 125I-IGF-I that was bound in amniotic fluid was strongly correlated with relative levels of IGFBP-3. Uptake of intact 125I-IGF-I across the fetal gut was clearly demonstrated, and continued for at least 36 hours following injection. A preliminary pharmacokinetic model of intra-amniotic dosing with IGF-I is presented. The aim of the final experiment was to investigate the effects of a chronic intravenous infusion of a low dose of IGF-I to normally growing late-gestation fetuses. There were no effects of IGF-I treatment on fetal growth or metabolism. Five fetuses were found to be IUGR at post mortem due to the effects of facial eczema in the ewe. A post hoc analysis of the effects of intravenous IGF-I in IUGR fetuses was therefore performed. IGF-I treatment significantly increased growth rate of IUGR fetuses and increased fetal blood aminonitrogen levels. Mean placentome weight was increased and the distribution of placentome types was altered. IGF-I treatment of IUGR fetuses reduced fetal lactate production. There were no differences in measures of fetal body or organ size at post mortem. The data from these investigations into the experimental manipulation of fetal growth provide clear evidence of the reversal of some of the effects of established IUGR, demonstrate uptake of intact and free IGF-I across the fetal gut, and, for the first time, suggest that IGF-I may increase the rate of fetal growth in IUGR. Amniotic fluid is the most readily accessible fetal compartment. The experiments described in this thesis suggest that fetal supplementation with IGF-I via the amniotic route may be a feasible, efficacious and clinically applicable therapeutic stratagem for the IUGR fetus.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321019 Paediatrics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3112</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of proteins in the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland</field><field name="creator">Evans, John Jerram</field><field name="description">Ovine neurophysin was extracted from fresh-frozen whole pituitary glands using hydrochloric acid at pH 1.2-1.6. After salt precipitation neurophysin was separated from other extracted protein by gel-exclusion chromatography on Sephadex G.75. Ion exchange chromatography on CM-sephadex C.50 using acetate buffer in a pH gradient was employed to resolve the neurophysin fraction into three components. Contamination of the preparations by non-neurohypophysial hormones was investigated. Antibodies which were raised in rabbits against ovine and porcine neurophysin were observed to have reactivity with neurophysins of the same and different species as the source of the antigen. Soluble proteins in the neural lobes of a number of mammals were separated by electrophoresis on starch-gel and tested, by immunodiffusion, for immunological reactivity with an anti-porcine neurophysin-II serum. A number of proteins, sometimes more than three per animal, reacted positively with the antiserum. Immunofluorescence histochemistry was used to demonstrate neurophysin-like antigen in tissue slices. Initially tissue was frozen unfixed and sectioned in a cryostat prior to fixation in 95% (v/v) aqueous ethanol. subsequently an improved method was developed in which tissues were fixed in saline-formalin and embedded in paraffin and immunohistochemistry carried out on deparaffinised sections. Immunofluorescence on tissue fixed in saline formalin was more intense and cells were resolved more sharply than on slices of fresh-frozen tissue. Neurophysin antigen was observed in the magnocellular nuclei of adult rats, guinea-pigs and rabbits and also in accessory cell groups in the hypothalamus. Material reactive against anti-neurophysin sera was also present in the neurohypophysis. Furthermore, neurophysin-like material was demonstrated in axons of the hypothalamo-neurohypophysial fibre tracts, especially in guinea-pig tissue slices. Immunoreactive material in axons was more abundant in tissue from dehydrated guinea-pigs. Neurophysin-like antigen, as detected by immunodiffusion and immunofluorescence was depleted in the neural lobes of dehydrated rate. Staining by aldehyde fuchsin showed that dehydration also caused a reduction in neurosecretory material in rat neurohypophyses. In the guinea-pig neurohypophysis, neurosecretory material was observed to have a lobular distribution whereas immunofluorescence was lobular on frozen sections but of even intensity on paraffin sections. Dehydration caused a depletion of histochemically-detected material in the guinea-pig neural lobe. Immunofluorescence histochemistry enabled detection of neurophysin antigen in rat hypothalami at 17 days gestational age. Fetal calves of 130 days and rabbits of 29 days gestation were also seen to have immunoreactive material in the hypothalamus and neural lobe. Evidence for modification of neurophysin-like material in the perikaryon or in proximal parts of the axona of the guinea-pig hypothalamo-neurohypophysial system was obtained by observing the effects of different treatments of HNS tissue blocks and slices on histological stains. Elements of the hypothalamo-neurohypophysial system which were stained by immunofluorescence were not always stained by aldehyde fuchsin dye.</field><field name="date">1975</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3115</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Community-based strategies to address youth suicide: development, implementation and formative evaluation</field><field name="creator">Coggan, Ann Carolyn</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the Youth Suicide Prevention Project, the aims of which were to develop, implement, and evaluate community-based strategies to address youth suicide. The focus of the evaluation was formative and was designed to constructively influence all the components of the project. The overall goal of the project was to provide information likely to improve the health and wellbeing of young people and thereby contribute, in the long term, to a reduction in youth suicide. This project, which was undertaken by Ms Coggan over a period of 26 months, involved collaboration with the Mental Health Foundation, and included the participation of community groups and young people. While several community-based strategies to address youth suicide were developed and implemented as part of this project, only three were central components of the Youth Suicide Prevention Project. The first strategy involved the use of a questionnaire designed to obtain information on the range and level of risk-taking behaviours occurring among young people and their perceptions of health-harming activities. The information obtained both assisted a local community to develop strategies to enhance the health and wellbeing of its young people and provided information to policy-makers on the extent of risk-taking behaviour and its association with self-harm. The second community-based strategy was the development and trialing of a teaching resource for use in forms three and four. This resource (Mental Health Matters) was designed to provide students with an opportunity to acquire information and skills to better promote and protect their mental health. The final strategy involved the conduct of a community action programme focused exclusively on youth health. Included in this programme was the provision and dissemination of local information on youth health and the conduct of three workshops: i) developing a mentally healthy school; ii) improving the identification, referral and acute management of suicidal young people; and iii) a community activation workshop designed to allow a community to prioritise strategies to improve youth health. Four aspects of formative input to the Youth Suicide Prevention Project are reported in this thesis: the developmental phase, the Youth Health and Risk-taking Survey, the Mental Health Matters programme, and the Youth Health Community Action Programme. This has involved the review of literature; the use of archival data and records; attendance at meetings; participant observation; the identification of evaluation procedures and methods; the design of data collection techniques; qualitative and quantitative data analyses including consultation with a statistician; and report preparation and timely dissemination both to the participants and to the wider community. The main findings of this evaluation indicated: that adopting a range of 15-24 years for youth was not realistic; that the occurrence of youth suicide and attempted suicide was spread evenly within the North Health region; that young people and school personnel saw a need for health promotion strategies to be developed; that young people identified a need for information on how to help themselves and others in times of crisis; that young people at school would provide information on a range of risk-taking activities; that high levels of risk-taking were occurring among young people at school; that an association exists between certain risk-taking behaviour and self-harm; that the provision of local information on youth risk-taking behaviour could act as a stimulus for the development of community-based strategies to address these; that a curriculum based programme with a positive focus on mental health should, with modification, be implemented nationally; that there is a need for the wider community to have information to dispel the myths surrounding suicide and suicide ideation; and that it is possible to successfully conduct a community action project exclusively focused on the health needs of young people. Major implications identified for future projects were the importance of providing relevant and local data to enable a community to develop strategies to address youth health issues and the need to further examine the high levels of risk-taking behaviours and the association of risk-taking behaviour and self-harm. This project also showed that teachers and students supported the further development of a curriculum-based programme called Mental Health Matters. This project also highlighted the need for an ongoing process of interaction between the community and research-based knowledge to ensure that strategies, proposed by the community are able so be implemented. Finally, while there is a need to focus on youth at risk, this thesis has demonstrated a need to provide the wider community with information and resources to dispel all the myths that surround suicide and suicide ideation.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3099</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Radar/Gdf6a function during zebrafish (Danio rerio)embryogenesis</field><field name="creator">Hall, Christopher James</field><field name="description">In the early vertebrate embryo, the vascular system is one of the first organ systems to form. Recently it has become evident that the development of mature, functional vessels requires not only signals derived from the endothelium itself, but a set of additional molecules that are not necessarily endothelium-specific. In zebrafish and Xenopus embryos two such tissues that are believed to secrete modulators of blood vessel assembly are the hypochord and primitive gut endoderm (PGE). These tissues intimately border the major axial vasculature. Radar/Growth/differentiation factor 6a (Gdf6a) represents a signalling molecule belonging to the GDF5, 6, 7 subgroup of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-&#946;) superfamily. In the zebrafish, transcripts for radar are located in the hypochord, PGE and ventral tail mesenchyme (VTM), all tissues that border the developing axial blood vessels. This prompted an investigation into a potential role for this signalling bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) during the specification and assembly of the closely related vascular and haematopoietic systems in the zebrafish. Transient forced expression experiments confirmed an early ventralising activity for the Radar signal that resulted in the expansion of the haematopoietic/vascular compartment, known as the intermediate cell mass (ICM). However, a loss-of-function zebrafish model generated using morpholino technology demonstrated a critical requirement for this BMP signal in establishing the integrity of the axial blood vessels. Furthermore, this requirement was independent of the initial establishment of vascular patterning. Zebrafish embryos depleted of the Radar signal initiate a normal primitive circulation. However, soon after this commencement of normal flow, blood cells were observed to extravasate from the axial vasculature. Microangiography confirmed this leakage phenotype. Such an angiogenic/maturation role for Radar during vascular development was supported by a transgenic zebrafish line carrying an inducible copy of the radar gene. Homozygous transgenic embryos established a typical early circulation that became progressively restricted until no blood travelled throughout the entire embryonic tissue. In summary, the work presented in this thesis strongly suggests that Radar is involved in a signalling pathway required for establishing the integrity of the axial vessels during zebrafish development.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3101</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Renal blood flow in the conscious, unrestrained rat</field><field name="creator">Grady, Heather</field><field name="description">The aim of this project is to test the hypothesis that the rate of renal blood flow remains constant under normal physiological conditions. Methods were developed for long term studies of renal blood flow (using the Doppler flow probe) and blood pressure in the conscious unrestrained rat. Special care was taken to maintain and observe the rats under normal, physiological conditions. Since the Doppler flow probe measures blood velocity rather than flow, changes in renal arterial diameter will alter the output of the flow meter, even if flow is constant. In order to measure flow more accurately, chanqes in vessel diameter were prevented by a short length of silastic tubing inserted into the renal, ortery under the probe. Blood flow was expressed as a percentage of the maximal flow measured when the animal was completely relaxed. Using this preparation, renal blood flow was measured continuously under normal conditions in both the light and dark cycles. Studies were performed to assess the effects on renal blood flow of anaesthesia, surgery and stress, and to assess the effect on renal blood flow of blockade of the renal nerves. Renal blood flow was depressed approximately 50% by anaesthesia, due to the effects of the anaesthetic agent rather than the accompanying surgery. Renal blood flow did not fully recover for 3-4 days after anaesthesia with, or without surgery. Renal blood flow was depressed by stress, even though blood pressure was unchanged. A mild sudden auditory disturbance caused a transient 23% fall in renal blood flow. A continuous auditory disturbance, depressed renal blood flow by 16% for several minutes. Handling the rat resulted in a 33% fall in renal blood flow which lasted for over 30 minutes. When measured continuously, renal blood flow was found to vary considerably. When the rat was completely relaxed renal blood flow was highest (defined as 100%). Renal blood flow remained high when eating and drinking (79%), but fell when the rat became alert but completely still (74%). During general movement renal blood flow was low (73%) with flow lowest while grooming (64%). Flow was apparently related to the degree of alertness and to activity. The extent of variation of flow is such that the calculated mean daily value of renal blood flow was only 80% of the maximum flow observed during complete relaxation. The depression of renal blood flow seen during activity and disturbance was largely prevented during reversible blockade of the ipsilateral renal nerve, induced by slow infusion of xylocaine around the renal artery. It was completely abolished by bilateral renal nerve blockade with Xylocaine. The depressive effects of activity and disturbance on renal blood flow were restored an hour after the Xylocaine infusion ceased. These studies clearly show that renal nerve is involved in control of renal blood flow under physiological conditions. It is clear that renal blood flow varies markedly under normal physiological conditions and in response to the external environment. A constant renal blood flow is not a necessity for normal renal function.</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320600 Medical Physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3141</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Honey and venous leg ulceration: a systematic review &amp; randomised controlled trial</field><field name="creator">Jull, Andrew</field><field name="description">Aims: To investigate the effect of honey on wound healing by conducting [1] a systematic review of trials of honey in wound care and [2] a randomised controlled trial of honey-impregnated dressings for the treatment of venous leg ulcers (the HALT trial). Systematic review: Method - The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, AMED and LILACS were searched for controlled trials using honey for any type of patient with an acute or chronic wound. Honey manufacturers and researchers were contacted, citations scrutinised and the internet searched. Data from included studies were combined where studies were sufficiently alike. Findings - 18 trials were included. Honey significantly decreased healing time compared to conventional dressings for partial thickness burns (WMD -4.7 days, 95%Cl -5.1 to -4.3), but delayed healing time in comparison to early excision and skin grafting for mixed partial and deep thickness burns (WMD 25 days, 95%Cl 17.4 to 32.6). No significant effect was found for minor acute wounds or for honey compared to silver sulfadiazine in partial thickness burns. There were no trials of honey for treating venous leg ulcers. Randomised controlled trial: Method - The HALT trial was a pragmatic, open label randomised trial. Participants received either a manuka honey-impregnated calcium alginate dressing (n=187) or usual care (n=181) for 12weeks. Both groups received compression bandaging. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants with healed ulcers at 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes were time to healing, change in ulcer area, incidence of infection, adverse events, health-related quality of life and cost-effectiveness. Findings -104 participants in the honey-treated (55.6%) group and 90 (49.7%) in the usual care group healed at 12 weeks (absolute increase 5.9%, 95%Cl -4.3% to 15.7%, p=0.3). Time to healing was not significantly different between the groups (mean difference -1.8 days, 95%Cl -7.7 to 4.1, p=0.5), nor was change in ulcer area (mean difference 0.9cm2, 95%Cl -1.4cm2 to 3.2cm2, p=0.4)incidence of infection (absolute decrease 5.0%, 95%Cl -3.1% to 13.1%, p=0.2), ulcer recurrence (absolute increase 5.2%, 95%Cl -0.4% to 10.7%, p=0.1), or quality of life. The average cost of community-based treatment per participant was higher in the honey-treated group (NZ$862 versus NZ$795). More adverse events were reported in the honey-treated group (RR 1.3, 95%Cl 1.1 to 1.6, p=0.01). More participants reported pain as an adverse event when treated with honey (RR 2.5, 95%Cl 1.5 to 4.2, p=0.0001). Interpretation: Systematic review - Honey may be an effective treatment for partial thickness burns in comparison to conventional dressings. Honey does not appear to benefit healing in other acute wounds and may delay healing in mixed and partial thickness burns compared to excision and grafting. The HALT trial - Honey-impregnated dressings did not have any significant positive effect on venous ulcer healing and were more expensive than usual care. Participants treated with honey experienced more pain than control participants.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3132</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Isolation, characterisation and evolution of zebrafish (Danio rerio) bmp9, bmp10 and gdf11</field><field name="creator">Bland, Ross James</field><field name="description">Three members of the TGF&#946; superfamily, bmp9, bmp10 and gdf11 were isolated from zebrafish genomic and cDNA libraries to further elucidate the role of these genes during embryogenesis. Zebrafish bmp9 and bmp10 belong to the BMP9/10 subfamily. The level of sequence similarity between the zebrafish and mammalian BMP9/10 subfamily members prompted an investigation into the evolutionary relationships of the zebrafish genes. The orthology of bmp9 and bmp10 were examined by phylogenetic and syntenic analysis. Phylogenetic analysis grouped bmp9, DSLI, Bmp9 and BMP9 into a single clade and bmp10, Bmp10 and BMP10 into another. Zebrafish bmp9 and human BMP9 were mapped to linkage group 12 and chromosome 17, respectively, and share syntenic relationships with a number of other genes mapped onto these respective chromosomes. Zebrafish bmp10 and human BMP10 were mapped to linkage group 5 and chromosome 2, respectively, and share syntenic relationships with mcm6/MCM6 and pax8/PAX8. The phylogenetic and syntenic analyses support the orthology of bmp9 and bmp10 to human BMP9 and BMP10, respectively. The phylogenetic analysis also suggests that chick DSL1 is not a unique member of the TGF&#946; superfamily but is the chicken ortholog of BMP9/Bmp9. The expression patterns of bmp9 and bmp10 were analysed by RT-PCR, Northern analysis, and by whole mount in situ hybridisation. No specific expression pattern was detected for either bmp9 or bmp10 by whole mount in situ hybridisation, indicating the low expression levels of these genes. The lower than expected sequence similarity to the mammalian orthologs and the low level of expression suggest a lack of evolutionary pressure between subfamily members. Zebrafish Gdf11 shows a high level of amino acid identity over the length of the entire protein to mouse GDF11. Phylogenetic analysis grouped gdf11, Gdf11 and GDF11 into a single clade. Zebrafish gdf11 and human GDF11 were mapped to linkage group 11 and chromosome 12, respectively, and share syntenic relationships with atp5b/ATP5b, dspg3/DSPG3, hoxcb/HOXC, and plasticin/PRPH on LG11/Hsa12. The phylogenetic and syntenic analyses, therefore, support the orthology of gdf11 to human GDF11. The expression pattern of gdf11 was analysed by whole mount in situ hybridisation. Expression of gdf11 was detected in both the dorsal and vegetal tail bud progenitors and during segmentation stages, expression becomes restricted to the caudal-most chordamesoderm of the tail bud. During the pharyngula stage, dynamic expression of gdf11 was detected in neural structures including the ventral hindbrain, midbrain and the forebrain. Expression of gdf11 was absent in the tail bud of ntlb195 mutant embryos but present in neural structures, indicating that the expression of gdf11 is regulated by different factors in these tissues. The function of gdf11 was analysed by microinjection of synthetic gdf11 mRNA. Overexpression of gdf11, however, resulted in the severe dorsalisation of the embryo, probably due to activation of a Nodal specific pathway.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3133</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Microglial activation and inhibition: implications for neurodegeneration</field><field name="creator">Gibbons, Hannah Mary</field><field name="description">Accumulating evidence over the past 20 years has indicated that the brain has an endogenous immune system, mediated at the local level predominantly by microglial cells. The primary role of an inflammatory response is to protect the host against a foreign stimulus, remove damaged cells and to initiate repair and regeneration of damaged tissue. However, it has become increasingly evident that this inflammatory response, in addition to its role in host defence and repair, can exert detrimental effects in the central nervous system (CNS). Neuroinflammation, as this response is now commonly known, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative diseases. Microglia, the resident macrophage of the brain, play a central role in sustaining this inflammatory response through the release of proinflammatory and potentially cytotoxic mediators. Hypothermia is neuroprotective, and these properties are thought to be mediated, in part, by the suppression of microglial activation. The BV-2 microglial cell line was used to investigate the mechanisms involved in the activation and inhibition of microglia. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced activation of BV-2 cells led to the up-regulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, the release of inflammatory mediators such as nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin (PG)-E2, interleukin (IL)-6 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-&#945;, and a change to a phagocytic phenotype. This response was mediated by the initiation of signal transduction pathways that culminated in transcription and translation of the inflammatory genes. Hypothermia (33&#176;C) caused complete suppression of iNOS and NO whilst displaying little or no effect on IL-6 and TNF-&#945; respectively. In contrast, LPS-induced COX-2 expression and PGE2 release was super-induced in response to hypothermia. A co-culture model of neuroinflammation was developed to investigate microglial-neuronal interactions. LPS/interferon (IFN)-&#947; activated BV-2 cells required direct contact with SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells to elicit a cytotoxic phenotype. Hypothermia and the selective iNOS inhibitor S-methylisothiourea (S-MT) protected against this BV-2-induced SK-N-SH cell death, strongly implicating NO as the major candidate molecule in microglial-induced neuronal cell death. Thus, microglial activation sustains the chronic inflammatory response in the CNS and in doing so contributes to further neuronal death. Inhibition of the detrimental facets of microglial activation may provide some protection against neurodegeneration.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320500 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3135</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Insulin-like growth factors and their binding proteins in post-natal ruminants</field><field name="creator">Hodgkinson, Steven Charles</field><field name="description">Observations that IGF is produced and acts locally in multiple tissues raise important questions about the biological significance of the major pool of IGF present in the circulation. Does it represent a pool of endocrine IGF en route to the tissues or conversely growth factor produced in excess of autocrine/paracrine requirements undergoing elimination? The primary objective of this thesis was to examine the kinetics and distribution of circulating IGF in sheep with a view to determining tissue destinations and thereby potential functions of the blood borne hormone. The IGFBP play a central role in facilitating IGF action. Characterization studies of the IGFBP and an examination of their physiology and potential involvement in IGF transport are also important parts of this thesis. Such studies are necessary because potential therapeutic uses of IGF will depend on systemic administration and endocrine action. Early work involved structural/functional characterization of a batch of recombinant methionyl insulin-like growth factor-I (N-Met IGF-I) designated for this project. The peptide was heterogenous on reversed phase chromatography eluting as two major peaks of approximate abundance 1:2. These each had the amino acid constitution expected of N-Met IGF-I and were carefully characterized in a range of binding and biological assays. Whereas the early eluting peptide demonstrated much reduced activity in each assay system, the second peak proved equipotent to a highly purified ovine plasma IGF-I preparation and was chosen for the investigative work of this thesis. The early eluting peptide may represent a variant with mismatched disulphides. Initial characterization of IGF binding activity in ovine tissue fluids was performed by competitive IGF tracer binding techniques together with size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and IGF-I affinity chromatography. Binding proteins (BP) of &gt;200, 150 and 40-50 kDa were revealed in these studies and shown to be widely distributed in body fluids. Thus the &gt;200 kDa binding protein, which is IGF-II specific, was identified in adult sheep plasma, colostrum, follicular fluid and fetal sheep plasma, and may be the ovine equivalent of the soluble type 2 IGF receptor. A 150 kDa binding protein complex, of mixed specificity for IGF-I and II, was also identified. In addition to vascular fluids, the 150 kDa complex was identified in mammay lymph, follicular fluid and, as a minor component, in vitreous humor. Binding proteins of 40-50 kDa were revealed in every fluid tested and multiple variants identified with distinct specificities for the IGF peptides. The BP 'make-up' of fluids and of 150 kDa and 40-50 kDa pools isolated by preliminary SEC was latter examined by IGF ligand blot analysis. Analysis of plasma 150 kDa pools revealed only the characteristic doublet of IGFBP-3 at 40-43 kDa, whereas the 40-50 kDa pool was heterogeneous containing IGFBP-3 together with smaller bands of 35, 30 and 23 kDa which may be the ovine equivalents of IGFBP-2, BP-4 and possibly BP-1. In support of the tracer binding data, IGFBP-3 was also identified in mammary lymph as were the smaller species. In an extension of the in vitro IGF tracer binding/SEC approach, kinetics of IGF equilibration with plasma binding sites was examined. Binding was found to be time and temperature dependent, reversible, dose responsive and relatively specific for the IGF peptides. Observations of special interest include a biphasic pattern of IGF-I equilibration with plasma, consistent with formation of the ternary 150 kDa complex of IGFBP-3, IGF and ALS, and evidence of relatively slow dissociation of IGF/BP complexes, suggesting that if release of IGF is required for full expression of IGF bioactivity in vivo, then specific processes may be involved. Avidity of isolated IGFBP complexes for Con A and heparin affinity adsorbents was also examined. The data indicate that the IGFBP belong to a relatively select group of proteins with high affinity for the glycosaminoglycan heparin suggesting roles for these proteins at the level of the capillary endothelium and/or extra-cellular matrix. Metabolic clearance of IGF-I and II was examined following intravenous (iv) bolus injection of the growth factors as radioiodinated tracer preparations. Tracer administration was followed by a rapid initial phase of clearance associated with tracer mixing in the vascular pool followed by intermediate and longer phases which appear to be direct consequences of interaction with and between the BP and to some extent accumulation of tracer degradation products in the circulation. Metabolic clearance of tracer complexed to the major molecular weight pools of BP was examined following SEC of sequential plasma samples. Average half-lives for IGF-I and II complexed to the 150 KDa and 40-50 kDa pools of carrier protein were established (150 kDa; 545&#177;25 min, 325&#177;30 min; 40-50 kDa, 34&#177;2 min, 9.6&#177;1.8 min, (mean&#177;S.E.M., IGF-I and II respectively)) and compared to free IGF-I (t1/2 &lt;5 min). Rapid clearance of free compared to bound IGF illustrates the central role of the IGFBP in maintaining IGF in the circulation and controlling tissue distribution. Whereas binding of IGF-II to different BP at 40-50 kDa (eg. IGFBP-2) may explain its shorter half-life compared with IGF-I, evidence suggests that IGF-I and II bind to the same carrier at 150 kDa. The observed difference in half-life of the 150 kDa complex is therefore suggestive of different metabolic handling of the BP depending on which of the IGFs is bound. The more rapid clearance of IGF-II complexed to the 150 kDa and 40-50 kDa carriers compared to IGf-I contributed to a more rapid clearance overall and is reflected in calculated metabolic clearance rates for IGF-I and II (IGF-I, 3.9 ml/min; IGF-II, 7.8 ml/min). Considering plasma IGF-II is significantly higher than IGF-I in post-natal sheep, a substantially greater secretion rate for IGF-II would be required to maintain plasma IGF-II in the face of the greater clearance rate. The secretion rate for IGF-II was estimated at ~ 1.6 nmol/min in the current study, some 8-fold greater than IGF-I. Clearance of IGF-I from plasma was associated with the appearance of radioactivity in lymph. Chromatography indicated that tracer in lymph was not degraded but retained its BP activity eluting on SEC complexed to high molecular weight BP. The data illustrate that blood borne IGF is distributed into the extra vascular space and may therefore be available to the tissues. This contention is supported by observations that relatively little radioactivity (&lt;20% in the course of these experiments) was cleared from plasma into urine suggesting that plasma IGF is not principally an elimination form. Similarly no other significant sites of elimination were identified. Questions of how physiological control of the BP may influence tissue distribution of IGF were investigated in the next major experimental section of this thesis. In the first study the influence of nutritional manipulation and GH treatment of growing lambs on the molecular distribution of IGF immunoreactivity in plasma was examined using a new IGF-I RIA in conjunction with SEC and saturation analysis for the estimation of the BP. Total plasma IGF-I was found to increase with nutritional intake (P&lt;0.01) and with GH treatment (0.25 mg/kg body weight/d; P&lt;0.001) but only on the higher intakes. Molecular size fractionation revealed IGF-I immunoreactivity in 150 kDa and 40-50 kDa binding fractions. 150 kDa bound IGF-I was increased on the higher plane of nutrition(P&lt;0.05) and by GH treatment (P&lt;0.001) but again, only at higher levels of nutrition. By contrast no change in 40-50 kDa bound IGF-I was observed with treatment. Unbound IGF-I was also identified in sheep plasma (2-5% of total) but demonstrated only slight changes in relation to treatment. Saturation analysis was an analytical approach chosen to estimate total binding capacity (TBC) and relative saturation of the binding protein pools. Evidence suggests that in ovine plasma constituents of the 150 kDa complex are available in excess of endogenous IGF (P&lt;0.001). Relative saturation of this species did not change with treatment despite the observed differences in 150 kDa bound IGF-I. The data suggest that components of the 150 kDa complex were themselves responsive to treatment. By contrast large differences in saturation of the 40-50 kDa species were observed (P&lt;0.001) despite little treatment dependent change in bound IGF-I. Binding capacity of the 40-50 kDa fraction was elevated at low levels of nutrition and suppressed on the higher feed intake resulting in near saturation. The data indicate complex regulation of the IGFBP in sheep. IGF-I, elevated in response to higher nutritional intake and by CH treatment was mostly distributed into the 150 kDa complex; paradoxically the species which most effectively maintains IGF in the circulation. Thus in conditions presumably conducive with growth related processes (high GH, high nutrition) access of circulating IGF to the tissues is apparently most restricted. This evidence is difficult to reconcile with the view that 150kDa bound IGF represents a pool of endocrine IGF en route to tissue sites of action. Galactopoietic effects of GH in lactating ruminants appear to be exerted in the absence of a mammary GH receptor and are associated with increased plasma and mammary IGF-I content. Thus it has been proposed that blood borne IGF, acting in the classical endocrine fashion may be the mediator of GHs lactogenic effects. Consequently the lactating sheep surgically prepared by the catheterization of efferent mammary lymph may be a useful model for examining questions of IGF/BP physiology. In a further study, plasma and efferent mammary lymph concentrations of IGF-I were determined in lactating ewes before and after treatment with GH (10 mg/d) for 3 days. Analysis of paired plasma/lymph samples revealed that the capillary endothelium constitutes a barrier to the passage of macro molecules which reduces the concentration of IGF in lymph to ~ 35% plasma. A key observation from the current study was the GH dependence of mammary lymph IGF-I. Thus, GH was found to increase mammary lymph IGF-I concentrations by a proportionately greater amount than the increase in plasma IGF-I (P&lt;0.01). The increase in lymph IGF-I resulted from an increase in the concentration of IGF associated with both high molecular weight (150 kDa) and low molecular weight (40-50 kDa) binding fractions. However, the data indicate a proportionately greater increase in 40-50 kDa bound IGF-I in lymph compared with plasma suggesting that treatment either induces a selective redistribution of plasma 40-50 kDa IGF and BP into the mammary gland or, alternatively, treatment increases intra-mammary production of these factors. Ligand blot analysis of mammary lymph revealed IGFBP-3 and -2 as the major constituents of this fluid. IGFBP-2 declined in lymph with GH treatment whereas IGFBP-3 appeared to increase. Additionally, saturation analysis indicated that a substantial proportion of lymph IGFBP-3 was present in the 'free', uncomplexed form. Consequently observations that the total binding capacity (TBC) of the lymph 40-50 kDa fraction increased with treatment, would appear to result from an increase in IGFBP-3. Total binding capacity of the lymph 40-50 kDa binding fraction was found to increase by a proportionately greater amount that its plasma equivalent. Thus, if the lactogenic effects of GH are mediated by IGF distributed from blood into the mammary gland, the mechanism by which it is transferred would appear to involve BP of the 40-50 kDa pool and in particular IGFBP-3. In the final experimental section of this thesis a novel system was employed to examine tissue distribution and destinations of blood borne IGF-I. This involved intravenous infusion of the N-Met analog of IGF-I together with specific immunologic detection. For this an IGF antibody was employed which recognises the recombinant N-Met variant but demonstrates minimal cross-reactivity with any of a range of other IGF peptides including ovine plasma IGF-I and recombinant authentic sequence IGF-I. This antibody can therefore recognise the N-Met variant against a background of authentic endogenous IGF-I and was usefully applied to examining tissue destinations of the N-Met variant following iv infusion. Plasma N-Met IGF-I rose to plateau concentrations of ~150 ng/ml during iv infusion (Infusion rate, 8 &#181;g/kg/h). Analysis revealed the N-Met variant was distributed on plasma BP in much the same proportion as endogenous IGF. N-Met IGF-I immunoreactivity was identified in mammary lymph providing further evidence supporting the contention that blood borne IGF is distributed outside the vascular space. At the end of the infusion N-Met IGF-I was identified in all tissues examined contributing between 35% (in kidney) and 62% (spleen) to total IGF. Major differences in morphological distribution of blood derived (N-Met IGF) were revealed by autoradiography in post infusion tissue slices. Thus the N-Met IGF was found to contribute relatively little to total localizable IGF-I immunoreactivity in connective tissue elements of the samples examined (muscle and mammary) but, by contrast, blood derived (N-Met) IGF-I constituted ~85% of total IGF immunoreactivity in other tissues. In particular, these include the metabolically active regions of muscle and mammary (fibre and epithelium respectively). The evidence suggests therefore that fibre and epithelium may be targets for blood derived &#8216;endocrine' IGF. Differences in the abundance of blood derived IGF between tissues may relate to the accessibility (vascularization or capillary permeability) of specific tissues or, alternatively, to local rates of production and turnover of IGF in tissues. Thus the contribution of blood derived IGF to total localizable IGF may be expected to be less in tissues which actively synthesize IGF such as those in which autocrine/paracrine modes of IGF action are operative. Examples from the current study would be connective tissues of muscle and mammary. Conversely blood derived IGF would be expected to represent a greater proportion of total IGF in tissue targets for endocrine IGF. Support for the current data was obtained from IGF-I mRNA in situ hybridization studies performed on human fetal tissue (437). Stromal elements of muscle tissue (perimysium, epimysium) were identified as active sites of transcription as opposed to muscle fibre where message could not be detected. Thus the evidence suggests that the N-Met infusion model is a useful technique for delineating tissue targets for circulating (endocrine) IGF. It is now widely accepted that the primary actions of IGF on growth and development occur via autocrine/paracrine mechanisms close to its site of production. Nonetheless such arguments do not exclude the possibility of classical endocrine roles for the major pool of IGF present in the circulation. The primary thrust of this thesis has been to examine kinetics and tissue distribution of this pool of IGF. The data confirm the availability of blood borne IGF to extra vascular tissues and appear to indicate that it is distributed into the tissues on a selective basis and under physiological control. It may, therefore, be available to selected tissues to fill specific endocrine functions.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321019 Paediatrics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3104</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Paediatric bronchiectasis in Auckland, New Zealand : non-invasive screening for ciliary dysfunction and airway inflammation</field><field name="creator">Edwards, Elizabeth Anne</field><field name="description">Background: &#8216;Bronchiectasis&#8217; is usually a progressive disease defined as bronchial dilatation, with or without associated bronchial wall and lung parenchymal damage, and classically with pus in the bronchial lumen. There is no knowledge on the prevalence, aetiology, and severity of paediatric bronchiectasis in New Zealand. Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is an inherited disorder that can cause bronchiectasis and is characterised by specific structural ciliary abnormalities leading to impaired ciliary motility. It has been suggested that ciliary abnormalities may predispose Maori and Pacific Island people to bronchiectasis, but appropriate expertise and non-invasive technology to accurately investigate the condition has not been available in New Zealand. Additionally the exhaled gas nitric oxide (NO), a non-invasive marker of some types of airway inflammation, has been suggested as a useful screening test for PCD. The aims of this thesis were to: 1. Define the demographics, causes, and severity of the known paediatric bronchiectasis population of Auckland. 2. Establish a method for detecting primary and secondary ciliary dysfunction. 3. Explore non-invasive methods for differentiating primary and secondary ciliary disease. 4. Determine the prevalence of PCD in paediatric bronchiectasis in Auckland. Methods: Observations were made on children with bronchiectasis who attended the Starship Children's Hospital, and a cohort of healthy children recruited from local Auckland schools. A retrospective review of the demographics and radiology scores (CXR and HRCT scan) as a measure of disease severity was made. The results were compiled into a bronchiectasis database and a measure of socio-economic factors (NZDep96 index) was incorporated. Equipment was created for the photometric method of assessment of ciliary beat frequency (CBF). After piloting, 3prospective studies were undertaken to evaluate skin prick allergy tests, exhaled and nasal NO, lung function and a nasal brushing for assessment of CBF and ultrastructural analysis in the normal and diseased children. Results. The estimated prevalence of paediatric bronchiectasis in Auckland was ~2/10,000 and was disproportionately more common in the Pacific Island (6.3/10,000) and Maori children (2.8/10,000). Eighty eight percent of cases had bilateral disease, and 64% had 4 or more lobes involved. There was a wide range of presumed aetiologies but over half remained undiagnosed despite extensive investigation. The median duration of symptoms before diagnosis was 3.2 years, and a median of 4 respiratory admissions pre-diagnosis. The NZDep96 index suggested significant associated socio-economic deprivation. A non-invasive protocol to brush nasal epithelium and the technology to assess CBF was created and piloted. Ethnic normal values were established for NO and CBF for healthy European and Pacific Island children. Insufficient Maori children could be recruited. CBF and NO values were not low and comparable with frequencies reported internationally using similar methodologies. Exhaled NO levels did not differ significantly between the children with bronchiectasis and controls, or between the bronchiectatic children who were and were not prescribed inhaled steroids. However CBF and nasal NO were lower in the children with bronchiectasis than controls. The percentage of abnormal ciliary structural defects in the control children was 3 times higher than reported controls, with no difference across ethnic groups. Similar abnormalities were seen in the children with bronchiectasis. These abnormalities were central microtubule defects, tubular additions or deletions, and partial dynein arm defects. In the individual children with bronchiectasis who had low CBF and nasal NO, no single primary ciliary defect was identified to conclusively diagnose PCD. Conclusions: Paediatric bronchiectasis is common and severe in Auckland. New Zealand but the condition has been neglected in terms of recognition. It is hoped that the establishment of a bronchiectasis database for children will not only facilitate collaborative research but also act as a template for a national bronchiectasis database for New Zealand, which can be used to support applications for health resources and funding. Importantly the thesis has resulted in a non-invasive method for assessing ciliary structure and function that could be used to investigate New Zealand children and adults. A wide variety of ciliary abnormalities were found in the New Zealand children that were most likely secondary phenomena, and the incidence of PCD in the population examined, if present, is small. More work is needed to increase the ciliary structural and functional 'library' for New Zealand children, and particularly for Maori children who were under assessed in this work. The possibility of another vulnerability factor, as yet not identified, either of innate immunity or airway defences may still underlie the high prevalence of bronchiectasis in New Zealand.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3137</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Functional and structural analyses of an olfactory receptor from Drosophila melanogaster</field><field name="creator">Kiely, Aidan</field><field name="description">In insects, olfaction is mediated by a large family of integral membrane proteins, called olfactory receptors (ORs), that mediate the transduction of odorant binding into a neuronal signal. A functional assay for insect ORs was developed utilising calcium imaging in Sf9 cells. The Drosophila melanogaster OR, Or22a, was expressed using transient transfection, and its activity measured by monitoring increased intracellular calcium levels using a calcium&#8211;sensitive dye. The interaction of the odorants ethyl butyrate, pentyl acetate and ethyl acetate with Or22a were both dose&#8211;dependent and sensitive, with EC50 values of 1.53 x 10&#8722;11 M, 5.61 x 10&#8722;10 M and 3.72 x 10&#8722;9 M, respectively. Furthermore, Or22a expressed in Sf9 cells has a similar response profile to a range of odorants previously tested in vivo. This assay system will provide a useful tool for the investigation of insect olfactory receptor structure and function. A consensus of eleven transmembrane (TM) domain prediction algorithms suggested a model for Or22a that contains seven TM domains, reminiscent of GPCRs. To test this model empirically, the membrane topology of Or22a was determined using epitope&#8211;tagging of predicted loops followed by immunochemistry. These experiments revealed that Or22a has seven TM domains but that its orientation in the membrane is opposite to that of GPCRs, having a cytoplasmic N&#8211;terminus. This orientation was also observed for Epiphyas postvittana Or1, which suggests that this inverted topology may be common to all insect ORs. To test whether Or22a forms higher order structures, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between cyan and yellow fluorescent proteins inserted into the intracellular loops of Or22a was employed. The third intracellular loop interacts strongly with itself in homo&#8211;multimers, with interactions between the first and first loops and first and third loops also observed. These experiments show that ligand binding ORs can form multimeric structures in heterologous cells. The co&#8211;transfection of Or83b into S2 cells had no impact on these interactions, however Or83b is likely expressed in this cell line. Finally, models of how a ligand binding OR interacts physically with the ion channel Or83b are presented, and approaches that could be used to distinguish between these models are discussed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology::270505 Entomology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3342</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Expression and activity of enzymes in the human placenta: pharmacological &amp; toxicological consequences in AZT therapy</field><field name="creator">Collier, Abby Cherise</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis was to study xenobiotic metabolising enzymes (XME) in the human placenta, in particular the uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferases' (UGTs) role in the metabolism, transfer and disposition of the drug AZT, and to develop the human placental perfusion model into the first trimester. UGT, &#946;-glucuronidase, Cytochrome p4501A (CYPIA) and CYP reductase were present and active in the human placenta. CYP2E1 protein was expressed but not active. CYPIA, CYP2EI and the UGT2B subfamily were expressed across gestation, but the UGTIA subfamily was only expressed in first trimester placentas. The localisation of XME (the syncytiotrophoblast layer bordering the placental villi) did not change with gestation but enzyme activity and affinity did. Greater activify but lower affinity of UGT and CYPIA were observed in first trimester placentas than at term. In contrast, &#946;-glucuronidase had a high affinity, low activity profile in early gestation but the opposite at term. UGT and CYPIA activities in the first trimester placenta were induced by maternal cigarette smoking and may be synergistically induced by combined alcohol consumption and smoking. A significant correlation with higher UGT activity and earlier gestational age was observed. CYPIA exhibited a significant, negative correlation with maternal age across gestation. Maternal variables had no effect on &#946;-glucuronidase and their effects on the activity of CYP2EI and CYP reductase were not established. AZT caused apoptosis in the placenta and also increased reactive oxygen species and altered XME. The absence of serum enhanced these effects. Alterations in XME expression and activities included a decrease in UGT activity and increases in CYPIA, &#946;-glucuronidase, CYP reductase and glutathione-&#1029;-transferase activity in response to AZT exposure. AZT transport in a perfusion model was bi-directional and reached equilibrium approximately 3 h after addition of AZT into the maternal reservoir. In contrast, transfer of AZT glucuronide (AZT-G) showed significantly greater transport rates out of the fetal compartment resulting in AZT-G concentrations approximately 2-fold higher in the maternal circuit. Transfer of the co-factor UDPGA was significantly greater in the fetal direction and almost complete after 4h of perfusion. The low levels of glucuronidation of AZT catalysed by the human placenta (approximately 2% of a dose) are not due to insufficient transport of the co-factor UDPGA and are unlikely to be significant in terms of maternal whole-body clearance. Therapeutic failure of AZT in protecting the fetus is unlikely to be due to metabolism and clearance performed by the placenta but may be due to placental cytotoxicity. The development of the perfusion model into the first trimester placenta is technically achievable, but was impossible with the tissue available for these studies due to the method used to obtain placentas.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320500 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3138</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The prevalence, natural history, and determinants of non-synostotic plagiocephaly and brachycephaly in infants</field><field name="creator">Hutchison, Barbara Lynne</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321019 Paediatrics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3122</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Does District Planning under the Resource Management Act 1991 Protect Biodiversity?</field><field name="creator">Bellingham, Mark</field><field name="description">Biodiversity decline has continued at a rapid pace in New Zealand in the past 15 years (OECD 2007), in spite of specific provisions for biodiversity conservation under the Resource Management Act 1991 (Froude 1997, Bellingham 2004).  This thesis has examined problems with biodiversity conservation implementation in district plans, that arise from planners not making full use of the available factual base for district planning, a lack of monitoring in New Zealand&#8217;s RMA planning, and failures by ecologists and planners to properly understand and communicate information for effective district planning.  A critique of the policy and plan framework for biodiversity conservation in the Auckland Region and case studies in Rodney District and Waitakere City show there are strong provisions for biodiversity conservation in these plans that support the implementation of biodiversity conservation through district planning.  There was a moderate to high level of internal compatibility in the planning framework, apart from a policy conflict between urban growth and infrastructure development versus the protection of natural values and amenity.  Although the biodiversity factual base available for the Rodney District and Waitakere City district plans for district planning was sound, but it wasn&#8217;t often used to provide appropriate or sufficient information for district planning.  This was hampered by the poor state of the environment monitoring, and no process for monitoring the effects that resource consents and permitted activities were having on biodiversity condition.  This was exemplified by the discovery that the Rodney District Plan&#8217;s incentive-based regime for biodiversity conservation had failed to arrest the loss of 2.5% per annum of indigenous forest cover from 1977-1998.  This went undetected through a lack of plan monitoring.  In Waitakere City, district plan rules led to the indigenous vegetation cover on private land increasing by 0.5% per annum during the same period, and this was undetected by the council also.  District planning will continue to fail to achieve biodiversity conservation unless changes significant occur in planning practice, policy development and plan implementation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">district planning</field><field name="subject">biodiversity</field><field name="subject">RMA</field><field name="subject">resource management</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3406</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hypnosis, hypersensitivity and mood: some interactions between mind and body</field><field name="creator">Laidlaw, Tannis Marilyn</field><field name="description">Hypnosis has been used as a treatment modality to change physiological functioning almost since it was discovered. Particularly, it has been used in the treatment of psychosomatic illnesses. A series of studies was planned to explore the use of hypnosis within the context of recent advances in the field of psychoneuroimmunology. Type I hypersensitivity reactions were chosen as indicators of immunological functioning in allergy. Study One: This study using modern methodology and statistical analyses set out to test the hypothesis that it was possible to decrease reactions to histamine by hypnotic suggestion. Five subjects, all asthmatic and untrained in hypnosis, were given three hypnotic sessions where they were asked to control their reactions to histamine. These sessions were to be compared to three baseline sessions. A decrease in reactions was noted on the second administration of histamine calling into question studies that relied on a two session comparison. On subsequent sessions much unexplained variance was encountered, with the day upon which the sessions took place contributing significant amounts of the variance, giving rise to questions about what could cause these day to day changes. Study Two: Given the results of Study One, a method was subsequently devised in which serial, five-fold dilutions of allergen or histamine were administered to the subject's forearm with a standard Osterballe-type prick lancetter and reactions were recorded photographically on slide film. Areas were determined by computer-assisted image analysis. Seven healthy volunteers were tested for 8 sessions (testing included Profile of Moods Scale and Brief Mood Rating questionnaires, blood pressure, pulse and skin temperature). Mean wheal size and titration gradient data from allergen reactions correlated strongly with the psychological factor of liveliness but not irritability, although no manipulation of mood was involved. A stepwise regression analysis accounted for 61% of the variance of the allergen data, and 31% was from the liveliness factor alone. Thus, the more lively the subject felt, the smaller was the allergic response. The third study looked at a sample of 117 adult New Zealand subjects who volunteered to be tested with the Harvard Group Scale of Hypnotic Susceptibility (Form A). 38 of these people also were tested on a second test used to assess hypnotisability, the Creative Imagination Scale. Results indicated that the CIS can be administered with a minimum of preamble negating the value of special "think-with" instructions. It appears from the evidence in this study that both the CIS and the HGSHS:A measure characteristics that are stable over the years since the tests were first published. Reassuringly, they both can be used throughout the adult age group, with neither age nor sex testing differentially. The means and standard deviations were found to be similar to those of university aged students from various countries and cultures around the world over the years. The two hypnotisability tests were found to be correlated with each other but on a factor analysis each loaded separately giving evidence that the two tests are assessing different but related abilities. Study Four was an intervention study using 38 subjects who participated in a control session and cognitive-hypnotic intervention session that used the skin test methodology developed in Study Two. When the results of the two sessions were compared, significant decreases were found in the size of the wheals after skin testing with allergen or histamine. The hypnotic method employed in this study used three specific procedures that appear to have contributed to the high success rate: challenge to the assumption that the subject has 'no imagination', self-generated scenes and the entire process had the seriousness removed so there was little or no fear of failure. Again, the significance of mood variables was considerable in ameliorating the skin test responses, and hypnotisability was a significant factor in predicting success at being able to use the intervention. Overall, these four studies have revealed that hypnosis can be used to change at least one aspect of physiological functioning, reactivity to skin tests. Mood variables have emerged as important mediators, with implications that mood should be assessed whenever physiological variables are being measured.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321021 Psychiatry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3139</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The carotid labyrinth in the primitive New Zealand frog, Leiopelma hochstetteri</field><field name="creator">Ensor, Donald Rivers</field><field name="description">The amphibian carotid labyrinth was first described in 1738, but its purpose has never been satisfactorily explained. Much of the extant literature has either been restricted to a particular aspect of the organ, or has been based on erroneous information. This thesis used the New Zealand frog Leiopelma hochstetteri because its primitive status might render some characteristics of the carotid labyrinth more clearly evident. The "gross" anatomy of the tiny (0.5 mm diameter) organ was examined by wax-plate reconstruction and by scanning electron microscopy. The cytology of the capillary plexus tissue was studied by light and transmission electron microscopy using conventionally prepared sections. The higher resolution of the electron microscope permitted a more exact study of the innervation of the organ. Neurophysiological experiments were undertaken, but the very short (0.6 mm) and fine carotid nerve proved intractable. A study of the in vivo flow of blood through the labyrinth, resolving the pulsatile variations in flow caused by the action of the heart, was first made by visual observation and then using instrumental methods. The tissues of the capillary plexus contain the same characteristic associations of Type I and Type II cells, together with nerve fibres, as are described in the carotid bodies of the Mammalia, and in the carotid labyrinths of other Amphibia. These associations, which are believed to represent chemoreceptor units, apparently have efferent synaptic complexes against the membrane of the Type I cell. The dense-cored vesicles within the Type I cells fall within the size range described for the other species. Similar characteristic cell groups, complete with nerve supplies, were also observed in the surrounding connective tissue. The carotid nerve contains about 15 myelinated and up to 150 fine (0.15-0.5&#181;m) unmyelinated axons and leaves the sheath of the lingual ramus of the glossopharyngeal nerve through a ganglion of 25-40 cells. It supplies the labyrinth alone. The capillary plexus tissue, in which the characteristic cells are dispersed, is a densely cellular connective tissue and provides a network of random channels for the throughflow of blood. Melanocytes, collagen and elastic fibres, and nerve fibres are embedded in the matrix. The organ is mechanically passive since the only smooth muscle is found as a thin layer in the proximal main chamber. Blood flow measurements utilized the moving erythrocytes as tracers. Their movement, visible through the semi-transparent arterial walls, was recorded with a television camera and later analyzed with a microkymograph. Simultaneous recording of the ECG-related velocity measurements to the phase of the cardiac cycle. Flow in the common carotid was markedly pulsatile, entering the labyrinth in bursts and causing it to swell, while flow in the internal carotid was steady. Flow in the external carotid reversed for a large part of the cycle, returning to the roots of that vessel as the entire organ was distended. The organ owes its pulse-filtering behaviour to the resistive effect of the capillary plexus, combined with a reservoir-like storage due to the compliance of the fibroelastic capsule. This function concurs with Ask-Upmark's observation that all mammals have some pulse-filtering device interposed in their cranial arterial supply. I propose this to be the main function of the labyrinth, accounting adequately for its complex vascular structure. Its undoubted chemoreceptor function clearly can coexist happily with this vascular one.</field><field name="date">1976</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3129</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The epidemiology and management of cerebrovascular disease</field><field name="creator">Beaglehole, Ruth Bonita</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">1985</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3136</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The epidemiology of pertussis in New Zealand and risk factors for pertussis in New Zealand infants</field><field name="creator">Grant, Cameron Charles</field><field name="description">Literature review Pertussis mortality and morbidity Mass immunisation was associated with a decrease in pertussis mortality and a profound reduction in pertussis incidence. Despite this pertussis remains prevalent. Infants account for the majority of pertussis deaths and hospitalisations. Immunisation Pertussis vaccines protect against disease rather than infection. Despite immunisation pertussis remains endemic. The efficacy of different whole cell and acellular pertussis vaccines varies considerably. There has only been a small increase in immunisation coverage in New Zealand over the past 25 years. Currently between 80% and 90% of New Zealand children receive the primary immunisation series. Other epidemiological features Bordetella pertussis is a highly infectious organism. Neither infection nor immunisation results in lifelong immunity. Pertussis affects all age groups. It is more severe in females than in males. The incidence has always been highest in infants and children but the reported incidence in adults is increasing. Pertussis epidemics occur at four yearly intervals. The epidemic periodicity has not been changed by immunisation. Risk factors for pertussis Contemporary case control studies from the United States have shown that exposure to someone outside of the home with pertussis increases the risk of introduction of pertussis into the home and that infants of adolescent mothers and of mothers with a preceding coughing illness are at increased risk of pertussis. Small sample size and imprecise measurement of immunisation status have compromised these studies. Other factors associated with an increased risk of pertussis in infants include younger age, low birth weight, the infant's immunisation status and household crowding. Prior to this current case control study there was no knowledge on the effect of infant characteristics, infant immunisation status, parental and household characteristics, or socioeconomic factors on the risk of pertussis in infants. Methods The pertussis mortality and hospital discharge statistics and notification data from 1872 to 2000 were reviewed. The characteristics of children hospitalised with pertussis during the 1995 to 1997 epidemic were described. Risk factors for pertussis in infants were determined using a case control study with two different control groups. A matched case-control design was used to compare infants with pertussis with well control infants from the community. An unmatched design was used to compare infants hospitalised with pertussis to infants hospitalised with other acute respiratory illnesses. Results Historical review of pertussis epidemiology Immunisation was associated with a significant decline in pertussis mortality rates in New Zealand. Pertussis incidence rates in New Zealand are five and 10 times higher than in the United Kingdom or the United States. New Zealand pertussis hospital discharge rates increased from 1920 to 1950, decreased from 1950 to 1970 and have been increasing since then. The severity of disease among those hospitalised in New Zealand is comparable to other developed countries. Case control study of risk factors for pertussis in infants In the community control sample factors associated with incomplete immunisation included poverty and household crowding, advice from a doctor that immunisations be delayed and the caregiver not having a record of the infant's immunisations. Primary and secondary pertussis in case households occurred in all age groups. Over half of the primary cases were infants. Factors associated with an increased risk of pertussis included incomplete immunisation of the infant, children five to nine years of age living in the household, household members with pertussis during the preceding two months and the family doctor advising that an immunisation be delayed. Preschool attendance by a household member was associated with a decreased risk of pertussis. Infants of low birth weight and infants with younger mothers were not at increased risk of pertussis. In a multivariate analysis, non-immunisation of other children in the household and the presence of someone in the household with clinical pertussis were associated with an increased risk of pertussis in infants. The associations between household members with cough and the risk of pertussis varied with the age of the household members and imply an age dependent disease modifying effect of immunisation. For many of the children in the study households it seems unlikely that any health professional knew whether or not they were fully immunised. Conclusions Immunisation reduced pertussis mortality in New Zealand. Pertussis hospitalisation rates are increasing despite improvements in the immunisation schedule. Sustained sub-optimal immunisation coverage appears to be the dominant reason for New Zealand&#8217;s excessive pertussis disease burden. Primary school aged children are important in household pertussis transmission.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321019 Paediatrics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3130</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Psychosomatic dimensions of chronic musculoskeletal pain</field><field name="creator">Large, Bob, 1945-</field><field name="description">This thesis sets out to explore some psychosomatic dimensions of chronic musculoskeletal pain. Pain is a phenomenon which is universally recognised and experienced but nevertheless presents a very real epistemological problem. For convenience, the philosophical approach chosen here is that of linguistic parallelism which views pain as a range of abstract concepts defined in a variety of &#8216;languages&#8217; or disciplines in a complementary and interactive way. Psychiatric formulations of pain include the concepts of conversion, object relations and the associations of pain with a developmental history of suffering and defeat and a diagnosis of depression. These ideas have been to some extent confirmed by nomothetic studies of pain patients. Chronic, as opposed to acute, pain is associated with a broad range of physical, emotional and social changes and is a problem of such clinical magnitude that special multidisciplinary clinics have now become a feature of clinical services in most large centres. My own experience as a psychiatrist working in the Auckland Pain Clinic is described in this thesis. Over a four year period, 172 patients were assessed, comprising 15-20% of the total referrals to the clinic. The modal age was 45-54 years, with a male/female ratio of 7:10. The duration of pain was 5-10 years, the back being the most common site and musculoskeletal pain was by far the most frequent presentation. Most of the patients presented with psychiatric disorders in the neurotic-personality disorder spectrum; depression, anxiety and hysteria being frequent diagnoses. These findings are similar to other studies reviewed. Treatment was instituted in half of the patients seen and half of the treated patients improved or recovered. One third of the original sample returned a completed follow-up questionnaire 18 months to 5 years after presentation. Just under a half remained improved or recovered, the treated patients faring no better or wrose than those who refused or were not offered treatment, or who were referred elsewhere. There was a high rate of further consultation amongst all groups, but especially so for those who declined treatment. The treated patients and those referred elsewhere were significantly more likely to have found the psychiatric consultation helpful. EMG feedback, drug withdrawal and psychotherapy were more frequently associated with improvement than pharmacotherapy on short-term evaluation. On follow-up only EMG feedback maintained an advantage, Issues which emerged were the relationships between chronic pain, depression and antidepressant medication response; the role of anxiety and tension in chronic pain and the strong tendency towards continued help seeking amongst the majority of patients. Muscle tension has been invoked in the aetiology and maintenance of a variety of pain syndromes. The most intensively researched areas have been tension headache and temporomandibular joint pain where EMG feedback has become an established treatment technique, although there is still some controversy as to whether EMG feedback has any advantage over relaxation training as such. The use of EMG feedback training in other musculoskeletal conditions has been less well researched and doubt remains as to the role of generalised muscle tension in the causation of these conditions. An EMG feedback study was undertaken at the Auckland Pain Clinic using a within-subjects control- design. Eighteen subjects (12 females and 6 males) with neck and back pain were studied in terms of subjective reports of pain and EMG activity measurements under standardised conditions. Three conditions were compared, viz EMG feedback training, a control condition and a waiting list condition. The sequences of presentation of these conditions was counterbalanced in a design using two sets of latin squares to pick up any order effects. EMG feedback was the only treatment which significantly reduced EMG activity across sessions. An order effect was evident in that biofeedback was most effective when presented first but less so when presented after the control condition. Although estimates of present pain correlated with EMG activity, there was no statistical difference between pain score reductions when EMG feedback and control conditions were compared. Pain scores tended to decline during both conditions but the scores for &#8220;worst pain over one week&#8221; tended to rise. During the waiting list condition, present pain tended to increase while &#8220;worst pain over one week&#8221; tended to decline. Eleven subjects experienced an overall decrease in pain scores at the end of the study, while seven had increased pain. Declines in pain scores tended to be associated with a biofeedback training effect but this was not statistically significant. Improvement in pain was associated with high Present pain/EMG correlations when a rank order correlation was computed. This study provides some support for the use of relaxation methods in the management of musculoskeletal pain. It suggests that muscle tension may well play a role in the production and/or maintenance of musculoskeletal pain, although it does not account for all of the variance. The more interpersonal factor of illness behavior may well explain some aspects of pain not accounted for by pathophysiological factors such as muscle tension. Parson&#8217;s notions of the sick role and Mechanic&#8217;s concept of illness behavior have stimulated the by Pilowsky and Spence. We have made use of this questionnaire development of an &#8220;illness behavior questionnaire&#8221;/in a study involving 200 pain patients. A cluster analysis of these results produced profiles very similar to those found in Adelaide and adds validity to the groupings described by pilowsky and spence. Characteristically, patients with chronic pain tend to view their problems in somatic terms and to deny other problems in their lives, or if problems are admitted, to ascribe these problems to their pain. Illness behaviour profiles were found to cut across diagnostic categories when results from patients overlapping between the clinical diagnostic study and the illness behavior study were analysed. These illness attitudes therefore seemed to provide an alternative level of description to diagnostic systems. An analysis of therapeutic outcome in patients undergoing the biofeedback trial did not support the use of illness behaviour profiles as a prediction patients discussed here. Third is the Freudian mechanism of &#8220;conversion&#8221; which may account for pain syndromes where pathophysiological changes are not necessarily evident. These three concepts provide interlinking mechanism between adverse life experiences(with unpleasant affect) and musculoskeletal pain. These are part of an intrapersonal system which is potently influenced by the interpersonal and physical environment of the individual. Illness behaviour is at the social interface between intrapersonal and interpersonal systems. Research directions are suggested which may further elucidate the workings of this proposed psychosomatic formulation of chronic musculoskeletal pain</field><field name="date">1981</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321021 Psychiatry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3131</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Maori face to gambling = Kanohi ki te kanohi</field><field name="creator">Dyall, L. C. T. (Lorna Christine Te Aroha)</field><field name="description">Background Prior to the commencement of this study, gambling was not considered a significant health issue for Maori, even though the first national gambling prevalence study in New Zealand in 1991, identified that Maori had at least three times the risk of problem gambling of non-Maori. In the early 1990s, through the provision of a gambling telephone helpline and gambling counselling services, it was identified that Maori and in particular Maori women, were increasingly seeking help with problems with gambling. Gambling is an integral part of the culture of New Zealand. To understand gambling and problem gambling requires an understanding of the social, economic and cultural context it plays in being Maori. Aim of Study This study investigated whether gambling and problem gambling is an emerging health issue for Maori and if so, the extent of the problem, its effects on Maori and health approaches, and interventions which are likely to be effective for Maori. A public health approach to address problem gambling has been investigated and a plan developed. Methodology This study has been undertaken from a Maori-centered and an action-oriented research approach. It has involved integrating existing and new information from the following sources: Maori patterns of gambling and expenditure, gambling prevalence data, Maori utilisation of gambling treatment services and gambling by indigenous people. Fifteen Maori problem gamblers have been interviewed to understand from the "inside looking out" their experience of problem gambling. Thirty key informants have also been interviewed to understand from the "outside looking in" their perspective as to whether gambling is an emerging health issue for Maori. This research has involved quantitative analysis and qualitative research. Findings This study has found that problem gambling is an emerging public health issue for Maori. The effects of problem gambling for Maori are invisible and masked by other health problems such as alcohol abuse or mental health problems. Maori prevalence of problem gambling is similar to other indigenous populations which have shared similar historical and socio-economic experiences. Problem gambling often leads to crime, imprisonment, development of other health problems and the break down of families. Focusing alone on problem gambling ignores the real issues for Maori, a wider perspective is needed which focuses on Maori and tribal development. A public health strategy is proposed to reduce Maori gambling related harm.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3123</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electrophysiological and behavioural measures of central auditory processing in adult cochlear implant users</field><field name="creator">Kelly, Andrea Susan</field><field name="description">This study aimed to determine the relationship between auditory evoked potential measures, speech perception and frequency discrimination in 12 experienced adult cochlear implant (CI) users and to compare the evoked potential results in the CI subjects to those of a group of age- and gender-matched control subjects with normal hearing. The CI subjects all used the Nucleus CI-22 implant with the SPEAK processing strategy. Subject age range was 27-74 years (mean 50.9 years). All had used their implant for a minimum of one year (range 13-76 months, mean duration of implant use 37.5 months).Duration of profound deafness prior to implantation ranged from 1 - 40 years (mean 15.6 years).Middle latency response (MLR), obligatory N1-P2 cortical potentials, mismatch negativity and P3a auditory evoked potential were recorded. Speech perception was evaluated using tests from "The Minimum Speech Test Battery for Adult Cochlear Implant Users". Frequency discrimination was measured using a two-alternative forced choice procedure, to record difference limens (DL) for a 1000Hz tone. Duration of deafness correlated strongly with speech perception scores with poor scores reflecting greater years of deafness. The most sensitive of all the evoked potential measures was P2 latency, with strong relationships found between P2 and duration of deafness and speech perception scores. Earlier P2 latencies were associated with shorter durations of deafness and higher speech perception scores. In general, mismatch negativity was absent or degraded in CI subjects with poor speech scores. In better implant users mismatch negativity was typically present to both large and small frequency differences and demonstrated characteristic changes of increased latency and decreased area and amplitude for the more difficult discrimination task (as seen in the normal hearing group). Na amplitude of the MLR correlated negatively with duration of deafness, with small amplitudes reflecting greater duration of deafness. Frequency DLs were very variable, and no strong relationships were found between these and the evoked potential or speech perception measures.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3126</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of neurotrophic factors in neurodegenerative disorders of the human brain</field><field name="creator">Connor, Bronwen Jane</field><field name="description">Neurotrophic factors are a family of polypeptides that promote the differentiation, growth and survival of numerous central nervous system neurons during development and adulthood. It has been proposed that alterations in neurotrophic factor protein or receptor expression may be involved in the pathogenesis of human neurodegenerative disorders. Recent research supports the therapeutic use of neurotrophic factors in neurodegenerative disorders. However, while information has been obtained regarding the structure and function of neurotrophic factors and their receptors (trk receptors) in the developing and mature rodent central nervous system, little research has been performed examining the expression and functional role of these factors in the normal and diseased human brain. This thesis investigated the role neurotrophic factors and trk receptors play in the pathogenesis of human neurodegenerative disorders. Using immunohistochemical and in situ hybridisation techniques, the regional distribution and cellular localisation of neurotrophic factors and trk receptors was examined throughout both the adult rat and normal human brain. The expression of individual neurotrophic factors and trk receptors was also examined in human post mortem normal, Alzheimer's and Huntington's disease brain tissue, as well as in an animal model of apoptotic nerve cell death. Individual neurotrophic factors exhibited a specific and heterogeneous regional pattern of distribution throughout the adult human brain. Neurotrophic factor expression was detected in several neuronal populations which exhibit selective vulnerability in various neurodegenerative disorders. Alterations in the expression of neurotrophic factors within specific regions of the human brain may result in neuronal atrophy, possibly via apoptotic mechanisms. A significant reduction in the level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was observed within the hippocampus and temporal cortex of the Alzheimer's disease brain. A loss of neuroprotection afforded by BDNF may contribute to the progressive atrophy of neurons in Alzheimer&#8217;s disease. The high-affinity trk receptors, trkA and trkB (full-length and truncated) were also altered within the Alzheimer's disease brain. TrkA receptor-immunoreactivity was observed in astrocytes in the CA1 region of the Alzheimer's disease hippocampus, some of which were associated with &#946;-amyloid plaques. Truncated trkB receptors were found in high levels in senile plaques while the full-length trkB receptor was expressed in glial-like cells in the Alzheimer's disease hippocampus. The appearance of trkA and trkB receptors in astrocytes and plaques in the Alzheimer's disease brain might be related to &#946;-amyloid deposition and could be implicated in the development of Alzheimer's disease. Alterations in insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) protein expression were also observed within the Alzheimer's disease brain. IGF-I-immunoreactivity was expressed in a subpopulation of reactive astrocytes in the Alzheimer's disease temporal cortex. These observations may indicate that IGF-I is involved in the neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease. The induction of IGF-I in response to neuronal injury may be an attempt to inhibit mechanisms that result in delayed neuronal death. In addition, neurotrophic factor expression was examined in the Huntington's disease brain. Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and transforming growth factor-&#945; (TGF-&#945;) were significantly reduced within both the Huntington's disease globus pallidus and substantia nigra. Reduced GDNF and TGF- &#945; levels within the Huntington's disease brain may produce a loss of local or target-derived neurotrophic support within the basal ganglia and contribute to the preferential degeneration of medium-sized spiny projection neurons within the Huntington's disease striatum. Moderate hypoxic-ischemic (Hl) injury was used as an animal model of apoptotic nerve cell death. In agreement with the observations made in the Alzheimer's disease brain, moderate Hl injury resulted in the loss of BDNF within the rat hippocampus. In contrast, an increase in trkB (truncated) receptor expression was detected within glial cells in the rat brain. Alterations in BDNF and trkB receptor levels may lead to a loss of neuroprotection and the initiation of downstream mechanisms resulting in the induction of apoptotic processes. A cascade of events similar to those observed within the rat Hl model may occur within human neurodegenerative disorders. This study demonstrated that, while the neuropathogenesis of both Alzheimer's and Huntington's disease is complex, alterations in individual neurotrophic factor or trk receptor expression within selectively vulnerable cortical or subcortical regions may play a role in their pathophysiology. Furthermore, these results support the proposal that neurotrophic factors may be considered for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders by protecting against neuronal cell loss and by increasing the function of surviving neuronal populations.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320500 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3134</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Epidemiology of Giardia infection in New Zealand and the risk in children</field><field name="creator">Hoque, Mohammad Ekramul</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3127</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chamier the Epicurean : the life and works of George Chamier (1842-1915)</field><field name="creator">Sturm, Sean Roderick</field><field name="description">George Chamier (1842-1915) was an engineer and novelist, who was born and died in England, but spent most of his life on an eccentric orbit around the outskirts of the British Empire&#8212;through New Zealand, Australia and China and back to England again. After he had established himself as an engineer in Australia, he looked back on his life in a trilogy of autoethnographical novels, which work through the problem of how an &#8220;unsettled settler&#8221; such as he might get settled in the settler colonies. Philosopher Dick (1890) and A South-Sea Siren (1895) are set in the eighteen-sixties in North Canterbury, New Zealand on a back country station and in a small town respectively; The Story of a Successful Man (1895) is set in the eighteen-seventies in &#8220;Marvellous Melbourne.&#8221; This thesis, &#8220;Chamier the Epicurean,&#8221; examines Chamier&#8217;s life and (fictional) works in the light of two key questions. The first is: How can we understand the distinctive critical perspective on life in the settler colonies in the early days of European settlement that his novels articulate? The &#8220;outside insideness&#8221; of his position as an unsettled settler can account for the critical purchase he has on his own culture. Such a perspective is unusual in the history of local settler literature, not just because it is critical of settler society or &#8220;unsettling,&#8221; but because it is critical in an unusual way: Chamier unsettles himself by problematising his own position as a settler, thereby generating a critical autoethnography&#8212;to borrow Deborah Reed-Danahay&#8217;s definition, a critical &#8220;self (auto) ethnography&#8221; that is also &#8220;the ethnography of [his] own group,&#8221; his own ethnos (people). And the second question that informs this thesis is: How can we understand the relation between his life and works, given the degree to which the former seems to inform the latter? In the novels, he makes sense of his life in hindsight as a sentimental education. He has his autoethnographical &#8220;stand-ins&#8221; take on a series of sentimental personas in the attempt to get themselves settled as they move through the Australasian colonies in an ironic appropriation of the grand narrative of settlement as a progress from frontier to town to city. To see his life in hindsight as &#8220;mapped out&#8221; in this way was a gesture of aesthetic settlement that enabled Chamier to achieve an Epicurean equanimity he was able to find only fleetingly in the scramble of life in the settler colonies.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3176</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Robust control for uncertain networked control systems with random delays</field><field name="creator">Huang, Dan, 1980-</field><field name="description">Networked control systems (NCSs) are a type of distributed control systems where sensors, actuators, and controllers are interconnected through a communication network. This system setup has the advantage of low cost, &#176;exibility, and less wiring, but it also inevitably invites some delays and data loss into the design procedure. The focus of this thesis is to address the problem of analysis and design of networked control systems when the communication delays are varying in a random fashion. This random feature of the time delays is typical for commercially used networks, such as a DeviceNet (which is a controller area network (CAN)) and Ethernet network. Models for communication network delays are &#175;rst developed, in which Markov processes are used to model these random network-induced delays. Based on such models, we establish novel methodologies for stability analysis, control with disturbance attenuation, and fault estimation for a class of uncertain linear/nonlinear uncertain NCSs with random communication network-induced delays in both sensor-to-controller and controller-to- actuator channels. Data packet dropouts in the communication channels also have been taken into consideration in the modelling and design procedure. The main technique used in this thesis is based on the Lyapunov-Razumikhin method, which results in delay-dependent controllers. We &#175;rst consider the design prob- lems for uncertain linear NCSs. In this case, state feedback controllers and dynamic output feedback controllers are designed to satisfy both stability and disturbance at- tenuation requirements for this class of NCSs. Moreover, a robust fault estimator that ensures the fault estimation error is less than a prescribed performance level is designed. We further go on to address the control problems for uncertain nonlinear NCSs. The nonlinear plant is &#175;rst described by the T-S fuzzy model. Based on this model, stability analysis, disturbance attenuation, and fault estimation problems are studied for uncer- tain nonlinear NCSs. It should be noted that system uncertainties, disturbances and noises are addressed in both cases. The existence of such controllers and fault estimators are given in terms of the solvability of bilinear matrix inequalities. Iterative algorithms are proposed to change this non-convex problem into quasi-convex optimization problems, which can be solved e&#174;ectively by available mathematical tools. Finally, to demonstrate the e&#174;ectiveness and advantages of the proposed design methodologies in this thesis, numerical examples are given in each designed control systems. The simulation results show that the proposed design methodologies can achieve the prescribed performance requirements.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290900 Electrical and Electronic Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3372</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Placing the lived experience(s) of TB in a refugee community in Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Lawrence, Jody</field><field name="description">Although rates of tuberculosis (TB) in much of the western world have steadily declined since the Second World War, this infectious disease remains a leading cause of death among those living in impoverished circumstances. Social science perspectives have argued that TB is as much a reflection of socio-economic inequality and the uneven distribution of power and resources as it is about biological processes.  In this thesis I explore the lived experience of TB within the Somali refugee community in Auckland, New Zealand.  While migrants and refugees are frequently blamed for the resurgence in TB in Western countries, very little is known about the determinants that underlie this manifestation of the disease. The present research addresses this gap in the literature by employing a transdisciplinary social science approach that considers the determinants of health and illness that range across the social, cultural economic and political domains of human experience. The geographical underpinnings of the work are borne out in the fundamental goal: to (literally and metaphorically) place the lived experience of health, disease (and particularly TB) within the Somali refugee community in the wider context of migration and resettlement.  Employing qualitative methods I draw upon participants&#8217; narratives to highlight the different ways in which Somali health beliefs and experiences have been shaped by wider structural forces.  I demonstrate that within Auckland, Somalis encounter multiple and overlapping layers of disadvantage.  The combined impacts of this disadvantage have a profound influence on their health and illness experience, particularly in terms of the development and ongoing occurrence of TB.  Respondents with TB recounted widespread stigma that exacerbated the harm incurred by the illness itself.  Although Somalis are highly marginalised, the thesis acknowledges the agency and creativity exerted by people in fashioning the course of their life within the context of considerable structural constraints.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">tuberculosis</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">illness</field><field name="subject">migration</field><field name="subject">resettlement</field><field name="subject">Somalis</field><field name="subject">Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370400 Human Geography</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3151</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of the mechanical and oxygen barrier properties of microfibril reinforced composites</field><field name="creator">Shields, Ryan John</field><field name="description">A relatively new type of reinforced composite material, derived from immiscible blends of thermoplastic homopolymers, is characterised in this doctoral research.  Microfibril Reinforced Composites (MFCs) utilise common engineering and commodity polymers to create high strength and stiffness microfibrils dispersed in an isotropic matrix.  Unlike traditional polymer composites, MFCs use the dispersed component of a blend to create an even distribution of in situ reinforcing microfibrils via a simple extrusion, drawing and processing technique.  This research quantifies the mechanical and oxygen gas barrier properties of polyolefin-based MFCs containing polyethylene terephthalate (PET) microfibrils.  It is concerned not only with identifying MFCs with the best properties, but also with how manufacturing parameters influence those properties.  Characterisation is split into several parts.  Initial investigations into blend development during extrusion and drawing were conducted.  The main purpose of this was to gain a better understanding of the factors influencing the morphological changes that occur during production.  Blend viscosity ratio and capillary number were identified as key factors in determining the onset of coalescence, deformation and break up of the dispersed polymer.  The effects on microfibril formation of several important manufacturing parameters were highlighted, with die diameter and extrusion speed the most influential of these.  A significant skin-core microstructure was observed.  Formation of elongated microfibres (with negligible molecular chain alignment) was shown to occur during extrusion, which was subsequently justified via modelling of the shear stress flow fields in the die. Drawn blends gave very high tensile strengths and stiffnesses due to highly oriented molecular chains.  A threshold draw ratio of 3.5, at which properties change considerably, was identified.  Mechanical properties of injection moulded MFCs from polypropylene were not considerably better than the neat matrix polymer.  However, those from polyethylene (PE) showed significant improvement via injection moulding and directional compression moulding.  MFCs with just 30% microfibril content displayed tensile properties up to six times greater than neat PE.  Measurements of oxygen gas permeability highlighted improvements of up to 65%.  Processing and cooling conditions were shown to significantly influence permeability via a Taguchi experimental design analysis.  MFC storage containers from PE/PET were injection moulded as proof-of-concept on completion of the research.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">polymer</field><field name="subject">composite</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291400 Materials Engineering::291401 Polymers</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291400 Materials Engineering::291402 Composite materials</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3373</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adolescents&#8217; interpretation of smoking imagery in film: implications for future smoking</field><field name="creator">McCool, Judith.</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3157</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Disability following car crashes: an epidemiological investigation</field><field name="creator">Ameratunga, Shanthi Neranjana</field><field name="description">Background Road traffic injury is projected to rank as the third largest contributor to the global burden of disease by 2020. Disability is a significant component of the burden of disease ranking. Most published data on traffic crash outcomes, however, focus primarily on deaths and hospitalisations. Reliable estimates of post-crash disability and information on factors that modify the disabling process are essential to prioritise and allocate appropriate resources for road traffic injury prevention and interventions that reduce the risk of secondary disability. Aims To quantify the risk of disability associated with serious injury crashes in car drivers in a defined population; to explore the extent to which this risk is modified by chronic alcohol abuse; and to critically review methodological approaches that can redress the inadequate epidemiological attention to injury-related disability. Methods Systematic reviews were conducted to examine the available epidemiological evidence quantifying the association of car crashes with disability and the effect of alcohol on the risk of post-injury disability. Studies published or presented between January 1980 and April 2003 were reviewed. No language restriction was imposed. A population-based prospective cohort study conducted in the Auckland region of New Zealand recruited drivers exposed to serious injury crashes (identified through a surveillance system monitoring hospital admissions of injured car occupants). A representative sample of car drivers in the region was identified through roadside surveys (controls). The participants were interviewed at recruitment (to obtain pre-crash information from crash drivers and baseline data from controls) and re-interviewed at five and eighteen-months follow-up. Structured interviews on all three occasions included the Short Form-36, a global health change indicator, and the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test. Information on a range of potential confounders was sought at baseline through the interview, alcohol measurements and clinical records. Results Studies identified in the systematic reviews revealed that published estimates of the risk of post-crash disability ranged from 2% to 57%. The evidence regarding the effect of alcohol on post-injury disability is inconclusive largely because none examined this association directly. Most studies identified in the reviews were limited by several methodological problems including the absence of appropriate comparison groups, inadequate or no adjustment for confounding, significant potential for selection bias due to the study setting, high levels of loss to follow-up, and missing data. In the prospective cohort study, 215 crash drivers (75% follow-up) and 254 controls (69%) completed the 18-month interview. Overall, 40% of the drivers who were hospitalised, 20% of the crash drivers not hospitalised, and 7% of the controls reported deteriorated health at 18 months relative to their baseline health. This represents a tenfold excess risk of disability among hospitalised drivers and a three-fold excess risk among non-hospitalised crash drivers, relative to drivers in the general population. Among crash drivers reporting an overall decline in health, clinically important reductions in general and mental health were apparent over the follow-up period despite improving physical health and function. This trend was more evident among non-hospitalised than hospitalised crash drivers. Compared with drivers who were neither involved in a crash nor defined as hazardous drinkers, crash drivers who were hazardous drinkers had a seven-fold excess risk of a clinically significant (&#8805; 10%) decline in the SF-36 general health score (OR 6.85; 95% CI: 1.84-25.43). Crash drivers who were not hazardous drinkers had a three-fold risk (OR: 3.00; 95% CI: 1.14-7.89). The results indicated an important interaction between crash involvement and chronic alcohol abuse in potentiating the risk of disability. Conclusion Serious traffic crashes are associated with significant longer-term disability in a substantial proportion of survivors with an apparent worsening of mental health over time. Definitions of disability and estimates of the burden of disability following traffic injury remain highly variable in the published literature and it is timely for the international research community to develop a more systematic and consistent approach to this major and increasing component of the global burden of disease. By addressing the main methodological limitations of previous studies, this study revealed that chronic alcohol abuse potentiates the risk of post-crash disability. The findings suggest that measures for preventing road traffic crashes as well as efforts to identify problem drinkers among crash survivors should be intensified. The thesis highlights the need for robust indicators of non-fatal injury to monitor the impact of road safety programs and large-scale epidemiological studies to investigate the spectrum and determinants of post-injury disability.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3158</field></doc></add>
