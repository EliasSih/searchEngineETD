It effectively inhibits stress-induced protein aggregation by an ATP independent mechanism, binding to partially unfolded proteins and forming soluble high molecular weight complexes with them (Wilson and Easterbrook-Smith, 2000).  A model proposed by Yerbury et al. (2005) suggested that if clusterin mediates the clearance and degradation of misfolded extracellular proteins in vivo and this action is anti-inflammatory, a recombinant form of clusterin might be therapeutically useful to clear protein debris from sites of disease and inflammation and in this way suppress pathology. The expression of recombinant mammalian proteins is often performed using mammalian or insect cells because some post-translational processes (glycosylation, phosphorylation, oligomerization, specific protein cleavage and disulfide bond formation) are not performed by bacterial cells (Sambrook et al., 1989). However, since Stewart et al. (2007) showed that clusterin retains its chaperone function when deglycosylated and that deglycosylation did not induce major structural changes in the molecule, the possibility of producing chaperone-active human clusterin in bacteria became apparent. This thesis describes an attempt to produce a chaperone-active recombinant clusterin expressed in bacteria to provide a large scale supply of protein useful in therapeutic applications. In addition, two different commercially available recombinant clusterin proteins were compared in structure and chaperone function with human serum clusterin to provide additional insights into any functional limitations of recombinantly expressed clusterin proteins and to supply the information to the manufacturer. Firstly, the expression of clusterin - MBP fusion protein was attempted in E. coli TBI but full length recombinant clusterin - MBP fusion protein was only detected as a minor species; a large part of the product  was cleaved from MBP during expression and most of the MBP-clusterin fusion protein was degraded with time. Thus, because it was not possible to obtain a source of stable clusterin - MBP fusion protein, the expression of clusterin &#8211; 6xHis tag fusion protein was attempted. Gateway&#174; cloning technology was used for cloning and expressing clusterin &#8211; 6xHis tag fusion protein in E. coli. After expression, the protein was extracted and purified under denaturing conditions. The purified protein was subsequently refolded in 50 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 10% glycerol, 0.1% azide, alkylated with 50 mM IAA and dialyzed prior to developing functional and structural analyses. After expression in E. coli TBI, clusterin &#8211; 6xHis Tag fusion protein was detected along with disulfide-bonded high molecular weight aggregates and putative truncated products. While structural studies by CD revealed that the predicted secondary structure content of clusterin &#8211; 6xHis tag fusion protein and plasma-derived clusterin were similar, functional analysis revealed that the former had little if any chaperone activity (its limited effects on the heat-induced precipitation of fibrinogen were not dose-dependent). Structural (SEC, CD) and functional analyses (chaperone assays and IgG binding test) of Flag-Tagged full-length recombinant human clusterin (expressed in human embryonic kidney cells) and His-Tagged partial-length recombinant rat clusterin (expressed in E. coli, not post translationally processed, thus not cleaved into &#61537; and &#946; chains and not glycosilated) (both commercial proteins from BioVendor- Laboratory Medicine, Inc.) indicated that the recombinant proteins tested had (i) an increased proportion of high molecular weight species when compared with plasma-derived clusterin, (ii) predicted secondary structure content similar to that of plasma-derived clusterin, (iii) chaperone activity but were less effective than plasma-derived clusterin (recombinant human 28%, recombinant rat 48% less effective) and (iv) were able to bind IgG, the IgG binding activity was dose-dependent and similar to that of plasma-derived clusterin. Furthermore, the results obtained for recombinant rat clusterin suggested that the expression of chaperone active clusterin in bacteria is possible and that cleavage into &#61537; and &#946; chains and the C-terminus of the beta chain (residues 22-145) are not required for chaperone or IgG binding activity. Further studies will be required to optimize production of a chaperone active form of human clusterin in bacteria.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/68</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A new approach in determining the load transfer mechanism in fully grouted bolts</field><field name="creator">Jalalifar, Hossein</field><field name="description">Rock bolts are used as temporary and permanent support systems in tunnelling and mining operations. In surface mining they are used for slope stability operations and in underground workings to develop roadway, sink shafts, and stoping operations. Rock bolting technology has developed rapidly over the past three decades due to a better understanding of load transfer mechanisms and advances made in the bolt system technology. Bolts are placed into discontinuous rock to prevent movement between the discontinuity planes, depending on the direction of installation and nature of the discontinuity surfaces. Rock bolting can increase the tension and shear properties of the rock mass.Nowadays, the application of rock bolts for ground reinforcement and stabilisation is worldwide, but its effectiveness depends on rock type, strata lithology, and encapsulation characteristics. Thus the bolt, rock interaction, particularly near the shear joints, and how a bolt reacts to surrounding conditions require continuous evaluation and research. Work provides an in depth study of the bolt, grout, concrete interaction during under axial and lateral loading.To better understand load transfer characterisation bolt shearing across joint and planes, this research programme consists of three parts. Accordingly, a series of experimental studies and field work was undertaken. A numerical technique was developed to obtain the stress and strain developed along the bolt and surrounding materials under axial and lateral loading. Finally, a field investigation programme was undertaken to obtain the load developed along different bolt profiles (another objective of this thesis). Bolt profiles were also investigated by laboratory studies.A double shearing system (DSS) was used to examine bolts shearing. Testing was undertaken in 20, 40, and 100 MPa strength concrete to simulate different rock strengths. Only three bolt types were used in axial loading tests and different thicknesses of resin were evaluated under axial and lateral loading. Tests subjected to lateral loading were undertaken in 0, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 80 kN pre-tension loads, which revealed that the strength of the concrete significantly affects the bolt &#8211; joint contribution. Also shear displacement was dramatically reduced when the strength of the concrete was increased. Pre-tension increases the shear resistance of the system. The profile of a rock bolt affects the shear performance and load transfer under axial and lateral loads.The 3-D FE code, ANSYS V. 9.1 was used. To investigate the load transfer and interaction between bolt, grout, and concrete under non-linear conditions, special element types for the materials and contact interfaces were introduced. The stress and strain built up along the materials under axial and lateral loads was examined. A laboratory study on shearing at the bolt, resin interface of fully grouted bolts was extended to field studies in Appin and Metropolitan Collieries in the Southern Coalfields of the Sydney Basin, NSW, Australia. Twelve instrumented bolts were installed at both mines. Both installation sites were in the heading of a retreating long wall mine. The field investigation revealed that the load transfer on a bolt is affected by horizontal in-situ stresses and profile of the bolt surface. It showed that bolt with higher ribs and wider spacing offered greater shear resistance at the bolt &#8211; resin interface, which agreed with the laboratory results.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/855</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study on nonlinear behaviour of subgrades under cyclic loading for the development of a design chart for flexible pavements</field><field name="creator">Bodhinayake, Beatrice Chandrani</field><field name="description">The road pavement is continuously subjected to the loads transferred from moving vehicles during its design life and stresses and strains (responses) are induced in all pavement layers. The responses occur in the subgrade, which is the in-situ soil stratum with a low modulus, would gradually accumulate with the increase in volume of traffic although those responses are low in their magnitudes. It is reasonable to assume that the responses which occur in other pavement layers constructed according to the specifications outlined by the road authorities are recoverable due to their high moduli. Therefore, the performance of a road pavement significantly depends on the behaviour of its subgrade under the action of moving traffic. Moreover, a study on this behaviour of nonlinear subgrade would increase the confidence of pavement engineers in the design of flexible pavements. The in-depth literature review has revealed that the nonlinear behaviour of subgrades under the action of moving traffic has not been incorporated into the design charts that are currently being used. Furthermore, the multi-layer elastic theory has been used for developing those design charts, although, the sophisticated and fairly expensive finite element computer codes are able to produce accurate results. Therefore, the intention of this study is to investigate the nonlinear behaviour of subgrades under cyclic loading and to develop a design chart for flexible pavements incorporating that behaviour of subgrades employing the finite element theory in all the analyses. The granular pavements are the most widely used type of flexible pavements in Australia. Since subgrade materials with CBR values 5 and 7 are commonly found in road corridors of Australia, two granular base pavements tested under the cyclic loading by means of Accelerated Loading Facility (ALF) were selected from Callington, South Australia (with a subgrade of CBR of 5) and Beerburrum, Queensland (with a subgrade of CBR of 7). An appropriate pavement block is selected from the tested area and modelled as a finite element model for each pavement. The applied cyclic ALF load was modelled as a stress pulse with a cycle time and amplitude. The pavement materials, except subgrades, in both pavements were modelled as linear elastic materials with their moduli and Poisson&#8217;s ratios. Two curves of stress versus strain were developed using available literature and used to model the nonlinear subgrades in both pavements. Since an analysis with millions of cycles of load applications would require enormous amount of computer time, the analysis was carried out in stages. When an analysis is carried out in stages, the stresses and strains in nonlinear materials are to be submitted at the beginning of each stage as initial conditions. Two curves of permanent strain versus number of load applications were developed using available literature for both subgrade materials. With the aid of those curves together with the developed stress versus strain curves, the stresses and strains in nonlinear subgrade materials at the beginning of each stage were determined. The modelled pavement with the modelled linear and nonlinear materials together with initial conditions was analysed when subjected to the modelled cyclic load in each stage. The maximum deformations computed on the surface of the pavement were compared with their corresponding field measured permanent deformations. The agreement between the computed deformations and the field measured deformations during the ALF testing has revealed that the curves of stress versus strain as well as the curves of permanent strain versus number of load applications developed for two subgrade materials for studying their nonlinear behaviour under cyclic loading produce satisfactory results. Therefore, those curves were employed in estimating the deformations of granular base pavements with subgrade materials with CBR values of 5 and 7. Two sets of granular base pavements consist of identical thin asphalt surfaces and granular bases were considered for the analysis. The CBR values of subgrade materials in these two sets were considered as 5 and 7 respectively. The base thickness of these pavements was changed from 350mm to 750mm with 100mm increments for both sets. The analysis was carried out in stages for each pavement using the general purpose finite element computer code ABAQUS/Standard. The maximum deformation computed at a point on the surface at the end of each stage was plotted against the corresponding number of load applications for each pavement. Those curves were used to estimate the number of load applications that would produce a deformation of 25mm on each pavement. The estimated number of load applications was assumed as the allowable number of Equivalent Standard Axles (ESA&#8217;s) applied on each pavement during its design life. The base thickness was plotted against the allowable number of ESA&#8217;s for each pavement and presented as the design curves for CBR 5 and CBR 7 in the design chart developed in this study. In conclusion, the agreement between the computed deformations and the field measured deformations during the ALF testing has demonstrated that the curves developed for studying the nonlinear behaviour of subgrade materials under cyclic loading were able to estimate the deformations in real pavement structures quite accurately.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/868</field></doc><doc><field name="title">People at the polls: a geographical analysis of a local government election, Wollongong, 1974</field><field name="creator">Hermann, Robert James</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/871</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thinking and learning in junior high school: an evaluation of some enhancement strategies</field><field name="creator">Wagener, Grahame William</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/987</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Some metal complexes of pentadentate Schiff bases</field><field name="creator">Boge, Edward Michael</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/899</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis and expression of important vaccine antigens of Bordetella pertussis</field><field name="creator">Smith, Adam M.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1035</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physiological and biochemical studies on Dunaliella</field><field name="creator">Goyal, Arun</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1072</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A farm household model for rural households of West Java, Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Sawit, M.

The conducting composite fibres of PAni- SWNT were developed respectively using two steps (acid doping after fibre spinning) and one step methods (doping during preparation of spinning solution). The effectiveness of nanotube inclusion for improvement of mechanical, electrical and electrochemical properties was studied in each method. During development of the fibres, techniques such as UV-Vis-NIR, Raman spectroscopy, Dynamic light scattering and viscometery were used to characterise the quality of dispersion and spinning solutions. It has been shown that the N,N'-dimethyl propylene urea (DMPU) and dichloro acetic acid (DCAA) as solvents respectively for PAni in base and salt form are able to effectively disperse the pristine SWNTs to reach percolation level. The addition of nanotubes changes the rheological behavior of neat PAni spinning solution from a Newtonian to non-Newtonian shear thinning fluid based on power law regime which reflects nanotube-nanotube and/or nanotube-polymer physical entanglement. Several techniques including DMA, DSC, SEM, TEM, FIB, Raman spectroscopy, CV and four point probe electrical conductivity measurement were employed to characterize the various properties of the solid fibre. In both, one step or two steps methods, fibres containing SWNTs have superior tensile strength and elastic modulus compared with neat PAni fibre. The inclusion of SWNTs to PAni, however, decreases the elongation at break. These outcomes directly can be attributed to physical and/or chemical interfacial interaction between well distributed SWNTs bundles and the PAni matrix. The addition of nanotubes to the PAni matrix also increases the electrical conductivity and enhances the electrochemical redox process. However, the two step method was found to have some problem include low spinning rate, low flexibility and low conductivity and insufficient charge transfer along the fibre to be working electrode. These disadvantages were diminished by faster spinning of PAni- ES/2-acrylamido-2 methyl -1-propane sulfonic acid (AMPSA)/SWNT using the one step process with more than 5 times stretching ratio. An electronic conductivity percolation threshold of ~ 0.35 % w/w SWNTs was determined with fibres possessing electronic conductivity up to ~ 750 Scm-1. The well defined electrochemical window for neat PAni- ES/AMPSA fibre and its composite containing SWNT either in aqueous or ionic liquid electrolyte, with wider electrochemical window, confirms the ease of charge transport through a new conduction path for the fibre formed from salt structure, which was enhanced by addition of nanotubes. The ultimate tensile strength, elastic modulus and elongation at break of PAni-ES/AMPSA/SWNT fibres containing 0.76 % w/w nanotubes respectively were obtained 255 &#177; 32 Mpa, 7.3 &#177; 0.4 GPa and 4 &#177; 1 % compared with 170 &#177; 22 MPa, 3.4 &#177; 0.4 GPa and 9 &#177; 3 % for PAni-ES/AMPSA fibre. The quantitative analysis of nanotube orientation and detection of load transfer from matrix to nanotubes were investigated in PAni- S/AMPSA/SWNT composite fibre using Raman spectroscopy. It has been found that thermal stretching of as spun fibre mostly orients the nanotubes in a range of about &#177; 30&#176; versus fibre axis which extremely increase the Herman orientation factor from 0.02 for as spun fibre to 0.43 for the 5x drawn fibre. Moderate orientation and Raman shift about 90- 130 cm-1 in D* band of SWNT be correlated to effective but not prefect load transfer between PAni matrix and nanotubes. The result of temperature dependent electrical conductivity data was shown that the higher conductivity of PAni-ES/AMPSA/SWNT composite fibre compared to neat PAni-ES/AMPSA fibre also can be described by improvement of the metallic property in the crystalline areas and boosting of the metallic disorder contribution in amorphous area. The consequence of improvement of mechanical, electrical and electrochemical properties were a benefit for applying of PAni/ES-AMPSA fibre and its composite having SWNT in applications as actuator, power source and sensor. While the fibres showed great promise as actuators, their response as batteries and temperature/ humidity sensors was limited. The significant improvement was observed in actuator strength in excess of 100 MPa and work-per-cycle of over 300 kJ/m3 through the incorporation of small amounts of SWNTs as reinforcement in the PAni matrix. This performance is 3 times higher than previously produced conducting polymer actuators and exceeds skeletal muscle in terms of stress generation by 300 times. PAni- ES/AMPSA/SWNT exhibited a higher charge/discharge capacity (12.4/11.2 mAhg-1) compared with the neat PAni-ES/AMPSA (4.5/4.1 mAhg-1). All the results show that solid polyaniline fibre can be used directly as electrode in ionic liquid of EMI.TFSI for wearable power source system. However its current performance is still well below conventional rechargeable battery systems. PAni fibre and its SWNT composite showed a nonlinear response with some delay to temperature signals. The PAni fibre incorporated with SWNTs showed lower sensitivity to change in humidity pulse compared with neat PAni fibre. This behavior has good opportunity for application in conducting yarn that needs the lowest variability in conductivity for transferring of electrical signal but clearly is not favored for sensing of humidity.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/491</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Two problems in finite elasticity</field><field name="creator">Padukka Withana, Himanshuki Nilmini</field><field name="description">Some materials encountered in nature and used in engineering exhibit mechanical effects which cannot be adequately explained by classical linear elastic theories. For example, rubber is an elastic material that undergoes large elastic deformations, and therefore renders a non-linear mechanical behavior. An analytical investigation dealing with the problem of static deformation of such materials therefore involves highly non-linear equations leading to arduous mathematical work. Consequently there exists only a limited number of known exact solutions for such problems in the field of finite elasticity.This thesis is concerned with two problems of finite elastic deformations of rubber blocks. Rubber has been successfully modeled as an isotropic incompressible hyperelastic material with strain energy function given by either the neo-Hookean or Mooney forms. For this class of materials, substantial reductions of the basic un- derlying equilibrium equations can be obtained, making the problems more tractable and for plane and axially symmetric deformations of these materials, simpler stress- strain relations can be obtained. Therefore, by combining these essentially two-dimensional stress-strain relations together with the reduced equilibrium equations it is possible to obtain comparatively tractible forms of the equations.In this thesis the following problems for axially symmetric deformations of isotropic incompressible neo-Hookean and Mooney materials are investigated:(i) asymptotic axially symmetric deformations describing compression of rubber cylindrical tubes with bonded metal end plates;(ii) rippling of a long rectangular rubber block bent into a sector of a solid bounded by two circular arcs.The above mentioned reduced equllibrium equations are employed in the context of non-linear continuum mechanics to arrive at approximate solutions. The solutions are approximate in the sense that the point-wise vanishing of the stress vector on a boundary is assumed to be replaced by the vanishing of forces in an average manner.In the first problem, for axially symmetric deformations of the perfectly elastic neo-Hookean and Mooney materials, formal asymptotic solutions are determined in terms of expansions in appropriate powers of 1/R, where R is the cylindrical polar material coordinate. Remarkably, for both the neo-Hookean and Mooney materials, the first three terms of such expansions can be completely determined analytically in terms of elementary integrals. From the incompressibility condition and the equilibrium equations, the six unknown deformation functions, that appear in the first three terms can be reduced to five formal integrations involving in total, seven arbitrary constants, and a further five integration constants, making a total of twelve integration constants for the deformation field. The solutions so obtained for the neo-Hookean material are applied to the problem of the axial compression of a cylindrical rubber tube which has bonded metal end-plates. The resulting solution is approximate in two senses; namely as an approximate solution of the governing equations and for which the stress free boundary conditions are satisfied in an average manner only. The resulting deformation and load-reflection relation are shown graphically.The second problem examined in this thesis is that of finite elastic deformation of a long rectangular rubber block which is deformed in a perturbed cylindrical configuration. This problem is motivated from the problem of determining surface rippling that is observed in bent multi-walled carbon nano-tubes. The problem of finite elastic bending of a tube is considerably more complicated than the geometrically simpler problem of the finite elastic bending of a rectangular block. Accordingly, we examine here the simpler block problem which is assumed to be sufficiently long so that the out of plane end effects may be ignored. The general equations governing plane strain deformations of an isotropic incompressible perfectly elastic Mooney material, which models rubber like materials, are used to determine small superimposed deformations upon the well known controllable family for the deformation of rectangular blocks into a sector of a solid bounded by two circular arcs. Traction free boundary conditions are assumed to be satisfied in an average sense along the bounding circular arcs. Physically realistic rippling is found to occur and typical numerical values are used to illustrate the solution graphically.In summary reduced equilibrium equations and simplified two-dimensional stress strain relations are used in this study to solve two problems for isotropic incompressible neo-Hookean and Mooney materials. Such deformations and the class of materials studied considerably simplify what are otherwise very complex problems from the theory of finite elasticity.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/869</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Painting the lines of connection between time, space and memory</field><field name="creator">Dawes, Debra</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/924</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Some aspects of inverter-fed induction motors</field><field name="creator">Charlton, Willis H.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1358</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From novelist to essayist: the Charmian Clift phenomenon</field><field name="creator">Tucker, Graham Rochford</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1369</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tribological performance and microstructure of physical vapour deposition coatings, laser clad WC/Ni layers and duplex coatings</field><field name="creator">Huang, Shao Wei</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1536</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mathematics of non-classical diffusion</field><field name="creator">Lee, Alexander Iowa</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1554</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of the New South Wales public school system 1989-1991, focused through the role of cluster director</field><field name="creator">Manefield, John M.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1621</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Private computer training in Papua New Guinea: from chaos to order</field><field name="creator">Sinebare, Musawe</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1794</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Medical fraud and inappropriate practice in Medibank and Medicare, Australia 1975-1995</field><field name="creator">Flynn, Kathryn</field><field name="description">The Australian system of universal health insurance has enjoyed great electoral popularity but the system has been open to abuse and has been beset by administrative inertia, a reluctance by governments to establish reliable estimates of the extent of fraud and overservicing, lack of adequate legislative policy and a very low rate of prosecutions.The aim of this research is to provide an historical and sociological account of institutional responses to medical fraud and overservicing and the media&#8217;s engagement with this issue over twenty years from 1975 to 1995.Archival sources and interviews with key politicians, public servants and whistleblowers are used to tell the story of how universal health insurance was accepted as a necessary part of the social fabric from the introduction of the Pensioners Medical Scheme in 1951, Medibank in 1975 and Medicare in 1984 but measures to deal with the financial abuse of these systems did not have the same priority. The pathology industry provided the greatest scope for illicit profits through offers of kickbacks and inducements from pathology companies to referring general practitioners and this practice fuelled the growth of entrepreneurial medicine. Whistleblowers in the late 1970s and early 1980s campaigned for legislative and administrative change, but the reform agenda was more successful when it was led by a managing director of the Health Insurance Commission committed to change. These events are contextualised by several theoretical perspectives, including Foucault&#8217;s theory of governmentality, the sociology of insurance and of whistleblowing.The challenges for the 21st century are to maintain the level of resources needed to provide the intensive policing required for the regulation of the financial abuse of medical benefits particularly in the area of electronic fraud and sophisticated criminal fraud.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2071</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Detection and differentiation of species in the family Sarcocystidae Poche, 1913</field><field name="creator">Johnson, Alan Murray</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2159</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of children's non-narrative writing in a year 6/7 classroom</field><field name="creator">Wildash-Campagna, Helen Charlotte</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2339</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A generic tele-robotic task level interface to an ADepartmentrobot arm utilising the World Wide Web</field><field name="creator">Hartfiel, Simon Francis</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2577</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of the presence of the first level practitioners in wards and the changing role of the nurse unit managers</field><field name="creator">Podmore, Trudy</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2606</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The game of expertise: investigating the use of science in a professional disciplinary setting</field><field name="creator">Wallace, Margaret Christina</field><field name="description">The thesis aims to examine and understand what takes place when a statutory authority, responsible for regulating the practice of a particular set of clinicians (nurses and midwives), claims to use the principles of evidence-based practice to scrutinise the practice of an authorised clinician. It reports on the results of a thematic analysis of the reasons for decision, findings, and transcripts of the New South Wales Nurses&#8217; Tribunal hearings into allegations of professional misconduct made against homebirth midwife Maggie Lecky Thompson in the period 1996 to 1998.This thesis is about the connection between the scientific basis for health care and the way that this type of knowledge is used to make judgements about the acceptability or otherwise of the care provided by a health care professional. The research takes as a starting point the development of evidence-based practice in health care and the use of empirically supported guidelines to direct care decisions. It acknowledges the socially constructed and contingent nature of such knowledge.Themes were derived from the conceptual framework of the &#8216;Game board of expertise&#8217; developed by Sheila Jasanoff, a sociology of scientific knowledge scholar. These themes provide organisers that enable analysis and understanding of the tactics deployed by both, the complainant, the New South Wales Health Care Complaints Commission, and the respondent, Maggie Lecky Thompson in their presentation, construction and deconstruction of scientific evidence as mediated by each party&#8217;s expert witnesses. When viewed from the perspective of the findings and &#8216;reasons for decision&#8217; of each of the two relevant NSW Nurses&#8217; Tribunal hearings, this thematic analysis provides insights to the rationale for the deployment of particular strategic manoeuvres by the protagonists in this legal action.The analysis reveals that the themes of neutrality, credibility, objectivity, framing choices, standards of admissibility, and form and function were extant in the transcripts, findings, or reasons for findings of the NSW Nurses&#8217; Tribunal hearings into allegations of professional misconduct made against midwife Maggie Lecky Thompson. There was no evidence of one remaining theme, judicial predilection, in the public documents available in relation to these hearings.Jasanoff&#8217;s &#8216;Game board of expertise&#8217; is a tool that assists in the analysis of the processes of &#8216;constructing&#8217; scientific facts and moulding them to the particular purposes of each of the protagonists to a legal dispute. This type of analysis is a potentially useful tool for understanding the process by which one voice, usually the scientific voice, is privileged over others and also how opposing points of view are subjugated.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/854</field></doc><doc><field

name="description">Worldwide nanotechnology is a major focus in science and technology, and most research in this area deals with chemical, physical and biological issues or a combination of these areas, but to date very little work has been undertaken on mathematical modelling. Rather than employing large-scale computations using molecular dynamics simulation, in this thesis elementary mechanical principles and classical applied mathematical modelling procedures are utilised to examine three specific areas in nanotechnology.Firstly, the Lennard-Jones potential function for the non-bonded interaction potential energy between two molecules and the continuum approximation, which assumes that the interatomic interactions can be modelled by smearing the atoms uniformly across surfaces, are undertaken to investigate the mechanical properties of certain nanostructures, namely double-walled carbon nanotubes, nanopeapods, nanocones and carbon onions. O wing to their special mechanical, electrical and thermal properties, these nanostructures promise many applications for future nanoscale devices, such as nano-bearings and nano-oscillators. This thesis examines issues regarding nano-oscillators constructed from these nanostructures. In particular, the van derWaals interaction energy, the suction energy, the o&#174; set location and the oscillatory behaviour are determined. Analytical expressions are obtained as a function of the radii and the lengths of the structures. In addition, all the predicted mechanical properties derived here are in excellent agreement with results from molecular dynamics simulations.The second area is the joining of nanostructures by invoking the principle that the atoms arrange themselves in such a way that the total squared deviation of the distance between atoms at the junction and some ideal bond length is a minimum. Initially, toroidal molecules are described, which are formed from three distinct carbon nanotube sections, through minimisation of the total squared deviation of the distance between two carbon atoms at the junction from the ideal physical bond length. Representative formulae for the mean generating toroidal radius and tube radius of the tori are determined. Following this is to determine the perpendicular joining structures for carbon nanotubes and flat graphene by two least squares approaches, which are the variation in bond length and the variation in bond angle. Such a combined structure might constitute a transmission platform for ultra small computer chips. Given that the corresponding boron nitride nanostructures are also good semiconductors, the corresponding combined structures are also determined. However, the essential mathematical ideas for combining boron nitride structures are quite different to those required for connecting the corresponding carbon structures, since only rings with an even number of sides are energetically favourable.The third area in this thesis involves the elastic model of carbon nanotubes. Here, carbon nanotubes are assumed to be modelled as transversely isotropic linearly elastic materials which have the same properties in one plane, but vary in the normal direction to this plane. The equilibrium equations are derived and they can be shown to generalise those for isotropic materials. Further, wave-like deformations on the outer-most surface of the oscillating carbon nanotubes are investigated. On neglecting any frictional effects and assuming that the inner surface atoms of the outer tube and those located on the outer surface of the inner tube dominate the van der Waals force, expressions for displacements in the r- and z-directions are obtained.The major contribution of this thesis is the use of conventional applied mathe- matical modelling techniques to formulate analytical expressions for nanostructures. Broadly three mechanical issues are studied, including (i) van der Waals interaction energy and oscillatory behaviour for nanostructures, (ii) geometry of combining two nanostructures and (iii) deformation of carbon nanotubes as transversely isotropic materials. However, many of the theoretical structures proposed here have yet to be confirmed either experimentally or by molecular dynamics simulations; and as such the work might be considered as a first step to settling some of the important physical principles in nanotechnology. In summary, the new elements of the thesis comprise:&#8226;	Analytical expressions to determine the equilibrium locations, force distributions and oscillatory behaviours for nested nanostructures,&#8226;	Simple least squares methods to connect two nanostructures,&#8226;	Elastic model for the deformations of double-walled carbon nanotubes.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/51</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Surface coatings for 3-piece freight bogie centre bearings</field><field name="creator">Franklin, Matthew J</field><field name="description">The research is divided into four related sections of work. The first relates to the rim wall wear of the existing unlubricated steel, and polyethylene centre bearing components. Based on these findings, the second and third sections of work includes materials characterisation of alternative centre bearing surfaces - plasma nitrided molybdenum steel and stellite 6 laser clad layers, respectively. Finally, in the last section of work, the reciprocating pin-on-plate wear test method is used to evaluate the friction and wear of the existing and alternative centre bearing materials. The worn dimensions of the AISI 1053 steel, Hadfield steel, and polyethylene centre bearing components were determined. The wear of the high density polyethylene centre bowl liner was negligible. The rim wall wear of the unlubricated steel components was greatest in the longitudinal direction, whilst there was negligible wear in the lateral direction. The average wear depth rate for the AISI 1053 steel top centre was approximately twice that of the Hadfield steel centre bowl liner. The cross-sectional microhardness and microstructure of one worn AISI 1053 steel top centre and two worn Hadfield steel centre bowl liners were determined. The worn Hadfield steel centre bowl liners showed significant near surface work hardening. The wear mechanism for the AISI 1053 steel top centre was plastic strain accumulation in conjunction with low cycle fatigue. The quench and tempered AISI 4016 molybdenum steel samples were plasma nitrided at 450, 500, 550 and 580 &#61616;C using 75% N2: 25% H2 mixture gas for 5 hours. The microstructures of the coatings were determined using optical microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. The treated samples were characterised using x-ray diffraction and vi microhardness. The optimum condition for this material was achieved at the temperature of 500 0C. Stellite 6 multi-track layers were laser clad onto mild and AISI 4016 steel substrates with a continuous wave Nd:YAG laser at 1800 W laser source power using four different processing speeds: 600, 900, 1200, and 1500 mm/min. The laser power, defocused laser spot size, and powder feed rate were held constant. The clad samples were characterised using optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in conjunction with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Microhardness profiles of the clad layers and heat affected zones were determined. For both substrates the optimum processing speed is between 600 and 900 mm/min. Wear testing of Hadfield pin - AISI 1053 steel plate, Hadfield pin - untreated AISI 4016 steel plate, HDPE pin &#8211; Hadfield steel plate, Hadfield pin - plasma nitrided AISI 4016 steel (500 &#176;C) plate, and Hadfield pin &#8211; laser clad Stellite 6 (600 mm/min) plate material pairs was conducted using the pin-on-plate reciprocating wear test method. The wear test conditions provided a good simulation of the rim wall operating conditions for the Hadfield steel pin &#8211; plasma nitrided AISI 4016 steel (500 &#176;C) plate and Hadfield steel pin &#8211; laser clad Stellite 6 (600 mm/min) plate material pairs. The Hadfield steel pin &#8211; nitrided AISI 4016 steel (500 &#176;C) plate material pair had the lowest wear under these wear test conditions, whilst it&#8217;s co-efficient of friction of 0.57 would make it suitable for use in lightly loaded (50 ton wagon mass) 3-piece freight bogies.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/138</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of chiral conducting polymers for asymmetric electrosynthesis</field><field name="creator">Pornputtkul, Yingpit</field><field name="description">This thesis describes novel synthetic routes and characterization of chiral conducting polymers based on aniline and substituted anilines that have potential applications in the areas of asymmetric electrosynthesis and chiral separations. Ionic liquids and novel chiral ionic liquids are used as novel electrolytes for the polymer synthesis and for improvement of the electrochemical stability of chiral polyaniline doped with (+)-10- camphorsulfonic acid. Electroorganic syntheses using bare or chiral polyaniline modified electrodes in ionic liquids or chiral ionic liquid electrolytes are explored. Following an Introduction and a General Experimental Chapter, the new studies are described in Chapters 3 to 10.Chapter 3 reports a novel route to prepare optically active emeraldine salts via thermal treatment. Emeraldine base films were prepared by alkaline de-doping of PAn.HCl emeraldine salt films electrochemically deposited or chemically prepared. Chemically prepared emeraldine base films were cast onto glass slides from NMP solution. Redoping these films with aqueous (+)-10-camphorsulfonic acid (1.0 M (+)-HCSA) gave optically inactive PAn.(+)-HCSA films. Significantly, after heat treatment at 170&#176;C, optically active polyaniline were generated, as evidenced by their circular dichroism spectra. This is believed to be due to the polyaniline chains preferentially adopting a one-handed helix under the influence of the chiral dopant CSA- anion during heating of the films at temperatures above the glass transition temperature (Tg) of polyaniline.An unprecedented route to optically active polyanilines from achiral reagents using a chiral emeraldine salt inducer is described in Chapter 4. This acromolecular asymmetric proliferation is performed via electrochemical polymerization of aniline in racemic (e.g. (&#177;)-HCSA) or achiral (e.g. HCl and p-TSA) acid solutions using a thin film of chiral PAn.(+)-HCSA or PAn.(-)-HCSA pre-electrodeposited on the working electrode as a chiral inducer. The thin film of PAn.(+)-HCSA or PAn.(-)-HCSA was deposited on ITO-coated glass electrodes using 25 mC/cm2 electrodeposition charge, giving a thickness of ca. 100 nm. Remarkably, strongly optically active PAn.HA films of the same hand as the chiral inducer were produced during the second stage electrodepositions (another 100 mC/cm2) using (&#177;)-HCSA or achiral acids. A possible mechanism for this chiral induction is discussed. Experiments using deposition charges of between 50 and 300 mC/cm2 in the second electrodeposition showed that induction by the thin PAn.(+)-HCSA film occurred undiminished for final films as thick as 700 nm. This novel asymmetric synthesis method presents potential applications such as using thin chiral polyaniline films as inducers for the electrochemical asymmetric synthesis of other chiral conducting polymers. The fully sulfonated polyaniline poly(2-methoxyaniline-5-sulfonic acid) (PMAS) was found in Chapter 5 to be remarkably resistant to alkaline de-doping, even in 3 M NaOH or conc. NH4OH. Instead of de-doping to the corresponding emeraldine base, UVvisible spectral studies showed that a change of conformation for the polyaniline chains from an &#8220;extended coil&#8221; to a &#8220;compact coil&#8221; arrangement occurred. However, when the sterically crowed amines tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (Bu4NOH) and diisopropylamine were added to aqueous PMAS, de-doping of the &#8220;compact coil&#8221; emeraldine salt to emeraldine base was observed (pH &#8805;11.5), as evidenced by the appearance of a characteristic absorption band at ca. 630 nm. The resistance to dedoping in NaOH and NH4OH may therefore be associated with the electrostatic binding of the relatively small Na+ and NH4 + ions to sulfonate (SO3 -) groups on the PMAS chains, which is sterically hindered for the larger ammonium ions. The redox switching properties of PMAS were also investigated in Chapter 5. The oxidation behaviour of PMAS was similar to that previously observed for unsubstituted polyaniline. However, an unexpected sharp peak at 408 nm was observed for the reduced leucoemeraldine base (LB) form of PMAS generated by treatment with aqueous hydrazine, together with the usual 330 nm peak of LB assigned as a &#960;-&#960;* transition. Thermochromism and solvatochromism of the reduced PMAS species was observed involving reversible interconversion between the 408 nm and 330 nm species. These phenomena may involve a  earrangement of the PMAS eucoemeraldine base chains between two conformations.A novel chiral composite is prepared in Chapter 6 by mixing aqueous solutions of PMAS and poly-L-lysine (PLL) and casting as films. The highest degree of chiral induction in the PMAS-PLL films was observed using a PMAS/PLL molar ratio of 1. The electrical conductivity of the PMAS-PLL (1:1) films was ca. 4 x 10-3 S/cm, an order of magnitude less than PMAS itself. The chiral PLL in the complex is believed to induce optical activity into the main chain of the PMAS moiety, as evidenced by its CD spectrum in visible region. The observed optical activity of the PMAS-PLL films may arise from the PMAS chains adopting a one-handed helical structure due to electrostatic interactions between free sulfonic acid groups on the PMAS with ammonium side chain groups on the PLL. The PMAS-PLL composite films remained optically active during treatment with 1.0 M NH4OH and when reduced with hydrazine or oxidized with ammonium persulfate.The temperature employed in the electrochemical polymerization of aniline is found in Chapter 7 to have a critical effect upon the chiroptical properties of PAn.(+)-HCSA films deposited on ITO-coated glass from aqueous 0.2 M aniline/1.0 M (+)-HCSA. Films grown at elevated temperatures (35-65&#176;C) have inverted CD spectra compared to analogous films grown at lower temperatures (0-25&#176;C). These observations are explained in terms of a temperature-induced interconversion between two diastereomeric emeraldine salt products during the doping of the growing polyaniline chains with the chiral (+)-CSA- anion. The critical effect of polymerization temperature found in this study highlights the importance of employing a controlled temperature during electrochemical synthesis of optically active polyanilines.The influence of solvents on the chiroptical properties of PAn.(+)-HCSA emeraldine salt films prepared in ionic liquids are explored in Chapter 8. Polymerizations at high temperature (50-55&#176;C) are required for dissolution of the (+)-HCSA (0.5 M) in all ionic liquids studied, except for (-)-MBEA-TFSI in which solvent HCSA is highly soluble at room temperature. Electroactive polyaniline can be prepared from the electrochemical polymerization of aniline in the presence of (+)-HCSA in the ionic liquids BMI-BF4, BMI-PF6, EMI-TFSI, P13-TFSI and chiral (-)-MBEA-TFSI. Raman spectra of the films generally showed characteristics of meraldine salts, and were very similar to those previously reported for PAn.HCSA synthesized via conventional methods. However, the polymer grown from EMI-TFSI showed different features indicating the presence of unusual chemical structures. These are probably generated by ortho-coupling and crosslinking during electropolymerization. The optical activity of the PAn.(+)-HCSA films grown from EMI-TFSI, BMI-BF4 and P13-TFSI were relatively low, and much less than previously observed for analogous films electrodeposited from aqueous solution, while the emeraldine salt grown from BMI-PF6 was optically inactive. This probably arises from competition between chiral (+)-CSA- and the achiral anions of the ionic liquids (BF4 -, TFSI-, PF6-) as the dopant incorporated into the polymer during polymerization. An attempt to prepare a chiral emeraldine salt from electrochemical polymerization of aniline with racemic (&#177;)-HCSA using the novel chiral ionic liquid (-)-MBEA-TFSI as electrolyte was unsuccessful. Anodic degradation during polymerization at high positive potential (+1.3 V) apparently generated low molecular weight polyaniline oligomers whose length may be too short to maintain a helical structure, as the green product dissolved/dispersed in the polymerization solution.The electrochemical and chiroptical properties of chiral PAn.(+)-HCSA emeraldine salts prepared in aqueous (+)-camphorsulfonic acid and investigated in ionic liquids are explored in Chapter 9. The nature of the ionic liquids employed and the applied potential have a marked effect on the stability of the chiral polyaniline films. Reversible loss of the electroactivity of the PAn.(+)-HCSA films occurred when the polyaniline films were potential cycled in the ionic liquids EMI-TFSI, BMI-PF6 and BMI-BF4. Electrochemical degradation of the polyaniline films occurred in EMI-TFSI and MBEA-TFSI electrolytes when they were polarized at high positive potentials (&gt; +1.1V). However, significantly, in BMI-PF6 and BMI-BF4 electrolytes the optical activity and electrochemical stability of the polyaniline films were retained at potentials as extreme as + 2.0 V. However, cross-linking involving a phenazine-type structure occured when the PAn.(+)-HCSA films were exposed to high positive potentials in BMI-PF6, as evidenced by their Raman spectra. Racemization of the PAn.(+)-HCSA films occurred when electrochemical reduction was carried out in all of the ionic liquids examined except (+)-, (-)-, or (&#177;)-MBEA-TFSI. In the later ionic liquid electrolyte, strong CD signals were observed for the leucoemeraldine base film formed.  Incorporation of the cation from the ionic liquids during the reduction (rather than expulsion of the (+)-CSA- anion) and resultant swelling of the polyaniline films may be the reason for the racemization observed in the other ionic liquids.These are important observations, since they open the possibility of using such PAn.(+)- HCSA films as chiral electrodes in electrochemical asymmetric syntheses in appropriate ionic liquids. BMI-PF6 and BMI-BF4 appear to have potential as electrolytes in electrochemical asymmetric oxidations (e.g. the oxidation of prochiral sulfides to chiral sulfoxides) at high positive potentials, while MBEA-TFSI would appear useful for electrochemical asymmetric reductions (e.g. the reduction of prochiral ketones to chiral alcohols) at very negative potentials.Electroreduction of carbonyl compounds such as acetophenone and acetylpyridine to alcohols and electrooxidation of organosulfides such as methyl 4-nitrophenyl sulfide and methyl-p-tolyl sulfide to the corresponding sulfoxides in ionic liquids are explored in Chapter 10. The expected alcohol products were obtained from potentiostatic reduction of acetophenone and 2-acetylpyridine in EMI-TFSI on glassy carbon electrodes at -1.9 and -1.8 V, respectively. Reduction of 4-acetylpyridine in (-)-MBEATFSI on a glassy carbon electrode at -1.6 V yielded 4-pyridylethanol. However, the optical rotation of the product could not be measured due to interference from the chiral ionic liquid which could not be completely separated from the product. 4- Acetylpyridine was not reduced in (&#177;)-MBEA-TFSI on a PAn.(+)-HCSA modified ITOPt- coated electrode to the corresponding alcohol, the corresponding achiral pinacol being instead formed.Oxidation of methyl 4-nitrophenyl sulfide in EMI-TFSI and methyl-p-tolyl sulfide in BMI-BF4 on glassy carbon electrodes was shown to yield the corresponding sulfoxides products. However, the asymmetric electrosyntheses of these sulfoxides in ionic liquids by using a chiral polyaniline modified electrode was not successful due to oxidative degradation of the polyaniline.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/475</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Systematics of the Australasian Lymnaeidae</field><field name="creator">Puslednik, Louise</field><field name="description">The Lymnaeidae Rafinesque, 1815 are one of the most widespread groups of freshwater snails, however, they are characterised by a long and confused systematic history largely due to problems associated with shell plasticity. Recent molecular studies that have utilised DNA sequences have failed to adequately represent the Australasian lymnaeids. The aim of this study was to understand the systematics of the Australasian Lymnaeidae, using 16S and ITS-2 sequences in tandem with a anatomical and shell studies.The native Australian and New Zealand lymnaeids are currently attributed to Austropeplea Cotton, 1942 and Kutikina Ponder and Waterhouse 1997, which are thought to be represented by three and one species, respectively. Results of this study indicate there are 5 distinct species across three genera. Phylogenetic analyses of the A. tomentosa (Pfeiffer, 1855) complex recovered two distinct species, A. tomentosa in New Zealand and A. huonensis (Tenison-Woods, 1876) in southern Australia. There was however incongruence between the anatomical and molecular phylogenies.  Kutikina hispida was suggested to be closely related to the A. tomentosa complex, however, molecular phylogenies genes resolved K. hispida as sister to A. huonensis, with A. tomentosa being resolved as sister to the A. huonensis + Kutikina clade.  Kutikina was therefore synonymised into Austropeplea based on the molecular phylogenies. Based on molecular and anatomical phylogenies, the more northern complex, A. lessoni (Deshayes, 1830) was more appropriately placed in the Peplimnea (Iredale, 1943), and was found to be represented by two distinct taxa, P. lessoni and P. affinis (K&#252;ster, 1862). Phylogenetic analysis of 16S, ITS-2 and anatomical characters recovered A. viridis (Quoy and Gaimard, 1832) as relatively divergent from other members of Austropeplea. Therefore, A. viridis was placed into Viridigalba Kruglov and Starobogatov, 1985. Using 16S sequences and anatomical characters, a phylogeny of the Lymnaeidae was produced. The Australasian lymnaeids represented one of the most derived groups within the family in both the 16S and anatomical phylogenies. The North American and European lymnaeids were resolved at the base of the lymnaeid phylogeny, suggesting that these taxa represent the older groups within the family.Phylogenies based on molecular sequences suggest that the Austropeplea lessoni complex is more closely related to lymnaeids from South East Asia than to other Australian lymnaeids. Furthermore, based on molecular and anatomical phylogenies, A. viridis is suggested as sister to the A. tomentosa complex. Therefore it is highly likely the A. lessoni complex and A. tomentosa complex have separate derivations.  The monophyly of Radix Montfort, 1810 remains however unresolved.Two theories of biogeography of the Australasian Lymnaeidae have been recently proposed and were examined in light of the new phylogeny. While it seems certain that the Austropeplea lessoni complex had a South East Asian origin, the origin of the A. tomentosa complex is still unclear. The close relationship of the A. tomentosa complex with Asian A. viridis plus the derived position of the group in the family, suggest a second invasion of Australia by lymnaeids from South East Asia. However, the basal position of the New Zealand A. tomentosa would suggest the group occurred here first and moved into Australia, thus suggesting a Gondwanan radiation of the A. tomentosa complex. The discovery of a lymnaeid fossil in Antarctica lends further weight to this theory.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/815</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of financial management practices as a necessary rationalisation for the support of mission in an Australian nonprofit organisation</field><field name="creator">Abraham, Anne</field><field name="description">This study concerns the development of f&#238;nancial management practices in a nonprof&#238;t organisation, Guides NSW, an organization which has its mission as its central focus, and, like other nonprofit organisations, is permeated by its history, its culture and its traditions.In particular, the study addresses the two phenomena of the organisational attitude to f&#238;nancial matters and the dichotomy between short term and long term f&#238;nancial management. As organisational phenomena, it is appropriate to investigate them in their social context.  Although contemporary phenomena, their roots are deeply entrenched in history. Thus, this case study involves both f&#238;eldwork in terms of participant observation and engagement, and also historical analysis of archival records and artifacts.The members and management of the Association view its mission as sacred, but money as secular. Consequently, the consideration of f&#238;nances can only be rationalised when the mission is endangered. Guides can be viewed as a game of life built on the foundation of the Boy Scouts, and influenced by the preferences and predilections of the Founder of both, with players, spectators and umpires all endeavouring to maintain the essential ethos of the game.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/865</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of the response of the coal-mining community of Southern New South Wales to adversity during a period of economic depresssion between 1893 and 1897, in an endeavour to ascertain how unified that community was and the degree to which it provided an effective industrial force in support of the fledgeling political labour movement</field><field name="creator">Fraser, Donald Sinclair</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/879</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"Primitivism" in the West and the East: reflections on contemporary Taiwan</field><field name="creator">Wai-Ming, Wai-Ming</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/911</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Beyond the moons of August</field><field name="creator">Copello, Beatriz</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/916</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lindy Chamberlain: a personal visual response</field><field name="creator">Dawson, Neville</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/921</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re-imaging nature</field><field name="creator">Rosengren, Mary</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/928</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of adventure-based training on team cohesion and psychological skills development in elite sporting teams</field><field name="creator">Boyle, Ian T.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/984</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Images in the 'Looking Glass": self, ethnicity and multiculturalism in contemporary Australia</field><field name="creator">Terry, Leslie John</field><field name="description">During the past two decades the notion of ethnic identity has been discussed vigorously from a range of perspectives in much of the literature in the social sciences. This thesis continues this discussion by examining the ways in which the stories of ethnicity have been and are being told at both the theoretical and everyday levels. Making connections between the life narratives of people from a number of generations in six 'ethnic minority' families in Australia, theoretical insights on ethnicity, and the researcher's own engagement with issues of identity, the thesis highlights (following Butler 1991 on gender identity) the 'performative' nature of ethnic identities or identifications. It argues that while the different ethnicities examined in the study have specific individual and social genealogies, it is in the telling of the life stories that these ethnicities come into being in ways that cannot be reduced to what Bottomley (1997) critically refers to as 'celebratory pluralisms'. Engaging with contemporary writings in the area, the study contributes to a 'non-foundationalist' reading of the ethnic self.Moreover, the thesis suggests that such a reconfigured notion of ethnicity raises important issues for theorists working around concepts such as 'multicultural citizenship' or 'post-multiculturalism'. Consequently, in the final stage of the study some proposals are made about the possible futures for ulticulturalism in Australia, including the need to support the further development of past initiatives in the areas of languages. education and employment. As well as this, it is suggested that 'post-multiculturalisms' will involve, among other things, a continuing response to racism at all levels of society, a connecting up of different social and cultural histories with key social institutions and a recognition of the way in which the new technologies are impacting on established social identitites, as well as an engagement with some critical strands in contemporary social theory. In looking back across the entire text the author of the thesis finds that the idea of the 'looking glass phase' or the 'mirror-stage' as proposed by Jacques Lacan (1977b) comes to mind. This is because, it is suggested, that in narrating the self or the stories of others, whether it be around ethnicities or some other identifications, we are in some ways returning to that original moment when we as infants, in an attempt 'to find a way around certain inescapable factors of lack, absence and incompleteness' (Samp 1992: 65), tried to touch the specular image in the 'looking glass'. However, in contrast to the onedimensional mirror which Lacan formulated, the writer of this thesis concludes by suggesting that in engaging with other ethnicities, he is looking into a three-dimensional mirror in which the image of himself is unpinned by the reflections of his significant others, while images of other people who do not share his ethnicity, such as those whose stories are retold in this text, provide another merging layer in the 'looking glass'. It is subsequently argued that any exploration of the self or the  'Autobiographical I' in the Australian context cannot escape acknowledging that difference has 'entered inalterably' (see Hall in Terry 1995a) into our lives and that such a recognition provides us with a starting point for developing forms of post-multiculturalism which above all are open and reflective.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/992</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The application of advanced management accounting: does it improve company performance?</field><field name="creator">Ghozali, Imam</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Foucauldian analysis of development banking lending practices: a case study of the Fiji development Bank (FDB) 1967-1997</field><field name="creator">Deo, Hemant Narayan</field><field name="description">The Fiji Development Bank (FDB) in its development lending operations has undergone stmctural and cultural changes over the past nimiber of years. This research examines the bank's lending operations for the past thirty years (1967-1997), using a Foucauldian theoretical framework. The history of the bank's development lending practices can be described as discursive formations or discontinuities where the issue of 'land' has dominated the entire development banking (lending) fi-amework. A Foucauldian theoretical firamework brings out the concepts of archaeology and genealogy with builtin power and knowledge effects that are apparent, within the operations of the FDB and which can be interpreted as a disciplinary regime that provides a disciplinary surveiUance of the development banking operations within the Fijian context. The bank was formed in 1967 with two main lending divisions, namely agricultural and commercial, and was set-up to encourage development financing so as to foster the economic growth of Fiji. Therefore, the bank was wiUing to undertake and finance loans with less security undertakings than other commercial banks. This unique financing operation was made possible, to some extent, by govemment subsidies given to the bank. However, in 1994 the bank underwent a dynamic stmctural change with the introduction of the bank's new corporate plan which brought in a new corporate philosophy or culture which was profit-orientated. The bank underwent a massive loan review exercise, (or clean-up process) in relation to its entire lending portfolios: the focus of lending which was traditionally 'volume' - or 'quantity' - based on agricultural lending, also saw a new concept being introduced in the lending process a 'quality' base with a more commercial - lending focus. The corporate plan also changed the names of the lending divisions, which were now called profit centres and which were performance based. The lending officers were also now judged on their given lending portfolios in relation to their job tasks. Various management reports such as the Lending Management Information Systems (LMIS), Performance Appraisal Reports (PAR) and budgets, kept the management informed as to the overall operations of the bank. In relation to the lending process there was a greater disciplinary surveillance provided by the various profit centres to ensure that targets within the set budgets were met. From a Foucauldian perspective it can be appreciated that analysing such a case study brings out a new way of seeing things, and also provides a filtering process whereby the development banking data can be filtered which ultimately leads to a new pathway. This is clearly demonstrated in the thirty years operations of the FDB which is now seen to be more commercially profit orientated in financing its overall development lending.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1007</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Financial characteristics of interest-free banks and conventional banks</field><field name="creator">Al-Sultan, Waleed</field><field name="description">Many countries all over the world currently experience what became known as "Dual Banking" where interest-fi-ee Islamic banks operate side by side with conventional banks. Islamic banks conduct normal business as any conventional bank but do not pay or receive interest. They operate on profit/loss sharing principle. By this, is meant both the supplier of the flinds and the borrower share the risks; both prosper when returns are favorable and suffer together when returns are poor.The literature on Islamic banking and finance though recent is growing fast. Western scholars have begun to show an interest and make substantial contributions. The interdisciplinary nature of the literature offers a challenge.However, there are still numerous questions to be answered, many problems to be solved and a number of challenges to be faced. In particular, empirical work is needed to assess the differences in financial characteristics of interest-free and conventional banks. Also, nothing much has been written about the loan market in a dual banking system. Moreover, very little is known about the attitudes of clients towards Islamic vis-a-vis traditional banks. Furthermore, research on the performance of Islamic banks in individual countries has not received much attention.This thesis is an interdisciplinary study which attempts to make a (very) modest contribution towards filling the gap in the literature. In particular, this study tests for structural differences between the financial characteristics of Islamic and traditional banks. This testing is done through the use of discriminant analysis apphed to a sample of 48 Middle Eastern banks, 12 of which are interest-fi-ee banks. The analysis covers 20 financial ratios which evaluate liquidity, leverage, performance, credit risk, probability and efficiency.This study also tries to model the decision, of a chent facing a dual banking system, to deal with a traditional or an Islamic bank. This is done using logit and probit regression analysis.A simuhaneous equations model is developed and tested using time series data for 18 conventional banks and 12 Islamic banks to examine the performance of the commercial loan market within a dual-banking system.Moreover, this thesis tries to test if the transactions of Islamic banks are really free of all traces of "usury interest". A case study of the Kuwait Finance House is conducted. This involves in-depth analysis of the activities, products and financial statements of this company.The clients' perceptions of Islamic banking are also examined. This is done through the application of factor analysis to survey resuHs collected by the researcher on Kuwaitis' attitudes to Kuwait Finance House, the oldest and largest financial institution operating in Kuwait.The analysis of the evolution of Islamic banks suggest that these banks use the same tools and procedures as traditional (i.e. interest-based) banks in those areas where there is no conflict between banking operations and Islamic principles. Islamic banks have devised (and are still devising) new instruments to enable them to achieve their objectives in accordance with Islamic Laws.The simultaneous equations regression analysis suggests that the price of loans charged by Islamic banks does not exert any significant influence on the demand for commercial loans of the customers of conventional banks. However, the demand for funds offered by Islamic banks is positively cortelated with the rates of interest charged by conventional banks operating within the dual banking system.The logit and probit regression results suggest that the more people adhere to Islamic teachings, the higher the proportion of clients which deals with Islamic banks. The results also suggest that, age, income and occupation, are important factors in deciding which banking system to choose.An analysis of those activities and tools of finance of Kuwait Finance House (KFH), the only Islamic Bank curtently operating in Kuwait, suggests that this company is not a mere bank. It acts as a financier, contractor, lessor, developer and agent.The consumers' survey suggests that 49.3 percent of the respondents bortowed funds from KFH at some time during the last five years, but only 34.5% of the respondents held some type of deposit account with KFH during the time of the survey. The survey also suggests that 51.7 per cent of the respondents prefer to deal with traditional banks rather than KFH.Application of principal component analysis to survey results suggests that variables which motivate customers to deal with KFH rather than traditional banks can be condensed into five factors, namely: religion, traditional services, terms of bortowing. community development and convenience religion. Those respondents who prefer to deal with traditional banks rather than KFH expressed doubts about the interest-free nature of transactions of KFH; fear that their deposits with KFH may not be guaranteed by the Kuwaiti Central Bank, dissatisfaction with curtent restrictions of the application of the profit/loss sharing principle, particularly in the area of personal loans, belief that the transactions of the two type of banks are very similar and feeling each type of bank provide same traditional services.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field

P.</field><field name="description">The results of the research on the development of novel cationic peptoids as potential new antibacterial agents is presented in this thesis. The series of macrocyclic peptoids prepared in this study arises from a previously identified lead which was designed to act as a vancomycin mimic, and possessed many of the features believed to be necessary for antibacterial activity. Chapters 2 and 4 describe the design and synthesis of a number of structurally different cyclised and linear peptoids, which were produced from a multi-step synthetic pathway. The basic strategy involved the synthesis of a hydrophobic scaffold, to which a cationic peptide was attached. Compounds described in Chapter 2 contained two remote allyl substituents which were utilized in the reliable ring-closing metathesis reaction to produce the desired macrocycles. Subsequent removal of the amino acid residue protecting groups yielded the desired targets for antibacterial testing. A total of 163 compounds were synthesized, including 146 new compounds. In Chapters 3 and 5, the results from the antibacterial testing assays against Staphylococcus aureus (Chapters 3 and 5) and several vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) strains (Chapter 5), are discussed and structure-activity trends are highlighted. It was found that for antibacterial activity against both Staphylococcus aureus and VRE strains, a (S)-1,1&#8217;-binaphthyl hydrophobic scaffold must be present (MIC 3.9 &#61549;g/mL against Staphylococcus aureus and 15.6 &#61549;g/mL against the VRE for one such derivative). Chapter 6 reports the screening of several peptoids against the HIV integrase enzyme. From the screening, key structure activity trends were observed and a preliminary computational model indicating the mechanism of binding and inhibition is proposed. Four target compounds were prepared to justify the preliminary model.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1130</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the hydrolysis of metal ions</field><field name="creator">Brown, Paul Leslie</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1179</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of artificial neural networks to water treatment plant operation</field><field name="creator">Mirsepassi, Mir Abdolmehdi</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1224</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of reinforced soil walls in coastal protection</field><field name="creator">Khaniki, Ali Karami</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1225</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Catchment rainfall-runoff computer modelling</field><field name="creator">Sharifi, Forood</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1230</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Computer simulation of progressive failure in soil slopes</field><field name="creator">Bertoldi, Carlo Ernest</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1232</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design of rock bolting systems for underground excavations</field><field name="creator">Chen, Dianmin</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1234</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of Limestone modified cements for high performance concretes</field><field name="creator">Van Khanh, Bui Khanh</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1238</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Semiotic as a logic of action</field><field name="creator">Sykes, Geoffrey</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1287</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Boolean functions in cryptography</field><field name="creator">Qu, Cheng-Xin</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1292</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Banking deregulation, banking/monetary aggregates and monetary policy</field><field name="creator">Darsono,</field><field name="description">The objective of this study is to evaluate the reliability of banking and monetary aggregates as guide to the conduct of monetary policy. Banking aggregates i.e. savings mobilized through the banking system and credit aggregates are analyzed in accordance with searching altemative variables and providing more information needed to facilitate monetary policy.This study found that the possible presence of stmctural breaks for banking and monetary aggregates occurred in response to the second phase of banking deregulation.  With regard to the long mn relationships, this study confirmed the existence of stable long run equilibrium for all banking and monetary aggregates. However, for interest bearing aggregates i.e. savings, credit, modified narrow money and broad money, the stable equilibrium could only be achieved when applying the test procedures which allow for the presence of possible stmctural breaks. It implies that banking deregulation had more impact on interest bearing aggregates than on non interest ones. The latter, particularly currency and narrow money, are needed mainly to support fransactions, therefore they are less responsive to changes in interest rates which under a deregulated system were allowed to reach their market clearing levels.The short run relationships particularly with respect to changes in interest rates display an interesting result. Even though interest rates were statistically significant in explaining the short mn variations of some interest bearing aggregates, however their magnitudes were considered too low to warrant a policy recommendation. In line with savings mobilization which has received considerable attention in the banking deregulation, since interest rates were not effective enough as a measure to stimulate savings, the policy should be more focused on building and maintaining public confidence in the domestic banks. With regard to the implementation of monetary policy, it suggests that indirect monetary instmments which work through affecting the price i.e. interest rates were not effective. Clearly, under a deregulated system, banking and monetary aggregates are less controllable.Banking and monetary aggregates mostly did not perform well in predicting the future course of variables regarded to be the objectives of monetary policy particularly inflation and real income. Nominal currency performs more consistently and statistically significant in explaining the future course of inflation, both in the full sample and sub sample period. Meanwhile none of the banking and monetary aggregates could perform well in explaining real income, particularly in the post banking deregulation sub sample period.Briefly, in the long run banking and monetary aggregates are mostly still reliable as a guide to undertaking monetary policy in Indonesia, provided that stable long run equilibrium for those aggregates and the specified variables still exist regardless of the impact of banking deregulation. However, in terms of relationship with the variables presumed to be the objectives of monetary policy or predictabihty and controllability aspects, currency and narrow money and modified narrow money emerge as the most sensible variables to guide for the conduct of monetary policy.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1314</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Social welfare aspects of development in a transition economy: application to Vietnam</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Dzung The</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1323</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sumner Locke Elliott: writing life</field><field name="creator">Clarke, Sharon</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1376</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The location of transport infrastructure and the policy-making process: post terminals and modal networks for NSW export coal in the post 1970s</field><field name="creator">Everett, Sophia A.M.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1390</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pneumatic conveying of bulk solids</field><field name="creator">Wypych, P.

Exploring how whiteness manifests itself, how it permeates as epistemic blank spots into the actions of those promoting respect and recognition, is used as a basis to reflect on social justice in contemporary society.The emerging field of critical whiteness studies provides a solid foundation to engage with whiteness. Scholarship on the hegemony of technological discourse is drawn from to extend on this foundation. The notion of human history as a history of progress and the associated scientific hierarchisation of knowledges is rooted in relations of power|knowledge that perpetuate culturally inappropriate colonial relationships.1 Gene Sharp&#8217;s work on consent theories of power and Jacques Ellul&#8217;s engagement with Technological Society are engaged with to explore how such hierarchisation of knowledges is maintained. The pervasiveness of this relation is explored in three case studies to reflect on the implications.Engagement with white interpretations of the 1966 walk-out of Aboriginal stockworkers and their families at Wave Hill provides an historical grounding of contemporary whiteness. Interpretations of the walk-out as a strike that later shifted in focus, counter to oral historical accounts, are used as a basis to consider how manifestations of whiteness in Australia have shifted in the last 40 years. The 2001 formation of the Community Picket at Sandon Point, as a means to oppose a residential proposal, provides a focus for reflecting on whiteness in contemporary Australia. The Picket was established to offer support to the Sandon Point Aboriginal Tent Embassy (SPATE) and promote a progressive variant of &#8216;practical reconciliation&#8217;. Friends of the Red Hill Valley&#8217;s support for Haudenosaunee Treaty rights, in opposing an expressway proposal for the valley, is comparatively engaged with to reflect on contextual variations in how whiteness manifests itself in Australia and Canada. Exposing the actions of white supporters as counter-hegemonic and a challenge to aspects of whiteness whilst unintentionally maintaining unjust colonial relationships at the same time locates some of the challenges for both scholarship and action in the area of social justice. 1 Nikolas Rose, following Foucault and focussing on (self) governance and freedom, refers to the study of such changes as a genealogy (1999: 65-6).</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3025</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On the reception of aboriginal art in German art space</field><field name="creator">Krishnabhakdi-Vasilakis, Friederike</field><field name="description">German art history and ethnology have led to a binary reading of art that has inhibited the exhibition of Aboriginal art as contemporary art in the twentieth and early twenty-first century. This thesis addresses the question of how Australian Aboriginal art is displayed in the institutional spaces of art galleries and museums in Germany. I argue that there is an underlying current in Germany that divides the representation of art into European and &#8220;other&#8221;, particularly Aboriginal art. Within German culture, ethnological museums are ranked differently from art institutional spaces. The art museum or gallery is at the top of the hierarchy, enhancing the self-reflexive notion of culture, while the ethnological museum provides the context against which European, specifically German, identity and culture are pitched. Aboriginal art that is contextualised as ethnographic and not as contemporary continues a Modernist perspective on cultural exchange, one that emphasises an essential difference between European and non-European art in a universal progress of humanity. This essentialising of culture in Germany does not reflect the globalised situation that evokes regional cultural inflections based on experiences and expressions of hybridity and fragmentation.In order to understand how German art institutions and ethnographic museums stand for a Eurocentric art discourse, the thesis analyses the cultural parameters of nineteenth century Germany, the socio-political cataclysm of the Third Reich in the twentieth century, and the reversion to Modernism in its aftermath. In comparison, I outline the exhibition history and reception of Aboriginal art in Australia where the positioning of Indigenous and European traditions has shifted markedly into a postcolonial, postmodern situation since the1980s. My study investigates this categorisation into two entities through Western concepts of literacy and orality. Since the Enlightenment, the Western emphasis on alphabetic literacy as a system superior to oral transmission of knowledge has governed the way we make sense of the world around us. The written word underpins modes of exhibition display and reception, so that representation is read as text. As a consequence, institutions and galleries, as part of visual culture, treat knowledge that is transmitted orally as inferior. This thesis explores strategies that allow the viewing of art outside the conventions of the written word.I examine the modes of display and reception of Aboriginal art through fundamental ideas first put forward by Edward Said in Orientalism (1978), and also through Michel Foucault&#8217;s The Order of Things (1970). My main focus, however, relates to Pierre Bourdieu&#8217;s concepts surrounding Cultural Capital, Symbolic Capital and Symbolic Violence in his publications The Field of Cultural Production (ed. Randal Johnson 1993) and Language and Symbolic Power (trans. by Gino Raymond and Matthew Adamson 1991) which allow an analysis of power relations in cultural exchange within the hierarchies of art institutions.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3029</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A theological critique of the HIPC debt initiative: redefining the sovereign debtor and creditor relationship</field><field name="creator">Moerman, Lee C</field><field name="description">This thesis uses a theological perspective to extend the literature on accounting and accountability as applied to a secular context and provides insights into the role of supranational institutions and poor, indebted countries. In particular, this thesis focuses on the joint International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank (WB) framework for debt relief specifically designed for a group of countries with unpayable external debt and extreme poverty, referred to as the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Debt Initiative. Despite continued intervention, the HIPC Debt Initiative has failed to deliver debt relief and achieve poverty alleviation. This thesis provides analyses of this failure from a theological perspective and provides new insights and possibilities.  A theological perspective provides an alternate critique of the assumptions of the HIPC Debt Initiative. This thesis uses Jubilee Law as theory, as it explicitly focuses on the debtor/creditor relationship. In order to analyse the HIPC Debt Initiative, this thesis uses discourse analysis informed by Mannheim&#8217;s sociology of knowledge. This methodology enables an analysis of artefacts, in particular institutional discourse, such as that produced by supranational organisations (IMF and WB). This discourse is explored at three levels of meaning and provides distinct insights to understand the HIPC Debt Initiative and the resultant failure. The Jubilee Law has explicit themes of accountability, stewardship, intragenerational equity, intergenerational equity and notably still uses an economic rationale. These critical themes are used to offer insights into the HIPC Debt Initiative by redefining the debtor and creditor relationship. The redefinition places a new emphasis on the creditor&#8217;s responsibility for debt relief and poverty alleviation. This new perspective shifts the debtor and creditor relationship from one of dependence on the creditor to one of interdependence between the debtor and creditor. This shift does not abrogate the debtor&#8217;s responsibility but this concomitant shift of power offers emancipatory opportunities for poor, indebted countries hitherto not envisaged. The insight from this thesis offers an alternate set of propositions for the framework which offer emancipatory potential.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3030</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The power of positive thinking: the effects of self-esteem, explanatory style, and trait hope on emotional wellbeing</field><field name="creator">Davies, Fiona Jane</field><field name="description">Historically, personality and psychopathology have been viewed as conceptually distinct, but recently there have been calls for integrative models. Similarly, the traditional view of mental disorders has been that they are qualitatively different to normal mental states. However, this view has recently changed with a consensus starting to emerge that emotional wellbeing and psychopathology are on a continuum. In particular, the tripartite model of Clarke and Watson (1994) has been influential in understanding the links between affect and psychopathology, proposing that high negative affectivity is related to both anxiety and depression, and low positive affectivity only to depression. Longitudinal research over multiple time points is needed in order to clarify the above relationships and their trajectories over time, as well as to address the nature of developmental change and stability.Despite this, there is little research available on the link between emotional wellbeing&#8212;particularly specific emotional states such as sadness&#8212;and mental health over time. In addition, many personality variables have been studied in relation to mental health that have not had the same attention in the realm of emotional wellbeing. This thesis examines one such group of variables and their relationship to emotional wellbeing. Appraisal theories suggest a link between emotional states and the perceptions of events, and the variables included in this research come from this tradition. The phrase &#8216;positive thinking&#8217; is used in this thesis to refer to cognitive styles that involve positive appraisals of the self, the world, or the future. The specific constructs studied provide a mix of two well-established and widely studied variables (self-esteem and explanatory style) and one newer and less studied variable (trait hope).  Study 1 examined the cross-sectional relationship between the three positive thinking variables and four emotional states (fear, sadness, hostility, and joviality) among 785 Year 7 students. The results of the confirmatory factor analysis suggest that the three positive thinking variables are distinct, as do the different patterns of relationships between the positive thinking variables and the emotional states.Study 2 included 660 of the same students one year later in order to examine the longitudinal relationship between the positive thinking variables and emotional wellbeing. When all three positive thinking variables were included in the structural equation models, there were unique effects for each variable. Specifically, high self-esteem predicted lower fear and sadness, high trait hope predicted increased joviality, and positive explanatory style predicted lower hostility one year later. The positive thinking variables showed moderate stability over time, broadly consistent with prior research. Overall, the results of this thesis indicate that self-esteem, explanatory style, and trait hope have important and unique effects on emotional wellbeing in early adolescence. These findings have implications for clinical practice, particularly for prevention and early interventions programs for anxiety and depression. The reasons for the specific relationships found in this thesis remain unclear, and further development of the theoretical and research base in this area would be worthwhile.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3038</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The spatial variation of environmental factors on the Illawarra escarpment and their influence on vegetation patterns</field><field name="creator">Ashcroft, Michael B</field><field name="description">Mapping and explaining the distribution of vegetation helps land managers to make systematic conservation planning decisions. This is typically achieved using models that correlate the distribution of species with environmental factors, and can predict the vegetation at unsurveyed locations. These Species Distribution Models (SDMs) have numerous unresolved issues, but serve as a useful first-pass approximation for planning purposes.This thesis investigates some of the uncertainties of SDMs, including the impact of data accuracy, the incorporation of spatial processes, the evaluation of alternative models, and the benefits and challenges of producing models at the landscape scale. The research was conducted on the Illawarra Escarpment, 80 km south of Sydney, Australia (34.4 oS, 150.9 oE). The escarpment contains a north-south trend in eucalypts (Eucalyptus spp.) that cannot be explained in terms of elevation or geology. It also exhibits a patchy distribution of rainforest communities, some unique to the Illawarra. It is not known which environmental factors determine the distribution of either the eucalypts or rainforest species, or how they may respond to a changing climate.Species distributions are sensitive to the accuracy of data used, and yet many models only use elevation as a surrogate for temperature, or use simple elevation sensitive interpolations from weather stations. I collected hourly temperature data from 40 sites on the Illawarra Escarpment, and investigated whether elevation was an adequate surrogate for temperatures in this landscape. I then investigated whether temperature surfaces could be improved by considering other topographic and geographic factors, including exposure to wind, distance to coast, radiation, and the average conditions in the surrounding neighbourhood. Elevation was well correlated with moderate seasonal temperatures (e.g. summer minima and winter maxima), but was poorly correlated with the extreme temperatures (summer maxima, winter minima) that are physiologically limiting for many species. Using neighbourhood influences, exposure to wind and distance to coast improved the accuracy of temperature surfaces, and increased the explanatory performance of vegetation models. I concluded that elevation was not always an adequate surrogate for temperature. Temperatures are also affected by other topographic and geographic factors, and these should be considered when developing models for systematic conservation planning activities.Species distribution models are typically based solely on niche factors. Where spatial processes are included, it is typically by employing autologistic regression, or other techniques that use survey data as a predictor. This precludes the models being used to make predictions in times or places where survey data is unavailable, and reduces ecological explanation because it is an interpolation technique. I used neighbourhood (contextual) indices based on environmental factors as an alternative method to overcome these problems. I demonstrate that contextual indices improve SDMs over purely niche-based models, and are capable of predicting unknown populations in unsurveyed areas. I conclude that contextual indices have numerous advantages over autologistic regression, and can capture a continuum between niche and dispersal limited species.Models that predict how species will respond to climate change either use coarse-scale climate surfaces, or idealised predictions of uniform warming. These methods may dramatically over-estimate extinction risk because they neglect fine-scale variations in warming, and refugia where species can persist despite unfavourable regional conditions. I created fine-scale estimates of warming by combining 35 years of Bureau of Meteorology observations with one year of intensive fine-scale temperature monitoring. I found that warming was greatest at inland locations, at lower elevations, away from streams, and at sites exposed to hot, dry northwesterly winds. As species are biased in the geographic and topographic positions they occupied, some species have experienced more warming than others and are at greater threat from climate change. I concluded that it was important to continue developing methods to downscale coarse-grained climate surfaces, and suggest that the accuracy of this process could be improved by using a range of topographic factors.There are many methods for selecting predictors in SDMs, and the competing models often make highly variable predictions. I addressed this uncertainty by comparing the performance of models with and without a given environmental factor. I found that there was relatively strong support for the geology and winter minimum temperature predictors, as well as predictors based on contextual indices, as there was a significant drop in model performance when these predictors were excluded. In contrast, there was less support for summer maximum temperature, as other temperature predictors could combine to produce similar model performance. Model performance varied more between models for different species than between different predictor combinations for the same species. I concluded that it was inappropriate to assess models based on subjective benchmarks, such as an AUC of more than 0.7. A comparison between competing models for the same species gives a better indication of the validity of the model building procedure.The results of this research provide important insights into the benefits and challenges of creating SDMs at the landscape scale (extent of 10&#8211;200 km). It is a major challenge to obtain spatially and thematically accurate environmental predictors and biotic data at this scale, and studies should include the collection of data to ensure models are adequate. Landscapes will not have as much environmental variation as coarse-scale models, and this will limit the ability to transfer the models to new study areas. However, there are a number of benefits that justify these studies. Producing accurate temperature surfaces at the landscape scale will result in less pseudoreplication and less predictor colinearity. This will improve the robustness of models. Landscape scale studies also allow modellers to capture fine-scale refugia, and this will improve the accuracy of climate change predictions. Finally, many ecological processes operate at a scale that is too fine to be detected with coarse-scale models. Landscape scale models may be the only alternative to detect these processes. There is no optimal scale for SDMs, however, and a future challenge is to better integrate coarse and fine-scale models to make more ecologically robust predictions.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3042</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effective control of cell behavior on conducting polymers</field><field name="creator">Liu, Xiao</field><field name="description">This study explored the potential biomedical applications of polypyrrole (PPy). Electrical and topographic cues have been delivered to cells via composites of these conducting polymers, resulting in the successful control of cell behaviour.It was found that a clinically-relevant electrical stimulation protocol (250 Hz biphasic pulsed-current) delivered directly via PPy/poly(2-methoxy-5-aniline sulfonic acid) (PMAS) films can significantly promote PC12 nerve cell differentiation in the presence of nerve growth factor (NGF), and can initiate reversible neurite sprouting from PC12 cell in the absence of NGF. The ability to promote neural outgrowth on PPy/PMAS has important implications for improving the neural/electrode interface, and this may be used to effect in nerve regeneration.The same biphasic 250 Hz electrical stimulations were applied to a monolayer of endothelial cells on PPy/heparin films, and significantly enhanced endothelial cell migration was observed as a result. Combined with the ease of fabrication on metallic stents and the antithrombotic function of heparin, these materials may be utilized for modification of stents to improve the re-endothelialization process after implantation. Finally, aligned PPy/poly(styrene-&#946;-isobutylene-&#946;-styrene) (SIBS) nanofibrous scaffolds were fabricated by vapor phase depositing PPy onto electrospun SIBS fibrous mats. It was shown that this novel material provided a conductive and biocompatible platform for PC12 cell adhesion and differentiation. Neurite outgrowth was significantly influenced by the aligned fibers. High resolution AFM provided a closer inspection of the neurite outgrowths and revealed interesting physical interactions between the neurites and the aligned fibers. Aligned electroactive PPy/SIBS fibers have potential applications for improving the electrode-cellular interface of neural electrodes by encouraging guided neurite outgrowth toward the electrode through the use of electrical stimulation.The knowledge gained during the course of this study could form the basis for improving the cellular interface of neural electrodes and stents using conducting polymers.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3046</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mir&#243; to music: transformation and cross disciplinary processes</field><field name="creator">Huang, Yuh-Wen</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/922</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New music composition in computer-assisted environments</field><field name="creator">Blinkhorn, Daniel</field><field name="description">The focal point of this DCA thesis is the development of an original body of creative audio and audiovisual work gravitating around computer-assisted compositional environments.

The crisis in Thailand that began in mid 1997 occurred due to a loss of intemational and domestic confidence in the Thai economy arising from the weakness of its financial sector. This in tum is attributed to madequate pmdential regulation that resulted in an excessive stock market boom and a real estate bubble, in which foreign loans were used to finance non-productive investment in land and properties.A dynamic macroeconomic model for the Thai economy was constmcted by emphasizing the impact aspect of the Thai crisis: namely the impact of a jump in the perceived financial risk in investing in the Thai economy; the impact of an increase of short-term flows in financing non-productive investments; and the impact of a collapse in aggregate supply resulting from financial and corporate sector insolvencies. In addition, government policy advocated by the IMF in response to the Thai financial crisis in the initial stage is explicitly analyzed and compared with the Radelet and Sachs (RS) policy approach.The major conclusion from the simulation results presented is that an exogenous shock arising from a temporary increase in the perceived risk of Thai financial assets during the onset of the crisis period, in conjunction with the collapse in aggregate supply as a result of financial and corporate sector insolvencies, can lead to a Severe temporary economic contraction both in domestic demand and supply.Implementing the IMF approach, by tightening monetary and fiscal policies in the initial stage of the crisis, could strengthen the real exchange rate in the short mn but at a potentially high cost. Such a policy contraction contributes to a more protracted decline in aggregate supply and private capital stock, the latter being detrimental for long-term economic growth and aggregate demand. The IMF approach produces more favorable effects in terms of external developments (more stabilized exchange rate), while the RS approach brings about favourable effects upon domestic demand and supply. The simulation results suggest that adopting the RS approach is an appropriate policy option in the short-term, particularly in dealing with such a crisis in the early stage. The RS policy approach eases the crisis in its initial stages arising from the abmpt and severe contraction in domestic demand and supply, but it comes at the cost of the larger depreciation of the real exchange rate than that for the IMF approach. Restmcturing of the financial sector is important but needs a more comprehensive and well-thought-out financial restmcturing plan, otherwise it may lead to a more protracted contraction in economic activities. Encouraging long-term flows is also essential because they can generate a larger accumulation of private capital stock and a higher level of aggregate supply relative to short-term flows.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1318</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Toward a reinforcement-sensitive psychophysiological model for health-related behaviours and health communications</field><field name="creator">Aslam, Mubeen M</field><field name="description">This dissertation explores the hypothesised role of psychobiological personality dimensions in shaping specific health-related behaviours and propositions potential health communications. The primary aim was to investigate Eysenck&#8217;s and Gray&#8217;s personality dimensions in relationship to specific smoking, alcohol-use, substance-use, physical exercise and eating behaviours. Past research has either focussed on a narrow range of behaviours or examined the relation between personality, health behaviours and message interventions insufficiently. It is argued that most health behaviours are a function of psychophysiological processes and social learning, and future research should find them differentially conditionable by appropriate punishment- or reward-oriented messages.The dissertation draws on the Hippocrates-Galen-Avicennic tradition and the works of Pavlov, Skinner, Mowrer, Eysenck and Gray, and examines the previously ignored work of Avicenna on human temperament and emotions. A taxonomy of health-related behaviours and a framework for health communication and behaviour change are presented. The behavioural taxonomy of Indulgent-Denial, Delinquent-Inert, and Escape-Maintenance is assessable by physiological and psychological markers, and corresponds to Eysenck&#8217;s three-dimensional personality structure. The partly validated model explains behavioural variations by composites of nervous conduction and reactivity of behavioural systems in the brain, and also outlines possible communication interventions.The dissertation is anchored in positivism, assuming intrinsic biogenetic influences as the psychophysiological reality. A retrospective Study consisting of a single cross-sectional survey explored the multivariate relationship between the psychobiological personality dimensions and health-related behaviours in a student sample. In line with the protocols approved by the Ethics Committee, two standard personality instruments, the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised and the Sensitivity to Punishment and Sensitivity to Reward Questionnaire, and an especially developed Behavioural Questionnaire provided the self-report measurements. Demographic effects on behavioural and personality variables were discovered by chi-square tests and two-way multivariate analysis of variance respectively, associations between variables were observed by correlational analysis, likelihood of a specific behaviour on the basis of personality variables was examined by a logistic model, and health diagnostic accuracies of personality measures were assessed by Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis.It was found that high Extraversion and high Psychoticism scorers, and so Indulgent and Delinquent Behaviours were more likely to show appetitive associations, whereas high Neuroticism scorers and thereby Escape Behaviours were more likely to show aversive associations. All Eysenckian dimensions revealed low-to-moderate Reward-sensitivity while Neuroticism showed combined strengths of Punishment- and Reward-sensitivity. The intercorrelations of personality dimensions supported Gray that the Eysenckian dimensions probably represent unequal mixtures of Punishment- and Reward-sensitivity. The associations between personality and behaviours indicate Reward-sensitivity and Psychoticism as the most useful personality disorder dimensions, and the research questions the often-attributed role of Extraversion as a cardinal well-being dimension. Statistically and practically significant relationships between Extraversion and alcohol-use, Psychoticism and heavy alcohol-use, Psychoticism and substance-use, Psychoticism and heavy substance-use, and Neuroticism and binge-eating were observed, but the health diagnostic accuracies of personality measures were mostly poor and the correlations and odds ratios between personality and behavioural data were subject to a ceiling effect. The thesis questions whether personality measures may be a data collection method and not a diagnostic test for health-related behaviours. It is argued that personality data alone may be of insufficient diagnostic value in clinical decision-making and healthcare setting.Thus, the dissertation asserts that health-risk behaviours will be best understood when examined in relation to the reinforcement-sensitive behavioural systems in brain and the contexts in which these behaviours occur. A psychophysiological framework of behavioural assessment and modification is advisable instead of strict personality-based models or a one-size-fits-all approach, in view of theoretical and empirical knowledge about the neuronal growth through life, nerve physiology, early childhood development, relationships between conscious and unconscious processes, the anachronistic assumption of immutability of personality traits as risk factors, results of the data analysis and the observation that health-risk behaviours are of different types and should entail differential emotional appeals. The thesis has created an architecture for future behavioural research with an emphasis on systematic punishment- or reward-oriented health communication interventions, an area that has received comparatively little empirical attention.KEY WORDS: Behavioural Epidemiology, Behavioural Medicine, Health Communication, Personality Factors in Health and Behaviour Change, Population Health.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3062</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The road freight industry in New South Wales: associated environmental and safety aspects</field><field name="creator">Scimone, J.

This study investigates the fertility behaviour of 406 Iranian women, randomly selected from three regions of the capital city of Tehran. These women were once married, aged 15-45 years and fertile. Demographic,  socioeconomic, attitudinal and policy-oriented variables relevant to fertility and fertility control behaviour together with psychological factors such as 'subjective norms' were taken into account in order to analyse the issues comprehensively.  Data was collected through a questionnaire, including three scales for 'abortion', 'contraceptive', and 'son preference' with 20 items, and 33 questions which have been recognized as valid, important, and influential on fertility and fertility control behaviour. Alpha Cronbach was calculated for each scale separately and for all items collectively. It revealed a very high 'intercorrelation' and 'internal consistency' among items of each scale and all other items and demonstrated a very distinctive reliability.  Chi-Square test, Analysis of Variance, Multiple and Stepwise Regression analysis were conducted in order to find association, differences, effects and importance of each variable on the sample's attitudes and behaviour towards abortion, contraceptive usage, sex preference and family size.  Demographic and socio-economic factors have significantly differentiated fertility behaviour of the respondent. A significant relationship was found between 'duration of marriage' and 'existing family size' on the one hand, and between 'women's status', as a combined variable, and 'ideal family size' on the other. A similar significant relationship was also found between 'women's status' and 'ideal family size' as well as 'attitudes towards son preference' (p&lt;.01). It has been concluded that 'attitudes towards abortion' and 'contraceptive usage' have mainly been affected by post-war socio-economic circumstances as well as policy-oriented variables.  Multiple and stepwise regression analysis demonstrated 'duration of marriage' -'age at marriage'- as the strongest determinant of family size which accounts for about 62 per cent variation of 'family size' among the respondent. 'Education' as one of 'women's status' variables demonstrated stronger effect on 'family size', 'ideal family size' and 'son preference' than did the other variable, 'occupation'. 'Perceived ideal family size among other families' as a psychological factor, together with 'existing family size' of the respondents was recognized as major determinant of their 'ideal family size' and account for 29 out of 31 percent variation about the 'ideal family size' of the respondent. Data was processed by using SPSS and STATVIEW GRAPHICS statistical packages.  All important and determinant variables and their multidimensional implications on fertility, fertility control and social life are investigated. The findings are discussed with reference to gender differences as well as other structural characteristics of the study site.  The study revealed that 'husbands', 'health workers', 'friends and neighbours' are the most influential groups on fertility related behaviour of the respondents. There are also indicators of a successful family planning program effort on national level population growth control. It has also been asserted that the effectiveness of the programs is due mainly to post-war socio-economic circumstances. Despite this achievement, fertility control behaviour has a long way to be institutionalised and mean time there are some structural components which may favour higher fertility particularly in the absence of an effective family planing program.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1880</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Recycling: theory and reality</field><field name="creator">Sharma, Seeta</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2210</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of the leader: an examination of the influence of ministerial leadership on the growth of six Australian churches from 1978 to 1989</field><field name="creator">Goodhew, Richard Henry</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2215</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Is Australian unemployment Keynesian or neo-classical?: a disequilibrium approach to unemployment</field><field name="creator">Coombes, Trevor Steven</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2285</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Managerial strategy and industrial relations in Telecom Australia</field><field name="creator">Macklin, Robert</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2286</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Automating ban logic</field><field name="creator">Mathuria, Anish</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2795</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Democratic key escrow scheme</field><field name="creator">Man, Chor Wah</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2796</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The deterioration of Gieseler fluidity with time</field><field name="creator">Ruffle, P.

The overall purpose of this study is to investigate the intersection of conservation policies and cultures in and around national park management in Thailand. The objectives of this study are to look at approaches, concepts, and models of natural resource conservation in practices and discourses of the central agencies, local park officials, other official agencies, NGOs and indigenous people. The thesis highlights tensions and contradictions at the local level as national policies are implemented. The thesis results inform proposed strategies for future national park management and local resource conservation and utilization in Thailand. Qualitative research approaches were the most appropriate methodological choice to investigate and analyse perceptions, objectives, values, practices of different groups. Informal conversational interview, semi-structured interview and unstructured direct observation were the techniques for key data collection. Discourse analysis was the main analytical method. The results show that there are two main conservation concepts influencing conservation policy and implementation in and around the national park case study. One concept is the orthodox national park model based on conservation by excluding humans from a conservation area, and the other is a newer conservation concept based on the ideas of sustainability, participation, and biological conservation that accept humans as part of ecosystems. The two different concepts produce different cultures, discourses and practices in the Thai conservation system. A key issue demonstrated in this study is that the orthodox national park model plays a role as a cornerstone and strong influence on the culture of the Thai natural resource conservation system. As a result, the rights, interests, needs and values of indigenous people are marginalised by national park officials in national park management. Although, the new conservation concept that supports interests of indigenous people is accepted in the park policy, in practice it is devalued by the national park officials. The idea and form of the national park cannot be divorced from its social origins. The idea of the national park as a space of wilderness or pristine nature is had to sustain. vii viii Rather, it is a cultural landscape that embodies multiple cultural constructions of people and nature by both park officials and indigenous villagers. There are tensions and contradictions between these cultural groups. The tensions and contradictions are based on different values of the role of park resources for utilization or protection. This study suggests that the villagers and their uses of park resources should be considered to a greater extent on social equality grounds. Their management and use of resources needs to be recognized in local natural resource planning and management. In addition, the park policy makers should renew national park management to integrate with the two different conservation concepts. They should accept the values of villagers who live in and adjacent to the national park and take them into account in national park policy and implementation. In this study, models of joint management are offered as an alternative to current Thai national park management. This can support both the needs and values of villagers and those of ecological conservation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3061</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Orthogonal designs and complementary sequences: constructions and applications for wireless communication</field><field name="creator">Zhao, Ying</field><field name="description">Problems concerned with the algebraic structure and existence of orthogonal designs and complementary sequences with zero aperiodic autocorrelation have long been of interest in combinatorics, coding theory and applied statistics. Over the last few decades, due to an increased demand for wireless services, new technologies have had to be considered since traditional methods are reaching their technical or  financial limits. This has motivated the study of new applications of algebraic structures for wireless communications to improve system performance. For example, space-time block codes (STB Cs) from orthogonal designs for multiple-input multiple-output (M IM O) wireless systems have received a lot of attention due to their inherent orthogonality, which guarantees a full transmit diversity and a simple linear decoding. The objective of this research is to investigate the construction of orthogonal designs and complementary sequences in terms of wireless communication applications. One thread of this thesis is the introduction of amicable orthogonal designs over the real and quaternion domain in the context of STB Cs from orthogonal designs. Another part is the study of Golay complementary sequences and their applications as orthogonal spreading sequences for direct sequence code division multiple access (D S-CD M A) systems. We address the following problems in this thesis: &#178; The current complex orthogonal STB Cs for more than two antennas are not delay optimal or full rate, and even contain many z eros, which will impede their practical implementation. We first introduce some new complex orthogonal codes of order eight with fewer wasted time slots compared to conventional codes. Furthermore, for those complex STB Cs constructed from amicable orthogonal designs containing z eros and irrational numbers in their coefficient matrices, we use the representation theory of Cliord algebras to improve the form of complex orthogonal STB Cs. B y applying this proposed method, we can construct square, maximum rate complex codes with less z eros and no irrational numbers, e.g. transmitted symbols are equally dispersed through transmit antennas. &#178; However, given any arbitrary order and type, many amicable orthogonal designs are left undecided, since they cannot be constructed using current techniques. We thus introduce the concept of orthogonal designs equivalence. By searching all the equivalence classes of orthogonal designs we find new amicable orthogonal designs of order eight. In addition, some undecided cases can be concluded with non-existence after searching all the equivalence classes of an orthogonal design with the same order and type. We then summarize all the existence and non-existence results of amicable orthogonal designs with order eight. &#178; Motivated by the success of space-time block codes from orthogonal designs, we also discuss the construction of amicable orthogonal designs over the quaternion domain (AOD Q ) for their possible applications as space-time-polarization block codes, since the additional polarization diversity can be modelled by means of quaternions. We construct some new AOD Q s using the Kronecker product with real amicable orthogonal designs or real weighing matrices from an amicable family. &#178; Complementary pairs and orthogonal spreading sequences constructed on the basis of complementary sequences have long been studied for channel separation in D S-CD M A systems. H owever, it is hard to generate sequences with both good autocorrelation and cross-correlation properties so as to achieve a good interference performance. We derive a new class of quadri-phase orthogonal spreading sequences from small mutually orthogonal (M O) complementary sets. We then apply a sequence modification method based on choosing a diag- onal H -equivalent matrix to optimize the correlation properties of sequences. The modifed sequences exhibit a reasonable compromise between autocorrela- tion and cross-correlation characteristics, and, as shown through simulations, lead to good performance when used in an asynchronous multi-user CD M A system.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/19</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Isoleucine epimerisation and stable isotope ratio studies of cassowary, megapode and aepyornis eggshells: biogeochemical and palaeonenvironmental implications</field><field name="creator">Clarke, Simon James</field><field name="description">Previous researchers have used the extent of isoleucine epimerisation and stable carbon, oxygen and nitrogen isotope ratios of ostrich (Struthio), emu (Dromaius) and Genyornis eggshells to provide geochronological control and palaeoenvironmental information on the Quaternary sequences from which these sample types are recovered. This thesis expanded this field of research by examining isoleucine epimerisation and the stable isotopes ratios of cassowary (Casuarius), megapode (principally the Australian brushturkey, Alectura lathami) and Aepyornis eggshells. The aims of the research were to (1) increase our understanding of the ancient habitats of Casuarius, megapodes and Aepyornis in order to provide information on how these ecosystems functioned, as well as the nature and timing of the environmental change they have experienced, and (2) to document the amino acid and stable isotope biogeochemistry of avian eggshells in novel contexts in order to better understand the processes that influence these attributes.Samples of Casuarius, Alectura lathami and Aepyornis eggshells were heated at high temperatures (110, 143 and 160 &#186;C). These experiments were used to determine the temperature sensitivity of isoleucine epimerisation in these eggshell types, expressed in terms of Arrhenius parameters, and to characterise the thermal stability of amino acids. In the stratified archaeological sequences of To&#233; Cave, Kria Cave (Ayamaru Plateau, West Papua, Indonesia), Liang Lemdubu and Nabulei Lisa (Aru Islands, Arafura Sea, Indonesia) exposure to short-term high temperature heating events associated with campfires complicated interpretation of the extent of isoleucine epimerisation in Casuarius and megapode eggshells in terms of time and temperature. The extent of isoleucine epimerisation in Alectura lathami eggshells from Hay Cave (northeastern Queensland, Australia) enhanced the geochronological control for this site by clarifying the presence of temporal breaks in the sequence and providing an age estimate for a section of the sequence lacking age control. Late Holocene and Pleistocene populations of Aepyornis eggshells from the southern and southwestern coasts of Madagascar were readily distinguished by the extent of isoleucine epimerisation they exhibit.Relatively high stable carbon and oxygen isotope ratios (_13C and _18O values) in Pleistocene Casuarius eggshells from the Aru Islands were consistent with a weaker monsoon during the Last Glacial Maximum. The absence of this trend in Pleistocene Casuarius eggshells from the Ayamaru Plateau suggested the latter site is less sensitive to fluctuations in monsoon effectiveness. Supported by isotope analyses of modern megapode eggshells, carbon fixed by C3 photosynthesis was identified at the base of the Alectura food chain from the _13C values of Hay Cave megapode eggshells. The interpretation of Alectura eggshell _18O values was complicated by their wide range, and this was most likely a product of the combined effects of evaporation on oxygen isotope ratios and the protracted breeding season. The lack of variation in the _13C and _18O values of Aepyornis eggshells was attributed to subsistence on C3 vegetation and the water of perennial groundwater-fed ponds, whereas enriched nitrogen isotope ratios could be due to a number of factors including the infiltration of seawater into the littoral water table.Overall, the research presented an opportunity to examine the strengths and weaknesses of information extrapolated from isoleucine epimerisation and isotope ratios in avian eggshells in novel taxonomic and geographical settings. The high temperature experiments further documented the taxonomic dependency of the rate of isoleucine epimerisation in avian eggshells and indicated that the temperature sensitivity of this reaction is similar amongst eggshells. Although interpreting the extent of isoleucine epimerisation in eggshells from archaeological sites in terms of time and temperature was readily complicated by exposure to campfire heating events, the ability to demonstrate a close correlation with independent age control indicated that this problem is not ubiquitous in these contexts. The _13C values of eggshells broadly identified the vegetation that herbivorous birds consumed, and where the photosynthetic pathway of this vegetation was known, eggshell _13C values provided information on the _13C value of this biomass. The nitrogen isotope ratios of eggshells could be successfully integrated with existing knowledge of ancient habitats, and eggshell _ values were used to identify drinking water sources and trace climatically-significant changes in these reservoirs over time.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/389</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Enhancement of connectivity and flux pinning in MgB2 superconducting bulks and wires</field><field name="creator">Lu, Lin</field><field name="description">The objective of this work is to improve the connectivity and flux pinning and hence to enhance the critical current density of MgB2 superconductor by the development of following processes and techniques: densification and use of excess Mg addition, substitution and inclusion by doping with nano C, nano-SiC or carbon nanotube (CNT) and BN. Firstly, a new, direct Mg-diffusion method to synthesize highly dense pure MgB2 bulks has been developed, in which pressed boron bulks are separately packed in sealed iron tubes that have been filled with magnesium powder and then sintered at high temperature over a long period. The influence of the bulk density on the superconducting properties of MgB2 has been investigated through synthesizing bulks with different densities, using a combination of diffusion and the in-situ method. This method is easily applicable to the fabrication of highly dense MgB2 bulks and tape-shaped samples. It was found that the connectivity was significantly improved as the effective area (AF) varied from 0.2 (conventional in-situ) to 0.42 (diffusion), hence the self-field critical current density, Jc, is significantly improved compared with conventional porous MgB2 bulks made by the in-situ method. A sample reacted at 850 &#176;C for 10 hrs exhibited Jc of 1.2 MA/cm2 at 20 K in self-field. Secondly, a novel artificial pinning centre method has been developed by using thermal strain to induce defects in MgB2 superconductors. Strain engineering has been used previously to modify material properties in ferroelectric, superconducting, and ferromagnetic thin films8. The advantage of strain engineering is that it can achieve unexpected enhancement in certain properties, for example, it can&#172; increase the ferroelectric critical temperature, Tc, by 300 to 500&#61616;C, with a minimum detrimental effect on the intrinsic properties of the material. Strain engineering has been largely applied to materials in thin film form, where the strain is generated as a result of lattice mismatch between the substrate and component film, or between layers in multilayer structures.  The residual thermal stress/strain has been observed in dense SiC-MgB2 superconductor composites prepared by the diffusion method.  The thermal strain caused by the different thermal expansion coefficients (&#945;) between the MgB2 and SiC phases is responsible for the significant improvement in the critical current, Jc,  the irreversibility field, Hirr, and the upper critical field, Hc2, in the SiC-MgB2 composite. In contrast to the common practice of improving the Jc and Hc2 of MgB2 through chemical substitution, SiC-MgB2 composite shows only a small drop in Tc and little increase in resistivity but exhibits a significant improvement over the Jc and Hc2 of conventional MgB2 due to the advantage of residual thermal strains. The present findings open up a new direction for manipulation of material properties through strain engineering in materials in various forms.Another part of the work in this thesis was on MgB2 bulks and wires that were fabricated by in-situ solid state reaction and the powder-in-tube method, respectively. The effects of excess Mg on the structure and physical properties, such as the lattice parameters, the critical temperature (Tc), the critical current (Jc), the irreversibility field (Hirr), and the upper critical field (Hc2), have been detailed. It was found that Jc, Hirr, and Hc2 were significantly enhanced for Mg excess samples. All these properties were highly sensitive to the processing temperature for the Mg excess samples, while there was only a weak dependence on processing temperature for normal ones. For the bulks, the Tc variation for the 10% Mg excess sample was 1.6 K (36.3 K to 37.9 K) when the sintering temperature was changed from 650oC to 850oC, while it only varied by 0.5 K (37.2 K to 37.7 K) for the normal sample. The low field Jc for the 10% Mg excess samples sintered at 750oC increased by a factor of 3, compared to that for the normal MgB2 sample, while the Hc2 for the 10% Mg excess samples sintered at 650oC reached 8.7 T at 25 K, compared to 6.6 T for the normal sample. Rietveld refinement x-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis showed that the MgO content was reduced in 10% excess Mg samples, leading to an increase in the effective cross section of the superconductor. MgB2 / Fe wires with 10 at% excess Mg produced by in-situ powder-in-tube processing were compared with normal stoichiometric MgB2 / Fe wires prepared by the same method. It was found that the critical current (Jc) and the irreversibility field (Hirr) were significantly enhanced for MgB2 / Fe wires with excess Mg. The transport Jc for 10 at% Mg excess samples sintered at 800oC, measured in fields up to 14 T, increased by a factor of 2 compared to that for the normal MgB2 wires. The best Jc results for a 10 at% Mg excess sample were obtained by heating the sample for 1 h at 600 &#9702;C, resulting in Jc for a field of  8 T and a temperature of 10 K that reached 3 &#215; 104 A/cm2. A detailed analysis of the effects of excess Mg on the microstructures, the Jc, and the Hirr of MgB2/Fe wires is presented in this thesis.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/829</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An econometric analysis of Thai stock market in the context of global stock market integration</field><field name="creator">Chancharat, Surachai</field><field name="description">This thesis provides an econometric analysis of the Thai stock market in the context of global stock market integration. Chapter 3 examines whether stock prices for 16 countries are trend stationary or follow a random walk process using the Zivot and Andrews (1992) and Lumsdaine and Papell (1997) tests and monthly data spanning December 1987 to April 2007. With one and two structural breaks, the Zivot and Andrews and Lumsdaine and Papell test results provide evidence in favor of the random walk hypothesis in 12 and 11 countries, respectively, out of 16 countries. Thus, based on the empirical results in this chapter, the stock market price indices in the majority of countries analyzed exhibit a random walk. In addition, the key structural break in most of the cases points to the Asian crisis over the period 1996-1998. Chapter 4 investigates the existence of cointegration and causality between the stock market price indices of Thailand and its major trading partners (Australia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, the United Kingdom and the United States), using monthly data spanning December 1987 to December 2005. Both the Engle-Granger two-step procedure (assuming no structural breaks) and the Gregory and Hansen (1996) test (allowing for one structural break) provide no evidence of a long-run relationship between the stock prices of Thailand and these countries. Based on the empirical results obtained from these two residual-based cointegration tests, potential long-run benefits exist from diversifying the investment portfolios internationally to reduce the associated systematic risks across countries. However, in the short run, three unidirectional Granger causalities run from the stock returns of Hong Kong, the Philippines and the United Kingdom to those of Thailand, pair-wise. Furthermore, there are two unidirectional causalities running from the stock returns of Thailand to those of Indonesia and the United States. The results also found empirical evidence of bidirectional Granger causality, suggesting that the stock returns of Thailand and three of its neighboring countries (Malaysia, Singapore and Taiwan) are interrelated. Chapter 5 explores the relationships between stock market returns of 13 countries based upon monthly data (December 1987 to April 2007). Specifically, the principal component and maximum likelihood methods are used to examine any discernable patterns of stock market co-movements. Factor analysis provides evidence that stock returns in a number of Asian countries are highly correlated and, based on the resulting robust factor loadings, they form the first well-defined common factor. The results also find consistent results (based on both the principal component and maximum likelihood methods) suggesting that the stock returns of all global developed economy stock markets are also highly correlated, and constitute the second factor. That means, inter alia, geographical proximity and the level of economic development do matter when it comes to co-movements of stock returns and this has important implications for financial portfolio diversification if the aim is to reduce systematic risks across countries. Chapter 6 analyzes how 15 international stock markets and five key Thai macroeconomic variables influenced monthly stock market returns in Thailand in the pre- and post-1997 Asian crisis eras. The results indicate that the Singapore stock market influenced the Thai stock market significantly in both the pre- and post-1997 periods. Before 1997 the Indonesian and Malaysian stock markets were significantly related to the Thai stock market, whereas after the crisis Korea and the Philippines played a dominant role in explaining sources of variation in the monthly returns in the Thai stock market. Therefore, to a large extent, one may conclude that the Thai stock market is very much influenced by the performance of its neighboring countries&#8217; stock markets, but non regional markets exerted an insignificant effect. This goes some way to explaining why the financial crisis of 1997 remained a primarily regional crisis.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/835</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Coordination mechanisms for self-interested multi-agent systems</field><field name="creator">Bai, Quan</field><field name="description">A multi-agent system (MAS) is a collection of agents that interact with each other. Multi-agent systems (MASs) can be classi&#175;ed as self-interested MASs and cooperative MASs according to the features of agent goals. Coordination is one of the major issues of MAS research. It plays a central role in MASs to ensure agents achieve interactions properly. Today, the remarkable growth of MAS applications brings higher requirements and more challenges to agent coordinations. Many complex applications require a MAS to include various agents to work together under an open and dynamic environment.Toward some challenges in current agent coordination research, this thesis deeply investigates agent coordination problems in self-interested MASs, and proposes three coordination mechanisms based on three different methodologies. Firstly, this thesis investigates the use of Coloured Petri Net techniques in agent coordinations. As one of the best modelling tools, Coloured Petri Nets can express a great range of concurrent systems and interactions in graphical representations and well-de&#175;ned semantics, and allow formal analysis and transformations. In the thesis, a coordination mechanism that uses Coloured Petri Nets to model inter- action protocols of agents is proposed and implemented. This mechanism allows interaction protocols to be separated from hard-coded agents. The separation of agents and interaction protocols makes it possible to allow agents to evaluate and select protocols before they operate interactions. Furthermore, a Coloured Petri Net based approach that allows agents to propose, exchange and evaluate inter-action protocols is also introduced in this thesis. By citing Coloured Petri-Net techniques in agent coordinations, agents have more &#176;exible and rational interactions. Secondly, this thesis proposes a &#176;exible team formation mechanism for self-interested agents. In this mechanism, agents can evaluate the performance and importance of other agents in the system, and select team members with reasonable terms and costs according to the evaluation result automatically. Comparing with some traditional team formation mechanisms, the flexible team formation mechanism makes agent team compositions more reasonable, and avoids some potential benefit conflicts among self-interested team members (more suitable for self-interested agents). Finally, a knowledge level coordination mechanism that uses of ontologies to describe and manage MAS knowledge is introduced in this thesis. By using ontologies, MAS knowledge can be described and organised in hierarchies, and the dynamic features of independent knowledge sources are captured.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field

inferences</field><field name="creator">Brittle, Shane Anthony</field><field name="description">Concern in the United States over fiscal and current account deficits during the 1980s led to arguments that these deficits were linked, or &#8220;twins&#8221;. The Reagan Administration conducted an expansionary fiscal policy by cutting taxes, which was not accommodated by monetary policy. This placed upward pressure on US interest rates &#8211; which subsequently boosted the US dollar. The exchange rate appreciation led to a fall in net exports and a rise in the US current account deficit. Under these circumstances, the current account appeared to mirror the fiscal position, leading to the popularisation of the twin deficits hypothesis.Similar concerns were also held in Australia. Following the depreciation of the Australian dollar after its float in December 1983, the remainder of the decade saw a widening of the current account deficit; while net foreign debt increased from around 6 per cent of GDP in June 1981 to 32 per cent five years later. This led to both political and community unease over the large current account and rising stock of net foreign debt. Policymakers subsequently focused on fiscal consolidation as a means of reducing the current account deficit &#8211; leading to the establishment of policies such as the trilogy commitments in the Commonwealth&#8217;s 1985-86 Budget.An antonym to the twin deficit argument is provided by Ricardian equivalence, which asserts that deficits merely postpone taxes, and through the actions of altruistically motivated individuals, budget deficits have no real affects on the economy &#8211; including the current account. Australian academics during the late 1980s and early 1990s such as Makin (1988), Pitchford (1989) and Corden (1991) also challenged the notion that Australia&#8217;s level of net foreign debt and the current account were concerns for fiscal policy. They argued that private sector investment and saving decisions were made by optimising private individuals and organisations, with any benefits or costs of these decisions being a matter for these private agents.Research interest in fiscal policy waned over the 1990s, and for the most part of the 2000s, as monetary policy assumed the role of stabilising short-term fluctuations in prices and output in most advanced economies. Fiscal policy was left to focus upon the medium-term sustainability of government balance sheets, which for Australia was reflected in the introduction of the Charter of Budget Honesty Act by the Howard Government, and the adoption of its medium-term fiscal strategy.More recently, the sharp economic downturn associated with the global financial and economic crises of 2008 and 2009 has seen fiscal stimulus packages enacted in many countries, and a renewed interest in activist fiscal policy.  With little empirical knowledge on the efficacy of fiscal policy in modern economies, recent discretionary fiscal policies have been enacted without a thorough understanding of the potency of these policy actions &#8211; particularly given the marked structural changes in many developed economies over the past two decades (such as the increased integration of global product and financial markets).The purpose of this thesis is to provide an assessment of the potential efficacy of fiscal policy in Australia as a countercyclical policy tool. More specifically, the thesis considers whether private saving behaves in a manner that is consistent with Ricardian equivalence, thus mitigating the effects of fiscal policy, or conversely, if fiscal policy has some ability to influence real economic activity &#8211; leading to effects consistent with the twin deficits hypothesis.This thesis seeks to make an original contribution to the literature by first considering a large sample, both in the number of observations (188), and across almost 50 years from 1959-2006. Second, a great deal of attention is given to structural change in the Australian economy over this time &#8211; something which previous empirical literature (particularly for Australia) has paid little attention to.  Econometric techniques that consider the possibility of two structural breaks in each time series will be utilised. Incorporating these structural breaks into a cointegration analysis will allow for the estimation of such a large sample. Further, the work conducted here provides a more up-to-date analysis of the efficacy of fiscal policy in Australia. As noted by Kennedy (et al: 2004), there is little empirical evidence on the efficacy of fiscal policy in Australia, or estimates of fiscal multipliers.The analytical model employed in this thesis considers the extent to which private saving responds to changes in the total general government (Commonwealth, state and local) fiscal stance. While this framework lends itself towards explaining Ricardian equivalence effects, it can also be considered as a broad measure of the impact of fiscal policy on short- and long-run aggregate demand. The model is estimated using the autoregressive distributed lag approach (ARDL) to cointegration, which provides both short- and long-run coefficient estimates, but also provides the flexibility to accommodate the introduction of coefficients for structural breaks.As mentioned above, it is likely that the Australian economy has been subject to a substantial amount of structural change over the past 50 years. From the 1950s through to the early 1980s, the economy was heavily regulated, with markets subject to price controls and tariff protection, a fixed exchange rate, and government controls on bank deposits, interest rates and credit. The 1980s saw a period of rapid reform, with the floating of the dollar, removal of restrictions on credit creation, interest rates, foreign capital inflows and other broader reforms around market pricing and removal (or lowering) of tariffs and subsidies. Not accounting for these changes could lead to spurious results in the econometric analysis. While traditional Augmented Dickey-Fuller tests are conducted, the more advanced Lee and Strazicich one and two-break unit root tests are also used &#8211; which will also yield information regarding the timing of structural breaks in the Australian economy.Results indicate that while there is not a full Ricardian response to changes in the fiscal stance, there is some partial offsetting behaviour. The results imply that fiscal policy does elicit some impact on the real economy which will be partly offset by increased private saving or other crowding out effects. Lower short-run private saving offsets revealed through the error correction mechanisms indicate that nominal and real frictions and/or rigidities prevent some proportion of any offsetting savings behaviour occurring more quickly. Additionally, some households may also be subject to short-run liquidity constraints. However, nominal and real rigidities appear to have lessened as the Australian economy has been subject to significant economic reform.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3032</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of a static magnetic field on biological samples</field><field name="creator">Lazarakis, Peter</field><field name="description">FTIR spectroscopy uses the absorbed light in an IR beam to determine the composition of a sample.

Consistently it was seen that the largest changes to the cell were found in hydrogen bonds, most commonly in water. Though perhaps this may not normally create any significant biological impact when a biological sample is irradiated, as in radiotherapy, the chemical and physical structure of water is quite important.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3033</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Trade, growth, and the environment nexus: the experience of China, 1990-2007</field><field name="creator">Liu, Ying</field><field name="description">The market-oriented economic reforms that started in 1978 have greatly transformed the Chinese economy. China&#8217;s GDP has increased tenfold since 1978 while the per capita income has grown at an average annual rate of more than 8% over the last three decades, drastically reducing poverty. China&#8217;s foreign trade has grown faster than its GDP for the past 25 years (Chen and Li, 2000). Although industrial emissions increased in absolute terms that has been a noticeable reduction in per capita emissions especially after 1997.The major objective of this thesis is to study the nexus of trade, economic growth, and the environment in China during the period from 1990 to 2007. There are two interrelated hypotheses to be tested for this purpose: (1) The Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis and (2) Trade liberalisation in China had a short term negative effect on the environment and a long term positive effect based on the assumption that externality can be internalised and that an EKC exists in China.Both quadratic and cubic EKC models were used to capture the relationship between the per capita of income and the per capita of four industrial pollution emissions (SO2, smoke, dust, and COD). Due to an unbalanced development among the regions, this study grouped the whole country into three regions to examine the impact of a geographic location. The fixed effect and panel data were used. The results showed that an inverted-U shaped relationship as hypothesised by the EKC quadratic model in the case of SO2 exists, with a turning point at per capita GDP of 6,376 yuan, while  N-shaped curves were found for smoke, dust and COD in different regions. The results also showed that the more developed coastal region appears to have a turning point at a higher income level than the less developed central and western regions.To study the impact of trade liberalisation on the environment, this study adopted a modified version of Dean&#8217;s (2002) simultaneous model using a disaggregated sample based on above and below the turning point of the EKC. The Two-Stage Least Squares method was used. The results from the overall sample showed that the scale effects outweighed the technique effects for air pollutant (SO2) and water pollutant (COD), which is evidence for the pollution haven hypothesis. The split sample provided limited support for the EKC hypothesis where a rising level of income at the provincial level via an increased level of international trade was associated with falling emissions from the technique effect, so that rising income among the provinces tended to show a superior performance.In order to harmonise development stricter environmental regulations must be associated with growing incomes because they may provide the motivation for better production techniques.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3040</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship of participation in organised sports and games, participation in nonorganised physical activity, and cardiorespiratory endurance to fundamental motor skill ability among adolescents</field><field name="creator">Okely, Anthony D</field><field name="description">Physical inactivity has been considered a major public health issue among adolescents because of its high prevalence and its association with numerous adverse health outcomes during adolescence which may carry over to adulthood. A key to addressing this issue has been to identify the determinants that may influence an adolescent's decision to be physically active. A determinant that has been hypothesised is the level of proficiency of the motor skills used to participate in physical activity; however, this relationship has been virtually unexplored. This study investigated how organised sports and games, nonorganised physical activity, and cardiorespiratory endurance were each related to fundamental motor skill ability among adolescents. One thousand and seventy-two and 954 adolescents from Year 8 and Year 10, respectively, participated as subjects in this study. Organised sports and games and nonorganised physical activity were assessed by a self-report recall questionnaire of participation in physical activity. Cardiorespiratory endurance was measured by performance on the Multistage Fitness Test. Fundamental motor skill ability was qualitatively assessed by performance on a six-item fundamental motor skills test battery. Descriptive statistics plus multiple regression were used to analyse the data. Results suggested that participation in organised sports and games was significantly related to fundamental motor skill ability, F (4, 1831) = 14.30, p less than .0001, and that this relationship was stronger for males than for females. Participation in nonorganised physical activity was not significantly related to fundamental motor skill ability. Cardiorespiratory endurance was significantly related to fundamental motor skill ability, F (4, 1808) = 79.05, p less than .0001. For adolescents, fundamental motor skill ability may be an important variable influencing participation in organised sports and games and cardiorespiratory endurance and development of motor skills may increase adherence to a physically active lifestyle during adolescence which may carry over to adulthood.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/4</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Key biological parameters and commercial fishery for ocean leatherjackets 'Nelusetta ayraudi' (Monacanthidae) off the coast of New South Wales, Australia</field><field name="creator">Miller, Marcus E</field><field name="description">Ocean leatherjackets (Nelusetta ayraudi) are distributed along the entire coast of New South Wales (NSW) contributing significantly to the total catch of fish taken from the NSW Ocean Trap and Line Fishery (~340 tonnes in 2005/2006), in addition to other NSW fisheries, such as the Ocean Fish, Ocean Prawn and Haul-net Fisheries.    In spite of their significance in commercial fisheries world-wide, only few studies have aged monacanthids.  Of those, researchers have mainly used bony structures, such as vertebrae and anterior dorsal spines.  In this study, commercially captured ocean leatherjackets were aged by counting growth increments in thin-sectioned otoliths. The periodicity of increment formation was validated using a vital stain oxy-tetracycline (OTC) injected into young of the year fish (0+).  The von Bertalanffy growth function parameters provided good estimates of growth, k = 0.163 yr-1, t0 = -0.565 yrs and L&#8734; = 886 mm.  The fishery was found to be dominated by two and three year old fish making up 83% of the ocean leatherjackets captured.  The oldest fish (5+) and largest fish from both sexes (male &#8211; 605 mm, female &#8211; 656 mm) were found in northern NSW.  All fish displayed a rapid rate of growth especially as juveniles, with no significant differences in growth between sexes and locations (southern and northern NSW). Ocean leatherjackets showed a geographical and temporal &#8216;preference&#8217; for spawning.  Gonado-somatic indices (GSI) revealed a peak in spawning during August in northern NSW.  During this period adult fish were observed, via depth soundings, in large aggregations in depths ranging from 45 to 80 fathoms.  Ocean leatherjackets are pelagic egg broadcasters with no parental egg care.  Oocytes from ovulated ocean leatherjackets had a mean diameter of 0.66 mm (&#177; S.E. 0.002).  The estimated size and age at maturity (L50) for each sex was 352 mm and 2.5+ years old.  Mature fish of each sex displayed clear differences in dimorphic and dichromatic features. This research has provided the biological information necessary for future stock assessments of ocean leatherjackets in NSW.  In addition, it has contributed to management strategies designed to enhance the sustainability of the ocean leatherjackets fishery.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language"

The Permian Bulli Coal seam is mined from a portion of the basin which has undergone relatively little tectonic deformation apart from faulting and regional warping. The &#417; 1 orientation acting on mine roadways is determined using the mining induced shear fractures and is comparable to results from in situ overcore measurements. The angle between &#417; 1 and the mine roadway (0sr) together with the &#417; 1 magnitude and the &#417; 1/&#417; 2 ratio defines the range of roof conditions to be expected in a mine roadway. A twelve point scale of stress induced roof failure has been developed to rank the severity of stress acting across the mine roadway. For a given stress field the roof conditions expected over the range of Osr is defined by a Roof Failure curve. A number of Roof Failure Curves are able to define roof conditions for a varying stress field. The distribution of Roof Failure Curves represents the relative changes in stress field intensity across the mapped area. Mapping techniques are able to show the variability of both relative stress field intensity and lateral stress field orientation. Successful management of the in situ stress effects in mine development drivages and around longwall blocks is crucial to the economic viability of coal mines in the southern Sydney Basin.To further understand the origin of the in situ stress field a technique was developed to measure strain anisotropy in the coal maceral vitrinite. Vitrinite mean maximum reflectance (&#340;o max), using oil immersion, was measured from oriented sections normal to bedding and results indicate that the vitrinite in medium volatile bituminous coals has biaxial optical properties. The range of true maximum reflectance (Ro max) of vitrinite in the study was between 1.04% and 1.48% reflectance. The orientation of the R max can be determined from the long axis of the elliptical Calculated Bedding Plane Section of the Indicating Surface (CBPSIS). The biaxial nature of the vitrinite is thought to result from asymmetrical growth of its molecular structure and to be related to stress fields which developed simultaneously with coalification. The R o max direction is formed normal to lateral compressive forces. The CBPSIS figure from the bituminous coals studied is not usually elliptical but commonly takes the shape of two superimposed ellipses and, therefore, has two R o max peak directions, indicating overprinting of successive stress field orientations.Results from studies of Ro max orientations indicate that they show palaeostress patterns around faulted areas (including small faults with &lt;10m &gt;displacement) consistent with fault formation, and are also able to show variation of regional palaeostress events.The Ro max directions and in situ stress directions were determined from study areas in different coal mines. Five palaeostress directions are identified, two of which were recognised in all of the study areas. The same two palaeostress directions are coincident with the two in situ lateral stress field directions (NNW and ENE) recognised within the study area. The ENE stress field is coincident with a palaeostress active during sedimentation, prior to uplift. The NNW stress field orientation has been linked with a major wrench faulting episode in the area, following the cessation of sedimentation, but during coalification. Vitrinite reflectance data is able to record stress field events which have been_imprinted and locked into strata around the Bulli Coal seam, indicating that the in situ stress field acting in the southern Sydney Basin has a strong residual component. The study shows that the use of vitrinite as a tectonic fabric indicator is viable in weakly deformed terrain and is able to provide information concerning palaeostress regimes.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1394</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A hideously complicated problem: Anglo-American relations with Austria, 1945-1955</field><field name="creator">Denton, Margaret</field><field name="description">In February 1942, during the earliest planning stages for post-war Europe, Austria was seen as a 'hideously complicated problem1- by Washington and London alike. Surprisingly, when one considers existing literature on the post-war occupation of Austria, this sentiment remains a fitting description of Anglo-American relations with Austria during the ten years of the Allied occupation. For me, born in occupied Vienna and growing up in that city during the 1960s, this is a compelling revelation, since during that period one of the most powerful staples of the political education of young Austrians was that Austria had been saved by the Americans and the British from a fate worse than occupation - that of Communism. My own recent examination of an aspect of US post-war foreign policy and practice and their effects on Anglo-American relations2 raised a fundamental question: why did Austria remain occupied for ten long years, when the conditions for evacuation, as set down by the Allies during the war, had been fulfilled within the first nine months after liberation? To appreciate the significance of this question, it is crucial to understand what the aims of the Allies were. Austria was to be separated from Germany originally in a deliberate attempt to weaken the German war effort and then to deprive Germany permanently of Austrian support. To achieve this purpose, the Allies decided to restore Austria to independence. The conditions for independence would be deemed to be satisfied once Austria was demilitarised, her administration severed from that of Germany, adequate denazification measures in progress, and a freely elected Austrian government installed. By the end of 1945 these conditions were fulfilled. Why, then, did Austria have to wait until 1955 to regain her freedom? Although this question has not been asked for the first time, the small body of literature which attempts to answer it has done so only in a limited way. 3 Most noticeable in existing treatises on the subject is an emphasis on the relations between Austria and the Soviet Union and a bias towards acceptance of the Cold War thesis as proclaimed by the Americans. The Soviets, no doubt, until recently made comfortable villains and this may be part of the reason for the prominence given to the occupation period up to 1950. The years 1951 to 1955 are usually either ignored or given short shrift. It would appear that 1950 has presented a convenient point of termination for those who contend that Soviet intransigence prevented the conclusion of an Austrian treaty. By emphasising Soviet unwillingness to respond favourably to Anglo-American demands and, I suggest, by giving too much credence to the letter rather than the spirit of American documents, a skewed picture has been allowed to emerge, perpetuating the myth of the American saviour. My primary aim, then, has been twofold: to investigate the portrayal of America as the party which untiringly strove to free Austria from the occupation, and to explore the British part in the occupation and assess its effect on Anglo-Austrian as well as Anglo- American relations. To that end I have examined British and American policy towards Austria and the Soviet Union, Anglo-American tactics at treaty negotiations, and the extent to which London and Washington took Austrian wishes and complaints into consideration. This raised many important questions. Why, for instance, was there such disagreement, particularly after 1950, between Britain and the United States over the benefits to Western security of ending the occupation? In what ways did British and American assessment of Soviet policy differ between 1943 and 1955, and what effect, if any. did Austrian demands to end the occupation have on British and American views of Austria's role in Europe? The answers emerging paint a fascinating picture of Britain as the original cold warrior - both under Churchill and Attlee - but then, as the American ideological crusade gained momentum, insisting on a common-sense solution to Austrian security and Austria's place in Western Europe. Britain's pragmatic approach to the Austrian problem was, however, repeatedly frustrated by American intransigence and by Britain's own efforts to safeguard her economic interests in Austria. The evidence also suggests strongly that from 1948 onward American military considerations prevented the ending of the occupation until, in 1955, it was no longer politically feasible to keep it going. By 1955 the Americans feared that their failure to sign the treaty would prejudice the containment of Soviet Russia by encouraging further Austrian-Soviet bilateral deals. They also feared being placed in an untenable propaganda position by remaining the only occupying power unwilling to end the occupation. These factors and a shift in emphasis of US foreign policy towards Asia, as well as a greater reliance on massive retaliation rather than mere containment, determined American action in 1955. A crucial consequence of Austria's occupation was her choice of neutral status after being nurtured as a 'Western outpost' for ten years. It has invariably been asserted by writers outside Austria that neutrality was imposed by Moscow. But this is far too simplistic a view. The question needs to be asked, in what way did Austrian assessment of Soviet policy differ from British or American assessment, and why did Austria's initial sense of relief at the arrival of American and British occupation forces change to disillusionment? It is my contention that Austria embraced neutrality because satisfying the role imposed by the United States had become an intolerable burden and threatened - as, indeed, was acknowledged by some of the more determined cold warriors in Washington - to last for the duration of the East-West conflict. This, as we now know, would have added some thirty-five years to the occupation. Austria's own part in the ending of the occupation has not been adequately explored. The Austrian Government, if its actions are considered at all, is often treated as if it were a homogeneous entity, when in fact it consisted of the representatives of two diametrically opposed ideologies, who as recently as 1934 had fought a civil war against each other, A fundamental question, therefore, is why did the two major political parties in Austria - the Socialist Party (SPG), comprising Socialdemocrats and its left-wing faction, the Revolutionary Socialists, and the People's Party (OVP), an amalgamation of conservative Christiansocials and former right-wing corporate-state enthusiasts - co-operate in a coalition government throughout the occupation? What problems did the leaders of the coalition parties face, and why did the Socialist Party half-way through the occupation insist on the formation of new political parties? The importance of these issues lies in the essential connection between the burden imposed by the occupation, the potential for serious internal instability which it engendered, and the growing disaffection between Austria and the Anglo-American powers. I have divided the thesis into ten chapters. The running civil wars between Socialist and Conservative forces during the 1920s and early 1930s - culminating in the brutal suppression of Austrian Socialdemocracy by the authoritarian Dollfuss Government in 1934 - were pivotal in the forcible incorporation of Austria into the German Reich in 1938. Chapter One explores Anglo-American attitudes in the 1930s to the civil war and to the Anschluss in order to show what bearing they had later on Allied planning. The Allied proclamation in November 1943 that Austria was to be re-established as an independent state is examined in the light of the first of many serious misconceptions about Austrian aspirations, the belief - very likely inspired by Churchill's predilection for a Danubian Empire centred on Vienna - that independence held little appeal for the Austrians. Chapter Two shows how as early as 1944 British assessment of Soviet aims in Europe and the presumed threat to British European policy clashed with the Americans' reoccupation with the Far East and caused considerable disagreement between the two governments over the proposed post-war control of Austria. By 1945 Britain saw itself as the only power sufficiently aware of and prepared to fight the Soviet-led Communist threat to Europe. It was this notion of its role in Europe that caused the British Government to refuse recognition of the Austrian Provisional Government established by Karl Renner in Soviet-occupied Vienna in April 1945. The ensuing isagreement between the British and US governments provides one of the earliest examples of the Austrian Government quietly proceeding with the administration of the country while the occupying powers fought amongst themselves. British reactions to the Provisional government's preparations for the first post-war elections, to be held in November 1945, offer an instructive glimpse of British anxiety over the Communist threat, a concern which was only temporarily alleviated when the Austrian Communists suffered a decisive defeat in the elections. The focus of Chapter Three is the first battle of wills between the Austrian Government and the occupation forces over the inordinate number of occupation troops in Austria and the devastating burden they imposed on the country's resources and population. This chapter also explores the different responses by the British and Americans to these complaints and to the Communist threat thought to be posed to Austria's future independence. In direct contrast to their attitudes after 1950, in 1946 the Americans wanted a quick end to the occupation, whereas the British saw the problem as one of physical protection of Austria by the presence of Anglo-American occupation troops to deter the Soviet military, and insistence on co-operation between the Socialist Party and the People's Party to forestall the Austrian Communists. The ambiguities in British policy towards liberated Austria are explored in Chapter Four. These include the war-guilt clause contained in the British draft treaty, perceived as a monstrous injustice by the Austrians, who protested that they had been the victims of Nazism. The British draft also set the stage for a protracted battle between HMG and the Austrian Government, supported by Moscow, over British oil interests in Austria. In 1947 the first negotiations for an Austrian treaty witnessed a new-found determination by the Americans to defy the Soviets' alleged economic subversion of Austria. The resulting conflict between the Austrian leaders, who saw the Soviet claims as reparation demands susceptible to business-like settlement between Vienna and Moscow, and the Anglo-American negotiators, whose tactics were believed to prolong needlessly the occupation and thus pose a threat to internal stability, contributed to Austrian is enchantment with Western aims and to Austrian determination not to participate in ideological crusades against the Soviet Union. The impact of the Communist coup in Prague and of deteriorating East-West relations in Berlin on Anglo-American willingness to grant Austria her freedom are examined in Chapter Five. British policy had changed from the notion prevalent in 1946, that Austria should be protected from Communism by the physical presence of Western troops, to the conviction that a politically stable Austria - which in Britain's opinion could only be guaranteed by the conclusion of the treaty and the ending of the occupation - was vital to British European policy. In contrast, the worsening international ideological conflict saw the emergence in the United States Government of a policy of 'no treaty, but keep pretending'. The period also saw a shift in relations between Austria and the Anglo-American occupation forces. The administrative authorities were believed to be reactionary, insulting and insensitive, and Anglo-American troops were rivalling early Soviet behaviour in their treatment of the population. Austrian awareness of the Western Powers' reluctance to evacuate the country provoked a campaign against the occupying powers and a growing inclination to embrace neutrality as an answer to the problem. Chapter Six analyses the effects on the treaty negotiations of American domestic disputes over US foreign policy and the consequent unwillingness on the part of the Austrian Socialists to continue to restrain their political ambitions for the sake of American Soviet policy. It was during this period, when the hard-liners were gaining the upper hand in Washington, that the British - conscious of the potential harm to Austrian-Western relations - argued most fervently in favour of an end to the occupation. Anglo-American efforts to keep Austria 'friendly' are examined in Chapter Seven. These efforts are scrutinised against a background of the waning fortunes of the British Labour Government and US determination to keep Austria occupied until East-West relations in general were resolved in America's favour. Closely linked to Anglo- American inertia on the treaty question were the Austrian Government's difficulties in dealing satisfactorily with the economic grievances of the Austrian workers, leading to the incongruous situation of the Government having to defend itself both against Communist-led disturbances and efforts by the Western occupation powers to safeguard their own economic interests in Austria. The introduction in 1952 of the so-called abbreviated treaty, one of the most provocative actions of the Americans, is examined in Chapter Eight. This proposed treaty set both the British.and French against Washington and had the unintended effect of being welcomed by Austria as an 'evacuation instrument'. At the same time, one of the most galling issues of the occupation - the requirement that Austria pay for occupation costs - led to serious disagreement between Britain and the United States, as the US Government attempted to lessen the burden on Austria while insisting on onerous rearmament measures for Britain. Chapter Nine covers the period from October 1952 to February 1954. It deals with the essential connection between the constraints of the continuing occupation and the emergence of those political forces in Austria which favoured Austrian-Soviet bilateral negotiations to gain Austrian freedom, and saw neutrality as the deciding factor in future negotiations. These developments also witnessed a reassessment by Britain of Austria's role in Europe, thus bringing both Austria and Britain into conflict with US aims concerning Western defence. The concluding chapter examines the last year of the occupation, when Austrian leaders defied Anglo-American efforts to keep Austria 'on ice' and engaged directly in negotiations with Moscow, promising Moscow the security of a neutral Austria in exchange for Austria's freedom. The evidence has vindicated my doubts about the received opinion of the American role in the prolonged occupation. The portrayal of America the Saviour is changed to one of a determined ideological warrior, whose grip on Austria was relaxed only when continuation of the occupation threatened to damage the overarching aim of containing the Soviet Union. Anglo-Austrian relations during this period were determined by the inherent conflict between Britain's political aims for Austria and Britain's economic hardships, which obliged dependence on American goodwill regarding European security. A comment made early during the occupation by an Austrian diplomat in Washington is suggestive of the complexities governing Anglo-American-Austrian relations. He warned his government that although the US Government's aims in respect of the occupation coincided with those of the Austrian Government, ultimately Washington would bow to the needs of Britain if a conflict between Austrian and British interests arose.4 Yet as the occupation progressed, the tables were turned and London bowed to American policy in prolonging the occupation. Thus, as a result of the British Labour Government's demise in 1951 and the weakening of the British will in the face of American obduracy, the Austrian Government pursued the idea of neutrality as the only alternative to continued occupation. By 1955 the Soviet Government, driven by pragmatic rather than ideological considerations, represented the only reasonable negotiating partner in the Austrians' quest for independence.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1430</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Performance of international joint ventures (IJVs) in developing countries: a study of IJVs in Bangladesh</field><field name="creator">Md.

In arguing that the leaders of the union during that time allowed the pursuit of their particular ideological agendas to supplant the interests of the union's membership, it has been necessary to lay stress upon the peculiarity of the maritime workplace. This was a workplace that was not only occupied but inhabited by the merchant seaman. It is contended here that the special circumstances of the maritime workplace were such as to render seamen vulnerable to exploitation not only at the hands of their employers but also at the hands of their industrial leaders.It is shown here that for the membership of the Seamen's Union of Australasia the period 1918-1943 was one of division and convulsion. None of the leaders that this work considers in historical succession was able to rectify the prevaihng situation, regardless of their widely varying ideological agendas that ranged from Utopian socialism through anarchistic individualism to realpolitik It is argued that as a consequence of the breakdown of social polity within their industrial association, Australian merchant seamen were subjected to manipulation by forces that were beyond their power to control. Alienated from a landward society that was little aware of their special circumstances and that was generally unsympathetic, the seamen became an antagonised occupational group. Thus, by 1943, they were readily available for deployment in support of an ideology that was not of their making.This thesis necessitates consideration not only of the physical circumstances but of the psychological consequences of seafaring in the development of an attitude and subsequent behavioural patterns within the historical period under examination. It has also been necessary to take a number of contextual themes into consideration. Thus, shipping being crucial to the economic viability of the nation, maritime industrial relations routinely involved recourse to the coercive power of the state. And, since it was vital for Britain's economic interest to restrict competition in the operation of the liner link between the United Kingdom and Australasia, British 'shipping nationalism' had a dire effect upon the ere wing of Australian ships. Then there is the matter of the widening gap between the levels of skill reserved for and exercised by ships' deck and engineer officers and those of the seamen, as recognised in the anachronistically punitive disciplinary clauses of the Navigation Act. Yet another theme is the internationalism of seamen which while making them conscious of their advantages in comparison to other national seamen, also rendered them apprehensive of disadvantage. Australian seamen feared regression to the conditions endured by British national seamen. Worse still was their fear of supersession by those 'superexploited' Asian, African, and Indian seamen who under the terms of Asian articles sailed in many ships of Great Britain's merchant fleet, a situation that gave point to the factional power struggles which occurred within the body of the union.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1431</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Smallness, islandness and foreign policy behaviour: aspects of island microstates foreign policy behaviour with special reference to Cook Islands and Kiribati</field><field name="creator">Neemia, Ueantabo Fakaofo</field><field name="description">As a subcategory of small states, island microstates are the smallest. Using the Cook Islands and Kiribati as case studies, this thesis examines the relationship and effect of small size on foreign policy behaviour. The thesis also examines the implications of the other key characteristic of island microstates, namely islandness, for foreign policy behaviour.On the relationship between size and foreign policy behaviour, the thesis reveals two sides. First, foreign policy behaviour is conceptuahsed as one of the key areas through which the two island microstates respond and seek to manage problems, including economic dependence, which originate from their small size. In other words, the conditions and problems deriving from smallness motivate activities in the external environment which make up foreign policy behaviour. These external activities include the quest for increased intemational recognition as competent intemational actors, the maximisation of economic benefits in the form of increased aid and development assistance and improved retums from extemal ttade and other forms of external relations. Second, small size and its correlates, also circumscribe and constrain foreign policy behaviour.The two manifestations of the relationship between smallness and foreign policy behaviour are demonstrated in the two case studies, which comply broadly with the characteristics postulated by the main theories of small state foreign policy behaviour, particularly East's (1973) well-known model. The data from both case studies show some variations in detail from the main theories of small states' foreign policy behaviour, and qualify the postulates of these theories from the situations of smaller states.In so far as islandness (the other key characteristic of island microstates) is concemed, data from Cook Islands and Kiribati show that islandness not only imposes difficulties over and above those of smallness per se, but also accord them with a specific set of options. The evidence show that islandness has important implications for improving the instrumentalities and capacities of island microstates to manipulate their extemal environments. With the advent of the Law of the Sea, island microstates are now controlling vast expanses of ocean areas which not only increased their physical area, but more impportantly redefined their economic prospects and, to a considerable extent, increased their extemall involvements beyond the restricted foreign policy behavioural pattems predicted by most theories of small states foreign policy behaviour, including the influential East model.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field

approach in Brazil</field><field name="creator">Guzman, Gustavo Abel</field><field name="description">The key research question of this study is to determine if Brazihan firms are applying the human-centred manufacturing approaches and if so, to explore how and to what extent this is happening. From this, two related research topics emerge: (i) how macro contextual conditions support or constrain the implementation of the HC model; and (ii) which are the main technical and organisational features of a 'tropicalized' (adapted) HC model in Brazilian firms. In order to address these questions, case studies were carried out in 10 Brazilian firms. The aim of the empirical study was to determine the form and level of human-centredness in these firms and to explore the factors affecting this. An examination was then made of the patterns of human-centred development and its links with product, process and environmental factors, identified in the literature as key influences on HC systems developments. Two theoretical approaches were used to inform the empirical component of this study in order to explain the application of New Production Systems and, specifically the Human-centred approach in the semi-periphery. Firstly, the examination at the level of the firm, integrates constructivist views of people, technology and organisation with the concept of manufacturing engineering systems as well as the organisation configuration approach. This helps to understand "how" the human-centred approach was applied in Brazil. Secondly, a political economy examination of the macro contextual factors assisted to understand "why" related questions. Key findings of this study refer to the wide range of adaptation to local conditions of new production systems. This is explained by contextual institutional factors, such as industrial relations and regional labour markets. In contrast to established human-centred theory, the degree of human-centredness in the organisational arena was not strongly linked to either (i) human-centred designed technology; (ii) to new product market variety and change; or (iii)characteristics of the firm.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1707</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Percival Lowell: the sage as astronomer</field><field name="creator">Dolan, David Sutton</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1712</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rethinking technology transfer in the agriculture sector : the case of the Philippines</field><field name="creator">Burgos, Bessie</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1715</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Symbolic politics in the high technology debate in Australia</field><field name="creator">Joseph, R.

V.</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a comparative sociological investigation of the laboratory life-world of scientists. In particular, the thesis deals with the organisation of science and the ways in which the orientations of scientists and their research activity are structured in laboratories across national and cultural contexts.Theoretically, the thesis employs a range of theoretical concepts drawn from general sociology, the sociology of knowledge, phenomenology, political sociology of science, symbolic interaction theory and the social history of science. The most influential theoretical stream that formed the basis for the action and meaning approach used in the analysis of science, is the 'interpretive' perspective drawn most centrally from the works of Schutz, Weber and Mannheim.The theoretical framework developed in the first part of the thesis forms a coherent basis for the empirical investigation presented in the second part - through the methodology which is specifically developed to carry the 'interpretive' perspective of the theory into methodological assumptions and practice. The theoretical framework provides a basis for analysis of the action and meaning context of scientists within, and across two laboratory 'structures', as well as for analysis of interaction of the scientists with wider groups and agencies in the trans-laboratory and socio-historical contexts. The CFTRI/CSIR (in a non-Western culture context) and die FRL/CSIRO (in a Western culture context) formed the basis for empirical exploration through sixteen propositions drawn from the theory and the history of the laboratory case studies.The field research conducted in this thesis involved the generation of a 'method of multiple feedback'. This method was generated as epistemological frame that aligned with the interpretationist frame of theory in the thesis. Following Mannheim, this method sought not only to observe - at "objective" level &#8211; from without the subjective experience of scientists, but to draw the scientist-actor's own construction of expressive, evidential and objective meaning into the analysis of science in its institutional framework. This method involved the generation of data at five different levels of generality, employing feedback between these levels to form an overall interpretive synthesis of the relation between history, culture, politics, the scientific profession and the experience of scientist-actors.The overall picture presented in this thesis reflects that scientific research and the action of scientists in laboratories are structured through a dynamic social process within particular social, political, cultural and historic contexts relative to the laboratory context.On the basis of the theory and empirical research contained in the two case studies, the thesis demonstrates that scientists in CFTRI/CSIR and FRL/CSIRO are governed by two distinct traditions in research 'cultures' specific to the laboratory's national and cultural context. Towards the evolution of specific research 'cultures', the two laboratory organisations were found to be in constant negotiation with the socio-economic and political environment surrounding the institutions. Whilst the scientific research in CFTRI was found to be influenced by the utilitarian research 'culture' of CSIR, the research in FRL was observed to be highly influenced by the CSIRO 'culture' of excellence in scientific research. Correspondingly, the empirical research on the goal orientations of scientists in the two laboratory case studies, demonstrates that the meaning of research action is a product of the influences routed through the research 'cultures' extant in the respective laboratory's historic context.The case studies contained in this thesis directly challenge the controversial assertion that 'science is universal and culture free'.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1728</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The representation of the feminine, feminist and musical subject in popular music culture</field><field name="creator">Mayhew, Emma</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1743</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Role of public policy in linking university and research centres with industry in Sri Lanka</field><field name="creator">Amaradasa, R. M.W.</field><field name="description">The promotional mechanisms employed in University-Research-Industry (URI) relationships have been considered a strategic factor in the development objectives of the industrialized countries. Such promotional mechanisms are based on recognized conceptual frameworks, which have been carefully examined by researchers. However, little work has been done in this field with respect to problems of less industrialized countries especially in small developing countries. The objective of this study was therefore to compare the URI characteristics and promotional mechanisms of developed countries with those in operation in small developing countries like Sri Lanka.The methodology employed for this study included exploratory survey, follow-up interviews, interviews with decision-makers and case studies while analytical tools in the grounded theory approach were used to deal with qualitative data.The URI relationships which are used as instruments to generate economic benefits, show wide discrepancies in performance among different countries. The promotional mechanisms, widely prevalent in industrialized countries, emphasized the importance of framework conditions. The characteristic features of the URI relationships in developed countries are better described in the international literature in terms of models, concepts and systems such as National System of Innovation. An analysis of literature shows that less industrialized countries need to have a better understanding of issues related to the operation of those relationships that are less rigorously influenced by theories and concepts developed in industrialized countries.The study revealed that the relationships in Sri Lanka are based on the lower end of the spectrum, characterized by short-term orientation that include education and training, and service-based relationships. Lack of structural mechanisms, financial constraints, regulatory rigidity, inadequacy of laboratory facilities and absence of inter-organizational communication seems to be the major features that curtail relationships. It was observed that process related constraints and weaknesses are widespread in all three types of organizations, in addition to the weaknesses related to the framework. Accordingly, three sets of issues based on internal and external factors for a particular type of organization were developed which could be widely used as check list of issues for any developing country. This checklist was tested with new forms of organizations which have evolved to overcome such weaknesses, by adopting the responsive-adaptive approach. The new forms of organizations show features such as heterogeneity, organizational diversity and trans-disciplinarity as well as internal transformation, influence of one type of organization upon another, creation of new organizations and networks. These features are more prevalent in organizations in developed countries. The findings lead to conclusion that the URI relationships in developing countries show in a broad context similarities to those of developed countries but at the same time differ in nature. The concepts and models used in developed countries to explain the URI relationships can also be used to explain those in developing countries. The importance in understanding micro level conditions and taking remedial measures to overcome negative impact is imperative. Finally, the public policy interventions that are necessary to promote URI relationships, while eliminating weaknesses in the framework and micro-environment are proposed in this study.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1746</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The application of information systems in marketing: a study of empowerment in electronic commerce</field><field name="creator">Al-Dalahmeh, Mahmoud Ali</field><field name="description">This thesis describes post-positivist research in the field of Information Systems (IS), more specifically in Electronic Commerce (E-Commerce). Information systems (IS) and information technology (IT) both play a major role in improving productivity and competitive edge in e-commerce (Lin and Benjamin, 2000). The existence of IS does not depend on computers but it is the utilisation of computers and technology that produces a viable IS system (Davis and Olson, 1985).E-commerce is considered as a new type of information system and was defined by Poong (2006, p. 553) as &#8220;an information system that provides catalogues of products over the World Wide Web&#8221;. Despite the deep employment of technology in Information Systems (IS), they are regarded as social systems. Business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce has been rapidly changing the competitive landscape of retailing and service industries. Despite its claimed benefits, this innovative mode of retailing has not yet been accepted by every buyer. For company managers, the delays in the adoption of information systems such as e-commerce systems, and the empowerment of e-commerce users are recognised as a dilemma. An interesting question is why some users accept the idea of online shopping more readily than others. This study aims at helping to improve information systems applications for e-commerce in the complex, technology-oriented marketing sector. This thesis innovates a model to empower e-commerce users based on key critical factors that affect this technology. The core factors in this model are e-commerce self efficacy, Personal Innovation in Information Technology (PIIT), system ease of use, system experience, and technology anxiety. The model was empirically tested in a field experimental setting, using a real retail website for the purchasing decisions. The participants in this study were students at the University of Wollongong in Australia, as they are normal users of e-commerce. The Amazon.com website was chosen for this study, as this website is usually used by university students to buy books and CDs. The results of the investigation were tested using factor analysis and partial least square (PLS). The empirical testing provides support for the proposed theoretical model by explaining seventy-eight percent (78%) of the variance in the users&#8217; intention to use e-commerce systems.The implications of this study are both theoretical and practical. At the theoretical level, this study combined four models in one model. The first model, by Compeau et al. (1999)1, put social cognitive theory into practice for the IT area. The second model, by Thatcher and Perrewe (2002)2, applied personal innovation in information technology, trait anxiety, and computer anxiety to computer self-efficacy. Henry and Stone&#8217;s (1995)3 model is the third model used, as it employed ease of use and system experience in computer self-efficacy and outcome expectation. The final model was constructed by Kim and Kim (2005)4 and used specific self-efficacy (online trading self-efficacy) in customer trust, perceived risk, and buying intention. Therefore, it can be positively confirmed that this research model is a solid model, as it unites these four models into one to generate a clarification of users&#8217; behaviour in the framework of e-commerce utilisation.At the practical level, the study shows that adoption of e-commerce systems is directly, significantly and positively affected by e-commerce self-efficacy, outcome expectation (perceived usefulness), system ease of use, and system experience. It is proposed that individuals with higher levels of e-commerce self-efficacy, outcome expectation, system experience, and perceived system ease of use are more likely to perform an online transaction than those experiencing lower levels of these concepts. The study makes significant contributions across all areas of IT adoption and usage research and practice. There is justification for claiming that the study model will empower the application of management information systems for e-commerce.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language"

experience</field><field name="creator">Akkas, Sarkar Ali</field><field name="description">This thesis examines issues of judicial independence and judicial accountability with special reference to public confidence in the judiciary. The central issues of this thesis are the tension between judicial independence and accountability and the ways the two conflicting values may be balanced in the administration of justice to dehver an effective judicial service and win public confidence. The thesis emphasises that proper measures should be taken to maintain judicial independence and at the same time, an adequate system of judicial accountability should be established without undermining the independence of judges.The thesis examines the conditions of judicial independence and accountability in Bangladesh in comparison with general principles, international standards and practices of some countries in the common law tradition. It evaluates the law and practice which have been followed in Bangladesh to deal with various aspects of the judiciary involving the independence and accountability of judges. It reviews the history and current state of the judiciary by analysing a wide range of sources, including constitutional and statutory law, public records, available statistical data and media reports and secondary literature. The thesis identifies the strengths and weaknesses of the current system of constitutional and judicial administration in Bangladesh and their impacts on judicial independence and judicial accountability which include appointment, tenure and discipline of judges, and scrutiny of judges by the media and the bar. It proposes ways of preserving the strengths or remedying the weaknesses to improve the conditions of judicial independence and judicial accountability in Bangladesh.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1856</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Legislative approaches to the regulation of racial hatred: a study of racial vilification laws in Australia, 1989-1999</field><field name="creator">McNamara, Luke</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1857</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of a health education curriculum for primary schools in Solomon Islands</field><field name="creator">Llewellyn, Joan M.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1877</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Organic petrology and geochemistry of Bukit Asam coal, South Sumatra, Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Pujobroto, Agus</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1975</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The forgotten Sunday: the Newcastle Sunday Mirror 1959-61</field><field name="creator">Morrison, Ron</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1885</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quaternary stratisgraphy and evolution of aeolianite on Lord Howe Island</field><field name="creator">Brooke, Brendan</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1978</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nutrition and food service systems for long stay elderly patients: a contextual analysis : "making every mouthful count"</field><field name="creator">Walton, Karen Louise</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1994</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of palatable feeding-related receptors in macronutrient preference and diet-induced obesity in mice</field><field name="creator">South, Timothy</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1995</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A conceptual framework for understanding and measuring B2B online service quality</field><field name="creator">Burgess, Lois Ann</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2001</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Acquiring mobile robot behaviours learning from experience</field><field name="creator">Ward, Koren</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2002</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multigroup neutron transport theory in plane geometry</field><field name="creator">Clancy, B.

The first production was titied Just Between You And Me. and the second. All This Talk. Both plays foreground the "talk" of women in celebration and in questioning the roles of women.The scripts of the plays were workshopped and written using a consensual methodology. The dynamics of group interaction inspired the productions with an intensity which brought considerable audience comment and no small amount of personal satisfaction to the group members.The thesis provides an understanding of the texts, both in the process of creation and in performance. Of importance to this understanding is the creation of meaning and the process of communication. The thesis includes the playtexts (bound separately), a theoretical overview, the annotated playtexts and a videotext of selected scenes.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2199</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sources of acute stress and coping strategies in elite and non-elite adolescent tennis players</field><field name="creator">North, Paul Gary</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2264</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Practical applications of three-dimensional stress change measurements and displacements in underground coal mines</field><field name="creator">Nemcik, Jan Anton</field><field name="description">Theoretical advances in mathematical analyses, numerical modelling and computer technology has significantly increased the knowledge of stress distribution around underground excavations. The complexity of rock behaviour, especially of the sedimentary soft rock type has made exact mathematical predictions very difficult. The need for alternative methods was clearly defined.In the past various methods to measure in situ stresses were developed. Early measurements were in most cases limited to one dimension and were often used to measure the magnitude of vertical stress concentrations around the mine openings.No detailed discussions on the historical stress measurement development is attempted here since many publications dealing with the topic are readily available.To understand the behaviour of strata around the mine openings located within laminated and often strain softened rock, it is necessary to conduct a detailed underground geotechnical investigation.In general, the geological complexity and rock behaviour in most underground coal mines requires in situ investigation of: a) geological structure of roof rock, coal and the floor rock, b) geological disturbances such as faults,         fractures and other discontinuities associated with displacement c) detailed stress/displacement measurements as   mining takes place.Results are then used for mine planning purposes, mine sequencing, pillar design and design of efficient roof reinforcement.No detailed 3-dimensional stress measurements in coal mines were conducted till recent advances in usage of CSIRO 3-dimensional soft inclusion stress cells developed by ACIRL. The stress cells were originally designed for overcoring stress measurements. 3-dimensional stress measurements were often used in metalliferous mines for some time to measure long term stress changes in stopes. Despite many problems new techniques were developed and verified to efficiently record the full three dimensional stress changes in the coal measures as adjacent coal extraction takes place.The following text deals with a short history of the stress and displacement origins and the monitoring techniques used. Two detailed case histories of extensive geotechnical installation are presented with monitoring and interpretation of strata behaviour in underground coal mines.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2369</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The optimum design of shafts to AS1403</field><field name="creator">Goard, D.

The present study explores the construction of evaluative meanings in English for second/foreign language (ESL/EFL) writing under exam conditions &#8211; still an under-explored area in EAP research.  This study analyses short argumentative essays written in response to Task 2 of the Academic Writing Module of the International English Language Testing Systems (IELTS) as a high-stakes gatekeeping genre by drawing on Appraisal theory and Genre theory developed within Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL) as well as the theory of intertextuality.  In so doing, it focuses on the linguistic and rhetorical resources deployed by IELTS writers to construct the intersubjective relationship between the writer and the reader and the intertextual relationship between the task prompt and the exam script.  The findings of the research demonstrate that there are differences in linguistic choices of evaluative resources depending on grades awarded.  Specifically, the study provides important insights into the distinguishing features of successful and less successful IELTS texts in terms of the degree of the writer&#8217;s dialogical or subjective engagement with the reader as well as the degree of intertextual density between the examination response and the task prompt as construed in the choice of what is evaluated (i.e. appraised).  The results suggest that the evaluative patterns which can be identified through the different &#8216;voices&#8217; that the IELTS writer projects in the IELTS task provide insights into what is valued in more successful IELTS writing.The study makes a significant contribution to our understanding of the interpersonal expectations which are &#8216;hidden&#8217; or implicit in the current IELTS assessment criteria in the public domain. The tentative framework on intertextuality put forward in the study extends the current description of engagement resources captured in the existing Appraisal theory. The study has practical implications for effective IELTS preparation courses.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field

instrument to measure informed consent comprehension in non-cognitively impaired adults</field><field name="creator">Buccini, Laura D</field><field name="description">Informed consent in human research involves a process of communicating information about a research study so as to promote informed decision-making. Current research suggests, however, that a high proportion of participants do not fully understand what it is they are consenting to when enrolling onto a research study. In other words, for many participants consent to participate in research is not truly informed. Evaluating informed consent information through the use of comprehension tests is one possible method for increasing the likelihood that consent to take part in research is truly informed. This thesis, therefore, comprises a series of both qualitative and quantitative studies that build upon one another culminating in the development comprehension of informed consent information. Assessments of readability provide a preliminary indication of document complexity in terms of writing style (word choice, sentence length). Therefore, a small-scale descriptive study, as described in Chapter 2, was conducted: i) to measure the readability of Australian-based clinical trial informed consent documents; and ii) to determine whether national or local ethics committees within Australia have formally established informed consent readability standards. The results of the study revealed that the majority of informed consent documents were written at a reading level appropriate for individuals with some university education thus beyond the reading ability of a majority of Australian adults. Official readability recommendations and/or standards could not be located at the national or local level. One method of gathering evidence of informed consent comprehension is through the use of comprehension tests. Chapter 3 consists of a systematic review, which identifies and critically evaluates instruments that have been developed to measure clinical trial informed consent comprehension in non-cognitively impaired adults. A total of three instruments were identified. Strengths and limitations of each instrument were evaluated against the following criteria: i) method of item generation; ii) type and format of test items; iii) administration and interpretation of test results; and iv) psychometric properties. None of the instruments identified in Chapter 3 were developed based on a construct definition. This may be due to the absence of an accepted construct definition of informed consent comprehension. A construct definition provides a framework for determining how an instrument should be constructed, implemented, interpreted and applied. Furthermore, the validity of what is being measured will rest largely on that definition. Chapter 4 describes and reports on the results of a qualitative study, involving an international expert panel, which was conducted to develop consensus for a construct definition of informed consent comprehension. The construct definition proposed in Chapter 4 was utilized as the conceptual framework for the development a new of informed consent comprehension instrument, called the Modular Informed Consent Comprehension Assessment (MICCA) instrument. Chapter 5 describes the methodologies used to develop the instrument and presents the results of preliminary readability and content validity testing. Chapter 6 is an extension of Chapter 5 in that it presents the results of a psychometric study conducted to assess the reliability, generalizability and validity of the MICCA. Results of the psychometric study provide preliminary evidence that the MICCA can be utilized in various clinical trial settings and can produce reliable and valid test scores. Evidence of comprehension through the use of comprehension instruments, such as the MICCA, can help ensure that consent to participate in a research study is truly informed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3064</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Air entrainment in free falling bulk materials</field><field name="creator">Liu, Ze Qin</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1816</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Of oracles and beliefs: accounting as a mythological construction of and for social order.

They have started their use primarily in applications with alternating currents (AC), such as transformers, high current/low voltage cables, motors and generators.The energy losses in practical superconductors are negligibly small under suitable working conditions. However, Bi-2223/Ag tapes are composite conductors, consisting of superconducting filaments in a silver matrix. Composite conductors are associated with additional losses when the tape is used in AC applications, commonly referred to AC coupling loss.The susceptibility of different tapes to the coupling losses is usually described by effective transverse resistivity, P&#8869;. P &#8869;differs from resistivity of the silver matrix, and it is a convenient way to describe the susceptibility of a tape to the AC loss. Coupling currents between the filaments flow in a complicated pattern because of the complex geometry of the tapes. The coupling current loss depends not only on the resistivity of the silver matrix, but also on the spatial distribution of the currents. Therefore, the overall shape of the tape, as well as the architecture of the superconducting filaments in the tape are important factors defining the coupling losses. The geometrical factor needs to be known for determination of P &#8869;and is for tapes usually taken simply as the aspect ratio of the tapes, a/b, where a is the thickness and b is the width of the tape. The Abstract proposed study is aimed at determining the effective transverse resistivity of 8 filamentary untwisted Bi-2223/Ag tapes, fabricated by the PIT method and heat treated at 837oC. This takes into account the filament configuration, tape thickness and width as well. Three thicknesses of 0.18mm, 0.24mm and 0.33mm tape were studied. Ic, X-ray diffraction, and optical microscopy measurements were performed in order to characterise the tape. The Bi2223/Bi2212 phase ratio in the composite is XBi2223=~87%, and there is no bridging between the filament and no discontinuities. The Ic values for the thicknesses are: Ic(0.18mm)=11.2A, Ic(0.24mm)=17.85A, Ic(0.33mm)=13.8A. The Ic vs. thickness values demonstrate an optimum thickness for Ic.Measurements of the frequency dependence of the AC loss makes it possible to obtain the value of  P &#8869;&#61472;for each thickness-length of tape. This measurement was performed using an induction method, with the excitation field applied parallel to the face of the tape. The P &#8869;&#61472;is large, comparing to the tape matrix resistivity, P Ag.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Materials Science and Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/7</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Does obesity affect foot structure and function, foot sensation and plantar pressure in children?</field><field name="creator">Dowling, Annaliese</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2764</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of upper body skin temperatures in the regulation of sweat secretion in man</field><field name="creator">Patterson, Mark John</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2773</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The measurement of ionised magnesium in serum and whole blood for the detection of acute myocardial infarction</field><field name="creator">Kyriacou, Loucas</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2774</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relation of the structural evolution of the Macquarie syncline to sedimentation in the Moon Island beach sub-group, New South Wales</field><field name="creator">Johnson, K.

To date, however, little if any of this research has looked at consumer reaction to such information communicated via the medium of advertising, despite the increasing use of such corporate societal advertising appeals. While scepticism is a common cognitive response toward advertising, how scepticism toward non-economic corporate image claims might be promoted or inhibited through message elements has not been the focus of research attention. This thesis seeks to address this knowledge gap by investigating the impact of two diagnostic message elements on scepticism toward specific CSR claims.This study examines whether consumer scepticism toward the advertising of CSR claims can be influenced by altering the diagnosticity of social topic information and CSR commitment message dimensions. Two key research questions are addressed: does the provision of more social topic information encourage consumers toward less CSR advertising claim scepticism?, and does more specific information about a firm&#8217;s CSR commitment, expressing both its history and actual achievements, and their impacts, inhibit CSR advertising claim scepticism?In order to investigate these two research questions, an experimental approach was used to allow the manipulation of message elements and the testing of cause and effect. Data received via an online panel of a cross-section of 417 Australian consumers were analysed, and the hypotheses specified in study were tested using analysis of variance and covariance techniques.Results from this research suggest that increased information about the social topic related to the domain of the firm&#8217;s CSR initiatives does not significantly influence the level of scepticism toward CSR advertising claims, but information specificity about the firm&#8217;s CSR commitment does. These results are impacted by the consumer&#8217;s level of scepticism toward advertising in general, attitude toward the notion of corporate social responsibility, and attitude toward the social topic. The findings of this thesis provide evidence that consumers have the ability to deal with larger cognitive loads, created by information about specific impacts of firms&#8217; CSR programs, and that such diagnostic information is useful in reducing scepticism responses to CSR messages. These responses are important, as they form the foundation of subsequent attitudinal and belief structures so critical for influencing consumer behaviour.The theoretical contributions of this study include: (1) situating the role of social topic information, considered a critical element of advertising campaigns in social marketing, in CSR advertising situations; (2) implicating an organisation&#8217;s CSR history and CSR and impacts as important diagnostic elements in CSR message claims; and (3) defending the ability of consumers to adequately discriminate between cognitively demanding informational inputs when evaluating CSR advertising claims. Given increasing demand from consumers to learn about firms&#8217; CSR efforts, and firms&#8217; increasing willingness to respond to these information demands with CSR-based advertising campaigns, this study also offers guidance for marketing communication managers charged with developing corporate image based on CSR-based brand claims. Limitations and directions for future research are also discussed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3023</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of the group A streptococcal surface protein, serum opacity factor as a vaccine antigen and virulence determinant</field><field name="creator">Gillen, Christine Margaret</field><field name="description">Group A streptococcus (GAS) causes invasive and non-invasive diseases, as well as severe immune sequelae such as rheumatic fever and acute post streptococcal glomerulonephritis. Several surface proteins have been proposed as candidate vaccine antigens; this study examined the serum opacity factor (SOF) of GAS, a cell-surface protein which causes opalescence of human serum and mediates bacterial binding to fibronectin.A molecular characterisation of SOF from common Australian and international isolates revealed that SOF exhibits considerable variation in the N-terminal domain of the protein. This extensive variation has not led to a distinct geographic segregation, suggesting that SOF may have evolved a number of SOF sequence types that are common throughout global populations. In this study, hexahistidyl-tagged fusion proteins encompassing full-length SOF, and domains of SOF encompassing opacity factor activity (rSOF&#916;Fn) and fibronectin binding domains (FnBD), were used in the characterisation of the Aboriginal immune response to SOF. Anti-SOF serum IgG responses were found to be significantly higher (p &lt; 0.001) in Aboriginal adults and children when compared to the non-Aboriginal adult group. The Aboriginal immune response against the FnBD of SOF was significantly reduced when compared to the response against the whole SOF protein and the SOF&#916;Fn domain (p &lt; 0.001). This pattern of immune response was also observed in rabbits immunised with recombinant SOF. However, even though the immune response against SOF is directed toward the N-terminal variable domain, this study has shown that parenteral immunisation with the rSOF&#916;Fn domain stimulates an immune response that can protect against a lethal systemic challenge with a heterologous GAS strain, suggesting that the SOF protein from different GAS strains may contain common protective epitopes.While SOF protects against systemic heterologous GAS challenge when administrated parenterally, this study found that mucosal immunisation with the SOF protein fails to protect against mucosal heterologous GAS challenge. As the most effective protection against subsequent challenge is achieved when SOF is administered parenterally, the capacity of SOF to bind and precipitate high density lipoprotein (a function known as opacity factor activity or OF activity) may preclude its use as a vaccine antigen in humans. This study generated mutant forms of recombinant SOF with reduced (100 fold) or abrogated OF activity, for use as vaccine antigens. However, the structural alterations introduced into the N-terminal SOF domain (SOF&#916;Fn) by mutagenesis to abrogate OF activity, abolish the capacity of SOF to protect against lethal systemic GAS challenge in a murine model.Mutant forms of purified SOF&#916;Fn were also used to assess the contribution of OF activity to the pathogenic processes of cell adhesion and cell invasion. Latex beads coated with full-length rSOF75, rSOF75&#916;Fn or rFnBD, were used to show that adhesion to HEp-2 cells is mediated by both the SOF&#916;Fn and FnBD domains of SOF. The HEp-2 cell binding displayed by the N-terminal SOF&#916;Fn peptide is independent of OF activity. While the N-terminus of SOF does not directly mediate  ntracellular uptake by epithelial cells, this domain enhances epithelial cell uptake mediated by full-length SOF, in comparison to the FnBD alone.This study characterised SOF as a vaccine antigen of GAS, and showed for the first time that vaccination with SOF can protect against infection by a heterologous GAS serotype in an animal model. However, a number of deficiencies were identified that must be resolved before SOF can be applied as a vaccine antigen, including the OF activity of SOF and also the observation that SOF protects against GAS challenge only when administered parenterally.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3031</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Insoluble oxide product formation and its effect on coke dissolution in liquid iron</field><field name="creator">Chapman, Michael Wallace</field><field name="description">A significant body of work exists around coke dissolution into liquid iron, however there are key aspects of this important reaction that are not well described. This study was focused on gaining the answers to the questions &#8220;How does the coke mineral matter behave during coke dissolution?&#8221; and &#8220;Can the effects of sulphur and oxide layer formation on the dissolution rate be separated and quantified?&#8221;. Issues that must be addressed if the understanding of the kinetics of this reaction is to be advanced and coke's use in the blast furnace further optimised.To this end, a detailed investigation was conducted examining the influence of coke mineral matter on coke (carbon) dissolution into liquid iron. This project was focused on the mineral matter layer that forms at the coke/iron interface and how the presence of this layer affects the kinetics of carbon dissolution from the coke into the liquid iron. A range of experimental techniques were used to identify and characterise the mineral layer as it formed at the coke/iron interface and to assess the layers influence on the carbon dissolution kinetics.Carbon dissolution experiments, utilising a carburiser cover technique, were carried out where carbon and sulphur transfer to an iron-carbon melt was measured over time at temperatures of 1450&#176;C, 1500&#176;C and 1550&#176;C. This technique allowed fundamental data on the dissolution rate constant to be calculated, and the effects of temperature, melt sulphur and different carbonaceous materials to be explored.Development of the mineral layer at the coke/iron interface as a function of both time and temperature was studied utilising a quenched carbon dissolution technique that was developed during the project. This technique had the additional benefit of allowing the composition of the melt to be determined for a larger range of elements than the dissolution experiments. The quenched carbon dissolution experiments complemented the carbon dissolution experiments and allowed direct comparisons between the dissolution behaviour measured in the dissolution experiments and the composition and morphology of the mineral layer observed in the quenched samples.The dissolution studies were further complemented by sessile drop measurements of the wetting behaviour of iron on the mineral phases that were identified in the mineral layer present at the coke/iron interface, thermodynamic modelling utilising the MTDATA software package and a conceptual model of the interfacial mineral layer.A mineral layer was observed to have formed at the coke/iron interface during coke dissolution into liquid iron at experimental temperatures ranging from 1450&#176;C to 1550&#176;C. The mineral layer was solid at these temperatures and persistent at the interface. The amount of mineral matter present in the mineral layer was observed to be increasing with increased reaction time. The composition and structure of the mineral layer changed with both experimental time and temperature. The composition of the mineral layer was principally composed of oxides of aluminium and calcium, present as various calcium aluminates and calcium sulphides. Initially the mineral layer was a loose agglomeration of particles of which a majority were alumina particles. As the dissolution reaction proceeded, the loose agglomeration of particles was replaced by an open acicular layer that was predominantly the calcium aluminate CaO.6Al2O3 (CA6). As the dissolution reaction continued further, the calcium aluminates became increasingly richer in calcium oxide, with the predominate phase present in the mineral layer progressing through the calcium aluminates phases CA6 to CaO.2Al2O3 (CA2) and onto CaO.Al2O3 (CA). The apparent calcium enrichment of the mineral layer was observed to occur more rapidly as the experimental temperature increased. Accompanying the compositional changes in the mineral layer, the morphology of the mineral layer was also observed to change. The mineral layer was formed as an initial loose agglomeration of alumina particles, changing to an open acicular structure consisting of CA6/CA2 before being converted to a dense layer as the dissolution reaction proceeded and the composition of the mineral layer changed to CA and calcium sulphide (CaS) appeared at the interface.It was found that the formation of the calcium sulphide layer was preceded by the formation of the calcium aluminate layer. Only after the calcium aluminate layer had experienced progressive calcium enrichment and the CA and CA2 phases had formed did the CaS phase appear at the iron interface. Thermodynamic analysis of the experimental results confirmed that the formation of the calcium enriched calcium aluminates, CA2 and CA, were a necessary requirement to stabilise the calcium sulphide layer for the coke composition studied.The kinetics of carbon dissolution from the coke to the liquid iron were observed to be dependent on the structure of the interfacial mineral layer. This dependence was manifest as two stage behaviour in the first order mass transfer plots. The initial stage, characterised by rapid carbon dissolution, was observed while the mineral layer was developing or had the open acicular structure of the CA6/CA2 layer. The second stage was characterised by a significant reduction in the rate of carbon dissolution. The onset of the second stage was coincident with the change in the composition of the mineral layer from CA6/CA2 to CA2/CA and the associated densification of the mineral layer. In stating that the nature of the mineral layer affects the dissolution kinetics, a change in the reaction control mechanism is implied. This represents a change in the coke dissolution kinetics from simple mass transfer control to a mixed control regime where both mass transfer and the mineral (product) layer are active.In an attempt to overcome the problems associated with the heterogeneity of coke a coke analogue was developed. In the coke analogue the composition and dispersion of the carbonaceous and mineral matter (oxides) are controlled and the porosity is fixed. When single phase calcium aluminates were introduced into the coke analogues, calcium enrichment of the resulting calcium aluminate mineral layer was observed. The observed carbon dissolution kinetics were dependant on the structure of the interfacial calcium aluminate layer. Consistent with the coke dissolution studies, the calcium aluminate layer formed at the coke analogue iron interface during carbon dissolution was at least in part rate controlling the carbon dissolution reaction for the coke analogues studied.Utilising the sessile drop experimental technique the wettability with liquid ironcarbon-sulphur alloys of the predominate phases that were observed in the mineral layer were measured. It was observed that the contact angle decreased as the proportion of lime (CaO) in the calcium aluminate increased. Further it was observed that while the presence of sulphur in the melt increased the contact angle for the alumina and CA6 substrates, on the CA2 and CA substrates the contact angle was decreased. The improvement in the wetting of the CA2 and CA substrates with sulphur was attributed to the formation of CaS at the substrate/droplet interface.This study has produced new fundamental data on the growth and development of the mineral layer and the wettability of the predominate calcium aluminates observed in the mineral layer. These detailed studies have illuminated the changing nature of the layer in terms of both composition and morphology and found that the kinetics of carbon dissolution from the coke to the liquid iron were dependant on the structure of the interfacial mineral layer.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3039</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Building Babel: freeing multimedia processing and delivery from hard-coded formats</field><field name="creator">Thomas-Kerr, Joseph Alfred</field><field name="description">The amount of multimedia content available via the Internet, and the number of formats in which it is encoded, stored and delivered continues to grow rapidly. So too the number and diversity of the devices and software applications which produce, process and consume such content. This constantly changing landscape presents an increasing challenge to interoperability, since more and more software and hardware must be upgraded as new formats are developed. However, many of the operations performed on multimedia content are similar across coding formats. In recognising this, this thesis proposes several approaches to format-independent media processing, with an emphasis on content delivery. This considerably simplifies interoperability, since support for a new content format may be provided by disseminating a data file, rather than requiring application and device providers to extend and modify their software and hardware. A fundamental requirement for format-independence is the ability to describe the structure of any given format in a way that exposes how it may be fragmented for delivery or processing, and how other data important to the processing (for instance temporal or scalability parameters) can be extracted from the binary data. Several meta-syntax languages are evaluated that (to greater or lesser degree) perform this function. Of these, the most suitable for general use in format-independent processors is found to be MPEG-21&#8217;s Bitstream Syntax Description Language (BSDL). Its general suitability notwithstanding, BSDL exhibits several critical flaws when used to describe and process modern content formats. In response, this thesis proposes several new features for the language which significantly reduce processing complexity, and provide extensibility for complex data types. These features are implemented and validated using bitstreams of real-world length, which enable a linear response of approximately 10 times the speed of playback (on the particular test machine used), for videos up to one hour in duration. Digital media increasingly encompasses a wide range of metadata, as well as collections of related content (a DVD and it&#8217;s &#8220;special features&#8221;, for instance). Several recent standards address generic virtual containers for such rich content. While these standards&#8212;which include MPEG-21 and TVAnytime&#8212;provide numerous tools for interacting with rich media objects, they do not provide a framework for streaming or delivery of such data. This thesis presents the Bitstream Binding Language (BBL), a format-independent tool that describes how multimedia content and metadata may be bound into delivery formats. Using a BBL description, a generic processor can map rich content (an MPEG-21 Digital Item, for example) into a streaming or static delivery format. BBL provides a universal syntax for fragmentation and packetisation of both XML and binary data, and allows new content and metadata formats to be delivered without requiring the addition of new software to the delivery infrastructure. The BBL framework is validated and tested against a number of application scenarios including a format-independent streaming server, generic metadata syntax translation, virtual container assembly, and a format-independent hinter.Finally, it is observed that much of the semantic metadata that is generated to describe multimedia content could also be used to improve the decisions that must be made in order to transmit it effectively. Indeed, methods have been proposed for using specific semantic concepts in the delivery process. However, until now, no high-level system has been proposed that is able to take arbitrary semantic metadata, and utilise it in the multimedia delivery decision-making process. This thesis proposes such a system. It combines the aforementioned semantic concepts with other existing work in Rate-Distortion Optimisation for multimedia delivery, scalable content formats, and syntax description, and then develops a generalised framework to permit an arbitrary range of semantic metadata and optimisation techniques to be utilised. This objective is accomplished by utilising schema languages to describe the details of any given content or metadata, so that declarative mapping rules can be specified for translating from format-specific data points to format-independent concepts that are directly used by the framework. This translation can then be performed using software or hardware that knows nothing about the specific format it is processing.This thesis describes a particular embodiment of the semantic-aware multimedia delivery system which was implemented in order to verify its key assertions. It presents the results of subjective testing that was performed on several short news clips encoded using H.264/SVC scalable video coding, and Scalable-To-Lossless (SLS) au dio coding. Each clip was adapted to four target bitrates, using both of two methods: (a) using the semantic-aware system to devote a greater proportion of the available bandwidth to that part of the content (audio or video) that was conveying more of the semantics at any given time; and (b) at a constant bit-rate with the same average rate as clip (a). Test participants were shown each pair of clips (a and b) in a random order and were asked to evaluate which was more successful at conveying the meaning of the story. The result of this subjective testing was a 72% preference for those clips which had been adapted so as to devote more bandwidth to the semantically-important parts of the content.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computational Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3054</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Textual intimacy: ethical education for characters and readers in Jane Austen's novels</field><field name="creator">Lebow, Lori Karen</field><field name="description">This project examines four of Jane Austen's novels, focusing on narrative technique that positions readers to experience ethical dilemmas similar to those which serve to educate the heroines. Jane Austen's texts explore the epistemological issues of how subjectivity and imagination distort perception. Of particular importance is the communication process. Attention to language in all of its forms suggests Austen's acute awareness of the linguistic nature of human experience. Because Austen valued honesty and integrity, her texts demonstrate the necessity of cultivating these qualities to achieve enriching, intimate relationships. Language becomes the means through which characters are able to evaluate each other and to discover 'truth'. While the characters in the novels gain understanding, readers are similarly instructed because the narrative positions readers to become intimates of the characters. Since novels selectively create a textual reality, they become examples of the problems they raise. Characters and readers are taught to value compassion, and to maintain a generous, open-minded attitude in relating to each other. Narrative technique and reader response in Northanger Abbey, Pride and Prejudice, Emma and Persuasion, indicate that as Austen's skill developed, her narrative manipulations of reader response gained subtlety. While readers may be aware of the education process occurring within the text, Austen's creation of a mirroring experience for readers may be overlooked.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Arts and Humanities</field><field name="subject">English Language and Literature</field><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of urban emissions of trace gases use of atmospheric measurements and a high-resolution atmospheric transport model</field><field name="creator">Dunse, Bronwyn Louise</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1159</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hybrid concurrency control for prioritized rules in active database systems</field><field name="creator">Kim, Chae-Kyu</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1296</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Firewalls and internet security</field><field name="creator">Hussain, Shaukat</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2013</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dealing with diversity: incorporating cultural sensitivity into professional midwifery practice</field><field name="creator">Williamson, Moira Jane</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2068</field></doc><doc><field name="title">(Bi,Pb)2Sr2Ca2Cu3O10+x/Ag : high Tc superconductors and their applications in an electrical fault current limiter and an electronic high voltage generator</field><field name="creator">Jian-xun, Jin</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2074</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Microwave processing of sewage sludge</field><field name="creator">Mourtos, Paul</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2395</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The idealized limited pressure compression ignition cycle: an empirical treatment of its response to varying operating parameters</field><field name="creator">Van der Werf, Peter Van</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2413</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An analysis of machining accuracies in CNC machining operations</field><field name="creator">Islam, Mohammad Nazrul</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2511</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Late quaternary stratigraphy and chronology of the Riverine Plain, Southeastern Australia</field><field name="creator">Page, Kenneth John</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1385</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An examination of the sustainability of online communities in Australia: including the findings of participatory action research undertaken on a Beta 3rd generation network type regional community portal in New South Wales</field><field name="creator">Connery, Andrew</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2568</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of antibiotic resistance gene clusters and their mobility within a collection of multi-drug resistant Salmonella spp</field><field name="creator">Liu, Xiulan</field><field name="description">One hundred and thirty-six Salmonella enterica strains, isolated from humans, animals, environmental and plant sources in Australia from 23 serovars, were examined for the streptomycin resistance gene strA and strB, the sulfonamide resistance gene sul2, and the tetracycline resistance gene tetA(A) and tetA(B). Thirteen strains were identified as containing the strA-strB genes located on the transposon Tn5393. S. enterica serovar Hadar accounted for 11 of these strains, 6 of which were isolated from humans and 5 were from ducks. This investigation is therefore the first report of the Tn5393 transposon being detected in bacterial strains from a human source in Australia.RSF1010 plasmids were identified and extracted from 4 S. enterica strains, and were further confirmed by restriction enzyme profiling using PstI, SspI and EcoRV. Small non-conjugative plasmid p9123 was extracted and characterised from 3 of the S. enterica strains and also confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion. An RSF1010-like plasmid was also identified in 3 of the strains. This plasmid was found to be approximately 2.6 kb larger than RSF1010, and possibly derived from the RSF1010 plasmid via insertion of the tetracycline resistance gene tetA(A) between strB and mobC genes.An IS26-strB-strA-sul2-repC-repA-IS26 antibiotic resistance region was identified in 33 S. enterica strains, among these were 23 serovar Typhimurium isolates, 8 serovar Bovismorbificans, 1 serovar Senftenberg and 1 isolate where the serovar could not be conclusively identified. The 23 Typhimurium strains were further characterised by PCR and Southern hybridisation analysis using a blaTEM gene probe. The analysis identified two classes of antibiotic resistance gene clusters. Eleven S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strains harboured an IS26-strB-strA-sul2-repC-repA-IS26-blaTEM-1-IS26 antibiotic resistance gene cluster and another 10 S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strains contained an IS26-strB-strA-sul2-repC-repA-IS26-blaTEM-1 gene cluster, without the IS26 element downstream of the blaTEM-1 gene. Two strains contain elements of these gene clusters but further investigation is needed to fully identify these.Further linkage PCR amplifications revealed that the IS26-strB-strA-sul2-repC-repA-IS26-blaTEM-1-IS26 antibiotic resistance gene cluster was possibly inserted into the 3P-CS of a class 1 integron (In4 type) and truncated the 3P-CS region. Three derivatives were identified, of which the dfrA5-intI1 type was most commonly found downstream of the blaTEM-1-IS26 region. Southern hybridisation analysis using an IS200 gene probe revealed that strains which contain different antibiotic resistance gene clusters also display different but related IS200 profiles.The antibiotic resistance gene clusters of 19 S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strains were transferred to an E. coli 294 Rifr recipient either by direct mating or triparental mating methods. These experiments confirmed that the antibiotic resistance gene clusters were located on conjugative or mobilisable plasmids. The antibiotic resistance gene clusters of 4 S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strains could not be transferred to the E. coli 294 Rifr recipient. These experimental results suggest that the antibiotic resistance gene cluster of IS26-strB-strA-sul2-repC-repA-IS26-blaTEM-1-IS26 might move as one genetic element between distinct plasmid backbones.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3043</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Encounters in Vanuatu: process and interactions in visual arts</field><field name="creator">Kay, Catherine</field><field name="description">The Master of Creative Arts Research investigates cross-cultural interactions with Vanuatu between 2003 and 2008. Several fieldtrips to the island of Efate the main island, site of the capital Port Vila enabled meetings with the visual art milieu of craftspeople, artists, the Vanuatu Cultural Centre and Museum, the two Art Foundations Michoutouchkine and Susanne Bastien, as well as commercial outlets.  It confirmed my interest in setting up conversations between my own art practice in Australia with individual artists in Vanuatu through two conferences, firstly the Pacific Arts Association IXth International Symposium Mus&#233;e du quay Branly in 2007 in Paris and secondly, the Pacific International Museum Association in Port Vila in 2008. My research, which includes two exhibitions, presents a working strategy based in artistic process for developing an on-going dialogue between artists from the Pacific and non-Indigenous Australian culture. Core concerns for island communities such those in Vanuatu include an understanding of the multiplicity within island cultures, a developing relationship between genders and a situation of constant change and development in relation to dominant external influences. &#8232;&#8232;My research built on insights from recent exhibitions by indigenous and non-indigenous artists and curators, which included work from, mixed cultural backgrounds such as Weaving the Murray (Art Gallery of South Australia and Prospect Gallery, Adelaide 2002), News from Islands (Campbelltown Art Centre 2007), and Woven forms (Object Gallery, Sydney and Form Gallery, Perth 2006).My collaborative research and exhibition document my encounter with two ni-Vanuatu artist/craftspeople Eric and Linda Natuoivi. Eric Natuoivi was already acknowledged as a leading Pacific artist through his involvement in the Asia Pacific Triennial of 1996, while his wife Linda is a highly regarded weaver within her community, but unknown outside Vanuatu. &#8232;Key issues that emerge are the interactions between artists and between artists and audience; the power relations between cultures and institutions, and facilitating the needs of artists from very different cultural situations. The exhibition Encounters in Vanuatu (FCA gallery 2009) documents the processes of these interactions as well as presenting important examples of Eric and Linda Natuoivi&#8217;s works. My artwork, in the adaptation of plaited structures and photographs, reflects the transformation that occurred as a result of being a catalyst between two worlds. Digital images and short films address the complexities of reading artworks outside their context of production, and in the artificial reality of the gallery space. This essay proposes a model for cross cultural interaction and highlights the significance of artistic, intellectual and economic benefits for artists engaged in cross-cultural events.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Other Arts and Humanities</field><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3055</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis and characterisation of novel conducting electroactive polymers for metal ion transport</field><field name="creator">Davey, Jelders Michael</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1185</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Computer based landslide hazard and risk assessment (Northern Illawarra Region of New South Wales)</field><field name="creator">Flentje, Phillip Noel</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1231</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Three Bangladeshi plays considered in postcolonial context</field><field name="creator">Chowdhury, Khairul Haque</field><field name="description">There is no full-length investigation of postcoloniality in Bangladeshi Bengali literature. This is partly because Bangladesh had no separate identity under colonial rule, being just another part of greater India. Then, at partition, it became one section of the unnatural union that was Pakistan. These two identities have kept Bangladesh as a relatively unknown domain, at least to the Western academy. The other reason in the context of literary postcolonial studies is that these have concentrated on writing in English, whereas Bangladeshi literature is almost completely in the national language. This study offers a discussion of the postcoloniality of contemporary Bangladeshi theatre via analysis of selected playtexts.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">postcolonial</field><field name="subject">literature</field><field name="subject">bangladesh</field><field name="subject">bengali</field><field name="subject">bangladeshi</field><field name="subject">plays</field><field name="subject">bangladeshi plays</field><field name="subject">play</field><field name="subject">bangladeshi theatre</field><field name="subject">theatre</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">nuroldin</field><field name="subject">footfalls</field><field name="subject">war</field><field name="subject">liberation</field><field name="subject">Dewan Gazi Tale</field><field name="subject">performance control bill</field><field name="subject">India</field><field name="subject">drama</field><field name="subject">criticism</field><field name="subject">foreign influences</field><field name="subject">customs</field><field name="subject">English Language and Literature</field><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/6</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of novel high-amplitude oscillations in skin blood flow</field><field name="creator">Haley, Cassandra D</field><field name="description">Regulation of skin blood flow (Q.sk) is vital to homeostasis, with adjustments to flow in response to important sympathetic thermal and non-thermal reflexes and by other factors which remain to be fully determined, but include local regulatory mechanisms (i.e. axon reflexes, release of endothelial vasoactive substances etc.). Laser-Doppler flowmetry is a well-known technique, used for assessing microvascular function, with raw Q.sk traces displaying marked variability, which is in part due to the above mechanisms, but also results from passive influences (i.e. oscillations in pressure resulting from cardiac frequency (fc) or respiration (fb), alterations to local transmural pressure and turbulences in flow due to vessel structure and or the viscosity of blood). The central focus of this dissertation was an investigation and characterisation of an apparently hidden, novel Q.sk phenomenon, which has not been previously reported in the literature, possibly due to traditional data processing techniques. This phenomenon encompasses high-amplitude oscillations in Q.sk which were detected using laser-Doppler flowmetry in human and rat Q.sk, which have a characteristic frequency of ~0.4 Hz, spanning ~1000 ms, and consist of high-amplitude peaks, accounting for up to a seven-fold increase of basal Q.sk.  Experiments presented within this thesis confirm the biological nature of these oscillations, which are present in both acral and non-acral skin regions. These oscillations, increase significantly with increases in local and mean skin temperature (Tsk; humans and rats Q.sk; P&lt;0.05) and may occur independently of core temperature. Further, these oscillations appear to be unaffected by global changes in mean arterial pressure within the normotensive range (P&gt;0.05). Local application of anaesthetic (i.e. to remove vessel tone) attenuated these oscillations in response to whole-body heating. However, propranolol treatment (80mg; orally) produced no significant differences in the characteristics of these oscillations (P&gt;0.05), despite producing a significant reduction in fc (~ 10 b&#8226;min-1; P&lt;0.05). Differences in baroreceptor loading between a supine and seated posture (as reflected by a significant increase in fc of ~ 10 b&#8226;min-1 in the seated posture; P&lt;0.05) produced no differences in the frequency of the high-amplitude oscillations at the forearm when recorded at heart level (~ 0.4 Hz). However, measurements at the thigh in the seated posture, displayed a significant decrease in the frequency of these oscillations (reduction of ~0.3 Hz) when compared to the supine position (P&lt;0.05). In addition, alterations to local vessel pressure by movement of the position of the Q.sk measurement site above or below heart level significantly increased the frequency of these oscillations (by ~0.2 Hz and ~0.1 Hz respectively; P&lt;0.05). Remarkably, additional manipulations of local pressure by means of upper arm occlusion (2 min; to either ~90 or 240mmHg), increased the frequency of these oscillations in some subjects, while in others a reduction in frequency was observed (P&lt;0.05). Furthermore, time frequency analysis, shows that these oscillations occur independently of fc and fb.   Taken together, it is likely that sympathetic nervous system has a minimal role in the induction of these oscillations (i.e. not associated with an active vasodilator mechanism, as this system is lacking in acral regions) and the oscillations occurring under conditions where the sympathetic vasoconstrictor tone to the skin would be expected to be minimal (e.g. hyperthermia). Local threshold-dependent thermal mechanisms (i.e. Tsk ~35-36&#186;C) may mediate these oscillations. However, since these oscillations have also been detected under normothermic conditions in the thigh and forearm in human subjects (Tsk ~32-33&#186;C), it is also possible that local temperature may exacerbate or facilitate non-thermal mechanisms, leading to the induction of these oscillations. The other possibilities are that multiple mechanisms may account for the high-amplitude oscillations, or that the threshold skin temperature for the induction of these oscillations varies with experimental conditions. However, if non-thermal factors account for the high-amplitude oscillations, then the results support a local passive mechanism, as these oscillations appear to be unaffected by central changes in vascular pressure (i.e. mean arterial pressure and oscillations in intravascular pressure due to fc and fb), yet are greatly affected by local alterations to pressure and vessel tone. The exact local passive mechanism behind these oscillations remains to be determined, but is likely to be common across skin regions and species, and the physiological relevance of the high-amplitude oscillations may relate to enhanced tissue perfusion, and or heat transfer through the cutaneous circulation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/61</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental correlates of adults' walking behaviour</field><field name="creator">Humpel, Nancy</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1658</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Event-related potentials in word-pair processing</field><field name="creator">Graffi, Joseph</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1659</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Executive function deficits in obsessive-compulsive disorder: episode or trait markers</field><field name="creator">Bannon, Shelley</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1660</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The name must not go down: political competition in Mount Hagen, Papua New Guinea</field><field name="creator">Ketan, Joseph</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2118</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interpersonal concomitants of generalised anxiety disorder</field><field name="creator">Milicevic, Dragica Denise</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2129</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Impact of separation anxieties on treatment outcomes in adults with anxiety disorders</field><field name="creator">Kirsten, Laura T.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2140</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reaction of 3-Hydroxykynurenine with lens proteins and synthetic peptides</field><field name="creator">Aquililna, J.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether the organic matter in the coal seams and as dispersed fragments is the same, different or systematically related. The type of organic matter in each may indicate that one is better, or the same, as a source for hydrocarbons.The sedimentary sequences examined are those of the Permian- Triassic Cooper Basin, the Permian Pedirka Basin, the Triassic Simpson Desert Basin, and the Jurassic-Cretaceous Eromanga Basin, all of which are located in central Australia.In addition, the relationship of organic matter type to the depositional environment for the Permian sequence in the Cooper Basin was investigated.  AH of the studies were carried out using reflected and transmitted light microscopic techniques for analyses of the organic matter.Relationships have been found between the maceral types of the dispersed organic matter (DOM) and the maceral and microlithotypecompositions of the associated coals.Exinite (sporinite) DOM correlates with vitrinite and sporinite in the associated coals in the Cooper and Eromanga Basins, Exinite (cutinite) DOM correlates negatively with cutinite in the coal in the Simpson Desert Basin, Sporinite DOM correlates with vitrite plus clarite and intermediate, microlithotypes (duroclarite, clarodurite and vitrinertite) in the coals of the Cooper Basin.Vitrinite DOM correlates with vitrinite and the intermediate microlithotypes in associated coal in the Cooper Basin, and with resinite in the coal of the Eromanga Basin, Inertinite DOM, mostly inertodetrinite, correlates with inertodetrinite and durite plus inertite in the associated coals in the Cooper Basin.The microlithotype compositions of coals formed in association with a large lake environment are distinctly different from the microlithotype compositions of coals formed on the lower coastal plain and in areasdominated by coal swamps in the Permian of the Cooper Basin, Channel belt coals are also distinct in type from those of the lower coastal plain, upper coastal plain and areas dominated by coal swamps. Lower coastal plain coals can be differentiated from upper coastal plain coals on the basis of their microlithotype compositions.Those coals with the highest vitrite plus clarite contents have formed in channel belts and associated with large lakes. Coals with the highest durite plus inertite contents have formed in the areas dominated by coal swamps.Given that exinite is the coal maceral richest in hydrogen, and therefore the best material for generating hydrocarbons, the best source rocks in the Permian of the Cooper Basin are those which have formed in the large lake and channel belt environments. If inertinite has the least potential as a source for hydrocarbons, then the sequences in areas dominated by coal swamps have the lowest potential as source rocks for hydrocarbons.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2119</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Measurement and meaning of Core Relationship Theme changes during psychotherapy</field><field name="creator">Parker, Lisa</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2130</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Photography as a measure of constricted construing: the experience of depression through a camera</field><field name="creator">Hanieh, Emma</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2131</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Control of coating mass on a continuous hot dip galvanizing line</field><field name="creator">McKerrow, Phillip John</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2384</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An analytical and statistical treatment of the infinitely dilute resonance integral</field><field name="creator">Thompson, D.

Its high water solubility makes it a potentially very attractive material for a range of applications. However, to date problems with its synthesis from MAS monomer and the impure nature of the PMAS product have hindered its exploitation. This thesis successfully addresses these problems and then subsequently exploits the pure high molecular weight PMAS obtained as a novel electroactive dopant in composite materials with other conducting polymers.The initial focus of this thesis was the development of a rapid purification technique capable of fractionating in gram scale quantities the crude mixture of PMAS and low molecular weight oligomers formed in establish d syntheses of PMAS. A new method was successfully established using cross flow tangential filtration to obtain, for the first time, the high purity, high molecular weight (HMWt) and low molecular weight (LMWt) PMAS fractions. Gel permeation chromatography, UV-visible spectroscopy and four point probe conductivity were used for characterisation of these fractions. The new separation technique was found to be a more efficient, rapid and scalable method for purification of PMAS than the conventional dialysis previously employed. Results have shown that the presence of the LMWt PMAS has an unexpected influence upon the electronic properties of the HMWt PMAS such that conductivity increases by two fold after its effective removal.Detailed optimisation studies were then performed on the synthesis of PMAS via the chemical polymerisation of 2-methoxyaniline-5-sulfonic acid (MAS) monomer, using ammonium persulfate as oxidant. These demonstrated that experimental variables such as time, temperature, monomer  oncentration, pH, and the rate of addition of oxidant influence the yield, molecular weight and conductivity of the resultant PMAS. Employing the optima l synthetic conditions resulted in a HMWt PMAS product with enhanced conductivity of 1.74 &#177; 0.09 S/cm, Mp 16,900 and recovered yield (after tangential cross flow filtration) of 50 % w/w.The pure HMWt and LMWt PMAS fractions obtained following the above purification were fully characterised using techniques such as cyclic voltammetry (CV), electron spin resonance (ESR), photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The HMWt PMAS fraction (Mn 13,400 kDa, Mw 33,600 kDa, Mp 16,900 kDa and PDI 2.5) was found to be paramagnetic due to the presence of radical cations (polarons). In contrast, the LMWt PMAS fraction (Mn 2,400 kDa, Mw ,700 kDa, Mp 2,800 kDa and PDI 1.1) was non-electroactive and non-conducting with no paramagnetic properties. Both HMWt and LMWt PMAS fractions exhibited nanodimensional morphology. The recently reported photoluminescence properties of PMAS have been reassessed in this thesis, revealing that the LMWt PMAS fraction in the presence of HMWt PMAS was the source of the unexpected photoemission reported for aqueous PMAS. In contrast, pure HMWt PMAS was found to statically quench the photoluminescence of LMWt PMAS.These optimisation and purification studies provided an opportunity to study, for the first time, the incorporation of pure HMWt PMAS as a conducting polyelectrolyte dopant without the complication of oligomeric impurities, which were shown above to dramatically influence the properties of PMAS. Pure HMWt PMAS was incorporated as a dopant during chemical and electrochemical polymerisation of substituted polyaniline (PAn). PAn/PMAS materials were prepared as water-insoluble films using  electrochemical polymerisation, and as highly dispersed nanomaterials via chemical polymerisation of aniline in the presence of HMWt PMAS. The incorporation of PMAS into the polyaniline was confirmed by elemental analysis, UV-vis spectroscopy and CV studies. The conductivity of the PAn/PMAS nanomaterial was found to be 3.0 &#177; 0.18 S/cm, approximately two orders of magnitude higher than that reported for polyaniline in the presence of non-conducting  olyelectrolytes, such as poly styrenesulfonate). Signifcantly, this new class of material exhibited conductivity at neutral pH values where polyanilineitself is de-doped to give a non-conducting material.The enhanced PAn/PMAS stability was xploited in this thesis in the area of electrochromics, giving an enhanced electrochromic contrast (57.0 %&#916;T at  770 nm). Its extended pH stability will also permit future studies into the utility of these materials in biological environments, which to date have been unavailable in unsubstituted PAn due to its lack of conductivity and electroactivity.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/713</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of forces on charged particles in electrostatic precipitators</field><field name="creator">Tassicker, Owen J.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1356</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Meaning in IS development: understanding system requirements and use with actor-network theory</field><field name="creator">Underwood, Jim</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1454</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Solving traveling salesman problems with heuristic learning approach</field><field name="creator">Lau, Sim Kim</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1455</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"Workers want a say: we have something to say" : workers' perspectives of management at BHP Refractories</field><field name="creator">Boas, Cecily Miriam</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1456</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a plant-wide productivity management system in an integrated steel strip plant</field><field name="creator">Wong, Chiu-Yum</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1460</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Engineers into managers: how to effect the transition of a competent technical professional into a competent manager</field><field name="creator">Halliday, Jacqueline Anne</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1461</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring concurrent engineering practice: human resource management and organisational power and politics</field><field name="creator">Schubert, Maren</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1462</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interorganizational relations and public regulation: the case of partially mandated occupational rehabilitation networks</field><field name="creator">Zanko, Michael</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1464</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Introducing concurrent engineering in an Indonesian aircraft manufacturing company: a processual analysis</field><field name="creator">Zainuddin, Zuhriati</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1465</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Janus: the multiple faces of engineering design</field><field name="creator">Wotherspoon, Ross D.</field><field name="description">This study is a sociological exploration of the work of engineering design. The data for this research were generated from a two-year ethnographic study of three engineering design projects within an Australian iron and steel producing company. This study provides an account of the activities undertaken, by engineers and others, during the design of human computer interfaces for process control. The study takes a symbolic interactionist perspective and acknowledges its criticisms. The study draws on Strauss's social worlds/arena theory, and Clarke's subsequent conceptualisation of the theory in an organisational context, to provide a broad set of sensitising concepts focussed on the interactive aspects of the construction of meaning amongst the social collectives involved in the process of engineering design.The findings of this study are organised around five interlinked and over lapping themes - trajectories of technology and work, design boundaries, engineering and operator social worlds, arenas in the process of design, and routine and non routine action. These themes reflect emergent concepts identified through the constant interplay between observation and analysis.The accounts given describe design negotiations riven through with ideologies of engineers, plant operators, and others, as individuals and as members of social collectives, such as occupational groups. I have come to understand these negotiations can be seen as battlefields with winners, losers, and only sometimes agreeable truces.These battles are conducted according to what appear to be predetermined rules of engagement that reflect - and define - who has power and over what elements of the battle that power can be exercised. The outcomes of these battles are design specifications that guide the 'trajectory' of a technology from an initial concept toward its final shape.This study is intended to provide a needed addition to the literature - detail on how individuals and groups go about creating new technological artefacts in an industrial design context. My hope is to assist both academics and practitioners in improving the process of engineering design.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1466</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Principals in NSW and school-centred education: principals' perceptions of their changed role and its personal impact during a time of system imposed reform</field><field name="creator">Lyall, Marie</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1470</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The disconfirmation of expectations paradigm for an industrial (business-to-business), professional service : an empirical examination and extension</field><field name="creator">Patterson, Paul G.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1471</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An analysis of GCC demand for tourism services with special reference to Australian tourist resorts</field><field name="creator">Alhemoud, Abdulla</field><field name="description">Tourism is an increasingly important area of Service trade. Every foreign visitor who spends money in a tourist resort/destination contributes to an improvement in the balance of current account of the country to which this resort belongs. With the value of the Australian dollar declining, and given the vast natural resources and beauty offered by Australia, tourism services may well become a key Australian export factor.The literature on marketing of tourism is still in an infant stage. This is because tourism, is a composite service offered by nationals to foreigners. The tourist is a very different customer to the national. In most cases, the tourist speaks a different language, adheres to a different religion, is grown up in a different culture, has different social values, comes from a place with different civilization and is used to different political and legal systems.The GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council, consisting of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates) is a great potential market for the Australian tourist industry. However, very little is known about the demand of GCC consumers for tourism services and the attitudes of these consumers toward various tourist resorts/destinations. Moreover, it is important to know whether GCC consumers would be interested to spend their vacation in Australia and to determine the salient characteristics of those GCC consumers who express interest to do so. However, Australia, should plan effective marketing strategies to maximize the intake of GCC tourists. This thesis is an interdisciplinary study that attempts to analyze the demand of GCC consumers for tourism services and the attitudes of GCC tourists toward various resorts/destinations. A special reference is given to GCC demand for Australian tourist resorts and the marketing strategies needed to maximize this demand. The thesis analyzed the main determinants of aggregate GCC spending on tourism. This is done through development and testing of Single and Simultaneous equation regression models. The econometric results suggest that GCC spending on tourism is subject to a partial adjustment mechanism with significant feedback effects. A surveys was conducted by the researcher during the months of April and May 1999 to find out how the consumers of the GCC countries rate tourist resorts and determine the main demographic factors which may discriminate between those who expressed interest to visit Australia and those who did not. Three random samples, each has 385 members, were collected from three GCC capital cities. The descriptive statistics suggest that the GCC consumers evaluate tourist resorts on 20 criteria. The relative importance of the considered variables varies within each member state and between states. The survey results also suggest that there are differences in the demographic profiles of the various GCC countries, particularly household income and family size. Moreover, The survey results indicate that a significant proportion of GCC consumers consider Australia as a tourist resort.The survey contained a large number of variables, most of which are correlated. The study attempted to examine the relationships among the interrelated variables and represent them in terms of a few underlying factors. This is done through the use of the technique of Factor Analysis. The principal component method, using varimax rotation, reduced the 20 explanatory variables, in each sample, to four factors. These were identified as "cost factor"; "attraction actor";  "convenience factor" and "image factor". Discriminant analysis was used to determine which, if any, of the four factors predict GCC consumers' interest to visit Australian resorts to a statistically significant degree. The results suggest that GCC consumers who are interested in visiting Australia are motivated by the "image factor" while those who are not interested are held back by the "cost factor".Since the GCC citizens have a wide range of choices when it comes to selecting a tourist resort, it was important to identify resorts with similar attributes. This is done through the use of the Cluster Analysis. Multiple discriminant analysis was then used to describe the nature of the differences between clusters and to test these differences for significance. The results of the cluster analysis suggest that the 13 most popular tourist resorts visited by GCC residents can be grouped into four clusters based on five predictors: "Travelling Cost"; Living Expenses", "Entertainment"; "Comfort"; "Attractions and adventures". Multiple Discriminant Analysis identified three discriminant functions. These functions suggest that GCC consumers, who visit the cluster of tourist resorts, which includes Australia, do so for attractions and adventures.The statistical results of the thesis suggest that Australian National and State Tourist Bureaus should approach the job of attracting GCC tourists from a planning point of view. The study develops a tourism-marketing plan for Australian tourist resorts to achieve this goal. A model of perceived service quality is also developed and applied to the Australian hotel industry. Finally the study discussed the marketing-mix of the Australian tourist industry and offered some recommendations to maximize the number of GCC tourists.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1475</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In-situ studies of phase transformations in iron alloys</field><field name="creator">Phelan, Dominic</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1504</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of music in television commercialsStephen Arthur Watson</field><field name="creator">Watson, Stephen Arthur</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1798</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Management of acid sulfate soils groundwater manipulation</field><field name="creator">Blunden, Bruce Geoffrey</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1834</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On-line tool wear estimation in CNC turning operations</field><field name="creator">Chungchoo, Chatchapol</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1835</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of the fluvial geomorphology of the eastern Kimberley Plateau, Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Wende, Rainer</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1965</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Society-oriented cryptographic techniques for information protection</field><field name="creator">Ghodosi, Hossein</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2020</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Life stage characteristics of nurses as determinants to continuing educational policy</field><field name="creator">Yuen, Felix Kwan</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2025</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Australian energy policy and its likely impact on rural industry costs and profitability</field><field name="creator">Fliedner, Ian</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2267</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Poverty in Australia with particular reference to the role of education as an anti-poverty strategy</field><field name="creator">Curry, John W.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2268</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Private Australian investment in the Pacific Basin: 1945 to 2000</field><field name="creator">Sztyk, Svetlana</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2269</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparative critique of the performance evaluation methods in the Australian energy industry</field><field name="creator">Li, Feng</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2270</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A case study of social responsibility accounting in local government reporting</field><field name="creator">Tran, Huong-Thuy</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2271</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Matrix converter technology in doubly-fed induction generators for wind generators</field><field name="creator">Harris, Benjamin J</field><field name="description">Wind generator technologies have been widely researched and documented. Modern wind generator systems are now being implemented with an output power of up to 5 MVA. They adopt power electronic control systems which allow the system to operate with a wide range of turbine shaft speeds, as well as with Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) algorithms to maximise the energy delivery to the power system.Despite the extensive development, maximum power transfer from the total available power in the wind gusts to the grid is limited by the mechanical and electrical losses in the generation process. A Doubly-Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) uses a two stage power converter process in the rotor circuit which contributes to the electrical losses in the system. By adopting a Matrix Converter (MC), the electrical losses may be reduced as the power conversation is conducted as a single stage process. This thesis presents existing variable speed generator technologies with a focus on DFIG systems. Based on this research, an alternative design for a DFIG control system using an MC is developed and analysed.The work begins with the presentation of existing DFIG systems using back-to-back PWM converters connected between the rotor circuit and the grid. The study examines MC technology and the application of current commutation techniques to MC systems. A non-ideal MC model and commutation controller is developed in the PSCAD / EMTDC environment. Simulation and analysis are conducted on the MC system connected to a passive load to determine its suitability for application in DFIG systems.The MC is connected to the rotor circuit of the DFIG system in the simulation and analysis is carried out to investigate the viability of the system. From this the MC excited DFIG is extended with the development of a hybrid Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) algorithm. The wind generator system is tested using pseudo-random wind speeds with varying wind gusts. The results of the simulation are presented and compared with existing MPPT technologies to assess the overall performance of the system in relation to existing technologies.Finally, the MC excited DFIG control system is adapted to provide reactive power compensation to the power system for the regulation of voltage in distribution networks. Testing of the system using a variable load connected to a common bus bar and single transmission line is conducted. Observations from the simulation show that VAr compensation from the DFIG system does reduce voltage fluctuations in power systems.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3026</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Knowledge libraries and information space</field><field name="creator">Rayner, Eric</field><field name="description">This research describes and develops Knowledge Libraries, idealised systems for organising and presenting information.

The central contention of the thesis is that Dennison was both deeply influenced by, and made an important contribution to the institutionalist 'school' of economic thought. It is contended that in his reorganisation of the family company to remove absentee owners and in his concern with inherited traits and habits of thought and their impact on human motivation, the impact of Thorstein Veblen is salient. It is demonstrated that in his theoretical inquiry into the rationale and inner logic of business firms that he was one of the first organisational or management economists. That his labour economics and industrial democracy initiatives were applauded by John R. Commons who visited Dennison, and in later writings placed him at the end of an intellectual lineage from Marx to Veblen, from Veblen to F.W. Taylor, and from Taylor to Dennison, in terms of the latter's intuitive understanding of the labour process and its place in 'managerial transactions'. It is also demonstrated that Dennison also worked closely with other recognised leaders of the institutionalist approach, namely Wesley Mitchell and Edwin Gay, particularly on business cycles, which resulted in Mitchell embracing a micro-based conception of smoothing business cycles at the level of the firm. And it is demonstrated that in his intellectual relationship with John Kenneth Galbraith, he was a major influence on the latter's economic thought especially Galbraith's concern with management and the corporation. Dennison's place in the institutionalist rubric is further vindicated by his lifelong advocacy of economic planning, both micro and macroeconomic, by his dissatisfaction with mainstream economics particularly its ignorance of the inner workings of the firm and its simplistic view of human motivation, by his activist involvement in public life and his concomitant belief in the need for institutional intervention to correct market failure, by his interest in the  corporation and the power of management and owners, and finally, by his personification of the nexus between economics and management. His lifelong interest in management issues foreshadowed the rise of management - as opposed to managerial - economics and the recent 'conversation' between the evolutionary variant of institutional economics and strategic management.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1309</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nanyo colonialism</field><field name="creator">Sudo, Naoto</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1370</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Odysseus unbound and Penelope unstable: contemporary Australian expatriate women writers</field><field name="creator">Brooks, Karen Ruth</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1371</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Place, pastoral and the politics of the personal: a semi genre-based exploration of D.H.

An in-depth case study of Gas Transmission Pipeline Construction was carried out, along with an extensive literature review. The current pipeline construction process was analyzed from a strategic management perspective. From this perspective, it was found that the traditional 'make and sell' attitude of manufacturers has now almost entirely given way to a customer orientated 'sense and respond' service philosophy. This is compounded by the needs for waste avoidance, cost efficiency and service to the customer. This research investigates the strategic opportunities for establishing advantages over competitors by designing unique service oriented supply chain strategies. Rather than relying on functional hierarchy and command and control governance where  a chain of commitments are poorly connected and difficult to reconfigure, the pipeline construction participants are challenged to develop more flexible process designs around a state of the art service based architecture. Complexity reduction has traditionally been used to deal with intricate construction supply chains. However, the architecture developed and demonstrated in this thesis will allow participants in pipeline construction to develop strategic opportunities around ideas of complexity absorption. The architecture is built on the premise that complexity absorption creates an organization that is strategically superior because it becomes a complex adaptive system that is unique to that organization. A case study is presented based on a major onshore gas transmission pipeline construction organization that illustrates an application consisting of Pipeline Construction Portal and Service Oriented Architecture. This model is internet-based and has three main constituents of Web Services, Portal and Client Services.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2390</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New sensing techniques using conducting electroactive polymers</field><field name="creator">Sadik, Omowunmi Amoke</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1163</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Traumatic stress reactions in police</field><field name="creator">Higgins, Jeannie</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1699</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Asymmetric synthesis of novel immunosuppressive agents</field><field name="creator">Cliff, Matthew D.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1115</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Performance analysis of intelligent networks</field><field name="creator">Lawrence, Jeremy Robert</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2103</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Prenatal predictors of postnatal distress and depression</field><field name="creator">German, Ester S.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2104</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Signalling message transport for B-ISDN</field><field name="creator">Eyers, Anthony William</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2107</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The hidden cost of war: the psychological effects of the second world war and Indonesian confrontation on Australian veterans and their families</field><field name="creator">Muir, Kristy</field><field name="description">Psychiatric casualties of war and mental illnesses in veterans have been officially recorded since the First World War. These psychological problems have affected the Australian military and devastated some veterans' lives. This thesis examines the psychological effects of the Second World War and the Indonesian Confrontation on Australian veterans and their families. Oral history testimonies reveal that the social consequences of war are remarkably similar for some ex-service personnel, despite the conflicts they served in. The symptoms of mental illnesses, such as anxiety, depression, social isolation, addiction and nightmares, not only severely debilitate some mentally ill veterans' home, working and social lives, they also have a profound and lasting effect on these veterans' families.The case studies' experiences are set within a historical and cultural context.  Archival and clinical material is used to trace the extent of psychological problems in service personnel, the perceived causes of these problems, and the policies and treatment methods used by mental illness experts and the Australian governments. Much of this history has been dominated by the predisposition doctrine: mental illnesses were attributed to the individual, rather than the war experience. This doctrine, along with the psychological effects of war, continues to leave its legacy on contemporary veterans and their families.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/863</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Immunochemical characterisation of erythrocyte antigens</field><field name="creator">Jonusys, Alison Mich&#233;le</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1067</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Health and disease as portrayed in the mass media</field><field name="creator">Nuttall, Julia Louise</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/881</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Determination of coefficients for pressure head changes at junction pit structures</field><field name="creator">De Groot, C.

HACC occurs at near ambient or lower temperatures and may be delayed for several hours, or even days, after welding is completed. Significant advances in developing thermomechanically controlled processed steels, with reduced carbon and alloy content, resulted in steels that are more resistant to HACC in the heat affected zone (HAZ). This has enabled the use of lower preheat temperatures during fabrication of welded structures. However, the improvement in the resistance of the HAZ to HACC has shifted the problem of cold cracking to the weld metal. The objective of this current work was to establish the effect of flux cored arc welding(FCAW) welding parameters, such as welding current, contact-tip toworkpiece distance (CTWD) and shielding gas type, on diffusible hydrogen (HD) content for single run, bead-onplate welds using low strength seamed and seamless gas shielded rutile wires of E71 T-1 classification. The work has shown that under most conditions investigated, the weld metal HD levels for the seamed rutile wire were above the 10 ml/100g specified by the consumable&#8217;s classification (H10). The measured range of diffusible hydrogen for the H10 wire was 8.3 to 17.0 ml/100g, with the highest hydrogen content being obtained at the lowest welding current of 280 A, shortest CTWD of 15 mm and deposited using 75Ar-25CO2 shielding gas. In contrast, the seamless wire met requirements of the H5 classification (HD &#8804;5 ml/100g) for all welding conditions investigated, with a range of HD levels of 0.9 to 3.5 ml/100g. In general, lower HD levels were achieved when using CO2 shielding gas, although the effect is less significant with the H5 seamless rutile wire. The work included an investigation of arc characteristics under typical welding conditions, using high speed digital imaging and laser backlighting, in order to provide information on metal transfer and arc length. Several tests were carried out using the H10 consumable. It was established that the amount of heat generated by resistive heating of the wire prior to melting can exert a strong influence on the weld metal HD content and is more pronounced in welds deposited using 75Ar-25CO2. The measured arc length was reduced significantly when welding under CO2 shielding gas. Despite suggestions in the literature there was no evidence of a change in metal transfer mode to spray transfer on increasing the welding current from 280 to 320 A, transfer mode was globular for all conditions used. Following the weld metal diffusible hydrogen testing and welding arc imaging work, the weld metal susceptibility to cold cracking was assessed using the gapped bead-on-plate (G-BOP) test at different preheat temperatures. For this part of the work, identical welding parameters those used for the diffusible hydrogen testing were selected. It was found that the H5 wire weld deposits did not reveal any cracking at ambient temperature, whereas all the welds deposited using the H10 wire exhibited cold cracking with no preheat. Weld metal deposited using 75Ar-25CO2 shielding gas resulted in higher susceptibility to cold cracking than with CO2, which correlated to lower HD levels the CO2 tests. Besides the higher hydrogen content, it was also found that higher weld metal hardness corresponded to the greater crack susceptibility in the welds deposited using 75Ar-25CO2 shielding gas. These factors are considered to contribute to higher susceptibility to transverse cold cracking compared with CO2 shielding gas. Although the overall results indicate that the weld metal susceptibility to cold cracking corresponds to the relevant levels of HD, this relationship was found to be ambiguous in welds deposited at the shortest CTWD of 15 mm, using CO2 shielding gas at all welding currents investigated. While the amount of diffusible hydrogen was marginally increased from 11.7 to 12.8 ml/100g, resulting from the welding current increase from 280 to 320 A, the amount of cold cracking at room temperature was significantly decreased from 89 to 25 %RTC. This is explained by a significant difference in the cross section of the weld beads, suggesting a need to more closely evaluate the G-BOP testing, particularly examining the effects of weld bead profiles on the weld susceptibility to HACC. Preheat was found to decrease the amount of cold cracking in the H10 welds and it was concluded that preheat significantly reduces the main contributor to decrease the HD in the weld metal. Although the cracking susceptibility of welds using 75Ar-25CO2 shielding gas decreased more slowly with an increasing preheat temperature, compare to those deposited using CO2, no cracking was observed at 120 &#176;C in welds under both shielding gases. This indicates that the same welding consumable (H10) deposited using different shielding gases can result in a different response to preheat temperature. Based on the results of this work, a number of changes are proposed to hydrogen testing standards AS 3752-1996 and ISO 3690-2000, particularly with respect to the effects of CTWD and shielding gases on levels of diffusible hydrogen in weld metal deposited using gas shielded rutile flux-cored wire.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/361</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Magnetic study of transition metal complex compounds: bivalent cooper complexes of heterocyclic ligands</field><field name="creator">Hamilton, G.

It focuses on the social construction of scientific knowledge and political shaping of science policy which took place during the NSW State Government's Inquiry into Community Needs and High Voltage Transmission Line Development 1990/91 chaired by Sir Harry Gibbs - the 'Gibbs' Inquiry'.The thesis begins by providing an historical overview of the NIEMR/EMF debate. Next it reviews the literature on scientific/technical controversy leading to the development of an eclectic model for evaluating scientific/technical controversy. This model is then used to guide analysis of the Gibbs' Inquiry. The social interests behind scientific argument appearing in two of the main submissions put before the Inquiry are analysed and similar patterns of argument and rhetoric are observed. Next, the micro-politics accounting for the Inquiry's outcome of the recommendation of 'prudent avoidance' are detailed.This work seeks to document an important emerging scientific controversy, provide a detailed history of an important piece of science policy decision-making, and apply insights from the sociology of scientific knowledge to improve understanding of the dynamics of the construction of controversial scientific knowledge m public settings.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1719</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thermoregulation in people with spinal cord injury</field><field name="creator">Wilsmore, Bradley R</field><field name="description">Thermoafferent information is integrated at multiple levels within the central nervous system. However, due to the difficulty in differentiating thermoregulatory functions of the spinal cord from those of higher centres in humans, the role of the spinal cord in certain aspects of thermoregulation remains unclear. Subjects with spinal cord injury have unique neural changes providing an opportunity to evaluate the role of the spinal cord, independently of higher thermoregulatory centres. Subjects with (N=11) and without (N=11) spinal cord injury were studied in a series of experiments, in which a wide range of local and whole-body temperature changes and postural manipulations were imposed. During these trials, various physiological (skin temperature, core temperature, local sweat rate and sweat expulsion frequency - a measure of central sympathetic drive), and psychophysical variables (thermal sensation and discomfort) were investigated. Six key observations arose from these experiments: (i) Subjects with spinal cord injury had a lower thermoafferent capacity (secondary to neural damage) and a corresponding reduction in thermoefferent drive (sudomotor sensitivity of 4.2 versus 8.8 expulsions&#8226;min-1&#8226;&#61616;C-1 in able-bodied; P=0.03). (ii) Equations used to approximate thermoafferent drive in able-bodied subjects, overestimated thermal feedback in subjects with spinal cord injury. However, this could be corrected by modifying the skin area weightings to include only the sensate areas. (iii) No subjects with physiologically-confirmed thermoefferent spinal cord injury displayed sweating from insensate skin sites, indicating that a spinal cord that has been isolated from higher centres cannot induce thermal sweating. (iv) Subjects with spinal cord injury had higher forehead sweat rates (0.77 versus 0.52 mg&#8226;cm-2&#8226;min-1; P=0.03), but an equivalent sweat sensitivity (1.24 versus 1.27 mg&#8226;cm-2&#8226;min-1&#8226;&#176;C-1; P=0.94), indicating the presence of a peripheral adaptation to sustain thermal homeostasis, and secondary to reduced thermal afferent and efferent flow.

Its point of departure is to challenge the axiom in the literature on men and masculinity that hegemonic masculinity is a dominative socio-cultural phenomenon. Further, that as a consequence its relationship with social justice in gender politics is one of mutual exclusivity.As part of this critico-historical challenge to hegemonic masculinity, the analytic trajectory this thesis takes begins with the work of Antonio Gramsci and specifically, his theory of hegemony where particular focus is given to explicating the full complexity of that theory. Within and through this complexity, the interpretation of hegemony offered in R. W. Connell's theory of practice is examined to reveal a particular dominative form of hegemony that underpins the  conceptualisation of hegemonic masculinity offered in his later masculinities theory. However, this thesis shows through an elaboration of Connell's 'masculinities theory' and its extension into a study of the operationality of hegemonic masculinity in the key gender regime of family law, that the "alliance politics" and "de-gendering strategy" envisaged by Connell as a replacement for hegemony is a flawed strategy. Further, it will be argued that to offer 'new' strategic possibilities for social justice in gender requires not the negation of hegemony but its re-instatement into the politics of gender. In this context, the radical plural democracy that emerges from the post-Marxism of Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe represents a 'new' strategic project, which emerges from the Gramscian theory of hegemony but leads to a paradigmatic shift in the conceptualisation of protest and the aspiration for change. The theorists studied in the thesis all ground their work in the concept of hegemony even though, its interpretation and application differ, often significantly. Nevertheless, by applying a critico-historical perspective it is possible to show the central thematic that links each theoretical paradigm in a way that offers future research a set of radical ideas that enable the opening up of possibilities for progression to social justice in gender.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1734</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Deliberations of the Portuguese Overseas Council on the Estado da &#205;ndia: survival 1707-50</field><field name="creator">Sim, Yong Huei</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1735</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The performance of estimation methods for generalized linear mixed models</field><field name="creator">Collins, Damian</field><field name="description">Generalised linear models (GLMs) are a flexible class of non-linear models for non-normally distributed response data. GLMs encompass models for discrete response data which takes one of several values rather than being measured on a continuous scale. Discrete response data is abundant in agricultural and biological research, for instance, in the mortality of animals and plants (binary/binomial data) and the scoring of disease (ordinal data).Generalised linear mixed models (GLMMs) are an extension of GLMs which include additional random effects in the (conditional) linear predictor. Some examples of where GLMMs may be useful include the analysis of designed experiments, surveys, spatial data and longitudinal or repeated measures data.The fundamental difficulty in using GLMMs is that no closed analytical expression for the likelihood is available. A variety of approaches have been proposed to circumvent this difficulty, including approximate likelihood approaches, such as penalized quasi-likelihood (PQL), numerical approaches, such as Gauss-Hermite quadrature (GHQ), and approaches based on the use of Monte Carlo methods, such as modern Bayesian approaches implementing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques.Although in recent years more attention in the literature has been given to Bayesian approaches and other approaches based on Monte Carlo techniques for GLMMs, there is still widespread interest amongst practitioners in the use of approximate likelihood approaches, especially with the work of Lee &amp; Nelder (2001, 2006). The objective of this PhD is primarily to explore the approximate likelihood approaches, as well as comparing and contrasting them with numerical and Monte Carlo approaches.The most widely known approximate likelihood approach, PQL, is well-known to give biased estimators of the GLMM parameters for binary grouped data when the group size is small. However, the other two groups of approaches for GLMMs are not without problems. Numerical approaches such as GHQ are only suitable for GLMMs with nested random effects only, and often require very good starting values to achieve convergence. Approaches based on Monte Carlo techniques can be very computational intensive and also have convergence problems, as well as being sensitive to the choice of priors, when used within the Bayesian paradigm. The approximate likelihood approach of Lee and Nelder is claimed, by its proponents, to enjoy the computational efficiency of PQL whilst not suffering from the estimation bias issues that PQL experiences.A background to the GLMM and inferential issues is provided in Chapter 1, with theoretical material and alternative approaches for modelling correlation in non-normal data, such as the generalized estimating equation (GEE) approach. It is argued that the GLMM is the most generally applicable model for modelling correlation and clustering in non-normal data available at present. The second chapter reviews the main estimation approaches for GLMMs, discussing in more detail the issues associated with each of the approaches already highlighted above.Chapters 3 and 4 focus on the two most popular approximate likelihood approaches, PQL and the hierarchical GLM (HGLM) approach of Lee &amp; Nelder (2001, 2006) respectively. Simulation studies are presented in Chapter 3 for binary and sparse Poisson data from a range of designs. These studies show that the two main factors associated with estimation biases are the group sizes and the relative magnitude of the variance components (as well as the sparcity of the Poisson data). These studies also suggest that hypothesis testing for fixed effects, against the usual null hypothesis of zero effect, can be reliably conducted using Wald tests using the estimated variance-covariance matrix of the fixed effects from PQL. Finally, they also indicate that the first order Laplace approximation may be useful for calculating approximate likelihood ratio tests for testing variance components. Chapter 4 contains discussion of the HGLM approach of Lee and Nelder, which relies on either a first or second order approximation of the likelihood. Computational issues associated with the use of the HGLM approach are discussed in the context of a Fortran 90 implementation. Further simulation studies show that estimation biases for HGLM approaches are generally much smaller in magnitude than PQL, but the HGLM estimators can also be unstable for binary models with conditional expectations near 0 or 1. Some heuristic arguments for the relative performance of the HGLM approaches versus PQL are also presented.Estimation biases for the PQL and the HGLMapproaches are compared with Bayesian and GHQ approaches in Chapter 5 using a series of case studies. The approximate likelihood approaches performed reasonably well against Bayesian and GHQ approaches for all case studies presented, with the exception of the Rodriguez &amp; Goldman (2001) datasets, with no finite maximum for the likelihood found using the (second order) HGLM approaches. The second order HGLM approach gave similar estimates to the Bayesian and GHQ approaches in a paired binary simulation study.  Despite greater estimation biases, the PQL estimators had lower MSE than the GHQ estimators in a second paired binary (and Poisson) simulation study, in which the Bayesian estimator, with default priors, suffered estimation bias as well. PQL also performed relatively well against other approaches in a simulation study involving a randomised complete block design (RCBD) and in a simulation study involving a spatial GLMM, where PQL was compared with a much more computationally intensive Bayesian approach. These simulations also showed that the &#8220;REML-like&#8221; correction to the likelihood used by the HGLM and Bayesian approaches can give some positive estimation bias.Whilst both approximate likelihood approaches had difficulties either in terms of estimation bias or instability, in general they perform relatively well against the other approaches and provide a useful and efficient way of fitting a wide variety of GLMMs. The use of a first or second order HGLM approach is generally preferable to PQL to achieve lower estimation biases. If PQL is employed, it is suggested that the first order Laplace approximation be calculated for approximate testing of variance components.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1737</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The myth of the affluent urban workers' changing political affiliations 1950-1972</field><field name="creator">Ward, Patricia-Mary</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1742</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Early Devonian stratigraphy, conodont faunas and palaeogeography of the Capertee High</field><field name="creator">Colquhoun, Gary Philip</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1968</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Place-making in the East Kimberley: a study of land interests and symbolic capital in North West Australia</field><field name="creator">Lane, Ruth</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses the relationship between representations of place and embodied activity and experience. To translate this question into the context of the East Kimberley in the late 1990s, I focus on the manner in which planning processes since the 1960s have represented the East Kimberley as a place and ascribed value to land. Employing the concept of 'land interests', I describe in detail changing relationships to land for Aboriginal people, farmers and tourists since the 1960s. I focus on mobility, as an indicator of their embodied experience, and tease out aspects of the social identities of these groups that are produced through their changing relationships with land. Each land interest has produced representations of place, and I explore the paths by which these representations have gained a pubhc or pohtical audience over time.In the late 1990s two developments  dominated spatial pohtics in the region. A significant Native Tide claim was lodged in the Federal Court of AustraUa by the Miriuwung and Gajerrong Aboriginal groups, and the Wesfarmers-Marubeni consortium put forward a proposal to greatiy expand the existing area of irrigated agriculture in the Ord Valley for corporate farming of sugar cane. At the same time the region's tourism industry continued to expand. I analyse these developments in order to expose the iterative processes that operate between the production of place-images and rhetoric about place, and changes to land tenure, land use and management. In particular, 1 show how place-images, narratives and discourses about change and the past are mobilised in the context of contemporary' spatial pohtics and planning processes.Central to my analysis is Bourdieu's concept of 'symbohc capital'. Contemporar)- planning processes deploy specific forms of symbohc capital tiiat ahgn more closely with die interests of farmers and tourists than with Aboriginal people. In Chapter 8 I concentrate on 'autiienticity' as a form of symbohc capital operating in both tourism and native tide. In Chapter 9 I focus on die Ord Stage Two proposal, highhghting tiie manner in which 'productivity' and 'sustainabhity' are deployed as key forms of symbohc capital that justify why die scheme should proceed. The legal concepts of Aboriginal Land Rights and Native Titie generate a new form of symbohc capital associated with continuity of Aboriginal cultural traditions and relationships with place. I analyse the potential for this to influence the way concepts such as 'authenticity' and 'sustainabhity' are interpreted. Planning associated with Ord Stage Two and with the various national parks in the East Kimberly rehes on a notion of bounded or stratified space, which may be chaUenged by the recognition of co-existing Aboriginal land interests.In conclusion, I consider how planning processes might better accommodate the fluid nature of people's relations to place and to each other. The history of unequal power relations and the differential influence of some representations of place over others structures the spatial politics in which any planning occurs. However, processes that recognise emerging forms of symbolic capital that are shared by different land interests are more Ukely to allow synergies to occur. A 'progressive sense of place' (Massey 1993) could then develop in which both places and social relations would be recognised as always in a state of becoming.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1977</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stratigraphy and mid-to late quaternary chronology of the Cooper Creek floodplain, Southwest Queensland, Australia</field><field name="creator">Maroulis, Jerry Christopher</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1982</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sensationalism or nationalism?: Australian and Indonesian newspapers reports on East Timor crisis in 1999</field><field name="creator">Poespodihardjo, Ari Santoso</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2024</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Emotional competence and relationship satisfaction: identifying skills that may be essential to having a happy and intimate relationship</field><field name="creator">Nour, Cindy</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2137</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The series romance: the changing representation of gender relationships within a popular genre</field><field name="creator">Mayhew, Lilybeth M.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2203</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dying in an age of technology: an evaluation of terminal care technology and its alternatives</field><field name="creator">Leigh, Chloe</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2211</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of structures, transport and magnetic properties of doped novel three-dimensional perovskite compounds</field><field name="creator">Farhoudi, Mohammad Mehdi</field><field name="description">Perovskite oxide compounds have generated a great amount of interest over the past twenty years, as they exhibit exotic magnetic, electric, and magnetoelectric properties, which, apart from their intrinsic interest, would have a wide range of applications in industry, with special utilization in the engineering of data storage devices.Starting with a general definition of the perovskite structure of ABO3 materials, the magnetic and transport properties of cobalt and manganese based compounds are reviewed. The objective of this thesis is focused on the investigation of the structures, and the magnetic and transport properties of some typical cobalt or manganese based three-dimensional perovskite compounds doped with various elements.Polycrystalline samples of RE1-xSrxCoO3 (RE = Gd, Nd, Ho, Y, and Dy), REMnxCo1-xO3 (RE = Gd and Ho), and La0.33Sr0.66Fe1-xCrxO3 were fabricated and characterized in detail using X-ray diffraction, Rietveld structural refinement, magnetic and transport measurements, X-ray absorption near-edge (XANES) spectroscopy, and far-infrared (FIR) spectroscopy.Perovskite GdCo1-xMnxO3 (x = 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8) compounds were prepared by solid-state reaction. Structures were characterized using X-ray diffraction and the Rietveld refinement method. The compounds crystallized in the orthorhombic structure with Plmn space group. Crystal lattice parameters constants decreased with increasing Mn doping level. DC magnetization and ac susceptibility were studied over a wide temperature range and different frequencies. A typical spin glass state was observed in all samples around the same temperature of 122 K, where the compounds changed from the paramagnetic to the ferromagnetic state. For x = 0.5, secondary transitions were observed both in dc and in ac measurements, which were independent of the frequency, but depended on the doping level. The valences of Co and Mn were estimated with possible spin states.The structures, magnetism, giant magnetoresistance, and spin and valence states of Co ions were investigated in perovskite Gd1-xSrxCoO3 (x = 0-0.5) compounds synthesized by a solid state reaction method. Results showed that all the samples are ferromagnetic around 150 K, and the magnetization and coercive field increase with the Sr doping level. A spin glass state was observed. Furthermore, the resistivity drops systematically with x. Giant magnetoresistance of over 60% was observed for the Gd0.5Sr0.5CoO3 sample. Spin state assessment indicates that the Co3+ and Co4+ ions are present in intermediate and high spin states.Polycrystalline perovskites compounds HoMn1-xCoxO3 (x = 0-0.8) were prepared by conventional solid-state reaction. Rietveld refinement indicated that, instead of a hexagonal structure with P63cm symmetry for HoMnO3, the compounds doped with Co crystallized in the GdFeO3-type orthorhombic structure containing distorted (Co/Mn)O6 octahedral. The dc magnetization was measured in fields up to 5 T over a wide temperature range from 350 K down to 5 K. It was found that the system gradually changed from paramagnetic for x = 0 to ferromagnetic with a Curie temperature, TC, of 90 K for x = 0.5, then to paramagnetic again for x = 0.8. X-ray absorption near-edge spectra (XANES) were collected to determine the valences of both Co and Mn ions. The results showed that Co and Mn were present mainly as mixed valences of Co2+ + Co3+, Mn4+ + Mn3+, Co3+ +Co4+, and Mn4+, depending on the value of  x.  When the XANES results were combined with Curie-Weiss fitting, it was found that both Mn4+ and Co3+ were present as high spin states for x &gt; 0.2, whereas, Co4+ appeared in either intermediate or high spin states, closely corresponding to the lattice variations along the (010) direction. HoMn1-xCoxO3 (x = 0-0.8) compounds were also studied by far-infrared (FIR) spectroscopy in order to gain information on the infrared active phonon modes. The data indicated that phonon modes significantly changed with increasing cobalt doping level. Four main bands were assigned as external, torsional, bending, and stretching bands. The external vibration energy remained the same at 1190 cm-1 for Co doping with x &lt; 0.5 and shifted to higher energy for x &gt; 0 5. The torsional and bending bands exhibited splitting. The stretching band is at 600 cm-1 for all samples, but the bandwidth is reduced as Co doping is increased. The transmission spectrum of HoMn4/5Co1/5O3 was analyzed to obtain the spectrum of the optical density. The minimum number of oscillators to obtain a reliable fit is 5, using a sum of non-interacting harmonic oscillators.Cr doping effects on the crystal structures and magnetic properties for La1/3Sr2/3Fe1-xCrxO3 were studied in this work. It was observed that single phase samples with the cubic crystal structure can only form within a narrow solubility range. Magnetic measurements showed that the resulting compounds are magnetic insulators.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3047</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The virtual orchestra: a systematic method of realising music composition through sample-based orchestral simulation</field><field name="creator">Sundstrup, Leif</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates a method of orchestral simulation using sample-based synthesis, instrument modelling, and music performance rules. Music scores are produced using Sibelius notation software and performed by FATSO (Film and Television Studio Orchestra).  FATSO is a virtual orchestra developed by the author using a combination of computer music software applications and expressive instrument modelling techniques capable of producing convincing simulated orchestral performances of music scores.Music performance rules are modelled on live human performance practice using both Analysis-by-Synthesis and Analysis-by-Measurement techniques. The collected data is analysed, and then implemented into a music score using the Sibelius live playback transformation feature. After a music score is processed with human performance data, the instrument sounds and playing techniques are realised by the Vienna Instruments sample playback engine and GigaPulse convolution reverberation plug-in. The processed performance data of the score is transmitted to Vienna Instruments via MIDI using sound-sets created with the Sibelius sound-set editor. Consequently, a music score created using Sibelius can be performed by FATSO with a high level of realism through detailed instrument modelling and expressive music performance rules.This thesis contains two parts. Part 1 discusses the background to sample-based orchestral simulation and the main components of realistic and expressive orchestral modelling. Part 2 discusses methods used by the author for performance data acquisition, and the resulting performance data implementation into the FATSO environment.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field

innovation (1974-1996)</field><field name="creator">Lindley, Robyn Alice</field><field name="description">This thesis breaks new ground by providing the first detailed study of smart card innovation during its first twenty years (1974-1996). The overall aim is to apply sociotechnical principles to further our understanding of the innovation process as it relates to smart card technology. By using a sociotechnical framework, this study also seeks to illustrate the limitations of conventional innovation theory when applied to new information technologies such as smart card: The central thesis posited, is that to develop our understanding of the underlying innovation processes that have occurred during the development of this new information technology, it is necessary to study the interactions between three actors that have all appeared to play a role in the process of smart card innovation. These are smart card technology; the potential users and the organisations. However, in stating this, it is also important to realize that one tacit assumption underlying the work reported here is that new technologies are only adopted if the technological parameters (technology focus), the market needs (user focus) and the entrepreneurs (organisational focus) meet.At a more abstract level, the work has also endeavoured to consider whether a sociotechnical approach applied as a framework for understanding the process of innovation for smart card is, in fact, a reasonable and useful paradigm for developing our understanding from both a theoretical and applied perspective. Thus the multidisciplinary process approach adopted is not intended to lead to a complete alternative theory:  nor is it intended to be merely a synthesis.What the current work has achieved, is to provide the very first insights into the understanding of smart card innovation. The sociotechnical framework adopted as a theoretical organiser and, which emphasises the role of the user, has also served to highlight the need for a multidisciplinary approach to develop our understanding of smart card innovation. The view upheld is that the paradigm emerging from these analyses based on traditional innovation thought, both demands and empowers the view of smart card innovation as a sociotechnical process. One of the main outcomes has been to demonstrate that smart card innovation provides a case in point highlighting the benefits of adopting a broad and evolutionary approach to innovation and based on a sociotechnical framework. This is in agreement with recent paradigm shifts in technology innovation thought. For the practitioner, these findings also illuminate new possibilities for the development theoretically informed smart card systems, thus placing the smart card design team in a position to significantly and positively influence future smart card innovation patterns.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1450</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A spectroscopic study of acceptors in germanium</field><field name="creator">Warner, Andrew</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1626</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Near band edge optical properties of MBE GaAs and related layered structures</field><field name="creator">Silver, Tania Marie</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1630</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optical and electrical studies of resonant tunneling heterostructures</field><field name="creator">Lerch, Michael L.F.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1631</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optical and magneto-optical studies of doped III-V quantum well structures</field><field name="creator">Fisher, Tracey Ann</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1632</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spectroscopy of the effects of strains and magnetic fields on shallow acceptor levels in germanium</field><field name="creator">Takacs, George Julien</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1634</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The angular distribution of fission products</field><field name="creator">Caruana, John</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1635</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The masses and kinetic energies of 239Pu fission fragments in the neutron resonance region and their relationship to dynamical effects in fission</field><field name="creator">Walsh, Robin Lindsay</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1638</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The removal of ocular artifact from the EEG</field><field name="creator">Croft, Rodney J.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1693</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into the cytotoxic properties of isatin-derived compounds: potential for use in targeted cancer therapy</field><field name="creator">Vine, Kara Lea</field><field name="description">The increased incidence of multidrug resistance (MDR) and systemic toxicity to conventional chemotherapeutic agents suggests that alternative avenues need to be explored in the hope of finding new and effective treatments for metastatic disease.  Considering natural products have made enormous contributions to many of the anticancer agents used clinically today, the cytotoxic molluscan metabolite tyrindoleninone (1) and its oxidative artifact, 6-bromoisatin (5), were initially used as templates for drug design in this study.  Structural modifications to the isatin scaffold afforded a total of 51 isatin-based analogues, 21 of which were new.  Cytotoxicity screening of the compounds against a panel of heamatological and epithelial-derived cancer cell lines in vitro, found the di- and tri-bromoisatins to be the most potent, with activity observed in the low micromolar range.  Interestingly compound activity was enhanced by up to a factor of 22 after N-alkyl and N-arylalkylation, highlighting the importance of N1 substitution for cytotoxic activity. 5,7-Dibromo-N-(p-methylbenzyl)-isatin (39) was the most active compound overall and exhibited an IC50 value of 490 nM against U937 and Jurkat leukemic cell lines, after 24 h. 5,7-Dibromo-N-(p-trifluoromethylbenzyl)isatin (54) was also of interest, considering the potent cell killing ability displayed against a metastatic breast adenocarcinoma (MDA-MB-231) cell line.  Investigation into the molecular mode of action of the N-alkylisatin series of compounds found the p-trifluoromethylbenzyl derivative (54), together with 9 other representative molecules to destabilise microtubules and induce morphological cell shape changes via inhibition of tubulin polymerisation.  This resulted in cell cycle arrest at G2/M and activation of the effector caspases 3 and 7, ultimately resulting in apoptotic cell death.Further investigations into the pharmacological profile of compound 54 in vivo, found it to be moderately efficacious (43% reduction in tumour size compared to vehicle control treated mice) in a human breast carcinoma xenograft mouse model.  Although histopathological analysis of the bone marrow in situ after acute dosing found only mild haematopoietic suppression, analysis of biodistribution via SPECT imaging found large amounts of activity also in the gut and liver.In an effort to reduce non-target organ up-take and thus increase accumulation of drug in the tumour, the N-benzylisatin 54 was derivatised so as to contain an acid labile imine linker and was conjugated to the targeting protein PAI-2 (a naturally occurring inhibitor of the urokinase plasminogen activation system) via amide bond formation with free lysine residues.  The conjugate was found to contain an average of 4 molecules of 54 per protein molecule without affecting PAI-2 activity. Hydrolytic stability of the PAI-2-cytotoxin conjugate at pH 5-7 as determined by UV/Vis spectrophotometry, was directly correlated with the lack of activity observed in vitro, suggesting a need to investigate cleavable linker systems with enhanced lability in the future. Despite this, PAI-2 conjugated to the cytotoxin 5-FUdr through a succinate linker system, showed enhanced and selective uPA-mediated cytotoxicity, in two different breast cancer cell lines which varied in their expression levels of uPA and its receptor.  This suggests that PAI-2-cytotoxin based therapies hold potential, in the future, as new therapeutic agents for targeted therapy of uPA positive malignancies, with limited side effects.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1916</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A phenomenological study of advanced learners in educational settings suited to their academic needs</field><field name="creator">Eddles-Hirsch, Katrina</field><field name="description">This study explored the lifeworld of 27 academically advanced primary students in educational environments that have attempted to address their atypical learning needs. A phenomenological theoretical framework was used to discover the experiences of 13 gifted boys and 14 gifted girls attending either single-gender or co-educational schools. Three types of school settings were purposefully selected for this study in order to discover the supportive systems that these different educational environments created for academically advanced learners. While there is a great deal of research about the cognitive outcomes of these types of school environments, little is known about their social and emotional outcomes. Some researchers, as well as educators in the field, have suggested that the affective outcomes of these types of school settings may be a more powerful argument for gifted programming than their well known cognitive results (Coleman, 1995, 2003).The results from this study demonstrate that, while challenging instruction was clearly important for the emotional wellbeing of the advanced learners, it went hand in hand with the schools` ethos in relation to the social and emotional development of their student populations.  The schools&#8217; objectives clearly influenced students&#8217; perceptions of emotional safety, acceptance of diversity, and teacher student and peer relations in the schools` environments. This finding differs to previous research that suggests that if a gifted child&#8217;s cognitive abilities are catered for, her or his social and emotional needs will automatically be met. This research has significance for educators and researchers in the field, as it provides insights from the gifted students themselves about their experiences in the specialised school environments, which hopefully will assist educators in better meeting the psychosocial and emotional needs of these students. This study also describes the types of social and emotional support systems, and social and emotional outcomes that can contribute to optimal social context in schools. In this study optimal describes a school setting that positively answers and enhances both the academic as well as the social and emotional needs of the gifted student.</field><field

Therefore, an understanding of the development of the basins, the coal and source rock potential within the sedimentary sequence, together with the physical properties of the rocks I will provide valuable information for the economic assessment and development of the region. Rifting occurred on the southeastern margin of the Sundaland continent during the Late Paleocene-Early Eocene. This formed a large, initially contiguous basin, comprising the Barito, Asem Asem and Kutei Basins, in the southeast and east Kalimantan areas. The Meratus Uplift commenced in Late Miocene and continued during the Plio-Pleistocene causing the subdivision of the large basin into the present Barito, Asem Asem and Kutei Basins. The Barito and Asem Asem Basins were filled with Tertiary and Quaternary sedimentary sequences. Deposition of the Tangung Formation commenced in the Eocene from a meandering river system which gave way to a fluvial-dominated delta and shallow marine systems. The Tanjung Formation was succeeded by the peak of the Late Eocene transgressive phase, represented by the carbonate-dominated facies of the Berai Formation. The overlying unit is the regressive lower delta plain and fluviatile succession of the Miocene Warukin Formation. The sequence ends with the Plio-Pleistocene Dahor Formation which unconformably covers the earlier units. Both the Tanjung and Warukin Formations have abundant sandstone units which consist largely of quartzarenite and sublitharenite, whilst feldspathic litharenite and subarkose are minor constituents. The Berai Formation is composed mainly of wackestone, packstone and grainstone with subordinate carbonate mudstone. The Dahor Formation is composed of conglomerate, sandstone, siltstone and mudstone. The clastic rocks of the Tanjung and Warukin Formations were transported southwards from a recycled orogen source, which probably included the Kuching High, part of the Mangkalihat Ridge and the Sundaland continent or Schwaner Block. Organic petrology shows that vitrinite and liptinite are the dominant macerals within both fine-grained clastic rocks and coal in the Tanjung, Warukin and Dahor Formations. Inertinite is a minor maceral in these units, but it is slightly more prominent in the Berai Formation. The Eocene and Miocene coals do not differ greatly in terms of maceral group composition. However, the Eocene coal contains more liptinite than the Miocene coal. The rank of the Eocene coal ranges between sub-bituminous and where the average vitrinite reflectance (Rvmax) is 0.43%. The Miocene coal contains less mineral matter than the Eocene coal. Mineral matter comprises mainly kaolinite, quartz, pyrite, carbonate and small amounts of chlorite. Both the Tanjung and Warukin Formations have very good hydrocarbon generation potential. The Berai Formation has less significant source potential as this unit contains little organic matter. The vitrinite reflectance data indicates that the onset of oil generation occurs below 1600 m depth throughout both basins. In most parts of the basins the Tanjung Formation entered the oil window zone during the Miocene. In the deeper parts of the basins the Berai Formation and, locally, the lower and middle parts of the Warukin Formation also lie within the oil window. The oil generation zone does not extend up into the Dahor Formation. The results of maturation modelling and burial history indicate that relatively rapid, early coalification of the section of Eocene age occurred over most of both the Asem Asem and Barito Basins. A second, more rapid, phase of coalification affected the lower part of the Miocene succession. A late Miocene-Pliocene history of constant or falling temperature resulted in a lowered thermal drive for maturation and migration. Microscopic features indicating hydrocarbon generation occur in many samples from the Tanjung and Warukin Formations, but they are most prominent within coal samples. These features comprise migrabitumen, oil droplets, oil cuts, oil haze and dead oil. Organic geochemical analyses show that the Warukin Formation has produced some oil in the Barito Basin. A minor quantity of oil from the Tanjung Formation may have migrated into reservoir rocks in the Warukin Formation. The study proved that the oil is mainly of terrestrial higher plant origin. Sandstone beds in the Tanjung and Warukin Formations have good to very good potential as petroleum reservoir rocks. The Berai Formation is considered to be marginally favourable as a reservoir rock for hydrocarbon accumulation. Diagenetic regimes (eodiagenesis and mesodiagenesis) have controlled the enhancement of secondary porosity after reducing primary porosity within the reservoir rocks. The most economically viable areas for coal are on the eastern flank of the Senakin Peninsula, and in the Kintap, Bunati and Gunung Kukusan areas. For petroleum exploration, the eastern and southern Barito Basin, and south of Pulau Laut and the A-1 and A-2 wells in the Asem Asem Basin, probably have the highest potential for hydrocarbon discovery.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2113</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of industrial pollution on the larval settlement, development and succession of marine fouling communities in Port Kembla Harbour</field><field name="creator">Moran, Peter John</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2115</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The goodness of fit publications of J.C.W.

The CIGRE proposed relationship for prestressing behaviour was assessed. A comprehensive literature survey yielded alternative experimental models and extensive amounts of creep constants for many conductor constructions.19, 37 and 61 strand ACSR and AAAC/1120 conductors were tested. 1(X)0 hour creep tests were performed at tensile loads of 20, 30 and 40% of the NBL of the conductor at 20&#176;C.  Prestressing overloads of either 10 or 20% NBL were applied for periods of 1,2 or 7 days.It was found that prestressing removed a considerable portion of the total predicted creep of a conductor in a relatively short time, i.e. has the effect on creep, of "overaging" a conductor. Analysis of the tests revealed that prestressing will stabilise creep strains for a period of time after load reduction. The stabilised period is adequately described by the CIGRE equivalent time relationship.											          a	 		                          &#181;		                          		t eq    =  (   &#417;1   )  t 1		  	   &#963;2 			    	     	     Creep constants determined by this work and revealed by the literature survey for Australian conductors, were compared with those published for comparable conductors manufactured overseas. It was shown that there are significant differences between the creep constants of Australian and overseas conductors. Creep constants therefore, for overseas conductors, are not applicable to Australian conductors.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2501</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of alloying additions on the microstructure and corrosion properties of an A1-Zn galvanizing alloy</field><field name="creator">Nolan, David James</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2502</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Geohydraulic aspects of dam filters</field><field name="creator">Radampola, Seanie Sujeewa</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2536</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fuzzy detection of microcalcifications in mammograms</field><field name="creator">Drijarkara, Agustinus Praba</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2549</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Waveform interpolation speech coding</field><field name="creator">Ni, Jun</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2551</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of oxy-carbon injection on EAF efficiency</field><field name="creator">Soeparto, Arief Bustaman</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2554</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Traffic profiles for audio and data collaborative work systems</field><field name="creator">Musangeya, W.

PET detectors are comprised in part of detectors such as photomultiplier tubes or solid state photodetectors optically coupled to scintillation materials, such as BGO or LSO. In this thesis a study of recently developed photodiode detectors, SPAD4 photodiodes, and LYSO crystals has been undertaken to investigate these properties. As part of this research IV (current-voltage) and CV (capacitance-voltage) characterization measurements were carried out on the photodetectors and results indicate they are of excellent quality. Ion Beam Induced Charge Collection (IBICC) measurements were undertaken to fundamentally investigate the effect of bias on the efficiency and uniformity of charge collection within the photodetector. A reverse bias operating voltage of 50 V was eventually chosen as the optimum bias voltage for the SPAD4 photodiode for the gamma ray spectroscopy and timing resolution experiments that followed the IBICC characterisation. Charge collection uniformity was found to be excellent at this optimum voltage. An investigation into the surface treatment of LYSO crystal and cladding was also completed. Physical measurements and simulations were conducted and the results are compared. Past simulation results have demonstrated that scintillation crystals produced a higher output when the surface was rough as opposed to the industry standard smooth polished surface [1]. Physical measurements and comparisons have also been completed with saw cut finish crystals and chemically etched crystals [2, 3]. Simulations were completed with &#8220;Scintillation Program&#8221;, a simulation code developed at the CMRP, and DETECT2000. Measurements completed for this thesis produced no significant change in the deduced scintillator light output after roughening a crystal side. Timing resolution in commercial PET scanners ranges from 8 to 16ns. Experimentally with a photomultiplier tube coupled to a photodiode, timing resolution as low as 9.4ns FWHM has been achieved [4]. Coincidence timing resolution measurements using standard NIM (Nuclear Instrumentation Module) electronic modules were taken with a iv NaI-photomultiplier tube and the LYSO-SPAD4 photodiode module. The best result obtained was a FWHM coincident time resolution of 22 ns, which is similar to past results. The SPAD4 photodiode and LYSO crystal combination show promise as the basis for a future PET detectors module, although further work needs to be completed to improve the timing performance.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2690</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A

Tests on groups of coals show that a change in coal type is dependent on the type of coal immediately preceding (Markovian properties). From this dependence most probable sequences of coal variations can be derived.For individual seams major changes in coal type are represented by characteristic plies, from which standard profiles of each seam are derived. Type seam sequences are derived from the standard profiles for each coal measure group, when more than half of the profiles are similar. Marked similarities exist between the type seam sequences.The distribution of the types of petrographic profiles of all seams is found unlikely to be due to chance. The sequences found from the Markovian properties, the type seam quences and the distribution of profiles are few and similar.All these results indicate that the seams are deposited under ordered conditions and that the major control is an internal one, most probably a response of plant growth and decay to the changing conditions associated with the increase of peat thickness.Comparison with Carboniferous coals from England and Canada shows that similar petrographic profiles are developed in them.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2944</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A physicochemical investigation of the recovery of hydrous tin oxides from electroplating liquors and rinse waters</field><field name="creator">Whitton, Richard Wilfred</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2945</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of the influence of titanium on the structure of alloy steels</field><field name="creator">George, Terence J.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2948</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of the thermal dynamics of the reheat furnace</field><field name="creator">Yang, Thien Siung</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2949</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Continuous hydrochloric pickle lines for commercial low carbon, general purpose steel</field><field name="creator">Papson, H.

With relatively high star formation rates and plenty of neutral gas, they are interesting laboratories in which to study the organisational processes that lead to star formation. These galaxies have masses in the ransition region between dwarf irregular and spiral galaxies, and are close analogues of the Large Magellanic Cloud, so it is of interest make detailed observations for later comparative studies. The neutral Hydrogen observations are the highest angular resolution available to date for these galaxies (~ 800 FWHM), with fine velocity resolution (1.3 km.s&#8254;&#185;). These show remarkable structure in both objects, including large holes and small clouds of gas (~ 107 M&#64321;) with moderate velocity offsets from the general rotation. An large, incompletely evacuated hole (2.2 kpc diameter) dominates the western half of NGC 1156. Its origin is unclear. The velocity fields of both galaxies show most of the disk is rotating smoothly, but near the centre appear to have significant noncircular motions, probably induced by a stellar bar. &#201;chelle spectroscopy at H&#945; shows the HII regions are following the same orbits as the neutral gas. The galaxies' optical structure and stellar populations are characterised through multicolour imaging, H&#945;  emission-line imaging and densely-spaced longslit spectra. NGC 4214 exhibits two exponential components in its surface brightness profile, while NGC 1156 is consistent with a single exponential. In both objects the major axis of the bright bar lies along quite a dfferent position angle to the kinematic major axis. Colour maps reveal varied populations in the bright bars of both galaxies, and the outer disk of NGC 4214. I make detailed comparisons of the galaxies' colour-colour distribution with stellar population models, and employ absorption-line indices from the longslit spectra as cross-checks in a few locations. Taken together the data suggest that over a large fraction of the galaxies there is a young population some tens of Myr old that contributes a few percent of the total stellar mass, though the particular combination of mass fraction and age cannot be uniquely determined. Neither galaxy exhibits strong O/H abundance variations within the bright bar region. Both galaxies are consistent with a model in which a minimum HI surface density (10&#178;&#185;atom.cm&#8254;&#178;)is a necessary criterion for star formation. In NGC 1156 the radial distribution of star-forming regions is well predicted by the disk instability criterion discussed by Kennicutt (1989), while the criterion is less successful in NGC 4214. In a systematic survey of NGC 4214 I identifed 13 holes likely to be expanding or burst shells, roughly in accord with the number expected given the linear resolution and the HII-region population. In a majority of the holes, a star cluster capable of powering the expansion is visible within the hole boundary. However the holes are so young and that I expected all would contain a detectable cluster. In a few regions new star formation appears to have occurred in the walls of the identified holes, but the total number of HII regions near HI holes is consistent with that expected by chance.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/356</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Eucumbene suite and the Heretic: paintings, prints and livre d'artiste</field><field name="creator">Murphy, Idris</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/958</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teachers and policy knowledge: a methodological and empirical study</field><field name="creator">Morgan, Grahame</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/977</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teaching secondary science with data loggers: the NSW experience</field><field name="creator">Silburn, Kenneth Raymond</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/980</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The changing context of tertiary English teaching in China and teachers' responses to the challenges</field><field name="creator">Gao, Lianli Clara</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to examine changes in tertiary English teaching in China and the perceptions and reactions of university English teachers, administrators and policy-makers to these changes. In particular, the study focused on the tension between policy and reality in the areas of curriculum, pedagogy and assessment in Chinese university English teaching. The key research question, therefore, related to how tertiary English teachers are meeting the challenges of the changing expectations of their profession, taking into account the complex context of tertiary English teaching in China with its characteristic historical, cultural, economic and political issues.  Different from most other research in this field in China, the study adopted a sociocultural perspective, using Bourdieu&#8217;s (1971b; 1984) notion of &#8216;field&#8217; and Bernstein&#8217;s (1990; 2000) &#8216;three message systems&#8217; to diagnose the expectations placed on English instructors as a result of changes in what to teach (curriculum), how to teach (pedagogy), and how to assess (assessment and evaluation). The study, finally, was organized around the principles of temporality, autonomy, and specialisation (Maton, 2004a, 2005) to identify teachers&#8217; and administrators&#8217; orientation to change, the degree of autonomy conferred by the changes and the specialist knowledge needed to respond to the changes.  A qualitative inquiry approach was adopted to explore thick and authentic data from a variety of sources, including policy documents, university syllabi, course designs, textbooks, assessment instruments, surveys, and interviews with teachers, administrators and policy-makers.  It was found that, although there is a great recognition of the need for reform, attempts have so far been ineffective because: - policy appears to be inconsistent and unclear in its theoretical basis; - the universities tend not to play a mediating role in interpreting national policy at   the local level, leaving teachers to fall back on what is familiar; - there is a lack of adequate pre-service training for English language instructors in   the areas of ELT curriculum, pedagogy, and assessment, and a lack of sufficient in   service professional development for further understanding and implementing policy   in their teaching; - textbooks and external examinations dominate tertiary English teaching, inhibiting   change; - as a result, university English language instruction is in a state of inertia and English   language instructors are feeling confused and uncertain.  The study argues that power over university English language education remains centralised despite the apparent policy mandate to devolve autonomy in curriculum, pedagogy, and assessment to the universities and university English language instructors do not have the necessary background and experience in language education to assume autonomy or implement reform.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/981</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using a cognitive tool to support learning in interactive multimedia environments</field><field name="creator">Gordon, Julie</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/988</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Accounting for management as an expression of eighteenth century rationalism: two case studies</field><field name="creator">Williams, Robert Bernard</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/999</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Welding and post weld heat treatment of 2.25%Cr-1%Mo steel</field><field name="creator">King, Benjamin</field><field name="description">The current standard practice when welding 2.25Cr-1Mo steel is to use preheat and post welding heat treatment (PWHT) to improve weldability. The research outlined in this thesis is an investigation of the microstructure and mechanical properties of weldments of 2.25Cr-1Mo steel before and after the application of preheat and/or post weld heat treatment. Trial welds and simulated coarse grained heat affected zone (CGHAZ) material were mechanically tested and etallurgically examined before and after welding and PWHT.The pre-heat investigation involved 3.8 mm and 7.1 mm thick tubes, welded with pre-heats of 25 &#176;C, 50 &#176;C and the standard 150 &#176;C. These samples were then mechanically tested to AS3992. The PWHT investigation was carried out on 12 mm thick tube and 16 and 26 mm thick plate samples. After welding, the samples were heated to a simulated service temperature of 550 &#176;C for up to 10 h and PWHT at 700 &#176;C. These samples were then compared in terms of microstructure and hardness.To enable mechanical testing of HAZ material, simulated HAZ material was produced. These controlled cooling samples also enabled monitoring of the transformation behaviour to produce a CCT diagram and comparison of the transformation products with the trial welds. The results of this experimental program showed that pre-heating thin tubes in the range 25-150 &#176;C had no noticeable effect on their properties. It is however expected that the influence of the pre-heat temperature would be limited to the root pass, as the higher interpass temperature would override any effect of the pre-heat temperture. The welds made in 12 mm and 16 mm thick material also showed negligible difference in their response to short-term ageing and PWHT. The results from the 26 mm sample however showed higher hardness and a different microstructure to those of other plate thicknesses.Thus no evidence based on mechanical properties and microstructures was found to support the specification in the Australian Standard AS4458 for pre-heat 7 temperatures above 25 &#176;C when welding tubes up to 7.1 mm thick. Furthermore, although the Australian Standards do not require PWHT for 12 mm tube, but specify PWHT for 16 mm plate, the present results do not provide a basis for the need for PWHT in either case. These conclusions are drawn within the context that the experimental welds were made under low restraint conditions and high restraint in industrial practice could affect weldment integrity through the development of high residual stresses, distortion and/or HAZ cracking.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/479</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling of stormwater quality in Byarong Creek</field><field name="creator">Woodward, C.

There is a lot of information on the adverse role played by low density lipoprotein (LDL) in atherosclerosis, however, much less is known on the intermediate density lipoprotein although both epidemiological evidence and animal and in vitro studies suggests it plays a role in atherosclerosis as well. Hence this thesis examines and compares the atherogenicity of intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL) between people with an without T2DM. In the first study the ability of IDL isolated from people with-and without-T2DM was investigated and the ability of IDL to induce lipid accumulation was compared. The results show that unlike LDL, IDL could be taken up by the macrophages in its unmodified form and the uptake was not likely to be receptor-mediated as it is mostly triglyceride (TG) (as opposed to CE) that was accumulated in the cells. It is believed that the triglyceride (TG) in IDL was first hydrolyzed into free fatty acids (FFA) by lipoprotein lipase outside the cells and these FFA were re-esterified to TG once inside the cells.  Although there was no difference in the lipid accumulation between the T2DM and control groups, both groups accumulated significant amount of TG in the cells when their IDL was incubated with macrophages in vitro (5830&#177;966 vs 5727&#177;1241, sum of area under curve adjusted for cell protein, p&gt;0.05). On the other hand, only negligible amount of cholesterol ester was accumulated in the cells in both groups and the cholesterol concentrations were similar to the concentration found in the non-loaded cells (21&#177; 5 vs 19&#177;3 vs 16&#177;8, p&gt;0.05).The second study investigated the atherogenicity of IDL by assessing the affinity of IDL to chondroitin sulphate (CS), which is a major proteoglycan found in vessel walls. The results show that IDL isolated from people with and without T2DM both bound to CS at similar affinities (86&#177;0.2 % vs 90&#177;2.0 %) and there were no differences in the composition of the unbound or bound fractions IDL between the two groups. The results also show that IDL bound to CS at two different affinities: lower affinity (low- bound IDL) and higher affinity (high-bound IDL). The high-bound IDL fraction contained significantly lower TG (0.64&#177;0.06 vs 0.39&#177;0.05 mmolL-1/mg, p&lt;0.01) and phospholipids (0.04&#177;0.01 vs 0.03&#177;0.01 mgdl-1/mg, p&lt;0.05) than the low-bound IDL fraction but both fractions contained similar concentration of total cholesterol (0.57&#177;0.07 vs 0.44&#177;0.07 mmolL-1/mg, NS). This study have demonstrated that the IDL that bound to CS with a higher affinity was also the one with smaller size compared to the IDL bound to CS with lower affinity. Similar to LDL, IDL consists of different sizes and the smaller IDL particles bound to CS at a higher affinity than the larger IDL particles. In the third study, the concentration of glycation in IDL was assessed to determine the atherogenicity of IDL. The concentration of advanced glycation endproducts (AGE) accumulated in the IDL was also compared in T2DM and control groups. The concentration of two AGE, i.e. N-epsilon- (carboxyethyl)lysine (CML) and S-(carboxymethyl)cysteine (CMC), were measured respectively and the results indicate that the concentration of each was similar in both groups (CML: 0.005&#177;0.003 vs 0.002&#177;0.001 nmol/mg NS; CMC: 1.48&#177;0.14 vs 1.45&#177;0.23 nmol/mg, NS). The results also show that CMC in the IDL fraction was positively correlated with both plasma TG concentration (r=0.39, p=0.04) and body mass index (r=0.46, p=0.02). These findings suggest that the IDL is possibly be more glycated when the risk of diabetes increases. Interestingly the same data show that the CML concentration was similar in the T2DM and control groups.  Together, this thesis demonstrated that IDL is atherogenic but the atherogenicity was not increased in the people with diabetes whose blood glucose concentrations were well controlled.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3066</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Glass sculpture: reflections on cultural colonisation</field><field name="creator">King, Gerry</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/951</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of regional skin temperatures in thermoregulatory control during heat stress</field><field name="creator">Cotter, James David</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1099</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Asymmetric synthesis of chiral amines and alcohols from chiral sulphur reagents</field><field name="creator">Dikic, Branko</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1111</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The implementation of a curriculum innovation: a study of using IT for teaching and learning in the Hong Kong institute of vocational education</field><field name="creator">Koo, Chung NA</field><field name="description">The rapid development of technology and explosion of information on the Internet had lead to a surge of using IT for teaching and learning among different education sectors.  In the light of this, many education institutions had developed policy in implementing IT for teaching and learning to improve and enhance the quality of the courses they provided.This thesis reports a study of using IT for teaching and learning by teachers in the Hong Kong Institute of Vocational Education (IVE), as an implementation of a curriculum innovation.  The aim of this study was to investigate how teachers behaved in the implementation process rather than to investigate the effectiveness of IT brought to teaching and learning.Different research methods were used to answer the research questions posed for the study.  An &#8220;Implementation Rubric&#8221; was established to find out how the innovation was implemented by IVE teachers.  Both qualitative and quantitative methods were used to identify the factors that hindered and enhanced the implementation.  Document analysis was also adopted to triangulate the evidence gathered from surveys and interviews.Results of this research indicated that, in general, the innovation was implemented by IVE teachers, although the degree of implementation of individual dimensions and sub-dimensions varied.  This study identified eight critical factors that hindered the implementation of the innovation.  Although some of the factors have been commonly mentioned in the literature, the study adds additional perspectives to it, in particular in the context of vocational education in Hong Kong.  Each of these factors is discussed in detail and compared with the literature for better interpretation.  This study also investigated the issues IVE teachers encountered during the implementation of the innovation and the ways they resolved these issues.The implications of the findings are discussed, and finally eight recommendations for improving the current practices and four suggestions for further research are proposed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3044</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A heuristic algorithm to optimise stope boundaries</field><field name="creator">Ataee-Pour, Majid</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2923</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reducing the incidence and severity of staff manual handling injuries through continuous improvement</field><field name="creator">Goor, Susan Catherine</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2924</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimization of gears with particular reference to design parameters</field><field name="creator">Davey, R.

Berry's great achievement was development at Shoalhaven of what his contemporaries deemed the finest estate in New South Wales and possibly the Empire. He sat in the Legislative Council for thirty-three years. He was the most forthright advocate for large-landowner hegemony, the first to articulate the case for protection, was for some years spokesman for Church of Scotland loyalists, resisted movement to democracy and opposed the spread of municipal institutions. John Dunmore Lang's 'Shoalhaven Incubus' libels and Berry's resistance to vindictive and illegal misuse of the Municipalities Act against him led to his being reviled Colony-wide as the symbol of selfish land monopolisation and champion of an outdated and oppressive aristocratic ideal.My thesis is that the key to Berry's career is his life-long adherence to the values imposed in his formative years in Scotland under the Dundas 'System'. Landowners monopolised political rights on the ground that they alone had a fixed stake in the country. The dominant group preserved its position through control of all Scotland's Parliamentary seats, patronage, the courts euid the Church. 'Stability' was the watchword, any change being suspect as prospectively harmful. The Church repressed questioning of doctrine, emphasised the duty of social harmony and reinforced paternalistic responsibility, but its efforts to inculcate high standards of morality contrasted with the elite's amoral use and defence of its power. Scots valued education and scientific and technological advances. Berry never confronted the contradictions in these forces which were reflected in his own conduct- Berry was prepared to put his scruples to one side in order to succeed but was anxious then to restore harmony between his conduct and principles. He was politically reactionary but a progressive farmer and eager to embrace new technology. He built schools and a library for his tenants but would hedge in their personal independence. Berry treated the values of his upbringing as eternally valid while they became increasingly anachronistic.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1432</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of an eight week modified exercise program for overweight children</field><field name="creator">Cambourne, Brodie</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2766</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Security and privacy model for association databases</field><field name="creator">Kong, Yibing</field><field name="description">With the rapid development of information technology, data availability is improved greatly. Data may be accessed at anytime by people from any location. However,threats to data security and privacy arise as one of the major problems of the development of information systems, especially those information systems which contain personal information. An association database is a personal information system which contains associations between persons. In this thesis, we identify the security and privacy problems of association databases. In order to solve these problems, we propose a new security and privacy model for association databases equipped with both direct access control and inference control mechanisms. In this model, there are multiple criteria including, not only confidentiality, but also privacy and other aspects of security to classify the association. The methods used in the system are: The direct access control method is based on the mandatory model; The inference control method is based on both logic reasoning and probabilistic reasoning (Belief Networks). My contributions to security and privacy model for association databases and to inference control in the model include: Identification of security and privacy problems in association databases; Formal definition of association database model; Representation association databases as directed multiple graphs; Development of axioms for direct access control; Specification of the unauthorized inference problem; A method for unauthorized inference detection and control that includes: Development of logic inference rules and probabilistic inference rule; Application of belief networks as a tool for unauthorized inference detection and control.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">information technology &#8226; data security &#8226; privacy &#8226; associations &#8226; association databases &#8226; direct access control &#8226; inference control &#8226; inference detection &#8226; unauthorized inference &#8226; confidentiality &#8226; mandatory model &#8226; logic reasoning &#8226; probabilistic reasoning &#8226; belief networks &#8226; logic inference rules &#8226; probabilistic inference rule</field><field name="subject">Computer Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/8</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Heroine</field><field name="creator">Kremmer, Jennifer</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/963</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Combinatorial designs with applications in cryptography</field><field name="creator">Chaudhry, Ghulam Rasool</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2007</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Management training in India</field><field name="creator">Sharma, Rajeev Datt</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2296</field></doc><doc><field name="title">River bank erosion by boat-generated waves on the Lower Gordon River, Tasmania</field><field name="creator">Von Krusenstierna, Axel</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2822</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The home and the prison</field><field name="creator">Aungles, Ann</field><field name="description">The thesis investigates a specific example of the interdependence between the domestic and the public spheres of social life. Through an examination of the social construction of 'the home' and 'the prison', the thesis examines the argument, from the feminist challenge to the social sciences, that it is the marginaUsation of the domestic and the arbitrary privileging of the public, that maintains the false assumption of the self sustaining nature of public life. The central theme of the thesis is that the contradictory intersection of 'the home' and 'the prison' is a particularly significant example of the tension between interdependence and incompatibility, that characterises the nature of the relationship between domestic and non domestic spheres in other areas of social life. The corollary of this argument is that it is the people in the population 'families of prisoners' who bear the greatest burdens of this contradiction. Moreover, one especially important aspect of the work of 'caring' for prisoners is the invisibility of the range of forms of exploitation and of the personal, social and economic costs that is involved in that work.The thesis examines the specific ways in which the population 'families of prisoners' has been variously constituted in the several legal, economic and scientific rationalities that construct penal life. Four major models of interdependence between 'the prison and 'the home' are identified in the analysis of these discourses: the 'family in the prison', the home clearly segregated from the prison, the boundaries between 'prison' and 'home' becoming more permeable when the home is constituted as the site of 'resource and resolve' and most recently, 'the home' as the site of imprisonment and control. It is in the work of the social scientific constructions of 'families of prisoners' that these last two models have been most closely defined. By drawing on the work of three approaches to social analysis, the feminist materialist critique of social policy, the radical critique of penality and the feminist analysis of criminology, the thesis develops nine major propositions about the impact of these variously constructed intersections of 'the home' and 'the prison' on the actual day to day lives of the people in the population 'families of prisoners'. It is especially in the contradictions between these various intersections that the work of caring has to be carried out. It is this contradictory nature of the work of caring for imprisoned men that is associated with the condensed nature of the inequality that is experienced by the people in the population 'families of prisoners'.Through an examination of the penal poUcies and practices operating in N.S.W. in the 1980s and fi-om interviews with thirty eight people who have family obligations to imprisoned men in N.S.W., the thesis demonstrates firstly, that that obligation leads to an extensive but hidden provision of unpaid labour. Secondly, that obligation to care also commits the carers to major economic and physical costs. Thirdly, the commitment to care then implicates the carers in the network of punishment and control that operates both within the prisons and in various forms of community control in N.S.W.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1730</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evolution, hybridity and mutation: three generations of hybrid performance texts from contemporary bioethical fables</field><field name="creator">Fargher, Catherine</field><field name="description">This is an annotated document which supports my Doctorate of Creative Arts (DCA) creative submissions. Over the period of this Doctorate, (2002-2006) I have developed three Hybrid performance texts - a radio script, a puppetry script and a bio-performance/installation - from original bio-ethical fables. These fables explore the moral and bio-ethical issues associated with the complex Post-natural environments that we find ourselves living amidst in this century, and the futures they suggest. I am suggesting a new term 'Post-natural', which I define as a human or natural environment that incorporates the Life Sciences. These sciences are recombinant genetic technologies and biotechnologies that mould and create futures, which radically alter our pattems of reproduction, food production and health management. Some of these natures and futures, where incorporation of new technologies are involved, have been dubbed 'Post-human' by cyber-theorists and 'Reworked Nature' by sociologists.In this annotation I examine and discuss my creative process, as well as its theoretical context and implications. For reasons that will later become evident, I use biological concepts to chronicle my own creative processes for my Doctorate of Creative Arts. I argue that biological principles such as evolution, mutation, metamorphosis and hybridity within the natural and bio-technological realms have informed my creative practice. When I started to develop the themes for this thesis, looking at changed forms in nature resulting from biotechnologies, it was clear that these biological principles and metaphors could also be applied to the creative forms with which I was working as they evolve, hybridise, mutate and are influenced by new technologies.The annotation is in four parts, examining the underlying theory, the generation of the original fables, and the creative cultivation of two further generations of Hybrid performance works.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/841</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Critical accounting pedagogy in practice: (re)constructions of 'a true and fair view'</field><field name="creator">Day, Mary M.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1002</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Accounting language change: a critical study of Habermas's theory of communicative action</field><field name="creator">Sawarjuwono, Tjiptohadi</field><field name="description">This study envisages the accounting function in practice, particularly as a language of business or organisations. The linguistic function becomes more important if being studied from the uttering capability point of view which this study calls "accounting language communicative competence". This idea is inspired by Habermas's intellectual insight. Habermas contends that the most important element in understanding social phenomena is communicative competence rather than linguistic competence.  Communicative competence means the mastery of an ideal speech situation, it encompasses not only the syntactic or semantic systems of language but also the rationality underlying the speech. This study argues that this insight is admissible for understanding accounting phenomena. Thus, accounting language communicative competence refers to the ability to understand accounting language and, in turn, to utter or implement it "properly" by considering all situations within its context. Specifically, this study focuses on organisational actors' accounting language communicative competence. Put another way, accounting language communicative competence is a manifestation of complex interactions among organisational actors, their knowledge and their circumstances. To illustrate this complexity, this study offers a metaphor, that is, a Javanese language speech level metaphor.  To construct this knowledge, this study applies critical accounting study, a methodology which is based on linguistic philosophy, because linguistic philosophy adds a dimension well beyond the scope of accounting and opens wide the nuance of accounting (Gaffikin, 1989) and provides more comprehensive insights. Hence, critical accounting study can accommodate these crucial insights. Essentially, Habermas provides a social theory which is based on it, that is, the theory of communicative action. Seen from this perspective, accounting [language] practice is a social product and follows social processes. Accordingly, it can be analysed from Habermas's two societal analytical processes, that is, lifeworld and system mechanism. To develop the research methods, this study modifies Laughlin's (1987) methodological approaches which are derived from Habermas's conceptual strategies.The results are suggestive and conclusive. They substantially imply that critical accounting study is practical and useful. It benefits both the researcher and the researched participants. Moreover, it allows accounting language change which will be more apparent if the researcher stays longer in the empirical world. However, with the limited time, this study can only ensure that there is a strong inclination towards accounting change</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1012</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of human cytomegalovirus challenge on monocyte function</field><field name="creator">Moses, Ashlee Vivien</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1066</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electrospray mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of DNA-interactive agents</field><field name="creator">Colgrave, Michelle Lisa</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1148</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Novel membrane composite structures based on conducting electroactive polymers</field><field name="creator">Misoska, Violeta</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1165</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Deterministic analysis and simulation of runoff in urban catchments</field><field name="creator">Ghafouri, Rouzbehani Abdolmohammad</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1236</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rock cutting studies using fracture mechanics principles</field><field name="creator">Guo, Hua</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1262</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Shape formation of space trusses</field><field name="creator">Hewen, Hewen</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1265</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A hypertext based intelligent assistant for courseware preparation: a step toward authoring shells</field><field name="creator">Sarrafzadeh, Abdolhossein</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1288</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An architecture for cooperation among autonomous agents</field><field name="creator">Jung, David</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1291</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Presentation of consistent information from independent databases</field><field name="creator">Bhattarakosol, Pattarasinee</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1301</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of Japanese technology transfer to Indonesia: a study of the effect of technology transfer on managerial skill formation of the host country's employees</field><field name="creator">Frinces, Zein Heflin</field><field name="description">This thesis is a result of an intensive empirical and exploratory field research conducted among Japanese subsidiaries operating in Indonesia based on case studies. This research studies the effect of Japanese technology transfer to Indonesia on the managerial skill formation of Indonesian employees.This thesis consists of 6 chapters. Chapter 1 contains background reasons for selecting the research topic and a "problem statement" of the research. Chapter 2 sets out the detailed stages of the way this study has been conducted. Chapter 3 provides a review of previous research that forms the basis for the research guidelines for the study. A pilot research or survey of 4 Japanese subsidiaries operating in Indonesia, was undertaken to test various theories found in existing literatures and to formulate further courses of action for this study. Further research was carried out involving 16 Japanese subsidiaries and 21 Indonesian managerial staff working in the Japanese subsidiaries operating in Indonesia.The review of previous studies in Chapter 3 suggested that there had been very little research on the subject of the effect of technology transfer on managerial skill formation. There had been little research on this subject because, as the review suggests it was perceived that skills had been formed in an automatic fashion and that management could operate smoothly without being concerned much about skill formation. It was also believed that research on the issues was both theoretically and empirically quite difficult to carry out. In this research the types of managerial skills studied are divided into three components, namely, (1) Japanese specific managerial skills, (2) functional or professional managerial skills, and (3) general managerial skills, consisting of conceptual, human, and technical skills. The Indonesian managerial staff working in Japanese subsidiaries were expected to have acquired these skills. It was predicted that the effect of technology transfer on skill formation and the acquisition of these skills, were associated with the various moderating factors explained in Chapter 2. Chapter 4 contains detailed case studies which give insight into both the skill formation process and the effects of of various moderating variables on the transfer process. Chapter 5 presents various findings of the study and analyses of the findings. It was found that only three of the five moderating variables studied had a significant impact on the skills formation process. On the basis of existing theories and this study's empirical evidence, a model of technology transfer and skill formation was then developed and presented in Chapter 5. Chapter 6 contains conclusions, policy recommendations, and for further study.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1472</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Listening to boys in kindergarten talking about school</field><field name="creator">Coleborne, Roslyn</field><field name="description">The perspectives of boys on their experience in school during kindergarten have not been explored in any significant way. Still missing in the literature is critical interpretive research on young, male children&#8217;s early schooling experiences and the implications for the academic outcomes of these students. There is evidence that some boys do not perform well in secondary school (West, 1999; Coulter, 2003; Martin, 2003) and this is predictable as early as the first year of formal schooling (Barrett, 1989; Alexander et el., 1993; Rimm-Kaufmann &amp; Pianta 2000). This study adds to the literature by seeking the views of boys in kindergarten classes about what schooling means to them.A goal of this study is to understand the complex world of the lived experience of being a boy in kindergarten, from the point of view of boys who live it (Schwandt, 1998) so a qualitative, interpretive approach to the subject matter is used. Uncommon in other studies of young children, the hermeneutic phenomenological perspective of the philosopher Hans-Georg Gadamer (2004) and a process of analysis proposed by Max van Manen (1990) provide the framework, using a mixed methodology derived from diverse sources. Data is generated primarily by conducting individual semi-structured interviews with fourteen boys in kindergarten classes in three schools in New South Wales. This data is interspersed with excerpts from the researcher&#8217;s retrospective reflective journal covering more than forty years of teaching. In keeping with the philosophical stance of Gadamer, these statements help to illuminate the personal position and bias of the researcher. Field notes that evaluate the processes and the techniques used to collect information from young children, supplement the primary data. Interpretation of the transcripts generated by conversations with the participants shows school routines and rules figure prominently in the boys&#8217; views of school life, and play and friends, are important features of the school day. The boys say  learning is work, and it is generally conducted using a pencil and paper. This study contributes to research on what school means to young boys and what factors engage or alienate young male students in school. It demonstrates links between these views and current education policy and classroom practice.The study provides insights into the effectiveness of various research techniques used with young children. Three scaffolding techniques were used to support the interview process, including the boys drawing a picture of school life and talking about their drawing, looking at pictures of typical school activities and commenting on those, and playing a game of &#8216;schools&#8217; with the researcher using the construction toy, Lego. The study found that talking to the boys in an engaged and supportive way generated more useful data than any of the other strategies or scaffolds used. The study adds evidence to the growing body of literature that suggests children are competent in providing information about issues that are relevant to them. Future research, using a hermeneutical phenomenological approach, could include girls in Kindergarten, in order to compare and contrast their experiences with their male counterparts, and contribute to unravelling further what makes school engaging for some students, and alienating for others.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field

Wayne</field><field name="description">This study reports the use of empowerment evaluation with a national school breakfast program in Australia known as the Good Start Breakfast Club (GSBC).The project comprised two key aspects. First, the empowerment evaluation (Fetterman, 2001) approach was used as the framework to develop a &#8216;practical&#8217; methodology desired by the program managers (Australian Red Cross) and major sponsor (Sanitarium Health Food Company at the time of the study) to evaluate their program. Good Start Breakfast Club personnel engaged in a process of self-evaluation and, in so doing, a suite of &#8216;practical&#8217; evaluation tools was developed. During the application of empowerment evaluation the researcher served as facilitator and evaluation &#8216;coach&#8217;, offering evaluation expertise throughout the process. Second, the impact that empowerment evaluation has had on the delivery of the GSBC program is reported in this case study. These impacts were examined at two main levels: first on the capacity of program personnel to contribute to the evaluation, and second on changes that occurred in relation to program delivery as a result of the empowerment evaluation.Eighty Good Start Breakfast Club personnel took part in ten empowerment evaluation workshops during 2005 to: identify key program activities for investigation; gather baseline data about the strengths and weaknesses of the activities; suggest goals and strategies to monitor and improve the activities identified; and to develop evaluation tools designed to provide evidence of success.The empowerment evaluation approach was successful in generating a high level of cooperation and commitment from workshop participants to the on-going evaluation process. It was also effective in building evaluation capacity in the relatively short period of the study with participants reporting having had their knowledge and understanding of participatory program evaluation enhanced. Nine evaluation instruments were trialled during 2006 with respect to four key program activities: providing a healthy breakfast to children in greatest need; positively changing or influencing the eating habits of children; improving the learning capacity/learning environment of children attending the GSBC; and social interaction in the GSBC environment.The research project makes a significant contribution to the field of evaluation practice on at least two fronts. First, early versions of the case study have contributed to the professional field of program evaluation with presentations made at three international conferences of the Australasian Evaluation Society, one at the annual conference of the American Evaluation Association and a paper published in the Evaluation Journal of Australasia. It is advancing knowledge about a contemporary program evaluation approach and about a community-based program of significant public interest in Australia. Second, evaluation methods and associated tools were prepared and implemented at trial sites by non-specialist program personnel in preparation for widespread use across the Good Start Breakfast Club program. Three survey instruments were subsequently rolled out across the program in three Australian states. It is envisaged that the findings of this study and the results derived from the on-going evaluation of the Good Start Breakfast Club, while of particular significance to the program&#8217;s sponsors, will be applicable to sponsors of school breakfast and other community-based programs throughout the world.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3059</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The structure and properties of the heat affected zone of structural plate steels welded high productivity processes</field><field name="creator">Pang, Willy</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1534</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analytical and experimental modelling of coupled water and air flow through rock joints</field><field name="creator">Gamage, Ranjith</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1818</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analytical and laboratory modelling of granular filters for embankment dams</field><field name="creator">Locke, Mark R.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1819</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A model of relationship commitment for a consumer service with low monetary switching cost</field><field name="creator">Wonosoebekti, Indriati</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2292</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pensions, savings and economic growth</field><field name="creator">Nell, Conrad David</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2307</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Neural networks modelling of in-bar width in hot strip mill</field><field name="creator">Luo, Shizhuang</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2521</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing an alternate interaction device for domestic multimedia environment</field><field name="creator">Ramli, Kalamullah</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2547</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Corroded memories</field><field name="creator">Hull, Aaron Coates</field><field name="description">This thesis seeks to examine the concept of the corroded memory, an idea that has driven the development of a large body of original creative work which includes performances, compact disk recordings, audio walks and video installations. I have completed this work during the last four years of part time study as a Master of Arts - Research student, enrolled at the University of Wollongong, Faculty of Creative Arts.In this thesis I examine, analyse and provide a context for a variety of publicly presented sound andvideo works. The conceptual framework and intent, together with the compositional techniques employed in each work are documented along with a self-evaluation of the various failures and successes of these works. Where necessary I will allude to references of work and ideas by other artists, composers and musicians who have influenced my work.This thesis was written to clarify ideas that are central to my folio of creative and curatorial work. My folio can be found on companion music CDs and DVDs. The text of the thesis which includes five appendices with a more detailed description of each work will have most significance for those readers who refer to the documented performances supplied on

Bisheng</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a mathematical modelling in nanotechnology. Many ex- periments and molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that the melting point of nanoparticles shows a size-dependent characteristic in the nanoscale. Based on the assumption that the material is a pure one, the melting process of spherical and cylindrical particles, especially nanoparticles, is treated as a Stefan moving boundary problem. Analytical or semi-analytical approaches, such as small-time perturbation expansions with front-&#175;xing techniques, large Stefan number limit, integral iterative scheme, and numerical methods, such as enthalpy scheme and front-&#175;xing method, are applied to the one- and or two- phase Stefan problem in spherical and cylindrical domains by taking into account the e&#174;ect of the interfacial or surface tension. The results from these methods are compared and show excellent agreement to some ex- tent. This thesis may provide a possibility of explaining some interesting phenomena occurring in the physical experiments, i.e. superheating and \abrupt melting", or work as a guide for the potential applications of nanoparticles, for example, drug delivery, nanoimprinting and targeted ablation of tumor cells In Chapter 1, a simply survey of the research background is given. Chapter 2 studies the full classical two-phase Stefan problems without surface or interfacial tension. By using the approach from large Stefan number limit and small-time perturbation methods, long- and short-time solutions are obtained, and the results from these methods are compared with the numerical enthalpy scheme. The limits of zero Stefan-number and slow di&#174;usion in the inner core are also noted. Chapter 3 presents the melting of a spherical or cylindrical nanoparticle by including the e&#174;ects of surface tension through the Gibbs-Thomson condition. A single-phase melting limit is derived from the general two-phase formulation, and the resulting equations are studied analytically in the limit of small time and large Stefan number. Further analytical approximations for the temperature distribution and the position of the solid-melt interface are found by applying an integral formulation together with an iterative scheme. All these analytical results are compared with numerical solutions obtained using a numerical front-&#175;xing method, and they are shown to provide good approximations in various regimes. In Chapters 4 and 5, the methods used in above sections are extended to the melting problem for spherical and cylindrical ii nanoparticles, respectively. The results from these approaches are compared with those from the numerical front-&#175;xing method. The original contributions of this thesis are: approximate analytical solutions are obtained for the classical two-phase Stefan problems in a spherical domain; a general single-phase limit for the melting of nanoparticles are derived and analyzed with the correct boundary conditions; a critical radius is found to exist for the blow-up of the one-phase melting; the melting process of spherical and cylindrical nanoparticles are studied analytically from the perspective of Stefan moving boundary problem by including the e&#174;ect of surface tension; some interesting phenomena observed in physical experiments, i.e. superheating and \abrupt melting", are explained in terms of Stefan problems.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/787</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Air suspension as applied to automotive &amp; commercial vehicles</field><field name="creator">Pedersen, R.

1911-1940</field><field name="creator">Mart&#237;nez, Julia</field><field name="description">This thesis questions the dominance of White Australia as a narrative of Australian history by highlighting opposition to the policy and its vision of a pure white nation. It considers the need for a new paradigm, that of Plural Australia, to more adequately frame the experiences of Australia's past and to acknowledge continued ethnic heterogeneity within the nation. A northern, tropical perspective on Australian history undermines the traditional narrative of British colonisation and the supposedly unanimous desire to maintain a White Australia. Darwin was established as a mixed tropical colony and maintained its multiethnic society right throughout the White Australia period.White Australia as a political and ideological principle has always been problematic. During the period up until 1940, the debate continued over the inclusion or exclusion of Australia's 'coloured' population within the nation, particularly in regard to Aboriginal and Asian workers. White Australia may have viewed these groups as potential competition to white workers, and as a threat to 'racial' purity, but this remained a contested issue. Colonial attitudes, which favoured 'cheap coloured' labour were retained. Internationalists, in contrast, preferred to include 'coloured' workers within the workforce and the community as equal members. Even staunch advocates of White Australia came to question the exclusion of 'coloured' residents from their community. This thesis argues that the primary issue for Australian nationalists was to create a unified and harmonious nation. It had been imagined that this would be achieved only with a 'racially' homogeneous population. But the experience of Darwin suggests that it was possible for a new kind of plural society to develop even under White Australia. The degree to which various ethnic groups were incorporated into the white working-class community differed, as is demonstrated in the case studies of Aboriginal servants and waterside workers, Japanese and 'Malay' pearling crews and Chinese workers. The character of Plural Australia was shaped, not simply by political, ideological or even economic considerations, but by the evolving responses of white Australians to their experience of living within a multiethnic community.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1437</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The bishop's society, 1856 to 1958: a history of the Sydney Anglican Home Mission Society</field><field name="creator">Anderson, Donald George</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1440</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On line dynamic analysis of the aerodynamic thermodynamic and metallurgical aspects of the blast furnace process</field><field name="creator">Hodkinson, Neville Thomas</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1513</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Size segregation in bell-less blast furnace burdening</field><field name="creator">Bharadwaj, Anil Kumar</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1604</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Semantic priming: an event-related potential investigation using pseudohomophone primes</field><field name="creator">Lethbridge, Alistair</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1678</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The paintings of Flight Officer Eric Thake, official war artist, R.A.A.F.

The central questions at the heart of this  examination involve, on the one hand, interrogating the constmction of home, belonging, and thus nation, as heteronormative, and, on the other hand, adjudicating between the claim made by some queer Canadian scholars that Canada is a queer nation and the assertion, made by other lesbian and gay scholars, that Canada is too heteronormative to allow for the development of a queer public culture. At the same time, postcolonial and anti-racist approaches to issues of Canadian identity and belonging suggest that race and ethnicity remain crucial sites around which competing discourses of the public sphere are mobilized. Particularly when issues of racial, ethnic or indigenous identity are broached in conjunction with sexually dissident identities, questions of queer alterity serve both to problematize and to interrogate the ways in which it is possible to think about what it means to call Canada home.This thesis approaches these issues in several ways. It attempts to locate the social and cultural faulthnes, both in populist texts and in queer cultural works, that reveal the contested and contestatory constitutionof queemess bothas belonging and as not belongjng wit&#237;iinthe Canadian body politic, in part by looking at two examples that serve as limit tests for both officiaJ and popular discourses of tolerance and multiculturalism &#8212; the legahzation of lesbian and gay marriage and the continued, and parhaps increasing, incidence of queer-bashing,  particularly in relation to tiie 2001 hate-motivated murder of Aaron Webster. However, following Richard Rorty's assertion that it is predominanfly narrative cultural texts, such as novels and films, that function "as the principal vehicles of moral change and progress," I concentrate predominantiy on narrative examples which both describe and critique the conditions tiiat, often incoherentiy, work to effect the exclusion of lesbian and gay Canadians &#8212; especially whenthose Canadians are also, to use RoyMiki's tema, racialized&#8212;fromthe public constmction of the nation. Using theoretical approaches predominantiy from tiie work of Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, Michel Foucault, Juditii Bufler, Lee Edelman, Elspe&#250;i Probyn, Paul Morrison, and Ann Cveticovich, I investigate the ways in which contemporary queer cultural production attempts, in Sedgwick's words, to disarticulate and disengage impacted social spaces, suchas family and nation, and to create "a practice of valuing flie ways in which meanings and institutions can be at loose ends with each oflier," a practice in which it is possible to understand flie ways in which normative discourses produce ways of fliinking about home, f&#248;mily and na&#250;onTn'wi&#250;ch.^everything means the same thing." Tbe critical, cuitural practices I examine include a variety of ways by which queer artists respond to the cultural faulflines tiiat regulate questions of visibility, representation, trauma and tiie creation of archives. I conclude by arguing that it is in tiie very disjuncture between competing discourses of Canada' s queemess and its heteronoraiativity fliat it is possible to assert queerly Canadian ontologies and epistemologies as public knowledges and ways of being that are always contingent and imcertain &#8212; and always urgenfly necessary.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language"

conductors</field><field name="creator">Al-Hossain, Shahriar</field><field name="description">In this thesis I emphasized on the organic compound doping (specially carbohydrate group, malic acid, C4H6O5) and heat treatment effects on the superconducting properties of MgB2. I also focused on the basic and fundamental properties of un-doped MgB2 wires in different temperatures for comparison purpose. And finally I have proposed another new dopant which avoids some problems using carbohydrate in some aspects.Firstly, I have studied the effects of sintering temperature on the phase transformation, lattice parameters, full width at half-maximum (FWHM), strain, critical temperature (Tc), critical current density (Jc) and resistivity (_) in MgB2/Fe wires. All samples were fabricated by the in situ powder-in-tube method (PIT) and sintered within a temperature range of 650&#8211;900 _C. I have showed that why I have taken such sintering temperature range by analyzing with differential thermal analysis (DTA). The increased FWHM and decreased Tc at low sintering temperature region suggested the smaller grain size and poor crystallinity. Strain values also higher at low sintering region. That&#8217;s why it was observed that wires sintered at low temperature, 650 _C, resulted in higher Jc up to 12 T. The best transport Jc value reached 4200 A cm&#8722;2 at 4.2 K and 10 T. This is related to the grain boundary pinning due to small grain size and poor crystallinity due to strain defects. On the other hand, wires sintered at 900 _C had a lower Jc in combination with better crystallinity due to higher Tc.The effect of carbohydrate doping on lattice parameters, microstructure, Tc, Jc, Hirr, and Hc2 of MgB2 has been studied. In this work I used malic acid, C4H6O5 as an example of 2 carbohydrates as an additive to MgB2. We have described the advantages of carbohydrate doping include homogeneous mixing of precursor powders, avoidance of expansive nanoadditives, production of highly reactive C, and significant enhancement in Jc, Hirr, and Hc2 of MgB2, compared to un-doped samples. The defects due to the C substitution into boron site lead to the enhancement of Hirr and Hc2. The decrease of a-axis lattice parameter and reduction of Tc indicates poor crystallinity due to C substitution. The microstructure was shown both for un-doped and doped samples which were well consistent with FWHM. The Jc for MgB2+30 wt% C4H6O5 sample was increased by a factor of 21 at 5 K and 8 T without degradation of self-field Jc due to C substitution into B sites.During the evaporation process of the C4H6O5 with B and solvent, freshly and highly reactive C is produced and C substitution for B can take place at the temperature same as the formation temperature of MgB2. By using this chemical route I again evaluated the doping effects of C4H6O5, from 0 to 30 wt% of the total MgB2, on the lattice parameters, lattice strain, amount of carbon (C) substitution, microstructures, weight fraction of MgO, critical temperature (Tc), critical current density (Jc), and irreversibility field (Hirr) of a MgB2 superconductor. The calculated lattice parameters show a large decrease in the aaxis lattice parameter for MgB2 + C4H6O5 samples from 3.0861(6) to 3.0736(1) &#197;, with even a 10 wt% addition. This is an indication of C substitution into boron sites, with the C coming from C4H6O5, resulting in enhancement of Jc and Hirr. Specifically, the Hirr of the MgB2 + C4H6O5 samples prepared by the chemical solution route reached around 7 T at 20 K, with a Tc reduction of only 1.5 K. In addition, the self-field Jc of the MgB2 + 3 C4H6O5 samples was only slightly reduced at an additive level as high as 30 wt%. The interesting thing I found here is maximum C-substitution and the maximum enhancement of all the superconducting parameters up to 10 wt% addition, after that the improvement rate is saturated. From these data I can claim 10 wt% addition is enough for maximum Csubstitution and enhancement of superconducting properties. However, residual oxygen after evaporation processing contributed to a large amount of MgO in our MgB2 + 30 wt% C4H6O5 samples. These problems can be further controlled by the amount of C4H6O5 additive or different evaporation temperatures.After the successful doping effects of C4H6O5 into MgB2, then I investigated the behaviour of C4H6O5 as a dopant with different sintering temperatures. All the samples were prepared by the chemical solution route. I report the carbon (C) substitution effects of MgB2 + 10 wt% C4H6O5 on the lattice parameters, critical temperature (Tc), upper critical field (Hc2), and irreversibility field (Hirr) as a function of sintering temperature in the range from 600 to 900 _C. The additive C4H6O5 as the C source resulted in a small depression in Tc, but significantly increased the C substitution level, and hence improved the Hc2 and Hirr performance at a low sintering temperature of 600 _C in conjunction with a short sintering period of 4 h. In addition, the low-temperature sintering process resulted in small grain size and higher impurity scattering compared to a pure MgB2 superconductor which promotes the flux pinning significantly.Very recently, I have chosen another solid hydrocarbon dopant named pyrene (C16H10) in to MgB2. There are few reasons behind this decision. Firstly we know all the carbohydrates consist of carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and oxygen (O). During the 4 evaporation process of C4H6O5, I noticed that the MgO amount is gradually increased with increasing doping level. So our group suggests such special solid hydrocarbon without O content which may reduce the MgO content within the matrix. In this work, we report on significantly enhanced Jc in MgB2 superconductor that was easily obtained by doping with a hydrocarbon, highly active C16H10, and using a sintering temperature as low as 600 &#176;C. The processing advantages of the C16H10 additive include production of a highly active carbon C source, an increased level of disorder, and the introduction of small grain size, resulting in enhancement of Jc.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/90</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessing the effectiveness of corporate web sites: an experimental study of the web acceptance model</field><field name="creator">Suh, Koo-Won</field><field name="description">There has been an ongoing need for designing and assessing corporate Web sites as important marketing communication tools. Typically, most research on Web site effectiveness has adopted traditional advertising evaluation models. A fundamental shortcoming of this approach is that it does not provide much information about user interaction. As corporate Web sites are new interactive media and Web user characteristics are far different from those of traditional communication media, new approaches should be developed. To overcome the inherent shortcomings of previous research, this study has developed a new theoretical framework, the Web Acceptance Model (WAM), which explores customer acceptance and uses of corporate Web sites. This study took an interdisciplinary approach involving theory derived from Marketing, Communication, Information Systems (IS), Education, and Psychology. The model is premised on two central phenomena of Web-Mediated Communication (WMC): social interaction between Web sites and users, and the active participation of users. In the model, the phenomenon of social interaction is captured by the inclusion of moderating variables: affective and task-related interaction which can help explain &#8220;why&#8221; a specific type of Web site is likely to be more effective. It is unlikely that a particular type of Web site will be effective all of the time. Therefore, this model also seeks to explain &#8220;when&#8221; a Web site is more likely to effective. Individual user difference as a moderator can help explain &#8220;when&#8221; and reflects the active role of customers in WMC. Finally, the model addresses all three elements of consumer attitudes i.e., affective, cognitive, and conative. Specifically, the model includes predictor, moderator, mediator, and criterion variables. The predictor (independent) variables are Web site content and structure. Content analysis was used to identify Web site typology in terms of structure and content. It was necessary to conduct an empirical study of Web site typology, as there was no published research on this topic. Empirically derived typology may better explain real world phenomena than a conceptually developed typology. Through content analysis of around 386 corporate Web sites, this study identified two types of Web site structure (&#8220;hypermedia&#8221; and &#8220;static image&#8221;) and two types of content (&#8220;integrated communication&#8221; and &#8220;basic image&#8221;). The criterion variables, which are the communication effects achieved by a Web site, are measured in terms of overall attitude toward the Web site and revisit intention. Among three mediators between the predictor and criterion variables, &#8220;social presence&#8221; serves as an affective bridge, while &#8220;perceived usefulness&#8221; and &#8220;perceived ease of use&#8221; serve as cognitive bridges. Finally, Web literacy serves as a moderator, which affects the direction and strength of the relationships between the predictors and mediators. The overall purpose of this study was to uncover the distinguishing features of effective corporate Web sites (i.e., those sites which are seen by users to be attractive, userfriendly and useful). To do this, the study sought to answer two exploratory questions and test hypotheses derived from the model. The exploratory questions were: (1) What content and structural elements are presented on corporate Web sites? and (2) How can corporate Web sites be classified according to their content and structure? These questions were answered through a preliminary content analysis of corporate Web sites. Fourteen hypotheses were derived to answer the three experimental research questions: (1) How do consumers respond to different types of Web site? (2) Do user attitudes toward corporate Web sites vary according to Web literacy levels? and (3) What features of corporate Web sites determine revisit intention amongst Web users? The first five hypotheses addressed how customers respond to different types of Web sites. The next five hypotheses examined what features of corporate Web sites determine revisit intention amongst Web users. The final four hypotheses investigated whether user attitudes toward corporate Web sites vary according to their Web literacy levels. These hypotheses were tested through a laboratory experiment. This study employed a 2 (Web site structure) &#215; 2 (Web site content) between-subject factorial design, with Web literacy serving as a co-variant. Each subject was allowed to explore only one of four specially constructed Web sites. Subjects were randomly assigned to each cell. The data was gathered through a self-report instrument, of which validity and reliability were ensured by a rigorous two-stage pilot test. Empirical evidence was gathered from one hundred and sixty students at the University of Wollongong in Australia who were recruited for the experiment. The data was analysed using the statistical methods of MANCOVA, ANCOVA, ANOVA, Multiple Linear Regression, and Simple Linear Regression. In terms of Web site content, it was found that the integrated communication type of Web site was more effective than the basic information type. The integrated type had higher social presence and perceived usefulness. In relation to Web site structure, it was found that the hypermedia type was more effective than the static image type, generating higher social presence and perceived usefulness. The results of this investigation suggest that social presence and perceived usefulness were critical factors that explain &#8220;why&#8221; a specific type of Web site is more effective than the other type. The more positive social presence and perceived usefulness were, the higher attitude toward the Web site was, and in turn, the higher revisit intention was. However, there was no significant relationship between perceived ease of use and attitude toward the Web site. It was also concluded that Web literacy moderate the relationship between Web structure and social presence. For example, people who with low Web literacy experienced higher differences in social presence between static image type and hypermedia type than those with high Web literacy. These results imply that both Web site structure and content had effects on consumer attitude and the two dimensions of social interaction (i.e., social presence and perceived usefulness) are critical factors for identifying consumer responses to Web sites. One of the interesting findings was the importance of an emotional response, meaning that it is not possible to fully explain consumer behaviour without the understanding of emotional responses to Web sites. The Web Acceptance Model provides a new way of conceptualising social interaction, which is central to WMC, and underlines the importance of an interdisciplinary research to our understanding of WMC. Therefore, it is hoped that this study will make a significant contribution to a burgeoning area of research that is of great and increasing importance to both the discipline and the practice of marketing.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/354</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a new silicon based detector module for PET</field><field name="creator">Hooper, Peter R</field><field name="description">In the quest to develop high spatial resolution Positron Emission Tomography (PET), the goal of this work is to characterise the innovative silicon detector array that forms the foundation of a new PET detector module design. The new detector module circumvents the current requirement for photomultiplier tubes by the implementation of its solidstate detector analogues. The detector module is based upon pixelated scintillation crystals optically coupled to custom designed silicon 8x8 photodiode arrays and read out by a 128 channel low noise charge sensitive preamp. Each element pad of the array has an active area of 3x3 mm2 and, for the work described in this thesis, is coupled via a fan-out connection system to the testing instrumentation. The testing instrumentation included I(V), optical excitation and nuclear spectroscopy (alpha particle and gamma ray spectroscopy). This work fits in as part of a larger project to provide proof of principle of this new PET detector module design. The dark current of individual pixel elements of an unbonded array was found to be 460 pA at an operating bias voltage of 40 V. To investigate uniformity of response across the array, three different methods have been used. Spectroscopy response on the photopeak of 137Cs in the case of optical coupling of each pixel with 3x3x3 mm3 CsI(Tl) showed uniformity of collected charge of &#177;28%. Investigation of direct response of pixels across the array with 59.9 keV X-rays from 241Am source demonstrated excellent response. To investigate the variation in uniformity of the detector pixel, the optical response of the array was measured using a laser diode (spot size of ~50 &#956;m) and was found to be &#177;12%. The uniformity of a single pixel element response using scanning optical beam was measured to be &#177;1%. Initial characterisation of 3x3 mm2 diode taken from the same wafer used to create the array was optically coupled to a 4x4x10 mm3 LSO scintillator and then to a 3x3x3 mm3 CsI(Tl) scintillator and irradiated by 511 keV and 1.2 MeV gammas from 22Na and 662 keV gammas from 137Cs sources. The energy resolution for the LSO was shown to be 28.8% FWHM for 511 keV and 16.5% for the 662 keV gammas. And the energy resolution for the CsI(Tl) scintillator crystal was 9.5% FWHM for the 511 keV gammas and 7.7% FWHM for the 662 keV gammas. The time properties of this array were tested with coincidence techniques using current pulses from the front and back &#8211; side of the array. For modelling of charge induced in a pixel from LSO photons, in the case of 511 keV photopeak, we used low energy alpha particles generating the same amount of charge. The FWHM of the time spectra was found to be about 700 ps resulting mostly from noise and statistics of charge collection. This specially developed Si pixel array photodiode was demonstrated to satisfy the critical technical parameters required for high resolution PET scanners. Further work has been recommended for stabilisation the sensitive area of pixel to avoid increasing reverse current due to optical coupling. A special optical adhesive has been proposed to avoid this affect.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/362</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On information hiding techniques for digital images</field><field name="creator">Brisbane, Gareth Charles</field><field name="description">In the era before digital devices, information was in part protected by the cost of duplication. However, as information is more commonly stored to and recovered from digital devices, its duplication becomes trivial. In recent years there has been an increasing amount of research into methods for embedding hidden information into items stored in digital formats. This information can then be used for a range of purposes, including content protection, traitor tracing, authentication and covert communications. In this thesis we exclusively consider the case of information hiding techniques for digital images. We address four problems in this research area: &#183; We consider the question, How much data can be imperceptibly embedded into an image, assuming that the sender and receiver have access to a shared image and that there is no modification of the communication during its transmission? Firstly, the maximum amount of information that can be sent for both monochrome and colour images using this model is derived. We then present coding strategies which nearly achieve the theoretical capacity, operating under the restrictions imposed by image formats, namely that the range of possible pixel values is limited. Results are provided demonstrating that the scheme can be used in practice to achieve the claimed throughput. &#183; We seek discover the set of N codevectors which best represent an n-dimensional, uniformly distributed space. This result could then be considered for the specific case of identifying the general colour palatte in Red/Green/Blue space which is best able to quantize a uniformly distributed colour image. The problem is addressed initially from a theoretical perspective, followed by an empirical analysis. The results are then compared, in terms of distorttion caused by quantization, against lattices, which are known to be an optimal selection of codevectors for large N. &#183; Seppanen, Makela and Kreskinarkaus propose a high capacity steganographic technique to conceal information within a colour image[72], using a shared colour palette. The technique is significant because of the high volume of data that is embedded into pixels but results in a high level of noise and so the quality of the resulting image is not acceptable. We propose: - Technique to improve the tradeoff between capacity and imperceptibility; - New &#8220;coding structures&#8221; which maintain a high capacity but lower the level of noise; - A strategy for increasing robustness; and - An analysis of the tradeoff by using an alternative algorithm for identifying the colour palette. Results are provided for the evaluation of each proposed modification. The resultant scheme, without robustness, is able to embed an average of over 6 bits per pixel at an imperceptible level of pixel modification. &#183; A robust watermarking technique is proposed which modifies the statistics of extracted segments. By using a region-based approach, resistance is provided to a range of attacks, including rotation, scaling and translation based modifications. The advantage of this algorithm is that no manual pre-processing is required: the detection algorithm is able to confirm the presence of the watermark with only the attacked image. The algorithm is shown to be moderately resistant to a large number of attacks including compression, cropping and rotation</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field

Al&#172;though high precision in machining has been a focal point for engineers for over 200 years, the traditional solutions have often been based on complex mechanical designs. In this thesis, two aspects of feed axis controller design are examined: i) the use of appropriate mathematical models and ii) the signi&#64257;cance of three of the most common performance limiting factors that have traditionally affected precision in linear feed axes. The three particular performance limiting factors considered are: i) dynamic stiffness, ii) torsional vibrations and iii) backlash. The most effective way of obtaining knowledge about a control system is through appro&#172;priate mathematical modelling. A new two-body model for a simple motor-transmission&#172;load system is presented in this thesis. This new model is shown to provide a more accurate representation of both the total inertia and lowest natural frequency of a system, when compared with the two-body model that is traditionally used by researchers and system designers. A new model to represent backlash in a two-body system is also pre&#172;sented. These new models are then extended to provide accurate mathematical models of four common linear feed axis drive con&#64257;gurations: i) a rotary motor driving a rack and pinion transmission, ii) a rotary motor directly driving a ballscrew transmission, iii) a rotary motor driving a ballscrew transmission via a synchronous belt, and iv) a linear motor directly driving the axis. Different control solutions to the problems of dynamic stiffness, torsional vibrations and backlash are examined in this thesis, with each controller implemented on specially con&#172;structed test-beds. An approach using Quantitative Feedback Theory (QFT) is presented xxi for systems with inherently low dynamic stiffness. This QFT approach is shown to pro&#172;vide a transparent design process, which results in high dynamic stiffness. Different controllers for torsional vibrations are compared both theoretically and experimentally, with many previously published solutions shown to be theoretically equivalent. A new backlash controller is also presented, which is shown experimentally to provide dynamic stability and good tracking performance at both high and low velocities. The importance of treating these performance limiting factors simultaneously is also ad&#172;dressed in this thesis, with the control solutions developed to address some factors shown to also affect the other factors. The QFT approach is shown to provide a suitable inte&#172;grated design process, where the implications of any compromises, on the control of each factor, are clearly visible.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/27</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of lithic artefact microdebitage for chronological determination of archaeological sites</field><field name="creator">Susino, George J.</field><field name="description">This study explores the use of several different techniques to isolate and determine the age of lithic microdebitage in relation to archaeological deposits and associated sediments. Quartz microdebitage was identified on the basis of surface features and roundness index by applying scanning electron  microscopy (SEM) and optical stereomicroscopy to archaeologically relevant sediments. Characteristics of the quartz microdebitage were compared with quartz grains from the same sedimentary layer. The observation of diagnostic features on quartz grains made it possible to discriminate between microdebitage and sedimentary background.This investigation has established that microdebitage particles under 500 &#956;m diameter are not easily resolved under optical stereomicroscopy, requiring the aid of SEM to discern between microdebitage and sedimentary quartz. It was also ascertained that no adverse effects on the optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) signal are measurable after exposure to SEM, provided that the electron beam is kept at, or under, 10 keV.Sedimentary material previously excavated from the Jinmium rockshelter (Northern Territory) and Mushroom Rock West (Queensland) was used to determine the age of quartz microdebitage from the archaeological layers by applying the OSL dating technique. The microdebitage OSL signal behaves similarly to that of sedimentary quartz grains, and is subject to the same problems. The OSL single-aliquot regenerative-dose protocol (SAR) was successfully applied to the age determination of microdebitage. The modifications used for the dose rate (due to particle size and shape) and for the calibration of the beta source (due to particle size) did not produce any inconsistencies or anomalous results. In the investigation of two archaeologically relevant sediment layers from the Jinmium rockshelter deposit, the minimum OSL age at 68 cm depth for the microdebitage was estimated as 4100 &#177; 900 years (12,600 &#177; 4000 years using the central age model estimate, with 73% over-dispersion on the palaeodose), and, for the sedimentary material, a central age model of 5300 &#177; 800 years (with a minimum age model estimate of 1900 &#177; 400 years, and, 78% over-dispersion). At 115 cm in the deposit, the OSL central age model estimate for the microdebitage is 10,200 &#177; 1100 years, with a minimum age model of 4500 &#177; 600 years (and an overiv dispersion of 56%). In the case study of Mushroom Rock West rockshelter, the OSL central age model estimate for microdebitage at 268 cm depth into the archaeological deposit is 21,200 &#177; 3100 years (with a minimum age model estimate of 10,500 &#177; 5200 years, and 60% over-dispersion), compared to a central age model estimate for the sedimentary quartz grains of 31,500 &#177; 3100 years (with a minimum age model estimate of 11,100 &#177; 1500 years, and 67% over-dispersion). For the archaeological layer situated at 441 cm depth, the microdebitage yielded an OSL age of 27,400 &#177; 2200 years. This sample of microdebitage produced the lowest over-dispersion (0.1%) on the palaeodose of any of the samples analysed, lending confidence to the accuracy of the palaeodose determination. The sedimentary quartz from the same sample produced an OSL minimum age model estimate of 33,500 &#177; 5600 years (and a central age model estimate of 46,900 &#177;3400 years). Relationships between microdebitage and sediment OSL ages are discussed.Direct OSL dating of the unheated quartz derived from the manufacture of lithic tools now provides an alternative to the reliance on sedimentary quartz as the primary source information regarding the age of archaeological deposits. This knowledge may be applied also to archaeological sediments previously excavated, for identifying episodes of lithic manufacture in temporal relation to other evidence of cultural activity. The ages of the two archaeological sites analysed differ widely, and this difference was also represented in the ages obtained from the microdebitage. None of the OSL age determinations of microdebitage was found to be unrealistically outside the boundaries of pre-existing age control. This is one indication of the validity of the novel experimental approach applied here.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/768</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Becoming a lawyer: the transformation of student identity through stories</field><field name="creator">Sharp, Cassandra Elizabeth</field><field name="description">To study law is to invite change. Not just change, but transformation. In the process of becoming lawyers, students interpret stories of law, transform meanings about law, and construct legal identity. Desperate to make sense of the world in which they will one day inhabit, first year law students draw on resources from two cultural realms: the legal and the social. In particular, they use popular stories as one resource to interpret what it means to be lawyer, and as a result students occupy a central place amid the intersection of law, society and fiction. This thesis is concerned with the interpretation and transformation of meaning about law and lawyering within the social and academic context of law school. Of particular concern are the stories that are interpreted and produced through the medium of television and within the context of law school. This thesis does not engage with the familiar debate over the way in which law is represented in popular culture, rather it offers a new scholarly perspective on how students use these images. Specifically, this thesis examines the significance of stories in students&#8217; construction of identity. It does so by empirically analysing the &#8216;talk&#8217; of focus groups. These groups were comprised of first year law students, and methodologically sought to address the use of stories within meaning-making processes and the construction of identity. Drawing from the analysis of these groups, the thesis shows that first year law is transformative moment in the students&#8217; identity construction; and that students use popular stories to interpret (and then retell) the ways in which they view a career in law. It further demonstrates that in their storied responses to popular culture students are grappling with notions of ethics and desperate to become ethically aware. The thesis concludes by arguing that student discussions reflect the imbrication of stories, ethics and identity, and for this reason, urges that stories be given explicit pedagogic value within the law school curriculum.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/838</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Secure communication over mobile ad-hoc network</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Zhenfei</field><field name="description">A Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET) is an ideal network that merely consists of mobiles devices without any pre-established infrastructure. However, the secure communication over a MANET is not straightforward. In this thesis, we present a solution for MANET secure communication. Generally speaking, it covers two main areas, namely key management and secure routing.In the key management area, we present an idea of adopting certificateless public key encryption (CL-PKE) schemes over mobile ad hoc network (MANET), which have not been explored before. In the current literature, there exists two main approaches, namely public key cryptography and identity-based (ID-based) cryptography. Unfortunately, they both have some inherent drawbacks. To avoid these obstacles, Al-Riyami and Paterson proposed certificateless cryptography systems. In this thesis, we adopt Al-Riyami&#8217;s advantage over MANET. To implement CL-PKE over MANET and to make it practical, we incorporate the idea of Shamir&#8217;s secret sharing scheme. The master secret keys are shared among some or all the MANET nodes. This makes the system self-organized once the network has been initiated. In order to provide more flexibility, we consider both a full distribution system and a partial distribution system.In the secure routing area, we present the idea of adopting a reputation system over the optimized link state routing (OLSR) protocol. In the literature, there exists two main routing approaches, namely proactive routing and reactive routing. Several secure reactive routing protocols have beenproposed. However, as far as proactive routing is concerned, few secure protocols are presented, yet they all possess different drawbacks that make them only practical on certain routing protocols. One of major problems is how to determine whether a node is worthy of trust or not. In other networks, for example, peer-to-peer sharing networks, reputation systems are designed to judge users. Unfortunately, they are designed specifically for peer-to-peer systems, while the adoption to MANET is not very straightforward. To this end, we present our Rep-OLSR, which selects routes wisely based on users&#8217; former performance by periodically collecting polling results from neighbour nodes.Finally, we demonstrate that our solution is robust against several types of attacks. We also test our solution with several simulations. The results of the simulations indicate that our solution efficiently secure the communication with little extra traffic compared with pure MANET routing protocols.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/839</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structure and tectonics of the Gunnedah Basin, N.S.W: implications for stratigraphy, sedimentation and coal resources, with emphasis on the Upper Black Jack group</field><field name="creator">Tadros, N. Z</field><field name="description">The Gunnedah Basin has long been considered a foreland basin. This study found that the basin consists of several linearly arranged troughs defined by bounding longitudinal and transverse ridges and highs. These features, together with the distribution and type of the Early Permian sedimentary basin fill and the associated volcanic rocks, strongly indicate that the basin's origin is consistent with volcanic rift models. The Meandarra Gravity Ridge, which represents a significant zone of inhomogeneity in the upper crust caused by deep-seated dense mafic intrusions, provided a key tool for resolving the early history of basin development. The ridge is laterally displaced by low gravity transverse trends representing transfer structures which were active during rifting and thus bound rift compartments of varying size and subsequent thermal subsidence histories.There is a striking correspondence between the high gravity anomalies and the trough areas which  contain the thickest sedimentary pile (and hence maximum subsidence), and also between the low gravity transverse trends and the mapped transverse structural highs in the basin. These relationships, together with the linear arrangement of the troughs, enabled prediction of basement structure within areas of little or no borehole control, provided the basis for subdivision of the Mullaley and Gilgandra Suli-basins into structural subunits, and enabled prediction of basement faults which have little or no surface expression.During the Early Permian, the volcanic rift-related transverse and longitudinal structures were the main source of sediment and effectively controlled and confined sedimentation to the trough areas (overlying the half-grabens). Thermal relaxation followed in the mid-Permian and caused basin-wide subsidence, widespread marine transgression and deposition of the Porcupine and Watermark Formations, but the rate of subsidence in the trough areas was still significantly higher. The change to foreland tectonics in the mid-Permian provided a new source of sediment from the overthrusted New England Fold Belt. Tectonic loading in the Late Permian caused subsidence of the eastern half of the basin and establishment of lacustrine conditions. Structural readjustment along the eastern edge of the cratonic Lachlan Fold Belt caused uplift of a forebulge and shedding of quartzose detritus to the Westem Fluvial System which infilled the lake and expanded through the axial drainage via southwest-flowing tributaries. Fluvial incision of the underlying Westem Fluvial and Lacustrine Systems and sediment intermixing are evident in the main channel complex. Influx of coarse detritus from the New England Fold Belt and westward movement of the basin axis caused south-westward migration of the axial drainage complex.Widespread silicic volcanism in the New England Fold Belt region contributed large amounts of pyroclastic detritus to the basin-fill. A major phase of lateral compression and thrusting of the New England Fold Belt onto the craton caused structural readjustment and uplift, particularly in the north, and ended Permian deposition in the basin.Although foreland loading of the thrust belt was the dominant cause of subsidence during deposition of the Late Permian Black Jack Group and the Triassic Digby and Napperby Formations, the inherent volcanic rift-related basement structural elements had a significant effect by varying subsidence rates in the different basement compartments and consequently on development, distribution and geometry of depositional systems, their component fades and peat accumulation, as well as on emplacement and distribution of igneous intrusions and extrusions in the basin.In the Late Permian and Triassic, longitudinal structures were periodically reactivated as thrust faults resulting in uplift and erosion of much of the upper Permian sequence particularly in the Maules Creek Sub-basin and the northern Mullaley Sub-basin.The basement structural elements also controlled the distribution of igneous intrusions and volcanism. Late Carboniferous to Eariy Permian eruptions followed transfer faults and floored the developing Gunnedah Basin with basalt, while silicic volcanism appears to have developed parallel to the basin margins along longitudinal extension/detachment faults. Reactivated major transfer faults provided pathways for Jurassic and Tertiary phases of igneous intrusions and extrusions. Recognition and mapping of basement structural elements and understanding of the basin's tectonic history highlighted the interrelationship between basin origin, tectonics and sedimentation and provided a framework for sedimentological and stratigraphic analysis and coal resource evaluation.An hierarchial approach to genetic stratigraphic analysis has been applied to the study of the upper Black Jack Group. The analysis included definition of the geometry and distribution of genetic stratigraphic units and mapping sediment dispersion pattems within the sequence in order to develop sedimentation models and to detenmine the palaeogeography and tectonism expressed as basin subsidence and uplift in the source regions.Sand body geometry of the upper Black Jack sequence emphasises the structurally controlled fluvial character, with a major axial trunk channel complex fed by easterly and westerly contributory channels. The Hoskissons Coal and the Breeza Coal Member are regionally extensive, have tectonic and time significance and serve as genetic sequence boundaries. These seams separate genetic sequences of distinctly different depositional settings, bedding architecture, and sediment composition. The basinwide accumulation of the Hoskissons peat represents a significant period characterised by almost total non-deposition of terrigenous elastics and marks a change in basin depositional history from predominantly deltaic and shallow marine sedimentation to fluvial and lacustrine conditions of the upper Black Jack depositional episodes. The Breeza Coal Member marks the change from the Westem Depositional Episode, during which the basin fill was dominantly quartzose, derived from the Lachlan Fold Belt in the west, to the Eastern Depositional Episode when the sediment supply was from the New England Fold Belt in the east and was mainly lithic.Four major genetic elements: the Hoskissons Peat-swamp, the Lacustrine, the Western Fluvial and the Eastern Fluvial Systems, have been recognised by their different lithology, and depositional and tectonic setting and by their palaeogeographic relationships.The depositional systems served as mapping units with bounding surfaces for the contained genetic facies and allowed establishment and or refinement of correlations of several subregional coal seams. These seams, although not representing sequence boundaries, have time significance locally and have been used in finer subdivision within the larger genetic stratigraphic packages. Detailed lithofacies mapping of the interseam sediments provided the means to reconstruct the evolution of the upper part of the Black Jack fluvial systems, enhanced recognition of depocentres, revealed areal and stratigraphic distribution of sand bodies within the genetic units and ultimately allowed recognition of the impact of basement structures on sand distribution.The genetically defined units provided the basis for the establishment of a new formal lithostratigraphy for the entire Permo-Triassic Gunnedah Basin sedimentary fill. In all, three groups, three subgroups, 13 formations and six members have been formally named and described in detail for the Permian section. Three formations and two members have also been formally named and described in the Triassic section. The expanded knowledge of the Gunnedah Basin sequence also allowed correlation of the stratigraphy and depositional history with those of the Sydney Basin.The Hoskissons Coal, is the product of the Hoskissons Peat-swamp System and consists predominantly of vitrinite-poor, inertinite-rich coal with high liptinite content. Vitrinite content decreases upward in the lower section of the coal and increases upward in the upper section with a con'esponding increase in the amount of disseminated and discrete mineral matter. Liptinite (mainly sporinite) content increases towards the top where alginite is also present. The Lacustrine System displays cyclic alternation between upward-coarsening sediments of lake margin facies and organic-rich mudstone of lake basin facies.Architectural element analysis of the Western Fluvial System indicated that the sandstone was deposited by discrete, broad, probably shallow, low sinuosity channels comparable with Models 9 and 10 of Miall (1985) for low sinuosity rivers, and the middle-upper Brownstones of Allen (1983). In vertical profile, the sequence combines features characteristic of low sinuosity rivers of the "Piatt type" and the "South Saskatchewan type", or its ancient analogue - the Battery Point Formation.Axial and tributary channel fill deposits of the Eastern Fluvial System consist mainly of volcanic-lithic conglomerate. The flood plain facies consist of carbonaceous sediments, thick stony coals and tuff.Depositional setting had a significant influence on quality and continuity of the Hoskissons Coal. Therefore, in addition, the study included comprehensive analysis of the maceral composition of the Hoskissons Coal and applied coal facies analysis in order to understand the peat-forming environment and the factors that controlled the changes in that environment and consequently variations in coal quality and distribution. Subsidence was the major factor that controlled development of the Hoskissons peat swamp, influx of clastic sediments and consequently, coal quality and thickness. Rate of subsidence was uneven across the basin and was structurally controlled, and in part influenced by compaction of the peat or of the underlying platform of marine sediments.Initially, shoreline sands (of the preceding upper Watermark-lower Black Jack/Arkarula Depositional Episode), in the south, protected the peat swamps from inundation by the sea and kept the water table high enough to produce vitrinite-rich plies, low in mineral matter and sulphur, at the base of the seam. The general trend of upward decrease then increase in vitrinite content of the Hoskissons Coal indicate a gradual fall and subsequent rise in the water table which ultimately "drowned" the peat and established lacustrine conditions in the eastern part of the basin. Raw and washed coal isoash trends show a dominant fluvial influence on coal quality. Geographic zonation of the SiO2/Al2O3 ratios of the coal ash corresponds closely with regional trends in the associated depositional systems. Si02/Al203 ratios are high in the north and south-west as a result of the influence of the quartz-rich western fluvial sediments. Tectonic stability and minor influx of clay-rich sediments from the New England Fold Belt region contributed to the low to medium Si02/Al203 ratios in the east.Basement structural elements were active during sedimentation and influenced subsidence, sedimentation and peat accumulation. There is a strong relationship between the Hoskissons Coal lithotype profile, quality and thickness and basement structural elements. Organic-rich mudstone formed in rapidly subsiding areas in the centre of the trough areas where, in some places, the Hoskissons Coal has been replaced by clastic sediment. Lowest rates of subsidence on the highs and ridges produced a thin seam and exposed the coal to some degradation and partial erosion.Sand content of the underlying platform had some influence on subsidence and consequently on coal thickness and quality. Localised compaction of the peat also  contributed to subsidence in the north and central eastern areas.Coal seams above the Hoskissons Coal, were also strongly influenced by their depositional setting. Peat accumulated in interchannel areas adjacent to the axial channel complex and principal tributaries. Location of the axial channel complex was largely structurally controlled and occupied the areas of maximum basin subsidence. Moderate subsidence rates in the north tended to entrench the axial channel complex which, as a result, isolated the peat swamps in the interchannel areas and produced fewer seams that are hard to correlate. Rapid subsidence rates in the south and south east allowed greater lateral shift through aggradation and avulsion and favoured thick widespread peat accumulation except where the swamp has been disrupted by sediment influx from nearby channels.The comprehensive analysis of the structure and sedimentation, complemented with a study of the peat swamp environment and coal facies analysis, greatly improved understanding of the factors which controlled peat swamp development and peat formation, coal quality and distribution, seam thickness and splitting, and the nature of the mineral matter in the coal, and provided the basis for reliable seam correlations. All of these are important factors in the assessment of the basin's coal resources, which are estimated at 29 billion tonnes of potentially usable in situ coal. The Black Jack Group contains the vast majority of that resource, and nearly half of the total resource is contained in the Hoskissons seam.The remaining coal resources are contained mainly in the six seams overlying the Hoskissons Coal, particularly in the Caroona area, except near the axial channel complex where quality deteriorates and in some cases the seam is split or replaced by fluvial channel deposits.Exploration in the basin has concentrated on the Breeza, Caroona, West Gunnedah and Narrabri areas within the potentially economic zone of shallow (&lt;500&gt;metres), good quality coal in the east, where borehole spacing is between 4 and 8 kilometres or less and seam correlations are well established, allowing the coal resources to be calculated to Intended status. The bulk of the resources of Hoskissons and the overlying seams is amenable to underground mining methods only.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/840</field></doc><doc><field name="title">TrainNet: a novel transport infrastructure for non real-time data delivery</field><field name="creator">Zarafshan Araki, Mohammad</field><field name="description">To date, researchers have proposed many vehicular networks in which cars or buses act as a mechanical backhaul for transporting data. For example, a bus can be retrofitted with a computer and wireless card to automatically ferry data to/from rural villages without Internet connectivity. Alternatively, a person carrying a portable storage device can be used to link geographically disparate networks. These examples of challenged networks are characterized by frequent disruptions, long delays, and/or intermittent connectivity.This thesis proposes TrainNet, a vehicular network that uses trains to transport latency insensitive data. TrainNet augments a railway network by equipping stations and trains with mass storage devices; e.g., a rack of portable hard disks. TrainNet has two applications. First, it provides a low cost, very high bandwidth link that can be used to deliver non real-time data. In particular, cable TV operators can use TrainNet to meet the high bandwidth requirement associated with Video on Demand (VoD) services. Moreover, TrainNet is able to meet this requirement easily because its links are scalable, meaning their capacity can be increased inexpensively due to the continual fall of hard disk price. Secondly, TrainNet provides an alternative, economically viable, broadband solution to rural regions that are reachable via a railway network. Therefore, using TrainNet, rural communities will be able to gain access to bandwidth intensive digital contents such as music, video, television programs, and movies cheaply.A key problem in TrainNet is resource scheduling. This problem arises because stations compete for the fixed storage capacity on each train. To this end, this thesis is the first to propose three max-min scheduling algorithms, namely LMMF, WGMMF and GMMF, for use in challenged networks. These algorithms arbitrate the hard disk space among competing stations using local traffic information at each station, or those from other stations. To study these algorithms, the Unified Modeling Language (UML) is first used to construct a model of TrainNet, before a simulator is constructed using the DESMO-J framework. The resulting TrainNet simulator is then used to investigate the behavior of said max-min algorithms in scenarios with realistic traffic patterns. Results show that while LMMF is the fairest algorithm, it results in data loss and has the longest mean delay, the lowest average throughput, and the lowest hard disk utilization. Furthermore, Jain&#8217;s fairness index shows WGMMF to be the least fair algorithm. However, it avoids data loss as is the case with GMMF, and achieves the best performance in terms of mean delay, averaged throughput, and hard disk utilization.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/842</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Representing the belly-dancing body: feminism, orientalism, and the grotesque</field><field name="creator">Keft-Kennedy, Virginia</field><field name="description">This thesis traces the genealogy of the discursive construction of belly dance in literature and culture in the West from the late nineteenth century to 2005. Drawing on theoretical perspectives from literary studies, cultural studies, and dance studies it takes an interdisciplinary approach to the analysis of representations of belly dance. It explores how this dance has been shaped by major socio-cultural shifts in ideologies of race, gender, and embodiment. The solo improvised Middle Eastern dance, also known as belly dance, is a highly recognisable and strikingly pervasive dance form in Western popular culture, yet the topic of belly dance has remained significantly under-analysed in any academic field. This study brings the belly-dancing body into focus as a legitimate object of analysis that exposes how social meanings are produced through performance, and how dancing bodies are inscribed with, and read through, markers of race, sexuality, and gender. In examining the politics of gender and race in the representation of belly dance, this study brings to bear three key theoretical formations: feminism, Orientalism, and the grotesque. It is concerned with the complex ways in which belly dance has been mythologised, represented, and constructed in a range of texts such as colonial travel writing, fiction, and images from popular culture. In addition, this thesis also explores the intersections of (neo)colonialism, commodification, consumer culture, sexuality, and notions of female embodiment in representations of belly dance.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/843</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of detector volume on penumbral dose prediction in a 6 MV radiation therapy X-ray beam</field><field name="creator">Yuen, Johnson</field><field name="description">Introduction With the adoption of technologies such as stereotactic radiosurgery in the treatment of cancer, there is an increasing trend towards smaller field sizes where the importance of accurate penumbral measurements is critical. Small segments are also common in intensity modulated radiation therapy deliveries; hence accurate dose assessment at the edge of multi-leaf collimated segmented fields is also paramount.Clinically used detectors have significant detector volumes that contribute to measurement of wider penumbral dose profiles than the beam produces. This overestimate of penumbral width in turn has an impact on the radiotherapy treatment planning modelled dose distributions used for patient treatment. This is because the penumbra broadening in the dose profile affects the source size parameter used in radiotherapy treatment planning system. In this thesis, the extent of penumbral broadening was quantified and methods to produce data with effectively zero detector volumes were investigated. This data was used to calculate a source size for the computer model to best match the measured data.Methods Data was measured for a 6 MV beam (Varian Clinac 600C) using a diamond detector, a pinpoint detector, and a 0.125 cc ionisation chamber. Extrapolation and deconvolution techniques were used to calculate zero detector volume data. The extrapolation technique was studied in detail and a new verification technique, which involved R2 and dose differences, was developed to calculate the fit and errors associated with the extrapolation method. The amount of penumbral broadening and source size overestimation in Pinnacle decreased with decreasing detector diameter. Results In this study, penumbral broadening of up to +1.8 mm (80%-20% penumbra) due to the detector volume effect was found to occur across both large and small field sizes and this resulted in overestimations in the source size parameter in the Pinnacle radiotherapy treatment planning system by +1.2 mm for the 0.125cc ionisation chamber (from the zero detector source size of 0.9 mm).The effect of source size overestimation in Pinnacle was studied by the calculation of dose distributions with the virtual zero detector dataset and the 0.125 cc ionisation chamber dataset.The point in the middle of the field had minimal change but there were changes in the dose distribution which were due to a summation of penumbral perturbations of each beam.It was found that for large field sizes (~10&#215;10 cm2) the summed doses in the treatment region were underestimated by approximately 0.5%. For small field sizes (1&#215;1 cm2) summed dose in the treatment region was overestimated by approximately 3.5% while over the whole region there was an overestimation of approximately 11%. For the case of a 3DCRT prostate plan, changes in dose were underestimated by to 1% for volumes typical of the PTV and overestimated by up to +1.5% for volumes typical of organs at risk.Equations were derived that produced agreeable links between the detector volume and the penumbral width as well as the penumbral width and the source size parameter in Pinnacle. The coefficients required in these equations were calculated from datasets obtained from the measurement of dose profiles by physical detectors and the calculation of dose profiles in the treatment planning system respectively. The use of these equations could be used to estimate and/or correct for the detector volume effect on the source size parameter in the treatment planning system with a minimum of beam measurement time. However, further investigations are required to verify this over a wide range of conditions such as beam energy and collimator design.The 1D dose profiles measured with different detectors were analysed in terms of intersection point and inflection point. The results indicated that there were significant deviations of both these points from a normalised dose of 50% with small field sizes. There was an overestimate of the radiation field size (50%) by 0.8 mm measured with the 0.125cc ionisation chamber at the field size of 1&#215;1 cm2 but at other field sizes measured the radiation field size was within &#177;0.2 mm. The intersection point determined the spatial location of overestimation and underestimation of point and summed dose. The overall summed dose was found to be unaffected by the detector volume effect at a field size of 2.3x2.3 cm2, which was similar to the minimum field size for lateral electron equilibrium (2.6x2.6 cm2).Conclusions- The results of a survey of different radiotherapy institutions indicated that approximately half of measurements done for use in modelling the Pinnacle radiation treatment planning system involved the use of ionisation chambers (approximately 0.1 cm3). In this study, it was demonstrated that (1) the detector volume effect is significant as matching the model to broad penumbra overestimates the virtual source size parameter by the order of +1 mm in Pinnacle; (2) that the effect on dose distributions for single fields in the penumbra are the dose may be different by 1-10% compared with zero detector profile matched data (3) that corrections to the detector volume can be made with a new single detector technique combined with a predictive equation. This makes the correction more feasible with consideration to time constraints.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/851</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pesticide exposure in free-living native birds and the effects of acute dosing of fenitrothion and fipronil on physiological performance in selected species</field><field name="creator">Fildes, Karen J</field><field name="description">This chapter introduces the main classes of pesticides with a brief overview of their mode of toxic action. Cholinesterase inhibiting chemicals and their known effects on birds are reviewed in detail. The benefits and limitations of the use of lethal compared to sublethal toxicological endpoints to assess pesticide impacts on avian species in toxicological research are discussed. It is argued that there is a critical need for investigations of sublethal effects to consider biochemical and physiological components of ecologically relevant traits. The use of pesticides for locust control, particularly fenitrothion and fipronil, by the Australian Plague Locust Commission, is discussed. The chemical properties and mode of toxic action of these two pesticides are reviewed and the potential impact of their application on Australian native bird species is assessed.Chapter 2 Cholinesterase (ChE) inhibiting pesticides are applied throughout Australia to control agricultural pests. Blood plasma ChE activity is a sensitive indicator of exposure to organophosphorus insecticides in vertebrates. To aid biomonitoring and provide reference data for wildlife pesticide-risk assessment, plasma acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) activities were characterised in nine native bird species: brown songlarks (Cinclorhamphus cruralis), budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus), clamorous reed warblers (Acrocephalus stentoreus), double-barred finches (Taeniopygia bichenovii), king quails (Coturnix chinensis), Richard&#8217;s pipits (Anthus novaeseelandiae), white-plumed honeyeaters (Lichenostomas penicillatus), willie wagtails (Rhipidura leucophrys) and yellow throated miners (Manorina flavigula). The plasma of all species contained AChE and BChE except in king quail where no AChE was present. The lowest detectable plasma AChE activity was 0.10 &#61549;mols/min/ml in budgerigars and the highest was 0.86 &#61549;mols/min/ml in clamorous reed-warblers. BChE activity in the plasma ranged from 0.37 in double-barred finches to 0.90 &#61549;mols/min/ml in white-plumed honeyeaters and clamorous reed-warblers. The lowest proportion of AChE was found in budgerigars (12.8%) and highest in willie-wagtails (67.8%). Apart from king quail AChE activities in all species were within the range reported for other avian species. The absence of AChE in king quail has not previously been reported for any bird species. The effect of sampling time on plasma ChE was assessed in budgerigars and zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) and seasonal effects were examined in zebra finches.  No diurnal variation in ChE activity was found at any time of day in either species although there was a significant difference in all ChE activity between seasons in zebra finches.Chapter 3 Huge aggregations of flightless locust nymphs pose a serious threat to agriculture when they reach plague proportions, but provide a very visible and nutritious resource for native birds. Locust outbreaks occur in spring and summer months in semiarid regions of Australia. Fenitrothion, an organophosphate pesticide, is aerially sprayed to control locust plagues. To evaluate fenitrothion exposure in birds attending locust outbreaks, we measured total plasma cholinesterase (ChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities in four avian species captured pre- and post-fenitrothion application and ChE reactivation in birds caught post spray only. Eleven of 21 plasma samples from four species had ChE activity below the diagnostic threshold (two standard deviations below the mean ChE activity of pre-spray samples). Granivorous zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) and insectivorous white-winged trillers (Lalage sueurii) had significantly lower mean plasma total ChE, BChE, and AChE activity post-spray, while two other insectivores, white-browed (Artamus superciliosus) and masked woodswallows (Artamus personatus), did not. Cholinesterase was reactivated in 19 of the 73 plasma samples collected, and in one of three brain samples. We conclude that native bird species are exposed to fenitrothion during locust control operations. This exposure could have detrimental impacts as locust outbreaks and avian reproductive events are both stimulated by heavy summer rainfall, leading to co-occurrence of locust-control and avian breeding activities.Chapter 4 The effect of fenitrothion exposure on birds was examined by measuring aerobic metabolism, blood haemoglobin (Hb) content, plasma cholinesterase activities and body mass for up to 21 d post-dose. Peak metabolic rate (PMR) was measured in a flight metabolic chamber in three dose groups of house sparrows (Passer domesticus) (100 mg/kg = high, 60 mg/kg = medium, 30 mg/kg = low), and one dose group each of zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) (3 mg/kg) and king quails (Coturnix chinensis) (26 mg/kg). Aerobic metabolism was measured during a 1 h exposure to sub-freezing thermal conditions in low dose house sparrows and king quails (26 mg/kg). Fenitrothion had no effect on metabolic rate during cold exposure or on Hb at any time. By contrast, aerobic performance during exercise in sparrows was reduced by 58% (high), by 18% (medium), and by 20% (low) 2 d post dose. House sparrows (high) had the longest recovery period for PMR (21 d) and plasma cholinesterase (ChE) activity (14 d). House sparrows (high) and treated king quails had significantly lower body weight at 48 h post-dose whereas body mass was invariant in zebra finches and house sparrows (medium and low). Cholinesterase was maximally inhibited at 6 h post dose, and had recovered within 24 h, in house sparrows (low), king quails and zebra finches. Exercise PMR in zebra finches and king quails was reduced by 23% at 2 and 3 d post-dose, respectively, despite these birds being asymptomatic in both behaviour and plasma ChE activities. Chapter 5 We examined the sublethal effects of the fipronil based pesticide Adonis 3UL &#174; insecticide on birds by measuring exercise induced peak metabolic rate (PMR) in zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) and king quail (Coturnix chinensis), and during a 1-h exposure to sub-freezing conditions in king quail. Exercise induced peak metabolic rate was measured in zebra finch pre-dose and at one, two, ten and twenty days after treated birds ingested 17.5 mg/kg Adonis 3UL &#174; mixed with canola oil and control birds received canola oil alone. Peak metabolic rate measurements were taken during exercise pre-dose and two, six and fourteen days after king quail received 30 mg/kg Adonis 3UL &#174; or canola oil alone. Peak metabolic rate after was not affected by fipronil in Adonis 3UL &#174; or by sham treatment in birds of both species. We conclude that the administered sublethal dose of fipronil did not affect exercise performance in zebra finch or in king quail nor was there evidence of fipronil induced thermoregulatory effects in king quails.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/856</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thermal stratification in atria</field><field name="creator">Mak, Nicholas</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/892</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Text and intertextuality: words about music about words</field><field name="creator">Ford, Andrew</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/933</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The archaeology of masculinity: the process of personal archaeology in the creative arts</field><field name="creator">Duncan, Lindsay James</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/934</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Music of Michael Whiticker</field><field name="creator">Whiticker, Michael</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/937</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Hearts and Minds project: towards a theatre of cultural diversity - script and archival production videotape</field><field name="creator">Copeman, Peter Arthur</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/959</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transportation of the sense of place (Genius loci) : the development of ideas associated with the transportation of the sense of place 'Genius loci' with particular reference to works of 'poetical nature' within British romantic art and a brief consideration of aspects of Australian art where both are implicit in an understanding of the nature and characteristics of 'place'</field><field name="creator">Henderson, Ian</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/961</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A case study investigating international and local students' perceptions and experiences of teaching in an intercultural tertiary context</field><field name="creator">Hellmundt, Susan C.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/965</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design processes adopted Sri Lankan teacher educators to develop Internet-based study materials</field><field name="creator">Karunanayaka, Shironica Priyanthi</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/969</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intelligent profiles: a model for change in women's lives</field><field name="creator">Lysaght, Pauline</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/971</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Perceptions of student teachers and practising primary teachers in relation to primary mathematics</field><field name="creator">Kalamany, Thambiaiah</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/972</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 2 (PAI-2) expression on the cell surface of monocytic cell lines and human peripheral blood leukocytes</field><field name="creator">Liew, Michael Andrew</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1036</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Systematic pattern and evolutionary process in the complex species Persoonia mollis R.

This thesis focuses on the development of an interoperability solution for health by employing design science research methods to arrive at a final solution.First, background topics including Health Informatics standards and formats are covered, which leads to three major Health Informatics standards being used throughout the remainder of this work &#8211; HL7 for messaging, openEHR for patient records, and SNOMED CT as a standard terminology to facilitate clarity of information, and to discourage ambiguity between communicating entities.Ontology mapping methods between these standards designed to promote interoperability by using the standards in conjunction with each other are then presented, leading to a solution for semantic interoperability.A technical interoperability solution is required for sending these semantically interoperable messages, which leads to the development of a framework which uses a tuple-space paradigm to share messages. This framework is shown to have some scalability issues, which leads to the final solution &#8211; a scalable interoperability framework based on the Enterprise Service Bus methodology of enterprise integration which provides a real-world answer to communication in healthcare.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3048</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Collaborative natural resource management in a changing institutional landscape : rhetoric and practice of catchment management in New South Wales, Australia</field><field name="creator">Fidelman, Pedro I. J.</field><field name="description">Collaborative approaches to natural resource management (NRM), emphasising participatory and decentralised forms of decision-making, such as catchment management, have been experimented with in Australia over the past 15 years or so. These experiments have taken place in an institutional context that has been changing frequently and rapidly, as many states have, particularly in recent years, reviewed legislative and administrative arrangements for NRM. Such reforms may involve significant changes in the legislative and administrative arrangements, such as new and specific legislation, NRM entities with diverse names, structures and functions, as well as new processes.In New South Wales (NSW), for instance, such changes have often altered the structure and process of NRM decision-making (e.g., the interests represented, the level of authority and power devolved, community participation, geographic domain, etc.). Although, these reforms have sought to improve NRM performance and outcomes, they have occurred in a context where the exact requirements for institutional change, in order to facilitate collaborative NRM, are not well understood. In this context, it is not explicit how (and if) these institutional reforms are establishing, or are likely to establish, appropriate arrangements to translate the rhetoric of collaborative NRM into practice.This research examined the design of and change in institutional arrangements for collaborative NRM in the context of the NSW experience. The study used a case study research approach to undertake a comparative analysis of the arrangements experimented with over the history of the NSW catchment management initiative (late 1980s-mid 00s). The Institutional Analysis and Development framework was used to examine three catchment management institutions, representatives of periods characterised by institutional change. The research aimed to provide a better understanding of how (and why) institutional design and change have taken place, and how such design and change have facilitated (or otherwise) collaborative NRM.The study showed that institutional arrangements, in terms of who participate in NRM decision-making and how they are selected, authority, powers and resources devolved, decision-making and aggregation arrangements, arrangements for communication, interaction, reporting and monitoring, functional scope and geographic domain, varied considerably throughout the history of the NSW catchment management initiative. Despite the variations, institutional arrangements were characterised by significant constraints and have been limited in facilitating collaborative NRM. In many cases, institutional change reinforced the constraints to collaborative processes, such as those associated with stakeholder and citizen engagement, levels of authority and power devolved, and autonomy and flexibility of catchment management institutions. The analysis also provided insights into the challenges and complexities surrounding the development and implementation of collaborative NRM. Another key issue demonstrated in this study was an emerging trend in terms of institutional arrangements in NSW, where the current arrangements have evolved away from a collaborative model towards one of deconcentration (i.e., administrative decentralisation). Given the complexities and challenges involving the development and implementation of collaborative NRM, the adequacy and appropriateness of indiscriminately pursuing collaborative approaches was considered.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/837</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Demographic: economic modelling in the Wollongong statistical district</field><field name="creator">Dhawan, Reetu</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/886</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An integrative and dynamic analysis of business bankruptcy in Australia</field><field name="creator">Cheung, Lillian</field><field name="description">This thesis proposes an integrative and dynamic approach for assessing the effects of linkages across industries, industry-specific conditions, aggregate domestic economic conditions and intemational economic conditions on the rates of bankruptcy in six of Australia's major industries: primary production, mining and quarrying, manufacturing, building and constmction, transport, storage and communication and finance and property. The effects of these factors are estimated within a dynamic and simultaneous-equation system with pooled cross-state time-series observations for the period 1978 to 1992. In addition, preliminary tests of cointegration and causality are conducted vyith nation-wide time-series data for the period 1973 to 1992 in order to explore the possible linkages among industries' bankruptcy rates.The estimation results of the preliminary analyses and the dynamic and simultaneous equation system have both suggested inter-industry linkages among bankruptcy rates. Moreover, the estimation results of the simultaneous-equation systera have lent support to the survival of the fittest hypothesis for all industries studied. A number of other economic variables have also been found to be significantly associated with business bankruptcy rates, which include industryspecific variables such as the number of industrial disputes, housing prices and raanufacturing wage rate; domestic economic variables such as state per-capita income, federal government spending, personal income tax rate, interest rate and money supply; as well as intemational economic factors such as exchange rate, world prices and Japan's GDP. Among these variables, government policy instruments have been foimd to have relatively larger effects on the rates of bankruptcy. The estimation results of these analyses might help policy-makers design a comprehensive stabilisation policy for the Ausfralian business sector.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1311</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Approaches to evaluation of research and development in agriculture: a case study of rice productivity in Thailand 1967-1998</field><field name="creator">Siripongsaroj, Kriangsak</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1312</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Income distribution, employment and economic growth : issues in a development planning framework with application to the economy of Fiji</field><field name="creator">Guest, James F.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1319</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role and realities of bank operations in the economic growth of Malaysia</field><field name="creator">Shanmugam, Bala</field><field name="description">Although a number of studies have been undertaken to demonstrate the importance of financial institutions to economic growth (for example: Gurley and Shaw 1955, Patrick 1966, Porter 1966, Goldsmith 1969, Maldonado 1970, Mckinnon 1973, Shaw 1973), only a few studies (such as: Bhatia and Khatkhate 1975, Abdi 1977) have dealt exclusively with developing countries. Even more rare are in-depth empirical studies of the contribution of the financial sector to the real sector in developing countries. In an attempt to fill this gap in the literature on finance and development, an empirical study on the role and realities of bank operations in the economic growth of Malaysia was undertaken. Malaysia was selected since it is one of the few developing countries to achieve rapid economic growth and it was interesting to explore the impact of banks on such a growth.In short, the primary objective of the study was to demonstrate the significance of finance (banks) to economic growth in Malaysia. To accomplish this objective the following analyses were undertaken:(i) examination of the relationship between functions and operations of banks and on the other hand, and the growth of the financial and real assets of the country on the other (on a macro-level);(ii) collection of information on the impact of banks, as perceived by the public (on a micro-level via surveys, interviews and case studies);(iii) an investigation of the effects of the growth in banking on the informal credit market (moneylenders, pawnbrokers, tontine operators - through interviews).The findings generally indicated that the banks have been essential to the economic growth of Malaysia. Although the econometric analysis failed to conclusively link finance to economic growth, the micro-level analysis pointed to the important contribution that banks made to the business sector. The surveys, interviews and case studies brought out the realities of bank operations in Malaysia. Relevant recommendations were made as a consequence of these original and significant findings. The recommendations should be useful while formulating policies to enhance the contribution of banks to economic growth in Malaysia.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1326</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of secularized religion within the tradition of New South Wales Methodism since 1930</field><field name="creator">Ward, Winifred Lily</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1422</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sectarianism and the development of elementary education in New South Wales, 1788-1918</field><field name="creator">Davies, Kenneth</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1424</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of coal trade in the Wollongong district of New South Wales, with particular reference to government and business, 1849-1889</field><field name="creator">Lee, Henry Patrick</field><field name="description">The argument in the thesis is organised in three parts. Part I, comprising Chapters 1 to 5, inclusive, examines the period 1849-1871. It establishes the factors leading to the location of the first mines on the Wollongong coalfield, as well as to the formation of the coalition of local businessmen that had as its object the attraction to the district of as much mining capital as it could absorb. They identified the lack of a natural harbour as the great obstacle to the attainment of that objective and, through electoral manipulation, succeeded in having the New South Wales government construct a coal port at public expense. The port was completed in 1868, but proved a grand failure. Owners of capital responded to market and profit considerations rather than to the efforts of small business to overcome such considerations with artificial inducements provided at public expense. Consequently, by 1871, following recessions in 1863/64 and 1870, only a handful of mines were operating in the Wollongong Coalfield. Part II, containing Chapters 6 to 10, inclusive, deals with the response of the businessmen to the failure of their Wollongong Harbour policy. Initially demoralised and confused, they soon formulated a new variant of their policy&#8212;a railway linking the coalfield with Sydney Harbour, 50 miles to the north. This was a vastly more expensive proposition than a small coal port located in Wollongong. At first it attracted no support from government, which prompted the businessmen to sound out investors in Sydney with a view to forming a private company which would build and operate the Line.

Kynurenine, for example, undergoes deamination at physiological pH, and the product binds covalently to the nucleophilic residues in protein via a Michael addition. Key sites of kynurenine modification in human lens proteins include cysteine, histidine and lysine residues. The factors determining the levels of Kyn-amino acid adducts in vivo are not known. An aim of this study was to determine the rate of reaction of Kyn with nucleophilic amino acids (His, Cys and Lys) under physiological conditions (pH 7.2, 37&#176;C) and to evaluate the stability of the Kyn-amino acid adducts under these conditions. Kinetic and stability studies were performed using both free amino acids and modified calf lens protein, and reactions analysed by high performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Kinetic studies using free amino acids revealed that Cys reacted with Kyn at approximately three times the rate of His and four times the rate of Lys. Kyn-t-Boc-His was found to be the most stable of all the Kyn-amino acid adducts under physiological conditions, followed by Kyn-t-Boc-Cys and Kyn-t-Boc-Lys. Kyn-t-Boc-Lys and Kyn-Cys decomposed under physiological conditions, releasing deaminated Kyn. Kyn-Cys was the least stable of the Kyn-amino acid adducts. Incubation of Kyn-Cys in the presence of excess of t-Boc-L-His resulted in a decrease in Kyn-Cys and a corresponding increase in Kyn-t-Boc-His, due to the transfer of deaminated Kyn. Addition of a t-Boc group to the &#61665;-amino group of Cys increased the stability of the Kyn-Cys adduct by a factor of three. Oxidation of Kyn-t-Boc-Cys to a sulfoxide derivative decreased the stability by a factor of three. Kinetic studies performed with calf lens protein incubated with Kyn showed that Cys was the preferred site of Kyn modification, followed by His and Lys, repectively. Following 14 days of incubation, Kyn-Cys was present at 12- and 17-fold greater levels than Kyn-His and Kyn-Lys. Protein-bound Kyn-Cys appeared more stable than the free Kyn-Cys adduct and was similar in stability to the free Kyn-t-Boc-Cys adduct. Under these conditions, protein-bound Kyn-His levels increased by 38%, whereas Kyn-Lys decreased by 28% with incubation time. Protein-bound Kyn-Lys was also relatively more stable compared the free Kyn-amino acid adduct. Both the free amino acid and calf lens protein studies confirmed that Cys was the best nucleophile at physiological pH, followed by His and Lys. Kyn-His, however, was the most stable modification. The final pattern of Kyn-modification was shown to be a factor of amino acid reactivity and stability rather than amino acid abundance. Another aim of this study was to explore the hypothesis that protein-bound Kyn is oxidised in the cataractous lens, as the levels of Kyn-His and Kyn-Lys decrease by a factor of 4 with increasing severity of age-related nuclear (ARN) cataract. Model studies were performed in which Kyn-t-Boc-His and Kyn-t-Boc-Lys were incubated in the presence of an equimolar concentration of hydrogen peroxide. These studies showed that hydrogen peroxide did not affect the decomposition of either adduct under physiological conditions, suggesting that decomposition of these species in the cataractous lens may be the result of other factors, for example, stronger oxidising agents. The final aim of this study was to investigate the photochemistry of proteinbound Kyn. Previous studies have shown that Kyn, when free in solution, is an inefficient sensitizer of oxidative damage. However, the photochemistry of proteinbound UV filter molecules has not been investigated and this may be of significance, especially for the older human lens, as a result of the decline in free Kyn and an increase in the bound form. Lens proteins covalently modified with kynurenine were susceptible to photooxidation by wavelengths of light that penetrate the cornea (UVA light &#955;&gt;305, &gt;345 and &gt;385 nm). These wavelengths were chosen because light in the 300-400 nm band are absorbed by the lens. Hydrogen peroxide and protein-bound peroxides were found to accumulate in a time-dependent manner after exposure to UV light (&#955; 305-385 nm), with shorter wavelength light generating more peroxides. Peroxide formation was accompanied by increases in the levels of protein-bound tyrosine oxidation products dityrosine and 3,4- ihydroxyphenylalanine, species known to be elevated in human cataract lens proteins. Experiments using D2O, which enhances the lifetime of singlet oxygen, and azide, a potent scavenger of this species, are consistent with oxidation being mediated by singlet oxygen. These findings provide a mechanistic explanation of UV light-mediated protein oxidation in cataract lenses, and also rationalise the occurrence of age-related cataract in the nuclear region of the lens, as modification of lens protein by UV filters occurs primarily in this region.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/142</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study into the effects of fission-fragment damage on activation energies in AG/Bi2223 tapes</field><field name="creator">Marinaro, Dami&#225;n</field><field name="description">Ag/Bi-2223 tapes doped with small quantities of highly enriched uranium were prepared by the powder-in-tube process and irradiated with thermal neutrons. The resulting fission fragments create randomly splayed quasi-columnar defects that provide strong flux pinning. Significant improvements in the field and angular dependence of the critical current density and in the irreversibility field were observed at 77 K, increasing with the density of fission tracks. In tapes with equivalent fission track density, the observed increases are larger for the samples exposed to larger neutron fluences (where a lower uranium doping level requires higher neutron fluence to obtain the same fission track density). This is explained as a result of the formation of secondary uranium-containing phases physically separated from the Bi2223 phase above a solubility limit to the uranium doping. An unusual exponential dependence of Hirr on the density of tracks was also observed, unrelated to the secondary phase formation. The primary investigation concerns the activation energies for vortex motion in the thermally activated flux flow and flux creep regimes, probed via resistive transition and dynamic magnetic relaxation measurements, which had not been previously explored. Both methods demonstrate the dominance of the fission tracks in the pinning landscape, particularly in fields applied parallel to the c-axis. Linearity in an Arrhenius plot of the superconductor resistance against temperature over at least three orders of magnitude indicated thermally activated flux motion in tapes with and without fission damage. In fields applied parallel to the c-axis, the pinning energy was substantially increased by the fission tracks, U0 tripling in magnitude at &#956;0H ~ 0.3 T, and then reconverging with the pre-irradiation U0 for &#956;0H &gt; 2 T. This behaviour of the activation energy is well described by an effective matching field Beff ~ 0.3 T, identified at the maximum in the relative change of U0 and also observed from changes in the behaviour of the resistively determined irreversibility field. This Beff is lower than the matching field B&#966; ~ 2.1 T estimated from the fission track density. Dynamic magnetic relaxation measurements were analysed using a modified form of Maley's method [M. P. Maley et al., Phys. Rev. B 42, p2639 (1990)]. This method was modified by using an empirically determined temperature scaling to resolve the current density dependence of the effective activation energy Ueff(J,H,T0) in the flux creep regime from different isothermal data points, over a wide range of temperatures and values of J. Correlated changes in the empirical temperature scaling form U(T), an additive constant C, a fitting parameter &#956; and the divergent behaviour of Ueff as J &#8594; 0 are all consistent with a dimensional crossover from 3D elastic to 2D plastic creep at fields &#956;0H &#8776; 0.37 T in a nonirradiated tape. The dimensional crossover was shifted to higher fields &#956;0H &#8776; 0.65 T after the introduction of fission-fragment damage, interpreted as evidence that the randomly splayed quasi-columnar defects promote c-axis vortex correlation in the Ag/Bi2223 tapes. Analysis of the relaxation data without the additional temperature scaling modification, on the other hand, produced a conflicting result, implying the complete destruction of c-axis vortex correlation over the entire field range explored. This observation is inconsistent with measurements of the current &#8211; voltage characteristics. Together with the unreasonable values of C obtained by this analysis and in comparison to the consistency observed with the empirically determined temperature scaling modification, the results indicate that the inclusion of the empirical temperature scaling is essential to an analysis of relaxation data. In comparison to past studies, we conclude that the efficiency of the uranium-fission method in enhancing the flux pinning is strongly dependent on the material anisotropy, through the vortex line elasticity and dimensionality, which hence affect the vortex line accommodation to the splayed defects. This has significant consequences for the estimation of B&#966; in materials with differing anisotropy. The present method of calculating B&#966; directly from the fission track density multiplied by the average defect track length is an oversimplification, which does not take into account the finite elasticity of the flux lines as well as the anisotropy of the vortex system.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/324</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Widdershins and annotations</field><field name="creator">Lunn, Richard</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/962</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Phytoplankton diversity and ecology in estuaries of southeastern NSW, Australia</field><field name="creator">Liu, Dongyan</field><field name="description">Phytoplankton, as one of the most important primary producers in aquatic ecosystems, have been widely used to indicate the health of such ecosystems, but they are a poorly understood component of coastal plant communities in Australia. The primary objective of this study was to address a number of gaps in the current knowledge of phytoplankton in the estuaries of southeastern Australia.An extensive literature review on phytoplankton diversity and ecology in the estuaries of Australia was conducted to identify knowledge gaps. There are more than 130 estuaries in New South Wales, Australia (NSW), but almost no single set of comprehensive information on phytoplankton taxonomy has been established, and very few studies on the seasonal and annual patterns of phytoplankton distribution have been carried out. The thresholds or standards to assess the changes of aquatic environments using phytoplankton are therefore difficult to establish, even though an increasing number of bloom events indicates an urgent need to monitor the dynamics of phytoplankton assemblages. Thus, seven representative estuaries, which cover about 400 km of the southeastern NSW coast, were chosen for study of the general characteristics of phytoplankton diversity and ecology. A more detailed comparative study of the phytoplankton assemblages in two lakes with different nutrient status and a historical study of environmental change using diatom frustules in sediments of one lake as indicators were also completed. In addition, the growth of key species was studied to explore the governing environmental factors.In the seven estuaries, 145 phytoplankton species were identified, covering five groups - Cyanophyta, Chlorophyta, Chromophyta, Diatom and Pyrrophyta. Diatom and Pyrrophyta species were the main contributors to the phytoplankton diversity.  Phytoplankton assemblages were characterized by a large number of temperate water species combined with a smaller number of warm water species, reflecting the warm temperate climate in the studied areas. The proportions of brackish and freshwater to brackish species corresponded to the gradient of salinity in the estuaries. A combination of euplanktonic, tychoplanktonic, epiphytic and periphytic species was observed in the phytoplankton assemblages, which was related to specific estuarine habitats. The seasonal patterns of phytoplankton biomass displayed winter or spring maxima, and a positive relationship with the nutrient levels in the studied estuaries. The horizontal distribution of phytoplankton assemblages within each lake can be significantly impacted by seagrass beds or large freshwater discharges caused.A more detailed comparison of the phytoplankton assemblages between a heavily impacted lake (Lake Illawarra) and a less impacted lake (Burrill Lake), was completed, based on the bimonthly observations from April 2005 to April 2007. Lake Illawarra displayed higher DIN and DIP concentrations compared to Burrill Lake, particularly the DIP concentration. The former was characterized by a marked N-limitation condition, while the later displayed variable DIN:DIP ratios. Diatoms were the main dominant species in Lake Illawarra, combined with a limited dinoflagellate dominance in some seasons. In contrast, dinoflagellates dominated in Burrill Lake in most seasons. The proportion of toxic and red tide species in Burrill Lake was notably higher compared to Lake Illawarra. The different nutrient ratios between the two lakes were regarded as an important controlling factor. The seasonal succession of phytoplankton in the two lakes did not completely follow a spring maximum that is generally observed in temperate waters. In Burrill Lake, phytoplankton biomass increased from autumn and reached the maximum in winter, while the maxima in Lake Illawarra could occur in autumn, winter and spring. Factors influencing the seasonal maximum include nutrient concentrations and ratios, temperate and grazing pressure. In addition, seagrass beds significantly impacted the horizontal distribution of phytoplankton assemblages within lakes.Long-term environmental changes that have occurred in Lake Illawarra were investigated using dated (210Pb and 137Cs) sediment core studies. The diatom frustules deposited in the sediment post-World War II were analyzed along with the chronology.  The results indicated that significant changes had occurred in the phytoplankton communities in the lake over the past 60 years. There was evidence of increasing eutrophication through changes in diatom concentrations and the ratio of planktonic:benthic diatoms, and also of increasing salinity supported by the development of marine planktonic diatoms and a decrease of freshwater and brackish water species.Growth characteristics of two key phytoplankton species, Prorocentrum lima and Thalassionema nitzschioides isolated from Lake Illawarra, representing key dinoflagellate and diatom species, respectively, were studied. Their life strategies under the different nutrient and temperature conditions were compared. P. lima displayed a higher temperature preference and greater nutrient demand in contrast to Th. nitzschioides with a lower temperature preference and nutrient demand.  N-limitation can significantly impact the growth of P. lima because of its K-strategy preferring to utilize all available nutrients in a short time, and then ceasing growth.  The growth of Th. nitzschioides displayed less impact under N-limitation because of the preferred r-strategy which uses the nutrient in a more sustainable manner. In competitive experiments, P. lima displayed a great dominance in the f/2 enriched medium compared to the Th. nitzschioides at both 18 and 25&#186;C. In the N-limitation condition, Th. nitzschioides displayed dominance at 18&#186;C. Two explanations are suggested to explain these results. One is that the different strategies of two species to the nutrient uptake and temperature preference played important roles in determining their competitive ability. The other is that an allelopathic substance reported to be produced by P. lima could inhibit the growth of Th. nitzschioides.This research has provided important new information to assist understanding the characteristics of phytoplankton assemblages in estuaries of southeastern NSW. The indicative role of phytoplankton in estuaries was assessed and linked to the relevant physical and chemical factors, human activities and climate change. The need for further research and the application of phytoplankton studies in the environmental management has also been highlighted.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/827</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quality teaching and its characteristics</field><field name="creator">Warren, Stanley</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/975</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teacher education and teacher competencies: a study of how a model of teacher competencies could inform pre-service primary teacher education in Sri Lanka</field><field name="creator">Perera, Sarath</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/976</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The rise of China as a regional maritime power: strategic implications for a new century</field><field name="creator">Rahman, Christopher</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/991</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An empirical investigation of the quality of disclosure in corporate financial reports in developing countries: the case of Iran</field><field name="creator">Mirshekary, Soheila</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1014</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of accounting concepts and practices in Islamic banks: the cases of Bank Islam Malaysia Berhad and Bank Muamalat Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Adnan, Muhammad Akhyar</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1015</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Patterns of management control in a family managed business in an emerging economy: the case of Dilmah tea in Sri Lanka</field><field name="creator">Herath, Siriyama Kanthi</field><field name="description">This study is concerned with the patterns of management control existing in a family controlled tea exporting company in Sri Lanka, Ceylon Tea Services Ltd (Dilmah).

The Federation is one of the largest unions in New South Wales and as an affiliate of the Australian Teachers' Federation, is part of one of the largest industrial organisations of employees in Australia. The period under review was a time of significant economic, political and social change, both in Australia and internationally. This thesis examines the Federation's response to those changes and its attempts to influence the direction of those changes. It seeks to identify the changes within the union and the degree of continuity in the union's experience during the whole of the period under discussion. Previous work on the Federation has not dealt with this particular period of its history in any comprehensive way.The thesis is informed by, and in part endeavours to make a contribution to, the debates about the role teachers and their organisations play in a capitalist society. It examines the activity of the Federation as an organisation of employees of the State. It discusses the constraints operating upon teachers as State employees. It traces the sometimes contradictory influence of the ideology of professionalism, in its various forms, upon the attitudes and behaviour of teacher unionists. It considers the difficulties which can arise from teachers' contradictory position as both wage earners and professionals. The thesis endeavours to make some contribution to the task of identifying the class position, class location and the degree of class consciousness of teachers as unionists.The primary material on which this thesis is based is taken, for the most part, from the extensive archives and publications of the Federation itself. The author has had unrestricted access to this material. It has been supplemented by material of an official nature such as government education reports and by contemporary newspapers that have devoted a considerable amount of space to the activities of teachers' unions and to education generally. Interviews with persons involved in the union during the period under review, brought differing perspectives to the information and differing insights from those gleaned from the written sources. For the most part, however, the argument of the thesis is derived from the written sources.The work examines the policies, and particularly the methods, adopted by the Federation in the period under review. It traces the process of transformation from a concept of 'united action' which did not include resort to strike action, and which was largely determined by the central decision-making bodies of the union, to action initiated by local units and vanguard elements of the union and which often involved strike action. The movement towards the use of strike action as an industrial tactic is examined, together with the implications of the use of that tactic for the internal operations and politics of the union. It also considers the consequences of the use of strike action for the union's relationship with various authorities of the State.Indeed the 1968 strike, the first in Federation history, is the pivotal point both of the narrative and the argument of the thesis. Much of the thesis is developed chronologically. There are, however, important exceptions to this approach. Two chapters discuss the Federation's federal funding campaigns. Another two chapters deal with the background to the period under discussion and the wider social, political and economic context in which the Federation operated. There is also a chapter which discusses changes in the structure and operation of the union in the 1960s.Chapter one deals with the context in which the union operated in the 1940s and early 1950s, as well as giving some background to the internal structure and politics of the organization in this period. The second chapter examines the Federation's federal funding campaign, particularly the attempt to build a broadly-based united front by the mobilisation of arguments about the role of education in economic, scientific and technological development.Chapter three discusses the Federation's campaign for the reform of secondary education. The next chapter analyses the role that the union's Education Commission policy played in providing a central focus for the activities of the Federation in the first half of the 1960s.Chapter five analyses the various constituent elements within the union and the changes that took place within the organisation during the 1960s. The objective of this chapter is to explain what constituted, both 'unity' and acceptable 'action' within the traditional Federation concept of 'united action&#8217;. This is followed by a chapter which sets out the broader economic, social and political framework in which the union operated in the late 1960s and in the first half of the 1970s. Chapter seven is the second chapter on the federal funding issue, covering the period 1967 to 1975.Chapter eight examines the changes within the teaching service and within the union itself which contributed to the resort to strike action in 1968. The next two chapters deal with the consequences of that action for the union's relationship with the State authorities. They also examine the related struggle within the union between those who desired to maintain the maximum degree of central control and those elements that demanded greater autonomy from the centre in the ordering of the campaign priorities of the union.The last chapter covers the period of the new leadership which emerged victorious from the internecine warfare of the late 1960s and early 1970s. It analyses whether this period constituted a 'new era' in Federation history fundamentally different from the period preceding it. The work concludes that important changes took place within the union which, in turn, had a significant effect on the union's relationships with the State. It also suggests, however, that these changes had not, in any fundamental way, swept away the constraints placed upon teachers as employees of the State. It also concludes that the ideology of professionalism, although weakened and redefined in the interests of the union rather than the employer, still prevented teachers from identifying themselves as an integral part of the working class in its continuing struggle with Capital and the State. In the period 1957 to 1975 there had been much change, but nevertheless significant continuity, in the history of the New South Wales Teachers' Federation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1428</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Topics in population dynamics</field><field name="creator">Winley, Graham Kenneth</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1565</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using uncertainty functions: comparison of experiments</field><field name="creator">Donegan, Kevin Joseph</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1566</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Applications of artificial intelligence for quality control at hot strip mills</field><field name="creator">Xianogang, Xianogang</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1571</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimising alumina feeders in aluminium smelting pots</field><field name="creator">Kissane, J.

A conceptual model for this study. The Relocation Adaptation Model (RA), was derived from both empirical and conceptual literature on social gerontology.The study population was randomly selected from the more cognitively able nursing home residents. A combination of methodologies was used to collect the data necessary to make comparisons over a 17 week time period. Three recognised instruments were used: the General Health Questionnairre-20, The Affectometer 2 and the Katz Index of Activities Of Daily Living. Other instruments were developed by the researcher to collect relevant data. An audit of participant's records was included. Guided interviews were also carried out. The study found that the quality of life of residents in a nursing home is effected following a forced interinstitutional relocation and that the level of medication useage by participants may have been a significant factor in the response to the relocation.Few mass relocations of nursing home residents have taken place in Australia. These will increase as existing nursing home buildings age and deteriorate. This study is unique. The researcher believes it is the only Australian study of this nature to have been carried out.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1615</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Radiative transfer in Australian sub-tropical rainforest stands</field><field name="creator">Harper, Barry Malcolm</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1633</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The excitation and fano resonance spectra of some acceptors in silicon and germanium</field><field name="creator">Piao, Gejin</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1637</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study into the use of and need for healthcare services, for HIV infected people, from diagnosis until death</field><field name="creator">Jamieson, Margaret I.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1701</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nutritional assessment of patients with type 1 Diabetes Mellitus</field><field name="creator">Tahbaz, Farideh</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1704</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Postnatal depression: prevalence, prediction and preventive intervention randomised trial</field><field name="creator">Stamp, Georgina E.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1705</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The deskilling of registered nurses: the social transformation of nursing work in a New South Wales hospital, 1970-1990</field><field name="creator">Herdman, Elizabeth</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1729</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Administrative colonialism: district administration and colonial 'middle management' in Kelantan 1909-1919 and the Eastern Highlands of Papua New Guinea 1947-1957</field><field name="creator">Hawksley, Charles Michael</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1732</field></doc><doc><field name="title">At the ends of the world: apocalypse and Australian speculative fiction</field><field name="creator">Weaver, Roslyn</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1733</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The migration of academic professionals from Northeast Asia to Australia: a survey comparing academic immigrants from China, Hong Kong and Taiwan</field><field name="creator">Yaghoubi Hargalan, Samad</field><field name="description">In recent years, highly skilled migrants have represented an important component of global migration streams. This research is a comparative study of the migration of academic professionals from China, Hong Kong and Taiwan to Australia, a 'nation of immigrants' which receives many highly trained professionals from different parts of the world, especially Asia. The main goal was to analyse the effects of in-system and out-system factors on the emigration process, as well as the effects of facilitating conditions, all as perceived by the academic migrants themselves. An intersystem model of intemational migration was developed, based on Robert K. Merton's theory of 'social structure and anomie'. This comprises the central part of an inclusive analytical model of the emigration decision, which draws on a range of theoretical influences and has descriptive, explanatory and functional dimensions. Quantitative survey methodology was used to measure the impressions that the three populations of academic migrants had of the various subsystems of both sending and receiving societies, and of other relevant factors and conditions. A questionnaire was developed and disttibuted to academic staff members from the three Northeast Asian countries at seventeen Australian universities, resulting in 177 responses. The survey results vindicated the multifaceted analytical model employed, providing an understanding of academic migration as a multi-dimensional phenomenon. Given the historical and cultural similarities among the source countties, it is apparent that most of the factors studied influenced all three groups to some degree, but the balance differed notably from one to another, according to the type of society. Thus the migration to Austtalia of academics from the People's Republic of China was affected mainly by economic and political factors. In the emigration of academic professionals from Hong Kong, political factors played a more significant role than others, while in the case of Taiwan the survey respondents gave priority to environmental and some educational considerations. The results also show that the effects of 'pull' factors were viewed as more important than those of 'push' factors in the migration process. However, respondents rated most subsystems of Australian society less highly on the basis of their experiences after migration than their recalled expectations suggested. The thesis fmishes with a few general policy recommendations. These are directed at governments, policy makers and socio-economic planners in both migrant-sending and migrant-receiving systems.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language"

Low grade boron powders are attractive because of their low cost, but produced lower surface reactivity and larger particle size than high purity (99%) amorphous boron powder, indicating that the low grade powders cannot be used to achieve the same superconducting properties as those of samples made from pure 99% boron powder. However, the low purity boron powders can be improved by using simple physical and chemical processes, leading to enhanced magnetic critical current density, Jc. In order to get high performance MgB2, it is obviously important to control the phase composition and microstructure of the boron starting powders and the solid state reaction conditions.Ball milling is an effective method to reduce the boron particle size, so, the effects of ball milling boron powders in different media, such as acetone, ethanol, and toluene, on the superconducting properties of MgB2 needed to be considered and studied. It was observed that toluene was the most effective medium of them all for enhancing Jc. Jc was estimated to be 5 &#215; 103 A cm&#8722;2 at 8 T and 5 K for a sample that was ball milled in toluene. This value is much higher than that of the pure MgB2 reference sample that was not ball milled, by a factor of 20. It was considered that ball milling B using toluene leads to smaller MgB2 grains, resulting in enhanced Jc at low operating temperatures and high fields.MgB2 samples were prepared using as-supplied commercial 96% boron with strong crystalline phase and the same 96% boron (B) after ball milling. The effects of the properties of the starting B powder on the superconductivity were evaluated. It was observed that samples using ball-milled 96% B, in comparison with the reference sample made from the as-supplied 96% B, were characterized by small grain size and enhanced magnetic critical current density (Jc), which reached 2 &#215;103 A cm-2 at 5 K and 8 T. The improved pinning seen in these samples seems to be caused by enhanced grain boundary pinning at high field. MgB2 samples were also prepared by using 96% boron powder with strong crystalline phase that had been ball milled for various times. Based on Rowell connectivity analysis, when the ball-milling time increased, the connectivity factor, described as the active cross-sectional area fraction (AF), was decreased. This implies that the inter-grain connectivity became worse. These properties could lead to poor Jc in low field. However, the pinning force strength of samples using ball-milled 96% B is larger than that of the reference sample using as-supplied commercial 96% B powder. These results accompany enhanced irreversibility (Hirr) and upper critical fields (Hc2).Furthermore, the magnetic field dependence of the transport critical current density (Jct) and the grain connectivity of MgB2/Fe wires fabricated from ball-milled boron have been investigated in detail, and strong correlations have been found, as evidenced by differences in grain size, critical transition temperature, and resistivity. It was observed that the samples fabricated by ball milling had relatively small grain sizes, resulting in a weaker field dependence of the Jct in the high field region. On the other hand, the ballmilled boron was associated with poor connectivity between adjacent grains. It is clearly shown that the observed reduction in low field Jct is related to the reduction in the superconducting area fraction that is reflected by the connectivity factor. Even though high temperature sintering could always compensate for the degradation of the Jct in the low field region, the subsequent grain growth in this case was mainly responsible for the degradation of Jct in the high field region. The strong correlation between the grain size and the connectivity can change the field dependence of the Jct, and both these factors are primarily affected by the sintering temperature and by the presence and extent of ball milling.In the MgB2 field, chemical doping is the most popular way to improve the superconductor properties. It has been reported that significantly enhanced critical current density in MgB2 superconductor could be easily obtained by doping with a hydrocarbon, highly active pyrene (C16H10), while using a sintering temperature as low as 600oC. The processing advantages of the C16H10 additive include production of a highly active carbon (C) source, an increased level of disorder, and the introduction of small grain size, resulting in  enhancement of Jc.Using the same concept, low purity boron powders were used to fabricate pure and submicron-sized carbon sphere doped MgB2 superconductor. The boron powders used showed low reactivity towards MgB2 formation, as compared to high purity (99%) amorphous boron, which might result from the larger grain size and the existence of crystalline boron or boron oxide in the former. However, the samples prepared from this boron powder showed comparable Jc values at 20 K and in low field (&lt;1 T) to those from a sample prepared from 99% amorphous boron. Doping submicron-sized carbon spheres successfully introduced carbon substitution for boron, and so improved the Hc2, Hirr, and in-field Jc properties of the MgB2.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/353</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A physico-chemical investigation of some complexes of iron (III)</field><field name="creator">Ryder, Gregory Allan</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/889</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric studies of shale oil and oil shale from the Rundle deposit, Queensland</field><field name="creator">Regtop, Robert Anthony</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/896</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bestiary</field><field name="creator">Hull, Coral</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/915</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comic images in Taiwanese art: an exploration of abject culture</field><field name="creator">Lee, Chin-Ming</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/920</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Shibboleth &amp; heterodoxy: a comparative study of trends and belief in contemporary and traditional ceramic art</field><field name="creator">Peascod, Alan</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/929</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Osmoregulation in xerotolerant and not-tolerant yeasts</field><field name="creator">Edgley, Margaret Ann</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1069</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis and characterization of chiral monomers and polymers [manusctipt]</field><field name="creator">Ashraf, Syed Aziz</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1187</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of a generic electrochemical sensing system for ion chromatography</field><field name="creator">Ongarato, Daniela Maria</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1201</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of conducting polymer based sensors</field><field name="creator">Lu, Wen</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1202</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of novel carbazole-based peptoid antibacterials to challenge the deadly superbugs</field><field name="creator">Witchard, Helen M.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1203</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sulphide mineralization and host rocks of the Kangiara region, New South Wales</field><field name="creator">Roberts, Frederick Ivor</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1411</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The late Permian shoshonitic province of the souther Sydney Basin</field><field name="creator">Carr, Paul F.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1416</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Labour and politics in New South Wales, 1880-1900</field><field name="creator">Markey, Raymond A</field><field name="description">This thesis studies the motivation and nature of working class mobilization from which the New South Wales Labor Party emerged in the 1890s, and the nature of that Party. It concentrates, in particular, upon the relationship between trade unions and the Labor Party, and the relationship between the Party leadership and its rank and file. The thesis is divided into three parts.Part I ' Social and Industrial Structure' considers the material basis of working class mobilization. It examines the working and living conditions of the basic groups within the working class: urban workers, rural workers, coal and metal miners, and transport workers (marine and railway). For all of these groups, working and living conditions commonly fell short of colonial expectations of prosperity during the great economic boom from the 1860s to 1890. In many cases, working and living conditions actually declined in the 1880s. Furthermore, the opportunities for social advancement to independence from wage earning, which had been a powerful aspect of colonial expectations, were declining for most of these groups by the end of the 1880s. These trends were the result of economic problems in major industries, of economic restructuring from primary industry and building towards more large-scale manufacturing industry, and of related changes in productive organisation and workforce structure.Part II, 'Labour Organization', analyzes the organizational response of the vvorking class. Trade unionism spread rapidly amongst semi and unskilled workers in the 1880s. It was also characterized by a heightened degree of class consciousness and joint organization which saw the Trades and Labour Council develop class leadership. Closer, and more militant, organization also occurred amongst important employers' groups. On the union side, these changes have been associated with the 'new unionism' of the shearers and miners. But it is argued here that the urban unions, especially the crafts, led in these developments, largely because of the changes in their work experience.The decimation of the unions in the depression and great strikes of the 1890's, together with the hostile role of the state, hastened the unions' organization of the Labor Party. However, during 1892-5 the urban unions lost control of the Party to a coalition of Utopian socialist intelligentsia and the Shearers'Union (AWU), which delivered a large number of country Parliamentary seats to the Party.This new leadership marked a change in the participatory democratic and collectivist nature of working class organization, which had been evident in the nature of union government, the growth of co-operatives, and the spontaneous outgrowth of municipal political organization. The Labor Party moved, towards a more centralized form of organization, which emphasized a moderate Parliamentary strategy.This change was reflected in Labor policy and ideology, the subject of Part III. As the new leadership consolidated itself, the emphasis on a class-bdsed Party, with a social democratic policy of political reform and industrial legislation, shifted towards a populist Party, despite a short-lived challenge by socialists. Labor's populism derived from an electoral strategy aimed at ' intermediate social strata' as well as the working class, and from the dominant role of the AWU in the Party. The significance of the AWU in this regard was that it was dominated by small landholders. Populism, therefore, was mainly responsible for the 'Laborist' policy which emerged at the end of the 1890s, and which concentrated on arbitration. White Australia, land reform, and a limited state welfare apparatus. As an ideology, 'Laborism' assumed the neutrality of the state apparatus. With this ideological basis and policy, the Labor Party became the vehicle for the deliverance of the working class to a National Settlement between the classes in the new Commonwealth, after the most intensive class conflict Australia had ever experienced.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1423</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The precipitation hardening response of copper bearing HSLA steels</field><field name="creator">Cabello, Azucena Perez</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1532</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The rheology of a composite polymer ceramic plastic refractory</field><field name="creator">Wells, Lisa</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1533</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transformation characteristics and structure-property relationships for a copper bearing HSLA steel</field><field name="creator">Ghasemi Banadkouki, Seyed Sadegh</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1535</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Velocity distribution of single phase fluid flow in packed beds</field><field name="creator">Subagyo,</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1537</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chebyshev polynomials in the solution of ordinary and partial differential equations</field><field name="creator">Horner, T.

This thesis examines features of these representations&#8212;the role of the journey, the portrayal of women's labour, the role of the swagman and of madness, the representation of motherhood, mateship and marriage, the scope and role of the imagination, and narratives of community&#8212;in there historical context. Using this analysis the thesis shows how the process of national cultural imagination was in part shaped by the experience at the time of both modernisation in public and domestic life, and change and contestation in the gender order.Bush mythology frequently employed the notion of the masculine journey as an image of nation formation. The journey was used to represent a quest for nationhood which was to be achieved through the domestication of the land in the name of 'Australia'. The end of the journey&#8212;frequently figured as the return to the interior space of the home&#8212;was associated with the achievement of maturity on the part of both the traveler and the nation. Whilst men might embark on such journeys, female maturity was usually represented as a move into the home. This move, which appeared to take women out of the nation-space, testifies to the difficulty at the time of bringing men and women together into an imagined Australian national community.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1928</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Global telerobotics: interfacing on the World Wide Web</field><field name="creator">Hartfiel, Susan Christina</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2578</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The plastic behaviour of sheet metal in biaxial tension testing</field><field name="creator">Hogg, Neil M.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2586</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Size segregation in filling and emptying of a Paul-Wurth bin</field><field name="creator">Kilic, Ali</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2587</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of the kinetics of reduction of tin ore/Auschar composites</field><field name="creator">Zou, Rui Ping</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2588</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of air bubble size distribution on the flotation rate of complex ore in a froth flotation column</field><field name="creator">Igusti-Ngurah, Ardha</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2589</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genocide: a ceramic representation and documentary study of the impact of colonisation on the Australian Aboriginals</field><field name="creator">Counsel, Paul</field><field name="description">The work presented in this submission deals with the impact of colonisation on the Australian Aboriginals, it is presented in two parts, one a written dissertation, the other an exhibition of ceramic art. Using both aspects, I investigate the relationship between Aboriginal and white societies, both in an historical and present day context, and claim that this relationship constitutes genocide.This narrative is not written from a straight historical point of view, in that I do not look at different areas, States, times, individuals and policies to evaluate similarities and differences. Rather, it is a personal statement written by an artist. There is no attempt to create a smooth myth in the way that much of Australia's history has previously been addressed.In this investigation, I have applied Raphael Lempkin's definition of genocide, to events and practices which have taken place since the colonisation of Australia. I have structured the document around the United Nation's Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. In the presentation of the art work, I have used clay and corroded steel metaphorically to represent Aboriginal and white societies respectively. The resultant juxtaposition of these materials alludes to certain events and practices as described in the research. My greatest concern is that our history has been prejudiced by ideals and assumptions, which lay at the foundations of our ways of thinking. Aboriginal people continue to suffer the results of this legacy. It is my belief that these ideals need to be reassessed and that we need to change the way we remember our past.

The thesis breaks with the established traditions in the history, philosophy and sociology of sciences by attempting to capture both the cognitive and social dimensions of institutionalisation in one unified analysis. This unification has been achieved through a treatment of research as goal directed social action. This theme has been developed both theoretically and empirically.Theoretically, the thesis draws on a range of sources but the main inspiration has been the phenomenologically inspired work of Alfred Schutz - particularly as explicated by Thomas Luckmann and Peter Berger. The theory that has been developed has been supported by two case studies of Australian researchers - a group of physicists involved with the inspiration and development of an economically viable thermally based solar energy array, and a group of neuropharmacologists investigating aspects of chemical transmission systems in the human brain and their relationship to schizophrenia.The case material involves aspects of both structure and process in the life worlds of physical scientists. These aspects have been explored in considerable detail through the development of a system of eighteen related hypotheses. The overall picture of the physical sciences that is presented though, is one of structured sub-universes of meaning constituted through the actions of professionalised scientific workers.Scientific research is portrayed as a highly social process with researchers working together as part of research programs. Research programs are defined as the primary locus of productive activity and are constituted through the (typically) collective activities of a group of research workers who share a commitment to particular research practices and techniques, who are directed in their research towards a shared set of goals, and who share, to some extent, a common stock of specialised knowledge.The sub-universe of the research program is not without its conflicts and discontinuities, however. Researchers were observed to alternate between contexts of research and contexts of legitimation, which in the case of the solar energy researchers was a highly institutionalised separation of structures of relevance. This movement between contexts was in some cases associated with the experience of conflict in which scientists at times, found themselves in double bind situations where the demands of a more inwardly directed professionalism competed with demands of social relevance.The scientific research described in the case studies was predominantly instrumental by virtue of being more highly directed towards technical goals and the means for their realisation than towards questions about the value of these goals. It is suggested that this instrumental ism is typical of all of the contemporary physical sciences.The field work conducted in the course of the thesis involved the innovation of a method of "repeated feedback". In this method research accounts were generated through an iterative process which relied on the scientists to check and up-date a series of descriptions of their research. These descriptions were based on open ended interviews, questionnaire responses and non-formal interaction. Insofar as the method can be used to prevent unintended discrepancies between a sociologist's impressions of scientists' research and scientists' understandings, the method is particularly useful for the generation of accurate research accounts.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1731</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The social shaping of wind power in Australia</field><field name="creator">Bunting, Andrea Maree</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2073</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A temperature-dependent study of radiation-phonon field coupling in microwave-heated engineering ceramics</field><field name="creator">Donnan, Robert S.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2081</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The forming of foaming slag in electric arc furnace injection of coke breeze and rearrangement of melting procedure</field><field name="creator">Atmosumarto, Kuswanto</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2504</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of a formal network planning process for the military tactical environment</field><field name="creator">Peterson, Tracey Lea</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2575</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Broadband delivery: an investigation of the underlying technologies and the merging interests of Australian telecommunications carriers and service providers in promoting broadband services</field><field name="creator">Savanis, Michael</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2576</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The characterisation and leaching behaviour of coal washery tailings</field><field name="creator">McGlinn, Peter</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2649</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of finishing temperature and soaking of the coke in the oven upon the microstructure and strength of metallurgical coke</field><field name="creator">Gadsden, W.

Globalization, technology advancement and free markets with minimal government interference have contributed to uncertainty in the Australian labour market that has posed risks in employment. An ethos of equality in educational opportunities for all and job insecurity has led to growing numbers of mature age students entering Australian universities in recent years.The main purpose of this research is to explore why mature age students enter university after working for several years. In addition, the experiences of these students as they study at university as well as their perceptions about higher education in relation to employment are examined. A qualitative, narrative inquiry was employed to investigate the integration of higher education and career development among mature age students. Five mature age students from a range of faculties in the University of Gold Coast participated in the study. Face-to-face interviews, email discussions and document reviews provide the consistency of evidence across sources of data. The five stories with a thick description of the participants&#8217; experiences ensured the credibility of the research findings of the study.  The outcome of the study illustrates that these mature age students believed that higher education could provide them with opportunities that could transform their lives. Engaging in higher education allowed them to pursue goals that would make them feel happy, fulfilled and empowered while meeting a range of social commitments. Most importantly, they developed a sense of agency after they succeeded through a very difficult process and grew in confidence. However, their anxiety for the future was not totally removed due to the expected gap between higher education and the labour market. The study overall provides insights and guidelines for learning and career development of mature age students, and this will benefit both mature age students and higher education institutions. The major implications for universities from this study is they need to recognize mature age students as a special group and this means that their demands for career services, entry pathways to higher education and work-base learning are different from younger age students. For mature age students, they need to positively take advantage of the valuable resources of their rich life and work experience in the uncertain labour market.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3049</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of local government in the conservation of biodiversity</field><field name="creator">Kelly, Andrew Harley Heron</field><field name="description">This thesis comprises a critical review of the role of Local Government in the conservation of biological diversity (or &#8216;biodiversity&#8217;). Whilst the vast majority of the text relates to NSW, much of the broader commentary may extend to other Australian jurisdictions. The nub of the thesis is that despite the rhetoric in key documents &#8211; including the National Strategy for the Conservation of Australia&#8217;s Biological Diversity, the NSW Biodiversity Strategy, the National Local Government Biodiversity Strategy and various plans and policies made at the municipal level &#8211; the outlook is grim without fundamental policy, legal and fiscal change. The topic is huge but crucial to any person concerned about the mammoth decline of biodiversity in Australia. Whilst being intrinsically transdisciplinary in nature, the thesis attempts to contribute to the &#8216;new production of knowledge&#8217;.&#185; It raises issues, problems, ideas and recommendations. The work is based on: &#8226; A literary search until 2001. The long gap between this date and thesis submission is due to a severe illness suffered by the author, which arose in late Dec 2001.&#178; &#8226; Empirical research into: o nine 1998/1999 &#8216;state of environment&#8217; reports prepared for by councils located roughly in or around the &#8216;NSW South-western Slopes&#8217; bioregion that is recognised for the extremely limited extent of remnant native vegetation; o conservation related clauses in all gazetted &#8216;comprehensive&#8217; Local Environmental Plans - i.e. those applying to entire Local Government areas - prepared by councils between 1995 and 2000 inclusively and which remain in force; &#8226; Personal discussion with various officials and onlookers directly involved in, or concerned about, biodiversity conservation at the municipal level. Brief summaries of each chapter are provided herein. The introduction initiates discussion on (i) the meaning of &#8216;biodiversity&#8217;, including its shift from a scientific concept to a populist expression, (ii) the position of councils in Australian government and (iii) the significance of biodiversity conservation at the local sphere. It also introduces two related concepts that are met throughout the thesis, which arguably erode council conservation capability: Local Government&#8217;s &#8216;historical and cultural baggage&#8217; and the &#8216;ratepayer ideology&#8217;. The following three chapters provide the &#8216;historical and institutional&#8217; context. Chapter Two focuses on changing societal perspectives towards the biophysical environment, together with resultant statutory and environmental trends that have paralleled the advancement of Local Government. Chapter Three traces the history of NSW Local Government, demonstrating its entrenchment in the political landscape. It examines major changes, especially functional expansion and managerial reform. Chapter Four scrutinises a particular aspect of municipal experience, namely top-down and bottom-up cooperation between neighbouring councils. This chapter adds consideration of state appointed regional bodies that may arguably sideline Local Government. The regional context is fundamental to environmental management due to the inappropriateness of many council boundaries. The next three chapters concentrate on legislative and financial detail. Chapter Five reviews the Local Government Act 1993 (NSW), which provides wide service powers, limited regulatory opportunity and special requirements for council-owned land. Chapter Six explores the land-use planning system under the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (NSW), especially the ongoing influence of its urban background. It raises the perennial influence of &#8216;developmentalism&#8217; in the determination of applications for development, which directly benefits property interests. Recent statutory change, especially in relation to &#8216;threatened species&#8217; law, may do little more than support informed habitat destruction. A closely related matter is funding, as discussed throughout Chapter Seven. The issue goes beyond insufficiency. It is argued that Local Government&#8217;s primary financial source - i.e. rating, a property tax - works against biodiversity conservation. Not only is there no policy rationale to support rating in the conservation context but the system can provide a &#8216;perverse incentive&#8217; to rural landholders to clear their lands. This problem is exacerbated by the type of valuation and differential rates. The system demands major overhaul, including consideration of increased conditional Commonwealth funding. The following two chapters relate to attitudes towards the biophysical environment that are popular amongst the general community. Chapter Eight considers the provision of vegetated, passive recreational open space whilst Chapter Nine deals with securing and enhancing local amenity. These approaches, however, can be directly inconsistent with biodiversity conservation. Parochial &#8216;green&#8217; desires of local constituents can lead to environmental damage. Notwithstanding this, Chapter Ten provides some impressive examples of Local Government supporting biodiversity conservation. But these are isolated and rely on committed individuals. Whilst the pervasive prospect throughout this thesis is one of gloom, the concluding chapter builds on previous discussion by presenting ideas and recommendations to improve the role of Local Government in conserving biodiversity. It emphasises the need for regional approaches, improved funding mechanisms and fresh visions. Councils with bigger areas, supported by community structures to maintain &#8216;grass roots&#8217; public participation, together with massive change to Local Government funding, may provide a desirable path for municipal reform and retention of Australia&#8217;s precious biodiversity. The law discussed throughout this work stands at 1 Jan 2003. Major changes since then are noted in the Postscript.&#185; See ch 1 at 2.&#178; On 31 Dec 2001, after hospitalisation for 9 days, the author was diagnosed as suffering from a malignant brain tumour, known as astrocytoma. It was removed in 2002, followed by heavy radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and a long period of torpor during which I lived the life a cat, sleeping for over twelve hours per day. I returned to this thesis in July 2002, then spending about 30 minutes per day which expanded over time, and recommenced part-time academic work in 2003. I am now convinced that I have left the cancer behind, being one of the fortunate 20% of astrocytoma sufferers to survive, supported by a medical team of professional excellence.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/386</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Post-war Portuguese migration to the Illawarra</field><field name="creator">Halilovic, Kerrie</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/882</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transformational drama: theatre for community and social change</field><field name="creator">Aitchinson, Bridget Mary</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/943</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Travelling with the Duke</field><field name="creator">Kruse, Anne</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/944</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The benthic macrofauna of pool habitats in temperate coastal streams of the Illawarra, New South Wales: community ecology and response to natural and human induced disturbance</field><field name="creator">Johnstone, Glenn James</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1058</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The behavioural ecology of the gliding marsupial, Petaurus australis</field><field name="creator">Goldingay, Ross Lindsay</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1077</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structure elucidation of alkaloids from Philippine flowering plants</field><field name="creator">Nonato, Maribel G.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1174</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structure-based design and synthesis of small molecule human immunodeficiency virus type 1 integrase inhibitors</field><field name="creator">Gordon, Christopher P.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1175</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tryptophan metabolism and age-related cataract</field><field name="creator">Elderfield, Anthony James</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1212</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The design and implementation of a speech codec for packet switched networks</field><field name="creator">Hall, Stephen Charles</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1352</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Petrological and maturation characteristics of organic matter from the middle proterozoic McArthur Basin, Australia</field><field name="creator">Crick, Ian H.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1399</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards empowerment in liberal democratic society: the developmental consequences of consultative management in the workplace</field><field name="creator">Reglar, Rosemary</field><field name="description">The focus of this thesis is empowerment in contemporary liberal democratic society. It concerns the potential for empowerment through the developmental consequences of employee participation in consultative management. As such it is an expansion of Carole Pateman's thesis that by democratising the authority structure in the workplace, employees will develop a 'democratic personality' characterised by a sense of political efficacy and competence.To test Pateman's claims I study the developmental consequences of employee participation in consultative management. From slow beginnings in the 1970s, some Australian enterprises adopted consultative management as part of a new workplace culture towards the end of the 1980s. Two contrasting enterprises at the cutting edge of this development, namely BHP's Port Kembla Steelworks and a small heavy engineering business WGE are chosen for the study. An analysis of the data drawn from a questionnaire survey, non-participant observation and semi-focused interviews indicates the prerequisites for participation extant in both enterprises and suggests support for Pateman's thesis. The developmental consequences of workplace participation are demonstrated in the learning of intersocial skills and enhanced senses of personal and political efficacy. The developmental consequences are more evident for committee delegates, hitherto unused to discretion in the workplace, than for staff representatives and for those participating in both workplace committees and in voluntary associations outside the workplace. Such suggests additional support for Pateman's claims.But a participatory democracy with its communitarian politics of a substantive concept of the good described by Pateman is at odds with a liberal democratic framework where individual rights and interests are prioritised. Thus it might be expected that the positive developments for worker empowerment might not transcend the workplace boundaries and moreover, might even be negated by the counteracting values of economic rationalism, which characterises the contemporary liberal democratic society, A consideration of such issues cannot simply be inferred from empirical or behavioural studies alone, as at the heart of the problem lies a clash of ontologies. I draw on contemporary theorists Rawls, Skinner, Taylor, Walzer, Gould and Mouffe in order to address these issues and to show how the importance of the individual as a bearer of rights and interests is not necessarily lost when assuming the role of the participant in the public sphere.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field

key learning area</field><field name="creator">Webster, Peter John</field><field name="description">For many years educators have been concerned with the decline of physical education in schools. The concern for physical education has been outlined in articles by Alexander, Taggart and Medland (1993), Blanksby (1995), Crowley (1993), Evans (1993), Hickey (1992), Moore (1994) and Tumbull (1995) and was emphasised by the Senate Report on 'Physical And Sport Education', which was tabled in March 1994. This report made several recommendations that are of particular significance to physical education and the teacher. The recommendations focus on policy formulation, qualification of physical educators, minimum training levels, provision of support networks, the preservicing and inservicing of staff and the professional development of our educators. One of the criticisms of this report is that it is primarily based on anecdotal evidence of what is happening in schools.  Therefore the purpose of this research study is to address this lack of research by investigating teacher perceptions' of physical education within the K-6 PDHPE Key Learning Area (KLA) in New South Wales (NSW) primary schools.The study drew information from a stratified random sample of 227 teachers in 37 NSW primary schools across Government, Catholic and Independent school systems. The survey instruments collected data that included the background variables such as gender, age, years of teaching, tertiary qualifications, pre-service training, professional development and teachers' perceptions and practices in relation to primary physical education. The use of qualitative open-ended questions from the questionnaire provided additional insights into teachers' perceptions, attitudes and practices as these related to primary physical education in their schools.The questionnaire survey allowed for data to be entered into the Statview SE statistics package. The survey information was analysed statistically for patterns of data, seeking linkages among activities, attitudes and outcomes and drawing informed conclusions. The open-ended questions were transcribed with coded findings used to describe the perceptions teachers have of physical education in NSW primary schools.The findings of this study indicated that the teacher of physical education in NSW primary schools is most likely to be a generalist teacher who has undertaken only compulsory units of physical education during their pre-service education. Many of the teachers reported being dependent on previous personal knowledge and experience or the assistance and support of their peers in teaching their classes. The demographics of the sample highlighted that the primary teaching population is aging and there is a disproportionate percentage of female teachers to male teachers. Teachers emphasised the areas of fitness, games and sports skills and organised sport, while the areas of gymnastics, aquatics and adaptive physical education received minimal attention due to the limited expertise of teachers, legal liability issues and time restrictions. The resources and equipment available to teachers were generally considered adequate in the areas fitness, games and sports skills and organised sport, while those for gymnastics, aquatics and adaptive physical education were judged by teachers to be inadequate. It was the intention of this research study to provide, from the teachers' point of view, a comprehensive picture of physical education in NSW primary schools. The research findings will be supplied to all relevant stakeholders, in anticipation of fixture development and enhancement of the learning environment for students and teachers in NSW primary schools.The recommendations in Chapter Five have been developed to assist the teacher of physical education in NSW schools. The development of a common understanding of physical education needs to occur with the promotion of a physical education model rather than physical fitness or physical activity models. The pre-service education of primary school teachers must include mandatory units which are directly related to the content strands of the PDHPE syllabus, with further opportunities for teachers to specialise in physical education courses. Consultancy support is required to assist schools and teachers to implement the recently released syllabus and documents, with ongoing support on the development of an inclusive whole-school curriculum and focussing on lesson preparation prior to expanding into areas of safety and legal liability. All teachers should be provided with a series of school-based professional development opportunities and the development of an interactive website to enable teachers to expand their range of teaching and learning strategies, with identified groups of teachers targeted to ensure minimal students' experiences across a range of physical education. A minimum standard of facilities and equipment to conduct physical education should be established, so that teachers can fulfil syllabus requirements. Finally all stakeholders need to work in unison to enable students in NSW primary schools to experience meaningful physical education.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/978</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of the responses of the Pacific Island States to the fisheries provisions of the Law of the Sea Convention</field><field name="creator">Aqorau, Transform</field><field name="description">The thesis shows that there are three phases to the responses of the Pacific Island States to tuna management obligations in the LOSC. The first phase, from 1979 to 1989 involved strengthening the organisation of the Pacific Island States to co-ordinate their relationship. The second phase, from 1990 to 1996, was characterised by efforts to improve the regulation of foreign fishing vessels' activities in the region. The third phase, from 1997 onwards will involve reviewing the present tuna management and conservation arrangements to reflect principles of responsible tuna management and conservation. The review should take into account the new international instruments developed by the international community.The overall conclusion the thesis draws are as follows:&#8226; That the LOSC gives coastal States the authority to manage and conserve tuna in their EEZ. This authority carries with it the responsibility to ensure that tuna resources are not over-exploited. The obligation to conserve and manage may be implemented individually or it may be exercised co-operatively between the coastal States and also between the coastal States and DWFNs;That the responses of the Pacific Island States in general to the tuna provisions of the LOSC have complied with the LOSC imperatives for the management and conservation of tuna. However, the responses do not go far enough to discharge all the fisheries obligations of the LOSC; and;&#8226; That the challenge for future tuna management arrangements is to ensure that co-operative arrangements are made with DWFNs to ensure that tuna is managed throughout its entire range and that conservation obligations are clearly reflected in the responses of the Pacific islands to the challenges arising from the EEZ regime.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/993</field></doc><doc><field name="title">D-optimal input design for parameter estimation of linear and distributed parameter systems</field><field name="creator">Qureshi, Zahid H.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1342</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Facilitating learning: mine, yours and others' :gaining insight into the facilitation of corporate experiential learning programs through the lenses of personal experience and the learning styles analysis</field><field name="creator">Dickson, Tracey Joy</field><field name="description">Writing and research on facilitation of experiential learning, including corporate programs, predominantly focuses upon what the facilitator is to do, with little or no consideration for where the facilitation occurs. Using a heuristic research process that involves an immersion in the dominant literature on experiential learning (with an emphasis upon North American literature), and through the use of the 'lenses' of personal experience and the use of the Teaming Styles Analysis, this thesis follows a journey of exploration into the world of experiential learning. The journey includes forays into deconstruction of a popular article on facilitation as well as exploring literature from other areas such as urban planning, human geography and organisational aesthetics. Other places 'visited' along the way includes surveys of the learning styles of 73 post graduate students as well as the professional practice of 76 facilitators of experiential learning from diverse countries and cultures. The destination at the commencement of the journey while unknown, had a motive to enhance the effectiveness of the facilitation of corporate experiential learning programs. However, by continuing to honour the role of personal experience, as supported by many feminist writers, and by being willing to reflect upon the writings and practice of facilitation of experiential learning, the final destination ended up being a place called Place and Space. Prior to arriving at the final destination, a creative synthesis of the journey is expressed through a weaving of a photo essay with the words of a poem. The final destination of this journey, Place and Space, begins to raise questions about what the impact of the physical environment, natural/wilderness or built, may have upon the individual and/or the group's learning experience. These questions form the beginnings for another journey.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1778</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Planning of the implementation of public policy: a case study of the Board of Studies, N.S.W.</field><field name="creator">O'Mullane, Michael J.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1875</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Research and development structures within the Australian wine industry: organizational implications, global challenges and a changing of the wine culture</field><field name="creator">Aylward, David Knox</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2030</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of on site detention for flood reduction in urban catchments</field><field name="creator">Sharman, Adam William</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2403</field></doc><doc><field name="title">3D-audio object oriented coding</field><field name="creator">Potard, Guillaume</field><field name="description">This thesis first presents a novel object-oriented scheme which provides for ex- tensive description of time-varying 3D audio scenes using XML. The scheme, named XML3DAUDIO, provides a new format for encoding and describing 3D audio scenes in an object oriented manner. Its creation was motivated by the fact that other 3D audio scene description formats are either too simplistic (VRML) and lacking in realism, or are too complex (MPEG-4 Advanced AudioBIFS) and, as a result, have not yet been fully implemented in available decoders and scene authoring tools. This thesis shows that the scene graph model, used by VRML and MPEG-4 AudioBIFS, leads to complex and ine&#177;cient 3D audio scene descriptions. This complexity is a result of the aggregation, in the scene graph model, of the scene content data and the scene temporal data. The resulting 3D audio scene descriptions, are in turn, difficult to re-author and signifcantly increase the complexity of 3D audio scene renderers. In contrast, XML3DAUDIO follows a new scene orchestra and score approach which allows the separation of the scene content data from the scene temporal data; this simplifies 3D audio scene descriptions and allows simpler 3D audio scene renderer implementations. In addition, the separation of the temporal and content data permits easier modification and re-authoring of 3D audio scenes. It is shown that XML3DAUDIO can be used as a new format for 3D audio scene rendering or can alternatively be used as a meta-data scheme for annotating 3D audio content.Rendering and perception of the apparent extent of sound sources in 3D audio displays is then considered. Although perceptually important, the extent of sound sources is one the least studied auditory percepts and is often neglected in 3D audio displays. This research aims to improve the realism of rendered 3D audio scenes by reproducing the multidimensional extent exhibited by some natural sound sources (eg a beach front, a swarm of insects, wind blowing in trees etc). Usually, such broad sound sources are treated as point sound sources in 3D audio displays, resulting in unrealistic rendered 3D audio scenes. A technique is introduced whereby, using several uncorrelated sound sources, the apparent extent of a sound source can be controlled in arbitrary ways. A new hypothesis is presented suggesting that, by placing uncorrelated sound sources in particular patterns, sound sources with apparent shapes can be obtained. This hypothesis and the perception of vertical and horizontal sound source extent are then evaluated in several psychoacoustic experiments. Results showed that, using this technique, subjects could perceive the horizontal extent of sound sources with high precision, differentiate horizontally from vertically extended sound sources and could identify the apparent shapes of sound sources above statistical chance. In the latter case, however, the results show identification less than 50 % of the time, and then only when noise signals were used. Some of these psychoacoustic experiments were carried out for the MPEG standardisation body with a view to adding sound source extent description capabilities to the MPEG-4 AudioBIFS standard; the resulting modifications have become part of the new capabilities in version 3 of AudioBIFS.Lastly, this thesis presents the implementation of a novel real-time 3D audio rendering system known as CHESS (Configurable Hemispheric Environment for Spatialised Sound). Using a new signal processing architecture and a novel 16-speaker array, CHESS demonstrates the viability of rendering 3D audio scenes described with the XML3DAUDIO scheme. CHESS implements all 3D audio signal processing tasks required to render a 3D audio scene from its textual description; the definition of these techniques and the architecture of CHESS is extensible and can thus be used as a basis model for the implementation of future object oriented 3D audio rendering systems.Thus, overall, this thesis presents ontributions in three interwoven domains of 3D audio: 3D audio scene description, spatial psychoacoustics and 3D audio scene rendering.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/539</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Use of conducting polymers for electrochemical detection and on-line derivatisation</field><field name="creator">Lin, Yuping</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1215</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dynamic characteristics of the doubly fed twin stator induction machine</field><field name="creator">Cook, C.

In particular, this has been characterised by encroachment of saltmarsh by mangrove. Changes in the relationship between marsh elevation and water levels, facilitated either by altered tidal regimes, eustatic sea-level rise or marsh subsidence/autocompaction, have been hypothesised as the driver of these community-scale changes. In addition, the evidence for future sea-level rise is compelling and abundant. However, our understanding of marsh sedimentary and elevation dynamics in relation to sea-level and the impacts of sea-level rise on mangrove and saltmarsh in Southeastern Australia is limited. The aim of this study was to examine marsh elevation trajectories in relation to sea-level change, establish the contribution of sedimentation to these changes and determine the vulnerability of mangrove and saltmarsh to submergence from sea-level rise.This research has been carried out over approximately 1 500 km of coastline and at wide range of sites in Southeastern Australia, including the Tweed River, Hunter River, Hawkesbury River, Parramatta River, Minnamurra River, Jervis Bay and Western Port Bay. Photogrammetric mapping of mangrove and saltmarsh extent was compiled for each study site and tidal inundation models were developed to determine the vertical and horizontal change in mangrove and saltmarsh extent since the commencement of aerial photography. A network of Surface Elevation Tables was established to examine marsh elevation trajectories in relation to sea-level changes and determine the environmental variables influencing marsh elevation. Feldspar marker horizons were established in mangrove and saltmarsh to examine contemporary sediment accretion trajectories and determine the contribution of sedimentation to marsh elevation. Sediment cores from saltmarshes in Western Port Bay were 210Pb dated to establish historic sedimentation rates and make comparisons with sea-level changes. To ascertain whether mangrove and saltmarsh distribution changes were related to sea-level rise, sedimentation and/or subsidence, comparisons were made between changes in vegetation extent, sedimentation, marsh elevation changes and sea-level changes.Contemporary rates of sediment accretion varied greatly, but generally agreed with historic rates of sedimentation determined for the past 100 years at Western Port Bay. Inundation frequency, tidal range and geomorphology were all shown to influence sediment accretion at study sites. Surface elevation changes were strongly correlated to El Ni&#241;o intensity (Southern Oscillation Index) and rainfall. Mean sedimentation contributed to approximately 67% of surface elevation change in saltmarsh settings and 51% in mangrove settings. A consistent relationship between sediment accretion and surface elevation changes was not observed.At most study sites sediment accretion exceeded surface elevation changes due to subsurface processes causing subsidence/autocompaction. The bulk of subsidence was attributed to reduced rainfall in association with the 2002 to 2004 El Ni&#241;o related drought, which was shown to cause groundwater reserves to be depleted. Surface elevation exceeded sediment accretion in the saltmarsh at three study sites and this was attributed to ponding of surface water causing sediments to swell due to porewater storage increases, and increased primary productivity and associated belowground root development that displaced the marsh surface. Rates of sediment accretion generally kept pace with or exceeded sea-level changes, However, since subsurface processes of subsidence/autocompaction and uplift influenced marsh elevations, it was more appropriate to determine mangrove and saltmarsh vulnerability to sea-level rise on the basis of an elevation deficit, defined as the difference between rates of marsh elevation change and sea-level change over the same study period. Elevation deficits indicated that the vulnerability of mangrove and saltmarsh in Southeastern Australia to submergence was low.Submergence may not be the only possible impact of sea-level rise on mangrove and saltmarsh communities. No relationship was found between mangrove increase and sedimentation or saltmarsh decline and sedimentation. However, a significant relationship was established between rates of surface elevation change in the saltmarsh and rates of mangrove area increase. By determining the vertical gradient over which mangrove had increased extent and relative sea-level rise, which incorporates mangrove surface elevation changes and eustatic sea-level rise, a significant correlation was found between relative sea-level rise and the vertical component of landward mangrove encroachment. Observed changes to mangrove and saltmarsh extent in Southeastern Australia over the past 50 years were attributed to subsidence and sea-level rise.Several sedimentation and surface elevation trends in Southeastern Australia were typical of marshes within the international SET network. Sedimentation was equivalent to surface elevation change at few sites and marsh elevations were typically influenced by subsidence. Mangrove sediment accretion may also be globally predicted on the basis of tide range and long-term sea-level rise at study sites. However, marsh surface dynamics in Southeastern Australia differ from global trends due to the upper intertidal location of saltmarshes, the strong influence of drought on marsh elevations and generally lower rates of sea-level rise.The results of this study have important implications for current estuary management practices. For example, interference with natural sediment movements within estuaries by trapping sediments and associated nutrients upstream may actually reduce sediment availability to mangrove and saltmarsh communities and increase their vulnerability to the impacts of sea-level rise. Also, the finding that groundwater plays an important role in maintaining marsh surface elevation has implications on the management of groundwater resources and the role of climate change on the longterm survival of mangrove and saltmarsh communities.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/653</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The investigation of the stiffeners of a plate web girder under eccentric loads applied to a flange</field><field name="creator">Derrington, R.

An important part of this research was to refine the age range of C. heekereni and to reconstruct its paleogeographic context on the basis of Southeast Asian plate tectonics and eustatic sea-level changes. This study has implications for the history of other animal species on Sulawesi, and for Southeast Asian biogeography generally.Associated fieldwork in the Walanae Basin included the description of fossil sites, the recording of stratigraphic sections, two excavations, and the collection of sediment samples for palaeoenvironmental reconstruction and dating. Associated analyses included qualitative and quantitative morphological analysis of C. heekereni cranial and dental remains collected either by previous researchers or during my fieldwork. Comparative data was also obtained on other extant and extinct pigs, including those of the before genus Sus and Babyrousa. This data was obtained from the published literature, as well as from my analyses of material held in the collections of the Indonesian Geological Survey Institute in Bandung, the Zoological Museum in Bogor, and the Australian National University in Canberra.Concerning phylogeny, C. heekereni shows a combination of primitive and advanced skull characteristics. Comparative analyses indicate that the ancestor of this species was most likely close to Palaeochoerus, a primitive suid genus known from the Lower Miocene of the Siwaliks in the Indian subcontinent, which gave rise to various Eurasian and African suid lineages, including extant warthogs. In contrast, dental morphology in C. heekereni underwent little change except for a reduction of the anterior premolars and an increase in the size of the upper canines. A synthesis of the available geological evidence indicates that since the Middle Eocene, no part of Sulawesi has been connected to the Asian mainland. As the ancestor of C. heekereni cannot have entered Sulawesi before the Lower Miocene, it had to have crossed a sea barrier. This could have occurred during the Middle Miocene, when deltaic progradation on the east coast of Borneo extended further east than at present, and crossing the Makassar Strait to reach Sulawesi would have been less difficult.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3058</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Floating between the Orient and the Occident: Japan, Australia and their inferiority complex</field><field name="creator">Harada, Yoko</field><field name="description">Japan and Australia are generally understood as very different countries in terms of culture, history and ethnicity.  However, if we focus on their formation as modern nation states they are contemporaries and their similarities become visible.  Under the influence of European and American imperial/colonial expansion, they both became modern nation states around the turn of the last century.  As a result of being latecomers to the Western dominated international community they both developed an &#8220;inferiority complex&#8221; in relation to the West.  This made them appear ambiguous within in the context of Asia where they geographically belong.  Their ambiguous national identities are aptly represented in the reading of Edward W. Said by Japanese and Australian intellectuals.  In a world which Said described being dichotomous and hierarchical, they float between the Orient and the Occident.  Their ambiguous identities troubled by an inferiority complex are well reflected in their behaviour in the international arena.  On the one hand, as frontrunners in the region in terms of modernity, they act in a superior manner towards neighbouring Asian countries.  On the other hand, they tend to be connected to strong countries in the West.  Japan and Australia&#8217;s closeness in recent years can be explained as an outcome of their similarly ambiguous position in the world.  They are still captured by the rhetoric of colonialism and imperialism and in this sense they have not yet been fully &#8220;decolonised&#8221;.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3034</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Isolation of arsenic-accumulating mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Phuong T.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2747</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into the condition monitoring of large slow speed slew bearings</field><field name="creator">Moodie, Craig A S</field><field name="description">The condition monitoring of slow speed roller bearings has been investigated. A test-rig was designed and constructed to enable detailed measurement of horizontal rotating bearing acceleration forces in both the axial and radial plane in the speed range of 0.5 to 10 revolutions per minute. These accelerations were carried out at both sonic and ultrasonic sampling rates to establish which technique is the most appropriate. Overall bearing displacement and surface temperatures were measured. Strains generated in the stress frame by the loading of the bearing were monitored along with the power used to drive the test-rig. Measurements were obtained from two full-size slew bearings operating in Bluescope Steel Limited. One bearing operated at 4.3 rpm continuously in the vertical plane. The other slew bearing operated intermittently and with partial rotation at approximately 1 rpm in the horizontal plane. During this project, the concepts of Symmetry and Stability have been developed as a fundamental approach to information analysis. A considerable number of novel signal processing methods including; Kurtosis/Correlation dimension plots, Symmetry State Space (SSS), Symmetric Wave Decomposition (SWD), Compressed Eigenvector Deconvolution Spectral Analysis (CEDSA), Ring Matrix Fault Values (RMFV) have been developed. These methods all utilize symmetry, antisymmetry, symmetry &#8217;breaking&#8217;, stability and enable the assessment of which sensor methodology combination is best for the situation considered. It will be shown, among other things, that ultrasonic measurements using sensors designed for Acoustic Emission (AE) permit an implementation of an early warning system for slow speed bearings. This will enable the operator to carry the minimum inventory in bearings and to plan shut downs without incurring additional costs from unplanned outages resulting from failed bearings.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3035</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A dragline simulation model for strip mine design and development</field><field name="creator">Mirabediny, Hamid</field><field name="description">During recent years, the Australian coal industry has increasingly used large walking draglines as the dominant waste removal equipment in open cut coal mines. Because of the nature of the coal formations, dragline operations in Australian coal mining situations are quite complex and draglines are frequently used in applications beyond their normal capabilities. With the current trend to increasing dragline sizes in most of the Australian coal mines, the draglines become the highest capital investment item in these mines. It is therefore necessary to give detailed attention to the optimising operating procedures of the dragline.Dragline productivity and its stripping capabilities are directly affected by the selection of digging method, strip layout and pit geometry. Every mine has a unique combination of geological conditions. The operating methods that work well at one mine may not necessarily work at another site. Selection of an optimal stripping method, strip layout and pit geometry for a given dragline must be considered with respect to the geological conditions of the mines. With increasing geological complexity of Australian strip mines, it is becoming more important to use sophisticated techniques such as computerised mine planning methods to assist in optimising the dragline operations.A computerised dragline simulation model (CADSIM) has been developed for use in selection of optimum strategies for a dragline operation. The procedure developed links with a geological ore body model to develop a geological database for simulation. CADSIM model can be used in selection the most cost effective dragline digging method. A specific simulation language, "DSLX", was used to program seven common and innovative dragline methods currently used in Australian open cut mines. The DSLX language uses predefined functions to build strip geometry, working benches, blast profiles and spoil piles. The outputs from CADSIM model in form of volumetric, swing angles and hoist distances data were then aggregated with dragline specifications and site time study data to compare productivity and costs of the selected digging methods. The results of two case studies showed that this procedure lends itself to the "optimum" solution for dragline mine planning and design problems for a given coal deposit.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1219</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of oil exports in the economic development of Iran 1960-1992</field><field name="creator">Haerian Ardakani, Mahmood</field><field name="description">The main purpose of this thesis is to investigate the impact of oil exports on the process of the economic growth in Iran during the period 1960-1992. The study uses single and simultaneous equation regression models to test export-led-growth models in the context of the Iranian economy. The results would seem to suggest that the Iranian economy has been financed with large amounts of oil revenues in the past three decades, especially after the jump in oil prices in 1973. However, the regression analysis suggests that the Iranian economy did not gain as much from these price rises as the other oil producers because of the negative effects of the political turmoil during the last year of the Shah's rule in 1978, the transition of power to the Islamic government and, most of all, because of the heavy damages of the Iraqi-Iranian war.Despite these negative effects the oil sector has played the role of the "leading sector" in the last three decades. The results of the simultaneous equation models suggest that Iranian exports to its major trading partners had a significant impact on the growth of the Iranian economy. The simultaneous regression results also suggest the absence of the feedback effect between the Iranian economy and other economies under study except Brazil, Romania, Singapore and Turkey.The study predicts that the oil sector will continue to play a leading role m future Iranian economic development.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1327</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Technology, education, and social change: a programme for survival</field><field name="creator">Mitchell, N.

Preventive approaches would target diet and physical activity behaviours yet little is known about these lifestyle parameters in this group. This thesis describes the diet, physical activity and risk factor profile of a sample of women with previous GDM from the Illawarra region of New South Wales, Australia. A comprehensive ethnographic description is created profiling the sample using both quantitative (surveys, diet and physical activity measurements and clinical assessments) and qualitative techniques (in depth interviews). The central hypothesis is that, while the need for diet and physical intervention may be clearly demonstrated in this group of women, the complexities of their lives needs to be considered when developing how these interventions might be delivered.It is reasonable to assume that providing interventions for women with small children may pose practical and social challenges that warrant consideration in program design.The main aim of the research was therefore to assess the extent of the need for intervention for an identifiable cohort of women and qualify this with and an in-depth analysis of these practical and social issues. Subjects were recruited from the database of women referred to the Illawarra Diabetes Service who would be 10-25 months post-partum at the time of the study. Of a potential 150 subjects, 52 were accessible and completed a telephone interview, 19 completed a more in-depth cross-sectional survey, and 21 completed in-depth interviews with a further ten &#8220;support&#8221; people recruited through a snowballing technique. The health profile of the subjects confirmed the need for diet and activity intervention. Ten of 18 women completing a standard glucose tolerance test produced an abnormal result and were advised to seek further medical care. Dietary intake patterns were not in keeping with current recommendations for the prevention of T2DM  (total fat 34.9&#177;7.7%, SFA 13.2&#177;4.0%, PUFA 5.5&#177;1.7%  compared to targets of (less than)30%, (less than)10% and (greater than)10% respectively). While 16 of 19 women met physical activity guidelines, the research indicated that further work on the nature of physical activity in this group warrants consideration and that current, more general physical activity guidelines for the prevention of T2DM be adapted for this group. Most of the women (47 out of 51) initially expressed an interest in lifestyle programs but indicated that time and childcare barriers would prevail. In-depth interviews indicated that there were differences between women in relation to the potential accessibility of lifestyle intervention programs and that this may rest on feelings of empowerment within the limited capacity of family systems. Opportunities for lifestyle intervention in healthcare services are likely to lie within a model of family-centred therapy. This acknowledges that the lives of these women are embedded in an interdependent network of individuals forming the family system.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/853</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the biomass, diversity and nutrient relationships of macroalgae and seagrasses in Lake Illawarra, New South Wales, Australia</field><field name="creator">Rutten, Karin</field><field name="description">Lake Illawarra is a shallow barrier lagoon, located on the south-eastern coast of Australia. Eutrophication, referring to the enrichment of water by inorganic plant nutrients (primarily nitrogen and phosphorus), is one of the key environmental problems in Lake Illawarra. Management of macroalgae in Lake Illawarra is a major issue; excessive blooms of macroalgae, resulting in odours, access problems and community concern over Lake health, have led to many management strategies, including direct harvesting of algal biomass. Little information is available on the factors responsible for excessive growth of macroalgae in Lake Illawarra, although over supply of nutrients has often been cited as the primary cause. The aim of this study was to investigate the distribution, diversity, biomass and nutrient relationships of seagrasses and macroalgae in Lake Illawarra, and to determine what contribution, if any, macrophytes make to the Lake&#8217;s nutrient budget.  Firstly, detailed species lists and taxonomic descriptions were prepared for macrophytes occurring in Lake Illawarra, between June 2000 and July 2003. This study focused primarily on shallow (&lt; 1 m depth), inshore areas of Lake Illawarra, where problematic macroalgal blooms frequently occur. Seagrasses found in Lake Illawarra are Zostera capricorni, Ruppia megacarpa, Halophila ovalis and Halophila decipiens. In addition, 35 species of macroalgae were recorded and described; these included: 14 species from 7 genera of green macroalgae; 9 species from 9 different genera of brown macroalgae; and, 8 species from 8 genera of red macroalgae.  The biomass of seagrasses and macroalgae in Lake Illawarra were documented seasonally (winter and summer) at four key Lake Illawarra sites; these included two R. megacarpa sites and two Z. capricorni sites. Average R. megacarpa and Z. capricorni dry weight (DW) biomasses (above and below-ground material) ranged from 54.8 - 440 g DW m 2 and 58.1 - 230 g DW m 2, respectively. Significant die-back, particularly of Z. capricorni, occurred in winter; summer biomasses were up to 1.5 - 3.9 times higher than winter biomasses. Below-ground material (roots and rhizomes) comprised 20 - 45 % and 40 - 67 % of total plant biomass for R. megacarpa and Z. capricorni, respectively. Macroalgal biomass in 2000-03 was notably lower than in previous decades; this may be due to drought, as well as improvements in water quality. Maximum biomasses of macroalgae recorded in the present study were 150 - 370 g DW m 2. Algal blooms were composed primarily of the filamentous chlorophytes, Chaetomorpha linum and Chaetomorpha billardierii. The highest seagrass (R. megacarpa) and macroalgal biomasses usually occurred at the Oasis Caravan Park site, located along the eastern Lake Illawarra peninsula.  Tissue nutrient analyses were conducted on the most abundant seagrasses (Z. capricorni and R. megacarpa) and macroalgae occurring at four sites in Lake Illawarra, between spring 2000 and winter 2002. Total C contents of macrophytes varied from 23.3 - 42.0 % C for seagrasses, and 28.0 - 39.7 % C for macroalgae. The &#948;13C and &#948;15N contents of seagrasses ranged from -7.7 to  15.9 &#8240; and 0.7 - 9.0 &#8240;, respectively. The most significant seasonal variations in seagrass &#948;13C contents and, to a lesser extent&#61472;&#948;15N contents, occurred in Z. capricorni located at the source of fresh water input, Mullet Creek. Macroalgae showed a greater variation in isotopic signatures than the seagrasses, ranging from  4.9 to  19.8 &#8240; (&#948;13C) and 1.8 - 14.6 &#8240; (&#948;15N). Differences between species at the same site were often more significant than differences between the same species at different sites. Seagrass leaf N and P contents ranged from 1.74 - 4.13 % (mean &#177; s.e.: 2.62 &#177; 0.05 % N) and 0.12 - 0.59 % P (mean &#177; s.e.: 0.31 &#177; 0.01 % P); leaf N and P contents were typically double those of roots/rhizomes. N contents varied between species and sites, but P contents of Z. capricorni were usually significantly higher than R. megacarpa. Z. capricorni C and N contents increased in winter, corresponding to lower winter biomasses. Seagrass leaf biomass and tissue P contents peaked in summer 2002, which may be related to higher water column P concentrations in summer. Tissue N and P contents of macroalgae were more variable than those of the seagrasses, and ranged from 0.85 - 3.95 % N and 0.03 - 0.58 % P. The average C/P (808 &#177; 65) and N/P (47.9 &#177; 3.47) molar ratios of macroalgae were typically double those of the seagrasses. Low concentrations of tissue P, with respect to N, in R. megacarpa and macroalgae implied P limitation on several occasions, particularly when macrophyte biomasses were low. High tissue N contents in Lake Illawarra macrophytes suggested N limitation of biomass formation rarely occurred. Evidence of P, rather than N, limitation in macrophytes is surprising considering most data suggests N limitation of phytoplankton production in Lake Illawarra. The estimated pools of N and P contained in Lake Illawarra macrophyte biomass were similar to those present in the water column, but appeared minute when compared to the N and P stored within Lake Illawarra sediment.  Laboratory culture experiments were conducted to evaluate the response of the most problematic alga, Chaetomorpha linum, to nutrient enrichment. Water temperatures of 20 - 25&#176;C were found to promote the highest growth rates (up to 27 % WW d 1) of C. linum, but high growth rates (13 % WW d 1) were also recorded at 10&#176;C, the lowest winter water temperature recorded in Lake Illawarra. Enrichment with N, rather than P, had the greatest effect on C. linum; growth rates were significantly reduced in treatments without added N, but treatments with N-alone were statistically similar to N+P treatments. It was concluded that in Lake Illawarra, C. linum was strongly nitrogen limited. The ability of C. linum to grow successfully in culture, under a range of nutrient treatments, and without added phosphorus, in particular, correlates with the excessive growth of this alga in Lake Illawarra.  This study has made a significant contribution to the understanding of seagrass and macroalgal growth, biomass and distribution in Lake Illawarra. This information will assist with the long-term management of macroalgal problems in Lake Illawarra.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/22</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The use of education theory to guide the implementation of participatory rural appraisal in the Kingdom of Tonga</field><field name="creator">Vea'ila, Tevita Taukei</field><field name="description">Agriculture is the mainstay of Tonga&#8217;s economy. It provides approximately 80% of employment opportunities and about 32% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The fragile environment and limited resources of Tonga such as small landmass, isolation, proneness to natural hazards, long distances and expensive transportation costs from overseas markets of Australasia, United States, Europe and Asia, create fiscal deficits, high inflation and vulnerable economic growth (Briguglio, 1995; Government of Australia, 1992).Before 1960, subsistence farming i.e. growing crops mainly for home consumption and festivities was the mode of production in Tonga. During the early 1970&#8217;s, local farmers started to apply agrochemicals and fertilisers as the substitution for traditional farming practices such as shifting cultivation, moon planting guides, seed saving and composting when trading with developed countries. Currently, many Tongan people rely on agriculture as their main source of livelihood but the high use of synthetic fertilisers and pesticides to gain better yields is a short-term fix that has the potential to do serious damage to the health of the people of Tonga and their fragile environment.The theoretical framework for the research was participatory action research (Lewin, 1946). Participatory Action Research (PAR) is an alternative philosophy of social research and often associated with social transformation in the Third World. It is based on &#8220;liberation theology&#8221; and neo-Marxist approaches to community development in Latin America (Freire, 1968). Three particular attributes are often used to distinguish PAR from conventional research. These are shared ownership of research projects, community-based analysis of social problems and an orientation toward community action. This study was designed to appraise the usefulness of an appropriate educational theory to guide and support a research project that had as its attributes shared ownership, community based analysis of the problems and an orientation toward community action. The methodology framework for practical implementation of the project was participatory rural appraisal (PRA), a framework commonly used in agriculture development programs in less developed countries.The study had three main purposes: 1. To assess the strengths and limitations of Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) as a framework for organising community education practices designed to improve ecologically sustainable methods of crop pest control in Tonga. 2. To identify an educational theory that would be suitable to support the PRA framework and that also addresses the reported limitations of PRA. 3. To use the perspective of a participatory action research framework (PAR) to evaluate the implementation of this theoretical educational model in the context of a two Tongan community groups who were the focus of the data collection. These were a group of women from a town and a group of young farmers from another village.The literature review suggested that Cambourne&#8217;s (1988) conditions of learning would be a suitable educational theory to support the PRA process and to address the limitations with PRA. The study then examined how Cambourne&#8217;s (1988) conditions of learning could be activated to support adult learning in the context of Tonga &#8211; in particular the following attributes of participatory action research: shared ownership of research projects, community-based analysis of social problems and an orientation toward community action.A qualitative research methodology was adopted to help understand the richness of the cultural context of the participants (groups of women and young men in villages in Tonga) and to understand how the various conditions of learning, as recommended by the educational theory, were activated during the implementation of the education program. The focus was on the education activities as recorded by the researcher and extensive use was made of field notes, interviews and photographs, as well as other artefacts. These data were used to maintain a consistent record of the changes and interventions that occurred during the learning activities.The findings showed that the Cambourne&#8217;s model could be adapted to effectively guide an adult education program in the context of Tonga and concluded that such a model has the potential to be used for similar education programs in other rural education contexts.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/833</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contributions towards the development of the Technical Report IEC/TR 61000-3-13 on voltage unbalance emission allocation</field><field name="creator">Paranavithana, Prabodha</field><field name="description">Although voltage unbalance is a well understood concept, its presence as a power quality problem in electricity transmission and distribution networks has continued to be an issue of concerns primarily due to difficulties found by some network service providers in maintaining acceptable levels. This emphasises the lack of recommendations on engineering practices governing voltage unbalance that would facilitate the provision of adequate supply quality to connected customers.The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) has recently released the Technical Report IEC/TR 61000-3-13 which provides guiding principles for coordinating voltage unbalance between various voltage levels of a power system through the allocation of emission limits to installations. Although the IEC report is based on widely accepted basic concepts and principles, it requires refinements and original developments in relation to some of the key aspects. This thesis primarily focuses on making contributions for further improvements to the IEC report so as to present a more comprehensive voltage unbalance allocation procedure.Similar to the counterpart IEC guidelines for harmonics (IEC 61000-3-6) and flicker (IEC 61000-3-7) allocation, IEC/TR 61000-3-13 also apportions the global emission allowance to an installation in proportion to the ratio between the agreed apparent power, and the total available apparent power of the system seen at the busbar where it is connected. However, noting that voltage unbalance at a busbar can arise as a result of both load and system (essentially lines) asymmetries, IEC/TR 61000-3-13 applies an additional factor which is referred to as &#8216;Kue&#8217; to the apportioned allowance. This factor Kue represents the fraction of the global emission allowance that can be allocated to customers, whereas the factor K0ue (= 1 &#8722; Kue) accounts for voltage unbalance which arises as a result of line asymmetries. Although IEC/TR 61000-3-13 recommends system operators to assess the factors Kue and K0ue for prevailing system conditions, a systematic method for its evaluation is not provided other than a rudimentary direction. This thesis initially examines, employing radial systems, the influence of line asymmetries on the global emission levels in medium voltage (MV) and high voltage (HV) power systems in the presence of various load types/bases including three-phase induction motors. It is shown that the factor K0ue is seen to be dependant not only on line parameters as evident from IEC/TR 61000-3-13, but also on the downstream load composition. In essence, the global emission levels in HV power systems is seen to arise as a result of both the local HV lines and the downstream MV lines in the presence of considerable proportions of induction motor loads. Eventually, generalised methodologies, covering both radial and interconnected networks, for the assessment of the global emission in MV and HV power systems which arises due to line asymmetries are proposed.In allocating voltage unbalance based on the IEC/TR 61000-3-13 recommendations, quantitative measures of its propagation from higher voltage to lower voltage levels in terms of transfer coefficients, and from one busbar to other neighbouring busbar of a sub-system in terms of influence coefficients are required. IEC/TR 61000-3-13 gives a method for evaluating the MV to LV transfer coefficient suggesting a value less than unity for industrial load bases containing large proportions of mains connected three-phase induction motors, and a value of unity for passive loads in general. Upon detailed examination, it is noted that a transfer coefficient &gt; 1 can arise in the presence of commonly prevailing constant power loads. Incorporating these different influences exhibited by various load types under unbalanced supply conditions on the propagation, comprehensive methods for assessing the MV to LV and HV to MV transfer coefficients are proposed. A systematic approach for estimating influence coefficients for interconnected network environments taking their dependency on the downstream load composition into account is developed.The IEC allocation policy with regard to harmonics and flicker has been found not to guarantee that the emission limits allocated to customers ensure non-exceedance of the set planning levels. This thesis reports that the above is an issue with voltage unbalance as well. Overcoming this problem, an alternative allocation technique referred to as &#8216;constraint bus voltage&#8217; (CBV) method which closely aligns with the IEC approach has been suggested for harmonics and flicker. The work presented in this thesis extends the suggested CBV method to voltage unbalance allocation adding appropriate revisions to address the additional aspect of the emission which arises as a result of line asymmetries.In the application of the IEC/TR 61000-3-13 principles to better manage existing networks already experiencing excessive voltage unbalance levels, the initial development of insights into the influences made by various sources of unbalance is required. Employing an existing 66kV interconnected sub-transmission system as the study case, deterministic studies are carried out in a systematic manner considering each of the asymmetrical elements. Approaches for studying the voltage unbalance behaviour exhibited by various sources which exist in interconnected network environments are established. These are employed to identify the most favourable line transposition options for the study system. Further, this knowledge that facilitates the identification of contributions made by individual unbalanced sources forms a platform for developing techniques to assess the compliance with emission limits, which is another subject of relevance to future editions of IEC/TR 61000-3-13.As an essential tool for carrying out the studies, an unbalanced load flow program based on the phase coordinate reference frame incorporating the component level load flow constraints and the three-phase modelling of system components is developed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/834</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quality appraisal of higher education research: an action-oriented, process-based alternative to performance indicators</field><field name="creator">Curtis, Susanne J.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/994</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Jointing and fracturing of flat-lying rock masses, Illawarra Coal Measures, southeastern Sydney Basin New South Wales, Australia</field><field name="creator">Memarian, Hossein</field><field name="description">Fracture mapping of the Late Permian Illawarra Coal Measures, between Coalcliff and Wollongong, shows that joints developed originally in extension (mode I) and were faulted in subsequent events. Conjugate joint sets are a consequence of two separate fracturing events. Extension joints developed in joint units of different size and shape, with boundaries at changes in mechanical properties. The fracture pattern of extension joints in a joint unit is related to the mechanical properties of the rock mass and loading history. Joints with regional distribution fall into two, early and late formed, groups. Group I regional joints strike N-NNE, NE and SE. These joints propagated horizontally and never interfered with each other. All the existing interactions are the result of succeeding events.Group I regional joints were recracked subsequently. Recracking commenced with jointing and continued with lateral slip. All the faulted joints are classified as hybrid fractures. Faulted joints grew horizontally by the connection of recracked segments. En echelon arrays are the result of vertical propagation of faulted joints into intact rock. Recracking of rock also formed a set of secondary joints parallel to Oi. The sense of movement along conjugate faulted joints and orientation of sets of secondary joints, are related to 3 compressional stress fields namely: NNE-SSW, E-W and SSE-NNW. The intensity of recracking and the amount of lateral slip is mostly related to the strength of infilling materials, the angle between the fracture and the maximum compression direction, and the number of compressional events imposed on the fracture.In the southeastern Sydney Basin, some of the northwesterly trending normal faults were active during Late Permian deposition. Slip along these listric faults formed northwesterly trending gentle folds. A quasi-extensional regime, related to the forebulge of the Sydney Basin, reactivated appropriately oriented basement faults, which in turn, generated grabens in the cover. Group I regional joints formed after lithification and are classified as burial joints. Normal faults and dykes also developed during the Mesozoic. It is considered that the later part this episode was related to rifting that predated the opening of the Tasman Sea and its subsequent extensional history. The youngest deformational events were compressional. Group II regional joints and reactivation of pre-existing fractures occurred during these post-Early Tertiary events. Anticlockwise motion of the Australian crust, relative to the rest of the enclosing plate, caused by the collision between the Indo-Australian and Pacif&#238;c Plates, may have been responsible for the NNE-SSW compression in the eastem part of the Southem Coalfield. The E-W compression most probably postdated the NNE-SSW event.Rock fracturing controlled the present configuration of the coastal platforms. Fractures in bedrock also governed the location of many landslips in talus along the Illawarra Escarpment. A method is presented for predicting the presence of dykes in underground coal mines, using adjacent joints.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1395</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of Ti and Ti-Nb on the stability of the austenite grain structure and [austenite to ferrite] transformation characteristics in C-Mn steel under hot rolling conditions</field><field name="creator">Feng, Bing</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1492</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fabrication and improvement of silver sheathed (Bi,Pb)2Sr2Ca2Cu3010 Tapes powder-in-tube technique</field><field name="creator">Wang, Wei Guo</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1495</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fundamental study of pore formation in iron ore sinter and pellets</field><field name="creator">Yang, Yan-Hui</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1498</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Grain growth and continuous cooling transformation behaviour of austenite in Ti-Nb-Mn-Mo microalloyed steels</field><field name="creator">Manohar, Priyadarshan</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1499</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A technique to resolve road accident problems</field><field name="creator">Andreassend, David C.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1221</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of excavated clay slopes: a multi-stage finite element approach</field><field name="creator">Gray, P.

The definition of 'economic thought' used throughout this work follows Joseph Schumpeter's broad conception in that it includes two interrelated aspects: formal economic analysis and more everyday, commonsense thought. A central question is the issue of justifying numerical observations as valid knowledge. After a brief study of the knowledge and evidential status of numerical observations in the history of political economy mostly prior to the advent of Keynesian macroeconomics there follows a literary survey of the role and status of numerical observations in the writings of Menger, Hayek, Mises and some other 'new' Austrian economists. Some common tendencies in their methodological doctrines, as they relate to numerical observations, are apparent among the older Austrians and these appear to have descended to 'new' Austrians. A selected set of summary points are generated from the survey of Austrian perspectives and these are used to give direction to ensuing literary studies. These studies include: (i) A  methodological analysis of the knowledge status and limits of numerical observations in economic analysis. The approach throughout this investigation is philosophical. Morgenstern's concept of the 'accuracy of economic observations' proves useful in this respect, but this study goes beyond the boundaries within which Morgenstern discussed the notion. This study delves into Machlup's critique of 'operationalism' in economics with special reference to the role of numerical observations in 'testing' economic theories. A central conclusion is that the  increasing availability of numerical observations for use by economists in economic analysis - to design formal statistical constructs and 'test' economic theories - cannot remove uncertainty involved in interpreting or conferring meaning on the data. Uncertainty in this context arises from philosophical problems with numerical observations highlighted by Austrian themes elaborated in this thesis. These themes include mistrust, on a philosophical level, of aggregation in economic analysis; emphasis on the subjective appreciation of unique micro-level particulars; emphasis on the historical nature of numerical observations and acceptance of a fundamental difference between objects of thought and their 'counterparts' in the realm of sense perception. (ii) A study of the design, use and interpretation of numerical observations in the writings of three early political arithmeticians - Graunt, Petty and Davenant. An 'Austrian' theory of knowledge, gleaned for the most part from earlier chapters is used to develop the concept of a numerical indicator. An indicator is not a mute statistic. It is defined as a value-loaded, proximate numerical counterpart of something (a 'thought') other than the numerical observations it arranges. This indicator concept is then used to study the role of numerical 'facts' in the work of the political arithmeticians, (iii) A third study takes one of the many other suggestions arising from the survey of Austrian perspectives and analyses the historical process of operationalising unemployment in Australasia over specific time periods with reference to official statistical sources and methods. It moves away from the context of the formal analytic aspects of Schumpeterian economic thought and the role of numerical observations therein. It elaborates on the more everyday aspects of economic thought which provided the rationale for validating different ways of operationalising unemployment through history. Connections between counting rules and formal economic theories of unemployment are made in the Australian study but these connections seem rather strained. The New Zealand study details various influences moulding operational concepts and sheds light on the iterative, interactive official design and interpretation process involved in creating and altering these concepts over time.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1317</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Theory and application of (II R) adaptive notch filtering</field><field name="creator">Chicharo, Jose Fernando</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1361</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Far-infared studies of semiconductors in large magnetic fields</field><field name="creator">Heron, Rachael J.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1362</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sing Wis, Ya Wis: what is past is past. Forgetting what it was to remember the Indonesian killings of 1965</field><field name="creator">Goodfellow, Robert W.</field><field name="description">The personal trauma associated with the intense violence that engulfed Indonesia between October and December 1965 is not enough to explain how an open and documented history of the killings was silenced for over 33 years. Likewise, the New Order government's political and military power to suppress competing historical accounts cannot fully elucidate this enduring silence. History is a story about who controls the means of historical consciousness as well as the production of narratives. Therefore, part of the answer of what enabled the forgetting of the Indonesian killings can be found in an examination of the Suharto regime's propaganda project. This established communism as a social evil and New Order military authoritarianism as the antidote. An assessment of this narrative demonstrates how officially generated anti-communist ideology created silences in the process of historical production, and how forgetting the violence became a powerful determinant of local historical consciousness. Anti-communist ideology emerged very early in the New Order story - in the days following the attempted coup of 30 September 1965 and was characterised by three stages. First, the swift destruction of the senior organisational and cadre structure of the Partai Komunis Indonesia (Indonesian Communist Party or PKI), and the mass killings of Leftists by the Indonesian military in collaboration with a broad coalition of anti-communist forces. Second, by the use of anti-communism as a point of ideological linkage between anti-Sukamoist allies; and third, when the New Order no longer required the support of this coalition, the promulgation of anti-communism as a weapon of intimidation. This ideological weapon was then directed against most forms of dissent, especially any suggestion of an alternative to the official history of 1965. This pre-occupation with 'historical correctness' was in fact to characterise New Order rule right up until the resignation of President Suharto in May 1998 (and continues to the present day). However, the explanation for why the killings of 1965 were silenced and forgotten extends beyond social trauma, propaganda, official ideology, and state power. In addition to all of these factors, a type of state-sponsored memorymanipulation facilitated the careful commemoration of the 30 September Coup and the military response that began on 1 October 1965, while silencing most memory of the killings that occurred across Indonesian between mid-October and late December 1965. This was partly achieved through the medium of 'memory templates'. These guides to acceptable remembering filled the historiographical vacuum left by the almost unthinkable pace of social and political transformation - from Sukamoist populism to Suharto's military authoritarianism. This occurred over a period of weeks and months and was associated with a deluge of official information about the military response to the 30 September Coup, and an almost complete silence regarding the nature and extent of the killings. The Suharto regime was able to use this to change the way 1965 could be conceived as 'history' with the official version of the coup dominating the history of the period. In 1997 this determined that at a local level particular 'facts' about 30 September could only be negotiated through, inter alia, the prism of a pro-military historiography. The success of this project was contingent on the key co-ordinates of New Order legitimacy, namely that the Indonesian National Army, Tentara Nasional Indonesia (TNI) had rescued the people from the 'menace' of communism, that Marxism was an ever-present threat to the stability of the nation and that individual communists, sympathisers, or in fact anyone who was 'like a communist', were beyond political, social, moral and especially historical, redemption. This was synonymous with a historiography that invented new chronologies of the coup and then sought to impose and celebrate them, while almost all unmediated, or durational remembering associated with the killings remained suppressed and silenced. Suharto's role in managing the danger of resurgent communism was a critical factor in this process. Official historiography continued to develop with the generation of new myths that reinforced the official version of what happened in 1965 and why. Historical templates, which were primarily concerned with the role of Suharto in the story of the Indonesian Revolution, the 30 September Coup and the restructure of both the Indonesian economy and political culture, while never systematic or convincing at an elite level, nevertheless had a profound affect on village communities, where they created a momentum that lasted beyond the formal end of New Order rule. The wellestablished silence also meant that in 1997 at a local level, the violence of 1965 was only re-called in elusive terms, as vague and very non-specific. This situation continued even after Suharto's resignation in May 1998. The memory of the killings in the immediate post-Suharto period was therefore less influenced by raw military repression than by the far-reaching and still lasting indoctrination associated with New Order anti-communist ideology and the conceptual terms of reference dictated by the New Order's creation of guides to official memory. The examination of naiTatives from 1997 reveals two conflicting stories. A story of the coup and a silencing of the killings. Oral history research into the brutality begins the process of compiling new evidence about the nature of the violence from the perspective of eyewitnesses located in a particular place - the kampung or 'urban village' community of 'Kidul', and at a particular time - the final year of New Order rule. However, just as importantly, an examination of the contrast between different historiographies reveals disparate modes of memory and remembering. This contrast explains the social mechanisms of forgetting and the process of power within history writing itself.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1425</field></doc><doc><field name="title">British policy and the 'development' of Tibet 1912-1933</field><field name="creator">Spence, Heather</field><field name="description">Two conflicting views of Tibet's political status in relation to China have dominated both popular and scholarly literature. The 'pro-Chinese' school views Tibet as a traditional, integral part of China. Tibet, they maintain, was separated from China after the fall of the Manchu dynasty as a consequence of British machinations. Tibet was justifiably reunited with China, the 'motherland', in 1951. The 'pro-Tibetan' school argues that the partnership was between the Dalai Lama and the Manchus: that relationship ended with the collapse of the Manchu dynasty. Accordingly, Tibet is seen as an independent state conquered by the Chinese Communists and illegally incorporated into the Chinese state. ^ This study is not an attempt to enter that debate, but rather to fill a gap in a neglected aspect of Tibetan studies. Nonetheless, the results of this study will, no doubt, become a component in the highly politicized nature of Tibetan history. Sir Charles Bell's authoritative Tibet. Past and Present (1924) and Portrait of a Dalai Lama (1946) both stand as important primary sources for this study. As secondary sources dealing with British policy, W. D. Shakabpa's pioneering study Tibet: A Political History (1967), P. Mehra's The McMahon Line and After (1974) and A.K.J. Singh's Himalayan Triangle (1988) are indispensable. Alastair Lamb's most recent study, Tibet. China and India 1914-1950 (1989), is the first publication to deal with this period in detail. Lamb expertly evaluates Anglo-Tibetan relations and narrows the gap which this thesis study is also designed to close. However, by locating Anglo- Tibetan relations in the wider context of international politics, this dissertation will augment Lamb's study and contribute to the continuing intellectual debate in the field of Tibetan studies. Tibet has been significant in the political development of British India, for it was believed to be a key to the safety and security of India's north-eastern frontier. When the British consolidated their power in the sub-continent of India, they were also faced with the problem of securing a stable frontier on India's Himalayan borders. The British government, therefore, had to evolve a definite policy towards the Himalyan kingdoms, especially Tibet. British India's policy during the 19th century was to treat Tibet as a buffer state. There can be no doubt that the loss of Tibet's independence stems directly from the failure of the British Govemment's Younghusband Mission of 1904 to achieve what the Viceroy of India, Lord Curzon, hoped would result from it. Curzon believed that the M. Goldstein, A History of Modern Tibet 1913-1951: The Demise of the Lamaist State (Berkely, 1989), p. xv. 11 only way to guarantee the continuance of Tibet as a buffer was to ensure the predominance of British influence at Lhasa. This was to be achieved by bringing Tibet under some measure of British protection or influence. Curzon believed that British influence was essential because unless Britain laid claim to Tibet, Russia would draw Tibet into its sphere of influence. After the First World War Britain again had an opportunity to become Tibet's 'protector' but as was the case after 1904, chose to abandon Tibet to Chinese expansionism. Tibet, even today, conjures up images of 'Shangri-la', 'the savage and the sublime' and, perhaps, 'paradise lost'. It is, however, far from remote or picayune to world history. Tibet represents the interface between the two most populous nations on earth and marks the site of one of the most complex boundary disputes ever to disturb the peace of nations. The problems on India's northern frontiers have become a tangled mass of diplomatic perplexity to the governments and people of India and China. The loss of Tibet as a buffer zone between two major world powers has produced major long-term consequences. The Chinese domination of Tibet has presented the current Indian Republic with just those dangers which Curzon feared would confront the British-Indian Empire from the extension into Tibet of the influence of Tsarist Russia. Tibet's role today as a garrison state of China goes far towards explaining its important place in current Westem geopolitical thought. Tibet has become a major handicap to China's political stability. The fate of modern Tibet, and the problems of India's northern frontiers, are subjects of recent political debate. Tibet's destiny in a broader sense and in these days of national self-determination is now a concern of world conscience. It is difficult to comprehend the current situation in Tibet and its place in the policy of both the People's Republic of China and the Republic of India without an understanding of what happened during the period of British colonial domination in India. The British carry some responsibility for the present state of affairs of Tibet. The question at issue is what responsibility should the British accept and what explanations are there for Britain's inability to prevent the loss of Tibetan independence? The answer to these questions lie in an analysis of the wider pattern of Anglo-Chinese political relations and of intemational relations after the First World War. Over the years scholars have trodden a well-wom path to the documents dealing with Anglo-Tibetan affairs held in the Public Record Office and the India Office Library. These documents have, more often than not, been used to compose historical surveys which examine chronological events and often result in Anglo-Tibetan relations being analysed in isolation from the broader intemational context. The primary information on which this study is based provides a level of detail and understanding of the 1920s and I l l 1930s that has not previously been available. Many studies have been made of the 1904 Younghusband Mission, the 1913-14 Simla Conference and the later period of the 1940s and 1950s. The 1920s and 1930s have been overshadowed by the turbulent decades that preceded and succeeded them. These years have usually been given meaning only as a transition period and have assumed the character of a more or less featureless interval: a static period in Anglo-Tibetan relations. The relationship formed between British India and Tibet by the resolution of the 1914 Simla Conference appeared unaltered and fundamentally unquestioned until the transfer of power to an independent Indian government. This, however, was not the case. During this period two major policy shifts took place. The apparent continuity conceals the intensity of debates over Tibetan policy in the British and Indian governments, especially during the years 1919-1921 and 1932-33, which disclosed Britain's apprehension about the volatile political situation in central and north Asia during and after the First World War. The destiny of Tibet has normally been treated as if it was almost exclusively determined by Anglo-Chinese relations. This approach ignores the fact that after the First World War the Tibetan question become an important component of a much broader controversy on the course of post-war British policy in Asia. The major reasons given for the Chinese incapacity to conclude a Tibetan agreement with Britain during the 1920s have been civil strife and popular opposition within China. The general consensus on the reason for Britain's inability to persuade the Chinese to resume negotiations is the aspiring mood of nationalism in China itself Indeed this is part of the answer, but the other part is that China was awakening to the fact that Britain's power and position in the Far East had been substanfially decreased because of the First World War. Britain no longer had the diplomatic strength needed to bluff China into concluding a settlement of the Sino-Tibetan dispute. It is generally felt that China's intransigence and, at the same time, her weakness gave the Foreign Office no alternative but to sanction a policy of close Anglo-Tibetan relations without reference to China. On the surface this appears to be accurate but it overlooks the general context of Britain's economic situation in the Far East. This, in turn, reflected significant changes in the balance of power in Asia. Britain's position in the Far East had diminished and pressure from the British Legation in Peking, the Far Eastern Department of the Foreign Office and the British commercial community in China operated to shift the main emphasis of British policy in Asia from one of reliance on Japan to closer links with the United States and with a renascent China. With hindsight it can be seen that British policy decisions made during this period were crucial to Tibet's future. This study aims to place this period in the IV important position it should hold in any debate of Anglo-Tibetan relations. The 'forgotten years' deserve a more prominent place in Tibetan studies. The beginning date of 1912, or in Tibetan, the year of Water-Mouse, was the year in which the 13th Dalai Lama returned from two years of exile in British India and declared independence for Tibet. 1933, the year of Water-Bird, was the year in which the 13th Dalai Lama died. The intervening years covered a period of Anglo-Tibetan relations which seem to indicate a movement towards the independence and development of Tibet under the umbrella of British influence. It can be seen in retrospect, however, that British influence in Tibet during the intervening years gradually declined. It was the realisation of this fact which prompted the major question: Why did Britain draw away from relations with Tibet? What were the socio-political and cultural issues that caused Britain to withdraw? The First World War did irreparable damage to the structure of imperialist diplomacy. This fact sets the stage for a discussion of Anglo-Tibetan relations during the 1920s and 1930s. The undermining of the old order came about in two ways. On the one hand, Japanese expansion on the continent, coupled with the temporary distress of the European powers, destroyed the balance in the Far East which, though always precarious, the imperialists had managed to maintain. On the other hand, there were new forces undermining the very foundation of the old diplomacy - the 'new diplomacy' of the United States and the Soviet Union, and the self-conscious assertion of nationalism in China. It was Tibet's particular misfortune to be caught in the clutch of two powerful neighbours, Britain and China, who used her as a pawn in the compassionless game of political intrigue and diplomacy during the inter-war period. In attempting to answer the central question it is essential to connect the Anglo- Tibetan relationship to the intemational situation in which it operated. In tracing the British response to these intemational determinants, a chronological treatment is used. Each chapter therefore contains an evaluation which places Anglo-Tibetan relations in this wider context, identifying the economic, social and political ideas which set the historical boundaries within which British policy decisions operated. The central problem of Britain's relations with Tibet has required research based on the archives of the British Foreign Office, housed in the Public Record Office in London, and supplemented by records in the India Office Library. These comprise a massive collection of letters, telegrams, notes, minutes, reports of the British and Indian governments, including many from the Tibetan and Chinese governments. The principal collection used are the Political and Secret Department Subject Files. The Australian National Library in Canberra has on microfilm the Foreign Office series relating to China which covers political correspondence from 1906 to 1922. In this series is a vast amount of information relating to Anglo-Tibetan relations. The Library also holds original copies of the Foreign Office Confidential prints (1840-), the only set outside Great Britain. Records and manuscripts held in the Library of Tibetan Works and Archives in Dharamsala, India, have also produced some information. The private papers of Sir Charles Bell, Colonel Bailey, Colonel Weir, all of whom visited Lhasa during their time as British Political Officers, adds another dimension to the study. The diaries of Bell, Bailey, Frank Ludow, who set up the first British school in Tibet, and Captain R. S. Kennedy, who accompanied Bell to Lhasa as a medical officer, have also been consulted. These private papers are held at the India Office Library and the British Library. Books written by principal figures, such as Charles Bell, Eric Teichman, Henry Hayden, David Macdonald, WiUiam McGovem and Hugh Richardson, have also been studied as primary source material. Publications by Tibetan authors, R. D. Taring, R. Lha-Mo, K. Dondup, D. N. Tsarong, D. Norbu and T. J. Norbu have contributed a valuable Tibetan perspective. Interviews with surviving participants and observers have been especially useful, particularly regarding personal character details. Some interviews were tape-recorded in Tibetan and later translated and transcribed, others were translated into English during the interview. Interviews with English-speaking participants were typed directly into a computer data base. An application for a research visa for access to the National Archives in New Delhi, India, was successful. However, the application took nearly eighteen months to process and arrived too late for me to make use of the opportunity. Summary: With the return of the Dalai Lama to Tibet in 1912 the British govemment saw an opportunity to consolidate their influence in Tibet and re-establish Tibet as a buffer zone. The declaration of Tibetan independence inspired and facilitated a programme of development by the 13th Dalai Lama. The Dalai Lama intended to initiate changes, political as well as social, which were necessary if his country was to remain independent. The revived problem of a Russian 'menace' in Central Asia was the primary reason for London to exert pressure on China to attend a conference at Simla in 1914. During the conference the British developed a comprehensive programme to revise the status of Tibet. The Anglo-Tibetan Simla Agreement, in effect, proved to be an unequal bargain. In return for India's frontier security, the Tibetans were promised diplomatic and military support in their stmggle with China. From the viewpoint of the Tibetans, the 1914 Anglo-Tibetan agreement identified Britain as 'Tibet's Protector'. Yet, in spite VI of all the discussion on the status of Tibet, the notion of concluding some form of protectorate agreement with the Lhasa govemment was never contemplated. Instead, Britain proclaimed Chinese 'suzerainty' over an 'autonomous' Tibet. The recognition of Chinese suzerainty was to safeguard British commercial interest in China and the support of Tibetan autonomy was to ensure security of India's northern frontier. This provided Britain with informal control of Tibet without involving the granting of responsible govemment and, at the same time, allowed Britain to continue her stationary economic imperialism in China. 1914 ushered in the Great War, which transformed global politics. During the war years Britain was not prepared to, nor in a position to give, active military assistance to Tibet and the opportunity for building a close relationship with an autonomous Tibet diminished. Taking up arms against China for the sake of Tibetan independence was never a consideration. The Dalai Lama considered that Britain had made a commitment to support and protect Tibet by signing the Anglo-Tibetan Agreement. By 1918 he was very disillusioned. The question at issue by the end of the war was whether Britain was in a position to offer any form of diplomatic assistance or protection to Tibet. While China was deemed at the commencement of the First World War not to be a threat to Tibet, the war emphasised the increased danger of a China controlled by Japan. It soon became clear that Japan would attempt to take advantage of the war to expand her influence on the mainland of Asia. Despite this ominous situation, it seemed that pre-war circumstances were reviving in which British pressure would eventually overcome obstinate Chinese resistance, and an agreement on Tibet's status would be achieved. The world, however, was a different place after 1918. During the First World War and the period of post-war settlement British interests in China had radically to be redefined. Altering intemational economic patterns, changing imperial priorities, rising nationalism in the Far East, and the growth of new ideologies all had repercussions. The predominant theme in Anglo-Tibetan relations during the next few years was Britain's attempt to procure Chinese participation in renewed negotiations over Tibet and Peking's constant refusal, under an assortment of excuses, to oblige. The British govemment's response to this rejection on the part of the Chinese govemment was to send a mission to Lhasa. The sending of a mission to Lhasa and the eventual agreement to supply arms and aid to Tibet were viewed at the time as manifesting a new determination in British policy. Its principal result was supposedly to demonstrate that the British govemment intended to treat Tibetan autonomy as a reality by strengthening Tibet's ability to defend Vll itself and by helping to develop the country's resources. Bell's mission to Lhasa, in reality, was a diplomatic bluff to coerce China into resuming negotiations, a bluff which failed. Further indefinite delay, coupled with a continuance of the policy of self-denial, would have involved the risk of the Chinese regaining control over Tibet, as had happened in 1910. The British feared that the Tibetan govemment would conclude an independent treaty with China. Policy makers were faced with the choice of continuing to work for a settlement on existing lines, and mnning that risk, or of taking other measures to protect British interests by adopting a new and more liberal policy towards the Tibetans, which would entail the eventual opening of Tibet and the development of its resources under British auspices. It appeared that Tibet was being drawn more firmly under the umbrella of British influence. With British support, the 1920s seemed to promise a transformation of Tibet: a breaking away from old traditions and a move towards the radimentary development of technological, economic and military infrastmctures which would enable Tibet to become a self-sustaining independent state. Both Charles Bell, Political Officer, Sikkim, and the Government of India wanted a non-interference policy. At the same time they wanted Britain to help develop Tibet in a way that would enable the country to retain its independence but also serve British interests. The eventual decision to provide military assistance and aid symbolised not a new tenacity of purpose but Britain's inability to intimidate China into accepting an ultimatum. The adoption of the so-called 'new and liberal' policy which followed Charles Bell's mission to Lhasa was little more than an attempt to induce the Chinese govemment to abandon their obstmctive attitude and conclude a settlement of the Tibetan question. The British hoped that the spectacle of Tibet's adoption of a policy of selfdevelopment would coerce the Peking government into submission. In retrospect, however, it can be seen that the support given to Tibet was inadequate and the direction which British policy took during the 1920s and 1930s resulted in the eventual loss of Tibet's independence. The conceptual basis of Britain's new policy was flawed: Britain wanted Tibet as a buffer but was not prepared to give the support necessary for it to remain independent. The source of Britain's impaired policy is manifest. On the one hand, they were committed by a promise to the Lhasa govemment to support Tibet in upholding her practical autonomy, which was of importance to the security of India, and, on the other hand, Britain's alliance with China made it difficult to give effective material support to Tibet. What the British wanted was to create a balance. That is to say, give just enough support so that Tibet could protect India's Himalayan border without the British having V l l l to commit themselves to a major defensive initiative, while allowing the Tibetans, meanwhile, to pay for the honour of doing so. The intention was to convince the Chinese that Tibet was becoming self-sufficient. The ultimate objective was to get the Chinese to sign an agreement which would secure, for the British stability in Central Asia. British tactics were impotent and the Foreign Office adopted a 'wait-and-see' approach which dissolved into a 'dormancy' policy. The 1921 Washington Conference represented the crossroad in Anglo-Tibetan policy. Britain's wider economic and political considerations at this time altered Anglo- Tibetan relations. Britain's Tibetan policy was impaired, as statesmen attempted to cope with the transition between pre-war commitments and post-war attitudes. The British government's post-war position made cooperation with the United States, or at least avoidance of American displeasure, the sine qua non of any successful policy. Britain's Tibetan policy during the 1920s and 1930s was to have no policy - to drift: a symbolic act which reflected the decline of British imperialism. The British found themselves on the defensive in the Far East and a desire to retain their trade position in China became dominant. Especially after the 1925 anti-British boycott in China, Britain followed a conciliatory policy and supported Chinese nationalism. The implementation of Britain's new China policy during the late 1920s coincided with a period of intemal political turmoil in Tibet. The critical years for the Tibetan reformation were the 1920s, when the 13th Dalai Lama was attempting to strengthen and develop his nation. British govemment policy during this period limited the embryonic reforms and ultimately led to a weak and unstable Tibet. The Lhasa government exhibited a 'spirit of independence' but by 1925 the Dalai Lama was moving his allegiance away from Britain towards China. The Chinese Nationalist govemment took advantage of this tendency and adopted a 'forward' policy. By 1933 British commercial interests in China made it necessary to subordinate Indian policy towards Tibet to the wider British approach to China. Britain withdrew from relations with Tibet because post-war intemational political and economic changes hastened the demise of the British Empire and required Britain to support Chinese nationalism. Britain had to choose either to support and protect Tibet or look after her own interests. Britain, not unnaturally, chose to do the latter. A limitation to this study has been Australia's geographical isolation from areas of Tibetan studies and the scarcity of scholars involved in Tibetan studies in Australia, and especially in the University of Wollongong. My decision to undertake a study of Tibet for my Ph.D dissertation initially met with much scepticism within my History department. However, Dr. Ian McLaine agreed to supervise me provided a thesis could IX legitimately be developed from a British point of view. I remain grateful for his confidence in me. The absence of scholarly interaction has made my study a solitary and arduous task. Despite modem communication technology, the scholarly debate stiU remains a vital element in the process of history writing. To some extent this limitation was reduced by my participation in the Sixth International Conference on Tibetan Studies in Norway in 1992, and I would like to acknowledge my appreciation to the Institute for Comparative Research in Human Culture, Oslo, for the allocation of funds towards my participation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1433</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Challenging and maintaining the traditional gender order: labour movement responses to women workers in the metal industry, and to equal pay, during World War II</field><field name="creator">Symons, Beverley</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the reactions of the Curtin Labor Government, employer organisations, trade unions, the Communist Party of Australia and other labour movement groups, to the entry of women workers into 'men's jobs' on munitions production and other areas of the metal industry during the Second World War. Motivated primarily by their concern that the employment of cheap female labour threatened male jobs and wage standards, the union movement demanded that the women entering industry receive the same pay rates as the men they were replacing. Rather than institute equal pay by regulation, however, the Govemment decided on the compromise solution of establishing a special wage-fixation tribunal, the Women's Employment Board, and empowering it to award pay rates between 60% and 100% of the male rate assessed on the basis of the female workers' relative efficiency and productivity. This unique wage-fixing method was a radical departure from the entrenched 'family wage' basis long followed by the Commonwealth Arbitration Court under which female wage rates were set at around 54% of the minimum male rate. However, the potential it represented for a significant change in women's secondary position in the workforce, was contained.A primary concern of the thesis is to assess the relative influence of patriarchal ideology and Marxist theory, and of social, political, economic and industrial factors, on the attitudes and practices of key actors towards the issue of equal pay; also, the extent to which the traditional gender order was challenged by the wartime shift in the 'normal' sexual division of labour. It illustrates how the impetus for equal pay became dissipated during the second half of the war, in the face of pragmatic political and economic pressures and the dominant pattern of gender relations.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1434</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Industrial relations in the Australian engineering industry, 1920-1945: the Amalgamated Engineering Union and craft unionism</field><field name="creator">Inaba, Kouichi</field><field name="description">This thesis examines industrial relations in the Australian engineering industry between 1920 and 1945, with a focus on the legal framework, production methods and union activities. During this period, the Australian engineering industry developed from the 'jobbing' to the manufacturing stage. Therefore, the study assesses the extent to which the traditional industrial order, based on the apprentices-tradesmen system, was affected by this transformation. The investigation focuses on the industrial struggle between capital and labour at the point of production, especially the logic of craft unionism.In the 1920s, the industry remained at the 'jobbing' stage and production was heavily dependent on the craft-type skill of tradesman engineers. Capitalising on this technical advantage, their union, the Amalgamated Engineering Union (AEU), held strong influence on the shopfloor. The basic industrial strategy of the AEU, as a craft union, was to impose craft regulation on the industry, in order to protect the conventional job territory of tradesmen and restrict the supply of the skilled workforce. Because the main purpose of the Arbitration Court was to maintain industrial peace, its judgements basically confirmed the existing industrial order.  Therefore, the Arbitration system served the Union favourably, legally consolidating craft regulation. Thus, the Union evolved its relationship with the Arbitration system, while strengthening its ties with the Labor Party to secure and supplement the benefits of Arbitration. The Union's basic policy of 'labourism' was thus established in the 1920s in line with its craft orientation.The recovery from the Great Depression and the ensuing development of the industry in the 1930s corresponded to the transformation of the industry towards manufacturing with the introduction of the new "manufacturing' method. In this period, the Court gave priority to improving the condition of the Australian economy, and it encouraged the introduction of the 'manufacturing' method by legally providing cheap labour like 'process workers' and unindentured juniors for simplified operations. However, the actual deskilling effects of the 'manufacturing' method was limited.  Unlike the 'mass production' method which was characterised by the systematic use of automatic, single-purpose machines, the 'manufacturing' method was characterised by the attachment of deskilling devices like jigs, fixtures and stops to standard machines. By this method, Australian employers, who catered almost entirely for a small and fragmented domestic market, secured flexibility in production. However, because the setting up and the operation of standard machines were still largely dependent on tradesman engineers, the employers could not seriously undermine their employees' industrial ground. With the skill of tradesmen maintaining its value, the AEU continued to adapt traditional polices of craft unionism, and these remained effective. Thus, although the validity and efficacy of labourism was tested through the economic turbulence of the decade, the Union's reformist attitude was consolidated. Although the class consciousness of tradesman engineers increased in the Depression, their craft consciousness outweighed it.During the Second World War, the production of the engineering industry was boosted, because of War necessities. Under the circumstances of national crisis, the Union was forced to loosen craft regulation in order to increase the supply of the skilled workforce. Thus, dilutees and even women were introduced into the industry in great numbers. However, the increase in output was realised not so much by the introduction of new production methods as by the intensification of labour and the extensive overtime. The 'manufacturing' method nevertheless remained and so did the dependence on tradesmen's skill. Because the six months' training of dilutees was not sufficient to give them responsible tasks, the technical advantages of legitimate and competent tradesmen, who had served apprenticeship training, survived. In fact, as production increased, the industry was plagued by the dearth of competent tradesmen. Therefore, the AEU maintained its strong industrial position in opposition to the employers, the Court and the Government, and did not let wartime anomalies break the framework of the traditional industrial order. The AEU's practical and reformist attitudes also remained, sharpening the confrontation with more radical, leftist unions of the non-skilled. The empirical investigation in this study corroborates the theoretical assumptions set out in the Introduction. The industrial power of tradesman engineers derived from their technical advantage in production. Capitalising on it, they successfully resisted the employers' efforts to extend their power to manage. The deskilling process by technological development was not a unilinear and straightforward one. The historical process of struggle between organisations of employers and employees was complex, and neither developed a monolithic class loyalty.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1435</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Political myth: the political uses of history, tradition and memory</field><field name="creator">Ricketson, Peter</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1438</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fatigue strength of adhesively bonded aluminium in a marine environment</field><field name="creator">Smiltnieks, Shane</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1496</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fluid dynamics and droplet generation in the BOF steelmaking process</field><field name="creator">He, He</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1497</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Slender body theory near an interface at very low Reynolds' number</field><field name="creator">Fulford, Glenn Robert</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1561</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Solving linear and nonlinear transient diffusion problems with the Laplace Transform Dual Reciprocity Method</field><field name="creator">Satravaha, Pornchai</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1562</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The energy spectrum of neutrons in a pulsed fast assembly</field><field name="creator">Whittlestone, Stewart</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1636</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A model of visual discomfort and its implications for efficient reading performance</field><field name="creator">Conlon, Elizabeth</field><field name="description">Visual discomfort has been described as an extreme sensitivity to bright or intermittent light and some forms of repetitive pattern stimuli. This sensitivity can result in physical symptoms of eye-strain and headache and induction of anomalous perceptual features with exposure to pattern (Wilkins et al., 1984). The pattern percept produced by the lines of print on a page of text has been likened to the pattern of anomalous stripes which can induce unpleasant effects in sensitive individuals (Wilkins &amp; Nimmo-Smith, 1987). This sensitivity is increased in observers who report regular headache or those who report eye-strain and headache when reading.Scotopic Sensitivity Syndrome was a term coined by Men (1983) to describe a symptom complex which described anomalous physical, perceptual and performance difficulties reported when reading. This symptom complex is characterised by experience of photophobia, eye-strain difficulties, difficulties with depth perception and experience of anomalous perceptual difficulty with exposure to the print on a page of text (Irlen, 1983). As a result of these difficulties severe reading difficulty has been reported.In this work a model of visual discomfort was developed which combined the reports of physical and perceptual difficulties induced from observation of high contrast square-wave repetitive spatial patterns and a page of text (Wilkins et al., 1984; Wilkins &amp; Nimmo-Smith, 1984; 1987) and the performance difficulties reported by Irlen (1983) to occur when reading. A unidimensional model of visual discomfort was developed using a rating scale version of the Rasch model in which person and item parameters were combined on a simple logistic scale. From this model it was predicted that as the number of positive responses to items on the visual discomfort scale increased the probability of experiencing more severe visual discomfort increased. This increasing difficulty would be revealed by a greater number of reports of unpleasant physical side-effects and anomalous perceptual distortion from repetitive spatial patterns. Performance difficulty if present would be reflected in reduced task efficiency.The similarities between this model and Wilkins (1986a) conceptualisation of visual discomfort was tested with investigation of reports of unpleasant physical side-effects and perceptual distortion from observation of square-wave gratings of intermediate spatial frequency and a page of text. It was found that higher scorers on the visual discomfort scale reported significantly more unpleasant physical side-effects and perceptual distortions from all the pattern types presented than low scorers on the scale. Further analysis demonstrated that high headache susceptibility observers also obtained higher scores on the visual discomfort scale, and reported a significantly greater number of unpleasant physical side-effects from observation of the high contrast square-waves than low headache susceptibility observers. Reports of perceptual distortion among this high headache susceptibility group produced inconsistent results. It was concluded that the visual discomfort scale was a more sensitive measure of visual discomfort than unitary reports of single physical characteristics, although these may contribute.The spatial frequency at which most severe anomalous effects were induced was also investigated. Classifying observers into groups on the basis of scores obtained on the visual discomfort scale three groups, a severe, moderate visual discomfort and control group were formed. The results of these experiments demonstrated that for the severe visual discomfort group when a large pattern size and ten second exposure duration was used greatest physical unpleasantness and perceptual distortion was reported in the intermediate spatial frequency range and for the control and moderate visual discomfort groups greatest difficulty of both types was reported at high spatial frequency. When pattern size was reduced all groups reported greatest difficulty of both types at high spatial frequencies. These findings were explained in terms of a lower threshold of stimulation for the severe visual discomfort group in the intermediate spatial frequency range when a large pattern size and ten second exposure duration was used.Additional findings from these studies demonstrated that a single spatial frequency channel may be sufficient to induce unpleasant effects in both groups. The spatial frequency of greatest sensitivity differed among groups. This finding failed to support the hypothesis that the most sensitive spatial frequency channel would correspond to the most sensitive channel at threshold levels. The level in the visual system at which these effects are generated appears to extend from a retinal to cortical level, with the severe visual discomfort group reporting a number of illusory features induced at a cortical level when an intermediate spatial frequency of large size was presented.In order to examine the effects of this sensitivity a number of performance tests were conducted. Several experiments manipulated the square-wave-like structure of the global pattern. It was found that the severe visual discomfort group performed a letter orientation identification task significantly more slowly than other groups, although the moderate visual discomfort group reported significantly greater subjective difficulty with task performance. The performance of all visual discomfort groups on the Coding-B subtest of the Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children - Revised differed significantly from one another with the severe visual discomfort group performing least efficiently on the task. A strong relationship was found between total scores on the visual discomfort scale and Coding-B score. As the score on the visual discomfort scale increased the score on the Coding-B test decreased. This relationship accounted for 69% of the variance in the data. The severe visual discomfort group also read a text passage significantly more slowly than other groups, although comprehension did not differ from that of other groups. The performance results were explained in terms of McConkie and Zola's (1987) model of visual attention when reading. This model used a four level object hierarchy extending from the global percept of the page to the word level. It was argued that as a result of extreme sensitivity to the pattern percept the severe visual discomfort group is unable to avoid attending to the global pattern percept of the page. This produces unpleasant somatic and perceptual effects and reduces attention to the word and letter level, thus producing performance difficulties. It was predicted that this difficulty may be induced by anomalous interactions between the sustained and transient mechanisms, due to increased activity in the transient mechanism or decreased activity in the sustained mechanism. In some cases visual discomfort may be so great that the perceptual and physical difficulty generated may produce interference leading to higher level cognitive difficulties. This explanation does not fully describe visual discomfort as some observers experience performance difficulty when a square-wave-like percept is not presented. In this case more severe difficulty may concurrently exist.It was concluded that subjective report of physical and perceptual difficulty may suggest the presence of visual discomfort, however, coexisting performance difficulty must also be observable in the case of severe visual discomfort where a visual processing deficit is present. Overall this research demonstrates that a latent visual discomfort trait does exist. Scotopic Sensitivity Syndrome can be explained within this framework as a perceptual difficulty resulting from sensitivity to the pattern percept from the page of printed text. The efficacy of colour in reducing the unpleasant effects induced was less clear, although performance for the severe visual discomfort group only was enhanced when colour was added to the display. The colour producing improved performance, however, varied between observers. More detailed research is required to further investigate this effect.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1643</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A social constructivist base for community psychology</field><field name="creator">Hampton, Greg</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1644</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of women in transition: becoming a nurse</field><field name="creator">Bell, Pamela</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1645</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into the relationships between perfectionism with locus of control and coping style, familial socialisation effects and perfectionism, and the development of four categories of perfectionism</field><field name="creator">Pearce, Geoffry Daniel</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1647</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Auditory event-related potentials in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder: developmental and clinical aspects</field><field name="creator">Johnstone, Stuart J.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1648</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dehumanization: understanding the paradox of human interaction</field><field name="creator">Keenahan, Debra</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1656</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sacred &amp; profane: sacred &amp; violent : towards understanding priestly sexual violence</field><field name="creator">Medley, Mary</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1739</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Financial deregulation, banking development, and the likelihood of banking fragility: the case of Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Astiyah, Siti</field><field name="description">The objective of this thesis is to examine the relationship between interest rates, saving through the banking sector, credit from banks, and private investment using the financial deregulation hypothesis and the determinants of the probability of banking fragility for the Indonesian case. Some of the financial deregulation hypothesis related to those variables and the determinants of the likelihood of banking fragility has been tested using cross country data, but only a few studies have been performed using country specific data and there is no study for the particulars of the Indonesian case. Therefore, this study is intended to fill those gaps and add to the literature on the links between financial deregulation, banking intermediation, and banking fragility in the Indonesian economy. Moreover, this study will add the additional credit fiinctions associated with state banks and national private banks and add additional variables to the credit fiinction to consider specific issues associated with the Indonesian financial sector such as borrowing from Bank Indonesia. In addition, this study covers the 1997 financial and banking crises period, therefore this study will use a unit root test to consider the possibility of the presence of a structural break associated with the 1997 financial and banking crises for variables most relevant to the monetary and banking sectors in Indonesia.To investigate the relationship between interest rates, saving through the banking sector, credit from banks and private investinent using the financial deregulation hypothesis, it is hypothesised that real interest rates will encourage saving through the banking sector. Furthermore, it is hypothesised that credit from banks plays important role as a channel between saving through the banking sector and private investinent. It implies that financial deregulation contributed to increasing private investment through the availability of credit from banks and in turn it contributed to increasing economic growth. This hypothesis is in line with Shaw's views on debt intermediation. However, private investment is also hypothesised to be related to net capital flows of the private sector which essentially were foreign borrowings. Therefore, it suggests that private investment is not only financed by domestic banks but also by foreign borrowing. If most of the foreign borrowing is unhedged, a sudden large depreciation of the domestic currency will reduce the net worth of the borrower, which in tiim, will contribute to increasing banking problems. The problem in the banking sector, however, is often associated with other factors. Therefore, it is hypothesised that the probability of banking fragility is influenced by three groups of variables namely financial deregulation variables, macroeconomic variables, and group bank specific variables.This thesis found that positive real interest rates significantly affect real saving through the banking sector and that real saving after being reduced by the minimum reserve requirement is positive and significantly affects real credit from the banking sector in the long run. Real credit from the banking sector is also positively affected by borrowing from Bank Indonesia. Moreover, real credit from the banking sector positively and significantly affects real private investment and real private investment is also positive and significantly related to net capital flows of the private sector in the long run. This finding supports the evidence that real private investment was associated with credit from the banking sector and net capital flows of the private sector. By examining the impact of real interest rates on real saving through the banking sector, real saving through the banking sector adjusted for minimum reserves on real credit from the banking sector, and real credit from the banking sector on real private investment, there is evidence that an increase in real interest rates accompanied by a credible financial policy is associated with an increase in real private investment through the credit availability effect at least up to the second quarter of 1997. This finding is consistent with Shaw's views on debt intermediation, which are that an increase in banking intermediation contributes to increased private investment. An increase in banking intermediation which is indicated by increased credit to the private sector, however, is also often associated with an increased probability of banking fragility.This thesis found that the probability of banking fragility in Indonesia is significanfly related to financial deregulation variables and group bank specific variables for both the sample periods 1986:3-1997:2 and 1986:3 1999:2. On the other hand, macroeconomic variables are not significant in influencing the probability of banking fragility for the sample period 1986:3-1997:2, but are significanfly related to the probability of banking fragility for the sample period 1986:3-1999:2.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field

emission sources and their regulation</field><field name="creator">Bloem, Peter</field><field name="description">Air pollution from sulfur dioxide (SO2) in the Wollongong/Port Kembla region, New South Wales, Australia, has been of major concern for nearly 100 years. This longterm situation is due to the presence of local major industries which emit the gas, in particular, a copper smelter at Port Kembla, established in 1907. Extensive information on the emission and control of sulfur dioxide from this smelter has been reported over the years by the community, government and industry. Systematic monitoring of ambient atmospheric levels of sulfur dioxide was first undertaken in the region between 1957 and 1961. It recommenced in 1970 and has continued to the present day. This study is the first comprehensive, spatio-temporal analysis of all available ambient atmospheric sulfur dioxide monitoring data for the region. Previous reviews have tended to average data for the whole region, without considering the trends in specific locations and did not explore in any detail the relative contributions of major emission sources, such as the smelter. Two key factors were suspected to influence atmospheric sulfur dioxide levels in the region. The first was the nature of primary metallurgical operations undertaken at the smelter known to generate sulfur dioxide and any associated pollution abatement measures. The second was NSW government regulation regarding pollution control at the smelter. The interplay of these factors and their effect on ambient sulfur dioxide levels was explored over four distinct time periods namely; 1908 to 1965, 1966 to 1988, 1989 to 1995 and 1996 to 2006. The study found the copper smelter at Port Kembla has been a dominant source of elevated sulfur dioxide concentrations recorded in the area. There has been an overall decline in the atmospheric levels of sulfur dioxide from 1957 to the present day. The most significant downward trends in these sulfur dioxide concentrations were strongly associated with reductions in the load of sulfur dioxide emitted from the smelter. These were closely linked to changes in smelting technology (progression from batch &#8211; type to more continuous operation) and increasing pollution abatement (increasing sulfur capture) at the facility. The most significant of these reductions have tended to coincide with government intervention and regulation. This study provides a valuable retrospective on trends in air quality in the region and the environmental history of technology and regulation at the smelter in addressing ambient sulfur dioxide levels which, to date, have been poorly recorded.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2561</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using intelligent agents to identify trends in multi-dimensional databases</field><field name="creator">Rattanaphuwalux, Surapong</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2570</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of culture as a barrier to the implementation of Lotus Notes in selected Chinese organizations</field><field name="creator">Huang, Zhi</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2571</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Correction of transmission contamination in &#8310;&#8311;Ga</field><field name="creator">Kheruka, Subhash Chand</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2704</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The alkaloids of tylophora crebriflora characterization and structural determination of tylocrebrine</field><field name="creator">Rudzats, Richards</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2734</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of a field test of rowing performance potential</field><field name="creator">Randell, A.

Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Irianto, Gugus</field><field name="description">Privatisation has been interpreted in a variety of ways. It encompasses a variety of aspects such as ideology, politics, the economy, financial, as well as social implications and the global context. Above all, privatisation is conclusively understood as a medium of &#8216;reality&#8217; construction. It is a policy that does create a newly constructed distribution of wealth and power and reveals conflicts of interests among various parties.The fundamental determinant of privatisation is ideological, which is the government&#8217;s inclination to praise laissez faire (liberalism/neo-liberalism) rather than interventionist systems. The other central issue of privatisation is about efficiency or performance of state ownership vis-&#224;-vis private ownership. Beyond these aspects, privatisation is commonly exercised by countries that are in the middle of a deep economic crisis, facing soaring foreign debt, dealing with a widening budget deficit and dependent on international agencies, particularly the IMF and the World Bank (Ramamurty, 1992).Considering the nature of privatisation, a study on privatisation of stateowned enterprises is argued to be best placed in such a context. Such a study is parallel to the call to study accounting within its environment. Whilst a variety of theoretical frameworks of critical accounting studies are available, this study utilises one of them which is the political economy of accounting (PEA), a theoretical framework pioneered by Tinker (1980), advanced in the works of Cooper and Sherer (1984) and others and &#8216;applied&#8217; in the case of privatisation, such as, in the works of Shaoul (1997a, 1997b), Arnold and Cooper (1999), and Uddin and Hopper (2001, 2003).Grounded in such a framework, this study is an enquiry into the privatisation of PT Semen Gresik (Persero) Tbk., a state-owned enterprise in Indonesia which operates in the cement industry. The privatisation of this company was carried out as part of broader policy reforms and executed at three consecutive times in 1991, 1995, and 1998. These gradual divestments have been completed within different contexts. The latest partial divestment sparked heavy opposition to the hegemonic nature of MNCs from various stakeholders. A variety of issues ranging from justice and fairness, job security, financial aspects, to the economic sovereignty have been raised. Accounting and accountants are at the nerve centre of such discourse. Whilst various deficiencies are apparent in the &#8216;construction&#8217; of such policy, above all, the case raises the fundamental issue of the distribution of wealth and power, which, unlike that in Malaysia, the Indonesian government has failed to address.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/522</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A new class of convolutional neural networks based on shunting inhibition with applications to visual pattern recognition</field><field name="creator">Tivive, Fok Hing Chi</field><field name="description">In the contemporary era of increased information overload, there is a growinginterest in a new class of computational intelligence systems. These systems have been proven as powerful and versatile computational tools for solving certain types of problems that are too complex to be analyzed with traditional analytical means. Inspired by the computational mechanism of the human brain, many researchers have looked into neurobiology for new inspiration to solve more complex problems than those based on traditional computational techniques. Artificial neural networks, evolving from neuro-biological insights, give computer systems an amazing capability to actually learn from input data to generate solutions for problems that are too abstract to be understood or too resource-intensive to tackle. Although neural networks have been applied with success in many industries, there is a continuing demand for new types of hierarchical artificial neural networks that can overcome some of the drawbacks of the earlier models. This thesis presents a new class of convolutional neural networks based on the physiologically plausible mechanism of shunting inhibition with its various systematic connection schemes. The network has a generic architecture in which shunting inhibitory neurons are used as feature extraction elements. A series of training algorithms, ranging from first-order gradient methods to Quasi-Newton and hybrid methods, have been implemented to adapt the synaptic weights of the developed networks; all of them have been successfully used to train the convolutional neural networks for a classification task.To demonstrate their capability in real life applications, the convolutional networks are employed in a face detection system and a handwritten digit recognition system. The face detector has 383 trainable network parameters and achieves a detection rate of 98%for detecting human faces on a large set of unconstrained and complex images. The handwritten digit recognition system, on the other hand, has 2722 trainable parameters, and its classification rate is 97.3% for recognizing human handwritten numerals. Besides these two applications, the developed network is analyzed for its built-in invariance, and it is implemented as a rotation invariant face classifier. The network achieves a classification rate of 97.3% in the rotation range &#177;900, and for 360&#176; in-plane rotation, it has a correct detection rate of 93.6% at 5% false detection rate. These classification results demonstrate that the new class of convolutional neural networks has excellent generalization capability and achieves rotation invariance by adapting its connection weight matrices (receptive fields) as invariant feature detectors.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field

inter-relationships among health status, education, income and lifestyle factors: evidence from Australia</field><field name="creator">Lee, Jae Hyung</field><field name="description">This dissertation examines the inter-relationships among health, education, income, and health-related behaviour as measured by alcohol consumption and smoking. The cross-section models are estimated using data from Australia's sixty-one statistical regions to analyse multiple causal relationships among factors taken as endogenous. Classifying health indicators as 'no recent illness', 'no chronic condition', and 'self-assessed good or excellent health', ten models are presented and econometrically evaluated. The first, second, third, fourth, and fifth models take the proportions of persons with no recent illness and no chronic conditions, the proportion of persons aged 18 years or over with self-assessed good or excellent health, the proportion of persons aged 15 years or over with post-school qualifications, and nominal gross annual median income of persons aged 15 years or over, respectively, as endogenous. The inter-relationships among the proportion of persons with no recent illness, the proportion of persons aged 18 years or over with self-assessed good or excellent health, and the proportion of persons aged 18 years or over with moderate alcohol consumption are specified in the sixth, seventh, and eighth models. The proportions of persons aged 18 years or over with cigarettes consumption and with excessive alcohol consumption are taken as endogenous in the ninth and tenth models.Diagnostic checks are conducted to evaluate ah the models. The tests include the non-nested tests, the tests of independence, the tests for endogeneity and exogeneity, the RESET tests for functional form misspecification, and the tests for heteroskedasticity. The parameter stability of the models is also tested and then (if any instability is apparent) parameter instability analysis is carried out. In addition, the direct, indirect, and total effects of variables exogenously determined in the individual models are manifested, since all the models are identified.The empirical evidence is consistent with the hypotheses that there are multiple inter-relationships (a) among the proportion of persons with each of no recent illness and no chronic conditions, the proportion of persons aged 18 years or over with self-assessed good or excellent health, the proportion of persons aged 15 years or over with post-school qualifications and nominal gross annual median income of persons aged 15 years or over, (b) among the proportion of persons with no recent illness, the proportion of persons aged 18 years or over with self-assessed good or excellent health and the proportion of persons aged 18 years or over with moderate alcohol consumption, and (c) between the proportions of persons aged 18 years or over with cigarettes consumption and with excessive alcohol consumption.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1325</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adaptive power system stabiliser</field><field name="creator">Khodabakhshian, Amin</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1337</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Automatic depth maps generation through absorption in a colour liquid</field><field name="creator">Shi, Hao</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1338</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Composite axial flux induction motor</field><field name="creator">Platt, D.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1341</field></doc><doc><field name="title">War and trade: Siamese interventions in Cambodia, 1767-1851</field><field name="creator">Rungswasdisab, Puangthong</field><field name="description">Cambodia's status as a "weak vassal" of Siam and Vietnam has been a matter of consensus amongst historians. Most previous studies on Thai-Cambodian relations are based on the framework of tributary relation, emphasising the factor of political and ideological conflict among the courts of Siam, Cambodia and Vietnam. Based on such a framework, scholars have tended to conclude that Siam had no real economic motivation in Cambodia. This thesis aims at reexamining the history of the Thai-Cambodian relations between 1767-1851, in terms of two economic factor: trade and manpower. This thesis argues that trade and manpower, which were the basis of power of traditional states in Southeast Asia, were the economic reasons for Thai interventions in Cambodia. The consolidation of Thai power over Cambodia, as part of the trans-Mekong basin, was essential for the development of Siamese economy between the Thonburi and early Bangkok periods. The effective control of trade and manpower in the trans-Mekong basin enabled Siam to rebuild its devastated economy after the fall of Ayudhya and return to its former position as one of the most powerful states in the region in the early nineteenth century. However, the presence of the Vietnamese created difficulties for the Thai consolidation of power over Cambodia as well as other parts of the Mekong region. The major factor stimulating conflict between the Thai and the Vietnamese in Cambodia was the attempts by these two rivals to control local trade networks in the area.As for the Cambodian state, the economic conditions significantly determined the political configuration of Cambodia in the mid-nineteenth century. Its economic basis was either appropriated or largely destroyed by successive wars, devastation and depopulation by its powerful neighbours. Besides, economic interest and extemal interventions further exacerbated factionalism in the Cambodian state. The role of the Khmer nobles in northwestern Cambodia, Battambang and Siemreap, was critical in sustaining Thai domination in Cambodia. The development of Battambang and Siemreap reveals a regional diversity in history of Cambodia. The two provinces not only retained different administrative systems from other Cambodian regions, but were also cut off entirely from the jurisdiction of the Cambodian ralers in Udong/Phnom Penh.Since Cambodia's basis of power was destroyed, its rulers lacked effective means of implementing policy and securing the loyalty of the okya. The weakness of the Cambodian state revealed in its vulnerability to both local revolts and external incursions. Such conditions were an obstacle for the Cambodian state in achieving real independence from the domination of the Thai and the Vietnamese. In fact, by the mid-nineteenth century, Cambodia ceased to exist as a viable pohtical entity.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field

A.I.</field><field name="description">This research focusses on the behaviour of small and medium scale firms in Metropolitan Colombo, Sri Lanka. It argues that the more recent emphasis on organisational structure offers an appropriate conceptual and methodological frame for studying the locational behaviour of small manufacturing firms in Sri Lanka.In firms in developing countries family ownership,small size, labour intensive technologies and lack of organisation are main characteristics of small and medium scale industries. However, it has been recognised that there exist fundamental structural differences among the firms in this sector in Sri Lanka. Small and medium scale industrial sector consisting of so-called registered and unregistered firms, different structural features reflect differences in size, capital investment, ownership pattern, family participation, raw material utilisation, export orientation and the relationships with government organisations. These structural differences go some considerable way towards explaining the behaviour of small and medium scale manufacturing firms in Colombo, and the general hypothesis is that the nature of the interactions of small enterprises depend upon their internal organisational structure.The study focussed on three types of industries (textile, rubber and metal) in identifying the organisational structure of firms and in analysing the relationships between organisational structure and functional linkages, attitudes of entrepreneurs, patterns and degree of locational adjustments and the different responses of small firms to change in government policy. The study uses a sample of I36 firms and data and information were based on a questionnaire survey and extensive fieldwork in Sri Lanka, conducted during the period from January to July, 1984.Principal components analysis has been used to define the structure of firms and to identify the significant characteristics of industries. The extent to which the organisational structure of firms is reflected in their behaviour was investigated by means of correlation and stepwise multiple regression analyses. The study also recognises the importance of government policies which are important in terms of spatial pattern and structure of small and medium scale industries in Colombo and the way in which industries have perceived these policies and responded to them.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field

films</field><field name="creator">Li, Aihua</field><field name="description">Thin films of the high temperature superconductor (HTS) YBa2Cu3O7 (Y123) are of great potential in a wide range of applications, including low-loss microwave cavities and filters, bolometers, various superconducting terminal devices, flux transformers, and dc and rf superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs). They also have the potential to give insight into the fundamental mechanisms governing high temperature superconductivity. Y123 coated conductors, the so-called second generation superconducting tapes, which are based on Y123 thin film technology, also have great applications in carrying large superconducting currents. However, some important challenges or fundamental problems hindering their practical applications need to be solved scientifically. These include: finding the most effective and economic approaches to enhance the superconducting critical current density in high magnetic fields; reducing the fabrication cost with high reproducibility; arriving at a profound understanding of the relationship between microstructure and superconducting performance, etc. The work described in this thesis deals with these challenges, with an emphasis on fundamental studies on supercurrent enhancement through nanotechnology and nanoengineering using advanced thin film fabrication methods, including pulsed laser deposition and spin coating, and on the relationship between microstructure and supercurrent performance.An overview of the research on HTS thin films in the period from 2000 to the end of 2005 is given in Chapter I. Attention was paid to both Y123 films and coated conductors fabricated using both PLD and chemical methods, on both single crystal and metallic substrates. The related electrical and magnetic properties are also reviewed. In the first part of the thesis work, Y123 thin films with and without Ag nanoparticle inclusions were grown by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) on YSZ (100), SrTiO3 (100), and LaAlO3 (100) single crystal substrates. A discontinuous layer of Ag nanodots was deposited on the substrates prior to the deposition of Y123 films. The Y123 films grown on such surfaces modified with Ag nanodots were extensively characterised by atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), AC susceptibility and DC magnetisation. The effects of the density of Ag nanodots, which was controlled by the numbers of PLD shots, on the microstructures and resultant critical current density Jc have been studied systematically. Results showed that under fixed physical deposition conditions Jc increased monotonically with the number of Ag shots, n, for films grown on both STO and LAO substrates. At 77 K, the Jc increased from 106 to 3.2 &#215;106 A/cm2 for LAO and from 8&#215;105 to 3.5&#215;106 A/cm2 for STO as n increased from 0 to 150. At 5 K, the Jc was enhanced by approximately four times at both low and high fields. These values obtained due to nano-Ag inclusions are comparable to the best results achieved by other prestigious research groups around the world. However, for films grown on YSZ substrate, Jc increased from 2&#215;105 to 2&#215;106 A/cm2 as Ag shots increased from 0 to 30, and decreased to 9&#215;105 for n &#179; 60. Detailed microstructure investigations indicated that the crystallinity and ab alignment gradually improved as the number of Ag-nano-dots increased. In the second part of the thesis work, YBa2Cu3Oy films were grown on single crystalline YSZ, SrTiO3, and MgO, and on polycrystalline Ag substrates using non-fluorine sol-gel and spin coating methods. The effects of heat treatment conditions on the phase evolution and microstructures were investigated using optical microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and atomic force microscopy. A detailed study was performed on the phase formation, degree of grain orientation, formation of cracks, and surface morphologies. It was found that sintering temperature and roughness of substrate surfaces are two key factors in controlling crack morphologies. With several important advantages, including precursor solution stability, improved film density, and elimination of HF during processing, high-quality YBCO films have been achieved on single crystal substrates with transport critical current densities up to 106 A/cm2. An extensive study was carried out on the alteration of precursor solution stoichiometry and its effects on superconducting properties. Fluorine-free sol-gel&#8211;derived films on the LAO substrate exhibited epitaxial growth with excellent in- and out-of-plane texture. Experimental details are given on the sol-gel synthesis chemistry and XRD and TEM characterization of the YBCO thin films.The phase evolution of YBCO films prepared by the fluorine-free sol-gel method was also systematically investigated using in-situ high temperature optical microscope observations and x-ray diffraction. The conversion sequences and the final resultant products have been determined for barium, copper and yttrium containing precursors, respectively. It was found that those conversions are strongly dependent on the experimental conditions such as water partial pressure. The formation of YBCO starts at a temperature of around 710 oC and lasts up to 800 oC over about 15 min. Depending on the barium containing phases and experimental conditions. It is suggested that a- and caxis YBCO grains are governed by different reactions.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/520</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The isotopic signature of nitrous oxide emitted from agricultural soils measured by FTIR spectroscopy</field><field name="creator">Parkes, Stephen</field><field name="description">Agriculture contributes 16% to Australia&#8217;s greenhouse gas emissions, of which 23% are the result of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. Global N2O emissions from agricultural activities have increased substantially since the beginning of the industrial revolution. This has been driven by the increase in the amount of nitrogen added to agricultural soils, stimulating the N2O-producing nitrification and denitrification processes. Currently there is a poor quantitative understanding of N2O emissions from nitrification and denitrification and their controlling parameters. This is difficult to quantify since N2O emissions from nitrification and denitrification occur simultaneously. As N2O produced from these microbial processes have different stable isotopic signatures, stable isotope measurements have shown promise as a method to partition N2O emissions. Additionally, the intramolecular 15N site preference of N2O presents a further stable isotopic measurement which can be used for studies of N2O emissions from nitrification and denitrification. In this thesis, the absolute intramolecular 15N site preference of N2O measured using high resolution FTIR. The FTIR system was fully calibrated for site preference measurements of 15N enriched N2O sample. In addition, using the FTIR system the absolute site preference value for the N2O working standard used as a reference for isotopic measurements was determined. Using this absolute site preference value, it was possible to determine a value of 19.9 (&#177;2.1)&#8240; for the absolute site preference of tropospheric N2O. The absolute site preference value of the N2O working standard was used to report measurements of field collected N2O samples on the absolute scale. To determine the intramolecular site preference of N2O produced from nitrification and denitrification, a 2 week field campaign was completed at a dairy farm in south eastern Australia. Soil plots were treated with 15N-labelled NH4 + or NO3 -, either at application rates of 100 or 50 kg-N.ha-1, followed by irrigation. Following treatment, daily measurements were made of the N2O emissions, isotopic composition of N2O, soil mineral nitrogen concentrations and 15N composition, as well as soil moisture. From the interpretation of the collected data, intramolecular site preference signatures of -17 (&#177;5)&#8240; was determined for nitrification and a range of 0.5 to 12.3&#8240; was attributed to denitrification. Using the 15N measurements of N2O, it was possible to estimate the N2O emissions produced from nitrification and denitrification. For all treatments, emissions produced from denitrification far outweighed those from nitrification. These measurements indicated that the reduction of N2O to N2 was a key process controlling N2O emissions. Additionally, there was a clear relationship between the intramolecular site preference of N2O, and the amount of N2O reduced to N2. This relationship was used to estimate that for treatments receiving NH4 +, 5 &#8211; 22% of the applied nitrogen was emitted as N2.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/129</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation on cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries</field><field name="creator">Guo, Zaiping</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1831</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Keyhole gas tungsten arc welding: a new process variant</field><field name="creator">Jarvis, Brian Laurence</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1833</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Shear behaviour of fully grouted bolts under constant normal stiffness condition</field><field name="creator">Dey, Ashitava</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1837</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modulation of polyphase inverters</field><field name="creator">Strasser, Tony Dieter</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2377</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Numerical integration methods in power electronic simulation</field><field name="creator">Jalilian, Alireza</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2379</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Service provision issues of Universal Personal Telecommunication</field><field name="creator">Chan, Lawrence</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2380</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of the factors influencing the wettability of conducting polymers for fluid control in microfluidic devices</field><field name="creator">Halldorsson, Jenny</field><field name="description">The advent of miniaturised analytical systems has the potential to revolutionise the way in which chemical and biological analyses are made, due to the benefits of reduced reagent consumption, increased sensitivity and decreased analysis times.  With increasingly smaller device dimensions comes the need for more efficient methods of controlling fluid flow on the microscale.  Electrokinetic techniques, such as electrophoresis and electroosmosis, are well suited for delivering analytes and reagents in microfluidic devices, however high driving voltages and power requirements limit the size to which the device may be miniaturised and thus limit the applicability of these flow control methods for portable, hand-held devices.  In order to overcome this limitation, an elegant use of surface tension forces which dominate at the microscale is necessary.Conducting organic polymers, such as polythiophene and polypyrrole, have found widespread use in recent years due to their attractive mechanical properties and processability, in addition to their ability to be reversibly switched between oxidised (conducting) and reduced (insulating) forms.  This redox switching may be accompanied by a change in polymer properties such as wettability and surface energy which may be altered dramatically upon external stimulation, commonly in the form of a small applied electrical potential.The effect of redox switching upon conducting polymer wettability for fluid control in microfluidic devices is the central theme which was explored in this thesis. In particular, the aims of this thesis were to characterise the wettability of conducting polymers and investigate the factors which influence it, as well as explore the use of conducting polymers for fluid control in simple, dynamically controlled microfluidic devices, based on the change in wetting properties upon in&#172;-situ electrochemical redox switching.  The role of polymer oxidation state, film thickness, polymerisation substrate and the configuration of the electrochemical cell used for fluid control were considered.  Goniometry and tensiometry were used to characterise polymer wetting properties, while microscopy techniques (scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy and optical profilometry) were used to probe the morphology of polymer and understand the role of roughness on conducting polymer wettability and fluid movement.  The electrochemical properties of polymers were characterised by cyclic voltammetry, while Raman spectroscopy was employed to gain insight into the role of water and film thickness in determining the oxidation state of polyterthiophene in Chapter 3.The insights gained during polymer wettability characterisations were extended to investigate surface tension-induced fluidic control using electrochemical cells in both channel-based and droplet-based configurations upon the application of a small voltage. The knowledge gained during the course of this study should form the basis for developing devices which will contribute to interesting solutions for improving flow control on the microscale.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/31</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Alpha-2-Macroglobulin: an abundant extracellular chaperone</field><field name="creator">French, Katie</field><field name="description">Alpha-2-macroglobulin (&#945;2M) is a 720 kDa glycoprotein consisting of four identical (180 kDa) subunits and is the major representative of the &#945;-macroglobulin group of plasma proteins, present at high concentrations in human plasma.&#61472;&#945;2M is best known for its ability to inhibit a broad spectrum of proteases which it accomplishes using a unique &#8220;trapping&#8221; method. Protease trapping induces &#945;2M to adopt an activated conformation which exposes a binding site for the low density lipoprotein receptor (LRP), facilitating clearance of the complexes from the body. &#945;2M has been ascribed many biological roles which extend beyond simple protease inhibition including immune regulation, mediation of the inflammatory response via cytokine binding and more recently chaperone activity. &#945;2M has been shown to inhibit the heat-induced precipitation of proteins in vitro through the formation of stable complexes. The work outlined in this study further characterises the chaperone activity of &#945;2M under conditions of heat and oxidative stress and establishes the relationship between this and its role as a protease inhibitor. When present at physiological concentrations, &#945;2M was found to inhibit the oxidation-induced precipitation of lysozyme (lys). In a preliminary study, it was shown that &#945;2M forms stable, soluble complexes with heat-stressed proteins. In the current study, native agarose gel electrophoresis and immunoprecipitation analyses were used to demonstrate that &#945;2M also forms stable, soluble complexes with oxidised proteins. Removal of &#945;2M from human plasma was found to significantly increase the level of plasma protein precipitation under conditions of heat and oxidative stress. Proteins co-purifying with &#945;2M from human plasma (following incubation at either 43 &#176;C or room temperature for 72 h) were analysed by mass spectrometry; this identified fibrinogen as a putative endogenous chaperone client protein of &#945;2M. It was also shown that protease-mediated activation of &#61537;2M abolishes the chaperone activity, but that native &#61537;2M is able to form soluble complexes with heat stressed proteins and then subsequently become activated by protease trapping. Oxidation of (chaperone-inactive) protease bound &#945;2M was shown to restore chaperone activity but not the protease inhibitor function.  These behaviours provide an alternative means for generating &#61537;2M/stressed protein/protease complexes which could be cleared in vivo by LRP-mediated cellular uptake and degradation.The ability of &#945;2M/stressed protein complexes to bind to cell surface receptors was investigated using JEG-3, Hep-G2, and U937 cell lines and granulocytes derived from whole human blood. &#945;2M/CS complexes had limited ability to bind to LRP expressed on the surface of JEG-3 cells. However, preliminary results indicated that activation of &#945;2M (&#945;2M*) and &#945;2M/stressed protein complexes (&#945;2M*/CS) with trypsin resulted in subsequent binding to the surface of JEG-3 cells. Native &#945;2M/CS complexes were found to bind to granulocytes and Hep-G2 cells via unidentified, non-LRP receptors. Collectively, the results presented here further establish &#945;2M as a potent extracellular chaperone with the ability to protect proteins from heat and oxidation-induced stress. &#945;2M appears likely to have a dual role in vivo, as a protease inhibitor and as an extracellular chaperone, the first identified mammalian protein with both activities. The evidence suggests that it may function as part of an extracellular quality control system for protein folding important in the control of inflammation and protein conformational disorders (PCDs) such as Alzheimer's disease and type II diabetes. The pathology of PCDs has been linked to the development of extracellular deposits of misfolded proteins. This thesis provides evidence supporting the hypothesis that &#945;2M binds to misfolded extracellular proteins to keep them soluble and mediates their cellular uptake and subsequent degradation. Future advances in understanding of extracellular protein folding quality control are likely to provide novel insights into the mechanisms underpinning the development of serious human diseases and identify opportunities for the development of new therapies.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/114</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Surface reactions of zinc vapour with steel relevant to the Zn-55%Al-1.5%Si hot dip metal coating process</field><field name="creator">Williams, Joseph James</field><field name="description">Zn-55%Al-1.5%Si coated steel strip is manufactured by the continuous hot dipping process. An important difference in the processing of Zn-55%Al-1.5%Si coated steel when compared with galvanised steel is the higher temperature of the molten alloy bath &#8211;600&#186;C for Zn-55%Al-1.5%Si coatings versus 450&#186;C for galvanised. This increase in temperature leads to an accelerated rate of evaporation of zinc into the pretreatment furnace, leading in turn to various processing difficulties. Zinc vapour in the pre-treatment furnace has long been implicated with defects known within the industry as pinholes and bare patches - uncoated areas where wetting does not occur between the strip and the molten alloy. Despite the association with zinc vapour, the exact mechanisms of pinhole and bare patch formation have not been clearly established. One possible mechanism of pinhole and bare patch formation is the direct reaction of zinc vapour with the strip surface. It has been suggested by industry experts that zinc vapour could condense on the strip, leaving a deposit that prevents wetting by molten Zn-55%Al-1.5%Si alloy. It remains that little is understood of the fundamental nature of the interaction between zinc vapour and a steel substrate. The purpose of this research was to examine the rates and mechanisms of zinc vapour condensation on clean and oxidised steel substrates. Such information is essential for understanding the reactions that occur in the metal coating line furnace. It is intended that this research will strengthen the fundamental knowledge base upon which a solution to the problem can be developed. The experimental work conducted in this study was centred on condensing zinc vapour onto substrates under specific gaseous atmospheres at atmospheric pressure. A major part of the work involved the development of a technique for depositing zinc vapour onto a steel substrate and the design and construction of an experimental apparatus. Preliminary studies were undertaken to define the design criteria for an apparatus in which the rate of condensation of zinc vapour could be measured accurately and the interaction between zinc vapour and clean and oxidised steel substrates could be examined. In this probing exercise, modifications were made to a proven design of an apparatus designed to measure evaporation rates of metals in inert gas atmospheres was used. The preliminary experiments provided a wealth of essential knowledge required to design an experimental facility in which it was possible to accurately measure the rate of condensation of zinc vapour and to study the interaction between zinc vapour and the steel substrate, as well as their potential chemical reactions. This new apparatus was specifically developed for a quantitative assessment of zinc vapour deposition, and allowed the substrate and zinc vapour to be heated in independent, but interconnecting chambers. The exposure of the substrate to the zinc vapour could be controlled with precision, and it was possible to not only measure the zinc vapour condensation rates, but also to assess the effect of using oxidising and reducing gasses during preheating of the substrate. Under conditions of high undercooling, zinc vapour deposited by the island plus continuous thin film mode, while at higher substrate temperatures, close to that expected in the industrial process, the zinc deposited more slowly, and zinc islands did not form on the substrate within the first 60 seconds of exposure. Deposition of zinc vapour on an oxidised substrate occurred at a much higher rate than on a clean steel substrate. This increase in deposition rate has been attributed to a direct reaction occurring between the zinc vapour and the iron oxide without the formation of any liquid condensate. The reaction is: Fe3O4(s) + 4Zn(v) &#8596; 4ZnO(s) + 3Fe(s) This reaction will proceed to the right under sufficiently high partial pressures of zinc vapour, and at substrate temperatures both above and below the saturation temperature of the zinc vapour. It was observed that under sufficiently low partial pressures of zinc vapour, the above reaction is driven to the left. Zinc oxide has a determining influence on the wetting of the strip by the molten alloy. Immersion tests, wherein substrates deposited with zinc vapour were dipped into molten Zn-55%Al-1.5%Si alloy, were carried out to examine the effect of various zinc vapour reactions on the quality of the coatings. Deposition of zinc vapour on both clean and oxidised steel surfaces had a detrimental effect on the coating quality. In cases where zinc was deposited onto a clean steel substrate prior to immersion in the coating alloy, pinholes resulted, while zinc vapour deposition on an oxidised surface prior to immersion led to large scale uncoated areas.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/395</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Digital film dosimetry in radiotherapy and the development of analytical applications software</field><field name="creator">Wang, Yang</field><field name="description">This study is focused on the analysis, evaluation and calibration of low cost computer desktop scanners for possible use in film dosimetry.

It has been shown to work through various mechanisms of action, including 5-&#945;-reductase inhibition. The aims of this study were to develop new analogues related to phenoxodiol in order to increase 5-&#945;-reductase inhibition and to introduce &#945;1A adrenoceptor antagonism in the next generation of isoflavonoid derivatives. The &#945;1A adrenoceptor antagonistic activity was expected to ameliorate the symptoms associated with prostate enlargement. Work towards the design of synthetic target molecules was the focus of the initial stages of the study. Pharmacophores for each of the human 5-&#945;-reductase type I and type II and the rat type II isozymes were generated using CATALYST&#174;. Standard parameters were used and variable weight options were trialled during the generation process. The mapping of phenoxodiol on the human-based 5-&#945;-reductase phamacophores predicted that an additional aromatic ring should increase 5-&#945;-reductase inhibition. Pharmacophores for &#945;1A adrenoceptor antagonism, which were previously generated by Bremner et al, were utilized for the mapping of phenoxodiol. It was concluded that a basic nitrogen moiety was required for the introduction of &#945;1A adrenoceptor antagonism. In the light of these findings, isoflavonoids derivatised at the 2- and 4- positions were designed and assessed on the pharmacophores. Isoflavene derivatives 70 and 67, which incorporated a basic nitrogen at the 2- and 4- positions respectively, were predicted to have &#945;1A adrenoceptor antagonism. The synthetic targets which incorporated an additional aromatic group entailed the 5-methyl thienylisoflavene 71, the phenyl hydrazone 76 and the 2-thiazolyl isoflavene 77. In an attempt to integrate an increase of 5AR inhibition and &#945;1A adrenoceptor antagonism, the target compound 78 was designed which encompasses both an extra aromatic moiety and a basic nitrogen. A new approach to 2-substituted isoflavene derivatives was developed based on nucleophilic attack on an isoflavylium salt. The isoflavylium salt intermediate was generated from a preformed isoflavene by hydride abstraction using a trityl salt. Eight derivatives were synthesized using this method. Eight 4-aryl hydrazone derivatives were synthesized by reacting an isoflavone with the appropriate aryl hydrazine. A number of other 4 substituted isoflavene derivatives were synthesised either by nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl of an isoflavone or by electrophilic addition to the enol tautomer of an isoflavone. A new rearrangement of a C-4 thienyl substituted isoflavanol to a benzo[b]furan system was discovered. Another new rearrangement involving the transformation of the imidazolylhydrazone 162 to the benzo[b]furan derivative 163 was also found. While nitrile precursors of targets incorporating basic amine groups were obtained, reduction to the amines was not successfully achieved. A human 5AR type I assay was developed sourcing LnCap cells for the enzyme. Unfortunately, LnCap cell line contamination occurred resulting in corruption of the assay. Compounds synthesised in this study were also tested for biological activity against a variety of cancer cell lines and a number of compounds with potent anti-cancer properties were identified. In particular the p-nitrophenylhydrazone 159d showed excellent growth inhibitory activity against the androgen dependent prostate cancer cell line and is a potential lead compound for further development. This result indicates that the 5AR pharmacophores generated are predictive.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/597</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fabrication and characterization of superconducting  PLD MgB2 thin films</field><field name="creator">Zhao, Yue</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis was to study the thin film of magnesium diboride (MgB2) superconductor based on PLD synthesis technique. The MgB2 is a very simple binary compound with a number of surprising properties. The discovery of superconductivity with a critical temperature (Tc) of 39 K in bulk MgB2 in January 2001 has attracted a huge research interests worldwide in this material. In a hope to substitute MgB2 superconducting electronics for low temperature superconducting electronics and compete with high temperature superconductors, the preparation techniques of MgB2 thin films need to be advanced from a material engineering point of view. On the other hand, new studies regarding the different behaviours of MgB2 thin films and MgB2 bulks will assist the scientific community to better understand the physics in this superconductor.We began the study with in situ MgB2 film preparation using normal on-axis geometry. The in situ annealing conditions of pulsed laser deposited MgB2 films were studied. We found that the superconducting properties depend in a crucial way on the annealing conditions: temperature, heating rate and time. We tested the Tc dependence of the in situ annealed MgB2 films by changing various process parameters, including laser energy density, target-substrate distance, background gas, annealing temperatures, heating rates and dwell times. The film processing conditions were optimized and good quality in situ films were obtained routinely, with good reproducibility. The hysteresis loops of magnetic moment versus applied field at different temperatures indicate a weak field dependence in high fields. Magnetooptical imaging of the films showed quite homogeneous magnetic flux penetration, indicating structural homogeneity. The films without annealing show no superconductivity.Another method using ex situ annealing has also been tested for a better crystallization of the MgB2 film, as well as for reference purposes. In the ex situ annealing process, we first deposited boron precursor film on a sapphire substrate and then wrapped it in Ta foil and sealed it in a stainless steel tube together with pure Mg pellets, under protective Ar atmosphere. The tube was then annealed in tube furnace and kept at 900&#186;C for 30 min. With this method, we obtained ex-situ MgB2 films of comparable quality as those reported so far in the literature, and used them as a benchmark to test possible improvements in MgB2 thin film technology based on PLD.  Significant differences in properties between the in situ films and ex situ films were found. The ex situ annealed MgB2 film has a Tc onset of 38.1K, while the in situ film has a suppressed Tc onset of 34.5K. The resistivity at 40K for the in situ film is larger than that of the ex situ film by a factor of 6. The residual resistivity ratios are 1.1 and 2.1 for the in situ and ex situ films respectively. The field dependence of the resistivity-temperature curves has been measured. A large slope of the Hc2-T curve was obtained for the in situ annealed film. The Jc-H curves of the in situ film show a much weaker field dependence than those of the ex situ film, attributable to stronger flux pinning in the in situ film. The microstructural differences between the two types of films are observed by AFM and TEM. The small-grain (&lt;60nm) size and a high oxygen level detected in the in situ annealed MgB2 films may be decisive for the significant improvement of Jc and Hc2. In order to enhance the performance of the MgB2 films, various amounts of Si up to a level of 18wt% were added into MgB2 thin films fabricated by pulsed laser deposition. Si was introduced into the PLD MgB2 films by sequential ablation of a stoichiometric MgB2 target and a Si target. The Tc's of the Si added MgB2 thin films were tested. A Jc enhancement was observed in the Si added MgB2 films. For the ~3.5wt% Si addition, the best enhancement circumstance, the magnetic critical current density (Jc) of the film at 5K was increased by 50% as compared to the undoped film.The slope of Hirr(T) and Hc2(T) curves of the 3.5wt% Si added MgB2 film was slightly higher than that for the undoped film. For the application in superconducting electronics, the surface smoothness of the MgB2 thin film is of crucial importance. We pioneered an off-axis deposition geometry in the PLD MgB2 films preparation. Highly smooth and c-axis oriented superconducting MgB2 thin films were successfully achieved with a off-axis geometry. The films were deposited on Al2O3-C substrates, aligned perpendicular to a stoichiometric MgB2 target in a 120 mTorr high purity Ar background gas. An in situ annealing was carried out at 650&#8451; for 1 min in a 760 Torr Ar atmosphere. Despite the short annealing time, an x-ray _-2_ scan shows fairly good crystallization, according to the clear c-axis oriented peaks for the films. Both atomic force microscopy and the x-ray diffraction results indicated that the crystallite size is less than 50nm. The root mean square roughness of our off-axis film was ~4 nm in a 5&#61655;5 &#956;m2 area. The zero resistance Tc value of the best off-axis film reached 32.2 K with a narrow transition width of 0.9 K. The films showed no anisotropy in Hc2-T curves when parallel and perpendicular fields were applied relative to the film surface. The slope of Hc2-T curves is ~1 T/K, which is still among the highest reported values. On the basis of successful preparation of smooth off-axis MgB2 films, we obtained MgB2/Mg2Si multilayer structure by sequentially switching a stoichiometric MgB2 target and a Si target during off-axis pulsed-laser deposition. The transmission electron microscope cross-sectional image of the resulting film exhibits a layered structure with each MgB2 layer being 40-50 nm thick and the Mg2Si inter-layers about 5 nm thick. A clear enhanced anisotropy in the irreversibility lines and the vortex activation energy was observed. Pinning and the flux flow activation energy for this type of film was significantly increased in parallel applied fields.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/816</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Illawarra Methodism in the nineteenth century: a comparative study of Wesleyan and primitive Methodism in Wollongong, 1838-1902</field><field name="creator">Tibbs, Phyllis</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/877</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Illawarra Trades and Labour Council in depression, recovery, and war, 1926-1945</field><field name="creator">Nixon, Shirley</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/878</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of the 1949 Coal Strike on the Illawarra community and its responses</field><field name="creator">Buchan, Alastair James</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/880</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Illawarra Women's Health Centre: from conception to twenty years of operation</field><field name="creator">Miller, Melanie Anne</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/884</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Phenanthropiperidines and related compounds</field><field name="creator">Worth, Brian Robert</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/898</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The telling of tales: an installation and readings concerning waiting</field><field name="creator">Harris, Penelope</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/941</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transformation(death appropriation, conception(birth) identity, transition(life) land</field><field name="creator">Dahlm-Helm, P.

These included the seigniorial mode of production which resulted from the articulation of feudal and indigenous modes and was consolidated in the  eventeenth century in the colonial social formation and manifest in the encomienda and the hacienda.This articulation meant for the Mapuche a significant but not total transformation of their communal mode into a new social formation of patriarchal cacicazgos containing embryonic classes of non-producers and producers. It weakened Mapuche social solidarity and political unity and consolidated patriarchy such that polygamy became, as never before, exclusive to powerful men who in this way concentrated political power, accumulated wealth and secured control of the land, when industrial capitalism was entering its monopolistic and imperialist phase in the industrial centres in the second half of the nineteenth century.Patriarchal capitalism emerged as the dominant mode of production in the Chilean social formation even though seigniorial relations continued in agriculture until the 1960s and despite the resistance of the Mapuche nation which still struggles to recover its expropriated land and suppressed traditions. The study aims also to demonstrate the salience of historical materialism as an efficient instrument of social analysis useful in the revolutionary transformation of capitalism. It contributes to the reconstruction of historical materialism by showing that history and social processes cannot be understood without the study of gender formation and that they are not even, teleological or pre-ordained.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1724</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Feminist utopia and the new fathers: from matrifocal monotropism to biologically grounded universal father hunger</field><field name="creator">Haubold, Erika</field><field name="description">From the early fifties, the defining control over 'the best interest of the child' has developed into the perhaps most powerful tool in sexual politics. An essential part of this ongoing process of redefinition is the men's movement's declaration of the emotionally absent father as psycho- and social pathology and the son's demand for his restitution into their lives. This rhetoric transforms mid-century maternal deprivation into paternal deprivation and almost imperceptibly transmutes the exigencies of the fathers into the essentialized needs of the child. After this 'reinvention' of fatherhood, the relevant literature attests a potential for radical social transformation to those functions and modes of parent-child interaction which have traditionally been marked as the provenience of 'the feminine'.The new masculinist theorist of need construction have joined feminist theorists in their challenge to the normativity of orthodox parental functions. Both disciplines have used the critique of Enlightenment's dichotomous polarities as the theoretical framework for their reinventing of fatherhood and motherhood respectively. But despite their shared subject matter, there are few similarities between the two discourses. Whilst the fatherhood literature argues that Enlightenment's emphasis on the 'Maleness of Reason' has severed the father's connection to his children, feminist theorists maintain that the same phenomenon has secured their conjugal and sex specific parental functions within the family. This thesis explores the discrepancies between masculinist theories of loss and feminist theories of acquisition. It highlights the aggravated tension between complementary and sex transcendence produced by a politics of fatherhood which lays claim to qualified sameness of and radical difference between female and male parenting potentials and functions.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1725</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Juvenile delinquency in the Illawarra region: a self-report study</field><field name="creator">Ahmadi, Habib</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1726</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rattling the iron cage: a selection of cultural and critical investigations</field><field name="creator">Walton, Paul</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1727</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A history of the relationship between the Queensland branch of the Australian Workers' Union (AWU) and the labour movement in Queensland from 1913-1957</field><field name="creator">Clothier, Craig</field><field name="description">In 1913 one of the most significant events in the history of Australian industrial relations and Labor politics occurred - the  amalgamation of several rural unions with the preexisting Australian Workers' Union (AWU) to form a truly national AWU. Perhaps the most dominant branch of the newly amalgamated AWU was the Queensland Branch. Encompassing not only shearers and other workers within the pastoral industry the Queensland AWU represented numerous workers (mostly rural and semi or unskilled) in mining, construction, the sugar industry, transport and the hospitality and other service industries. At a stroke the Queensland AWU became far and away the most numerically strong industrial organisation in that state. That industrial strength soon manifested itself into political power through the close relationship that developed between the AWU and the Labor Party.This thesis will examine the rise of the Queensland Branch of the AWU and in particular its relationship with the Labor Party and the workers it sought to represent. Of particular interest will be the means by which the AWU attained, maintained and ultimately lost its dominance over the Queensland labour movement, the Labor party and more broadly the Queensland electorate.It will be the contention of this thesis that AWU was able to maintain its level of influence and power over such a sustained period due to the geographic, industrial, social and political peculiarities of Queensland that allowed for the rise of a rurally based, reformist yet economically and socially conservative organisation such as the AWU to emerge. Coupled with this was the AWU's ability to manipulate the mechanisms of the industrial and political labour movement in Queensland to ensure a steady flow of AWU nominees to the Labor Party and then Parliament. This in turn allowed for the passing of legislation beneficial to the interests of the AWU and its supporters. A mixture of strict control, numerical superiority and genuine industrial and economic progress for its members and sympathizers ensured that however ruthless its methods the AWU would continue to receive the necessary support. Only in the face of a changing economic and industrial climate and the potential threat to its power from within the labour movement did the AWU depart from its traditional policies and embrace militancy in order to preserve its power. Such actions were anathema to its supporters within the AWU and the Labor Party and the electorate as a whole. In an effort to maintain its power in the face of a largely imagined threat the leadership of the AWU willingly risked the security of the Labor government in Queensland to assert its power. The result was disastrous for both the AWU and the Labor Party in Queensland.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1996</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sample design and estimation for household surveys</field><field name="creator">Clark, Robert Graham</field><field name="description">Household surveys are a widely-used tool for obtaining information about a population of people.  A sample of households is selected followed by a sample of people within selected households.  Households exhibit structure with variables measured on people in the same household often being dependent.  Household sizes vary significantly and the strength of dependencies within a household may depend on its size.  Traditional sample design and estimation methods ignore these dependencies.Methodologies which explicitly allow for the dependencies which may arise within households are developed in four areas: &#8226;	Estimating the design effects of standard estimators, for survey design; &#8226;	Constructing new estimators to exploit dependencies within households; &#8226;	Selecting a set of auxiliary variables to use in regression estimation; &#8226;	Allocating the sample sizes of households and of people within households.In each case, new methods will be developed which allow for the population structure of people within households.  The new methods will be compared theoretically and numerically to existing methods to show whether, and under what conditions, it is worthwhile explicitly allowing for this population structure.This thesis is concerned with the sampling error of estimators of population totals; that is, the error due to selecting only a sample and not the whole population of people.  The model-assisted framework will be used.The thesis finds that the population structure of people within households can be exploited to give several useful innovations.  It is shown that, in estimating the variance at the sample design stage, the variation of household size must be considered.  This variation is ignored in existing methods for estimating the design effect, and a more accurate method is developed.  It is found that minor improvements can be made to standard estimators of total by considering within-household dependencies.  An &#8220;integrated weighting&#8221; method, based on a linear contextual model, which has important practical advantages is found to often have slightly lower variance than non-integrated methods, contrary to common belief.  Existing criteria for selecting which auxiliary variables to use in regression estimation are extended to the case of two-stage sampling, and applied to household surveys.  In most household surveys, either one person or all people are selected from each selected household.  More general designs, in which the number of people selected is a function of the number of people in the household, are developed.  The fact that the number of people in a household is small leads to some novel and efficient sample designs and estimators.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2055</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Symmetry and ad-hoc methods for solving nonlinear partial differential equations</field><field name="creator">Goard, Joanna</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2060</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tests of fit and other nonparametric data analysis</field><field name="creator">Best, Donald John</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2061</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transient behaviour modelling of underground high voltage cable systems</field><field name="creator">Daud, Muhamad Zalani</field><field name="description">The behaviour of voltage and current transients when a high voltage (HV) cable is first energised is a problem of practical significance to utilities. Modelling of this behaviour on a suitable simulation platform is an attractive approach, in many cases, provided that the results closely match real-world behaviour. This thesis presents modelling and analysis of transients resulting from energisation of an unloaded cable using PSCAD&#174;/EMTDC&#8482; simulation software. An assessment of the applicability of existing frequency-dependent (FD) cable models is given. The impact of transients on a simulated cable system is also presented and discussed.In cable system modelling, system components must be accurately modelled, primarily the underground cable. Two common frequency-dependent cable models are based on the travelling wave method, namely the FD-Mode and FD-Phase models. These models are investigated by comparing their ability to predict energisation current transients resulting from the switching of an unloaded 132 kV underground cable. The simulated results are validated by comparison with the measurement data. It was found that, the FD-Phase model provides more accurate results compared to the FD-Mode model. This model is widely applicable and suitable for use in modelling a wide range of frequencies.The FD-Phase model was used in this study to analyse the distribution of overvoltages at sending and receiving ends of the cable system. Specifically, statistical analysis has been carried out correlating the overvoltage magnitudes induced and the closing behaviour of the circuit breaker (CB). Two statistical switching techniques have been applied, namely the deterministic and probabilistic approaches. Based on the approaches studied, results from probabilistic techniques are recommended owing to the fact that it is closer to reality.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2032</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis, structures, transport and magnetic properties in zinc doped La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 perovskite manganite</field><field name="creator">Sotirova-Haralambeva, Emilia Velinova</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2541</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stories of a war: narrative and the single photograph</field><field name="creator">Battye, Gregory</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/932</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The search for identity: aspects of spirituality in the late Twentieth Century expressed in contemporary Iranian painting</field><field name="creator">Dekamvand, Mohammad Kazem</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/938</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The spiritual bricoleur: an artist's search for personal identity within an investigation of postnational and postcolonial identity</field><field name="creator">Takamiya, Norio</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/940</field></doc><doc><field name="title">More than the portrait: the intangible with the immediately visible as a painter interprets his subjects on a surface</field><field name="creator">Shepherd, Peter Leonard</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/953</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A heuristic framework for the determination of the critical elements in authentic assessment</field><field name="creator">Ashford-Rowe, Kevin Hugh</field><field name="description">Higher Education is currently undergoing a period of significant challenge and transformation. It is likely that these challenges will, in a comparatively short period of time, lead to changes in the ways in which the higher education experience is both mediated and accessed. These changes have arisen as a result of a number of factors, including the information revolution, and the consequent pace of technological innovation, the increased demand from both employers and government for a more highly skilled workforce and the desire to increase and make more accessible the higher education experience to an increasing proportion of the overall population. All of this has impacted upon the ways in which the higher education experience is represented, and in turn, by which students gain access to the knowledge and skills that will underpin their ability to both learn and perform. Higher education is increasingly being challenged to demonstrate its continued value to the broader community, especially employers, by ensuring that it provides capable, competent and informed citizens adequate to the challenges of a twenty-first century lifetime. If these principles are considered drivers for change, then it is important that the higher education sector can continue to demonstrate its ongoing value to the students who undertake it. It is against this background that this study was developed with the purpose of identifying from the literature, and then to codify into an applicable framework, the critical elements that would determine an assessment as being authentic. The study took as its starting point the importance, in the current educational context, of being able to determine the elements that define an educational experience as being an authentic one. The research commenced with a review of the literature to identify and collate those elements that had been identified by previous researchers in the field. Next these elements, once refined iteratively in practice, were developed into a framework that could be applied by the designer of instruction and assessment, in order to ascertain whether such a framework could be used to support the design of a more authentic assessment experience. This framework was then applied in practice and the student&#8217;s response to the learning and assessment designed according to these elements was evaluated, and the elements were further reviewed and revised upon the basis of this data. Thus the study was conducted in four phases, in the first of which the researcher explored the problem, in the second the researcher sought the development of a solution, and in the third phase this solution was implemented and evaluated, the findings were presented in the final phase. The findings of this study suggest that not only is it possible to codify those elements critical to the determination of authenticity into such a framework, but moreover, it is possible to systematically apply them in the design of assessment activity. Thus the implication of this research for educators and educational designers who seek to meet a requirement for workplace relevance in the design of their education and assessment activities is that they will have a better opportunity to both identify and then apply specific design principles that will assist them in the better development of assessment outcomes with a clearer workplace applicability.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/966</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Music educational and ethnomusicological implications for curriculum design: development, implementation and evaluation of Philippine music and dance curricula</field><field name="creator">Brennan, Philomena S.</field><field name="description">The problem of concern in this study is of a dual nature, involving music education principles and ethnomusicological issues. Using Philippine music and dance as the specific genre, the study investigates approaches to the learning of non-Western music at the secondary school level. The study identifies two approaches which may lead to the Philippine music and dance learning experience, designs curricula in two appropriate forms, and, finally, sets up conditions to test empirically the relative effectiveness of the curricula.The initial task for this study was to locate and collect Philippine music and dance data, by means of field work, during which the researcher acted as participant and observer in Philippine events. From this data, the study attempted to design, implement and evaluate Philippine music and dance curricula in two forms, with both curricula developed from identical music and dance materials and principals.The first form. Curriculum A, is a fifteen hour curriculum which presents the music and dance as entities in themselves, worthy of study in their own right. The second form. Curriculum B, is a fifteen hour curriculum in a cross-disciplinary form, seeking relationships between music, dance and socio-cultural variables. Following the development of the curricula, selected teachers were prepared to implement one or other of the randomly assigned curricula forms with 521 Year 8 and Year 9 pupils in a stratified random sample of New South Wales secondary schools. The sample was stratified according to four school-related variables, five teacher-related variables and three pupi1-related variables.Finally, this study attempted to evaluate the relative effectiveness of the two curricula by devising one Philippine music and dance achievement test. The test evaluates pupils in the areas of knowledge and skills in Philippine music and dance. The test also seeks pupils' attitudes towards Philippine music and dance in particular, and non-Western music and dance in general. Analysis of variance was employed to establish the more effective curriculum form, and to ascertain the effects of selected intervening variables upon the two Philippine music and dance curricula.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1332</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teacher belief systems, attitudes towards drama and educational outcomes</field><field name="creator">Errington, Edward Peter</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1333</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A resource exchange perspective of value added in venture capital firm</field><field name="creator">Naqi, Sayed Ahmed</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1900</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Accounting changes in a transition economy: the case of Vietnam</field><field name="creator">Chu, Thanh</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1903</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Solutional landforms in quartz sandstones of the Sydney Basin</field><field name="creator">Wray, Robert Arthur</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1981</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An examination of the relationship between teachers' beliefs in ESL education and their teaching and assessment practices in their classrooms</field><field name="creator">Cho Hung Yi, Mike Cho</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2325</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An examination of the correlation between one school's stated policies in literacy teaching and evaluation and the teaching and evaluation practices in that school</field><field name="creator">Woodward, Helen Lynette</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2327</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Description of the development and application of a code to describe and analyse the overt teacher initiated literacy messages being conveyed to students within a classroom context</field><field name="creator">Beecher, Bronwyn Ruth</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2342</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teacher perceptions of the essential skills in classroom management and discipline</field><field name="creator">Jessup, Steven</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2350</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Technology based learning and quality in Australian universities</field><field name="creator">Chambers, Dianne Patricia</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2351</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Academic industrial relations in Australia: an historial overview</field><field name="creator">Kelly, Diana</field><field name="description">This history of academic industrial relations in Austraha from the 1950s to the 1990s examines the ways in which assumptions, methods, and objects of analysis have been shaped by ideas and events external to the field of study. As an uncertain interdiscipUnary field, Australian academic industrial relations was as open to influences from changes in social and pohtical norms, pubhc policy and the changing imperatives of higher education, as it was to the ideas of scholars in the USA and UK, and those from nearby older disciplines. Within academic industrial relations, the tensions arising from dealing with these often competing influences were exacerbated by the rival models of unidisciplinarity and multidiscipUnarity for the study of industrial relations. Moreover, the very notions of what constituted academic industrial relations were constantly under question, right through to the 1990s when the managerialist HRM approaches to the study of work and employment appeared to threaten the existence of industrial relations as a field of study. This historical overview traces and analyses all of these influences, and the ways they interacted with each other in shaping the field of study. All of these patterns of influence emphasise the importance of taking account of environmental influences and the transmission of ideas in a disciplinary history.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1308</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hidden in the sands of time: geoarchaeology of sandstone landscapes in the Keep River region, Northern Territory, Australia</field><field name="creator">Ward, Ingrid A</field><field name="description">This geoarchaeological study aims to establish the geomorphic context of Aboriginal cultural landscapes and archaeological sites in the Keep River region, Northern Territory, over the Late Quaternary. The geomorphic focus of the thesis is concentrated on the sand sheets, which occur at the base of the sandstone escarpments. Sample locations include the occupation (rockshelter and sand sheet) sites of Goorurarmum, Jinmium and Karlinga, and non-occupation(creek) sites at Karlinga and Sandy Creek Gorge. The thesis presents five interrelated studies, including (i) an assessment of the theoretical relevance of geoarchaeology in northern Australia; and three studies at different timescales, evaluating (ii) long-term landscape processes over timescales of millenia using in situ osmogenic dating, (iii) sedimentary processes over timescales of centuries to millenia using luminescence dating, and sedimentary processes over decadal timescales. A fifth study integrates the results of the above four studies with existing archaeological data. Measurement of in-situ cosmogenic 10Be and 26Al concentrations from the local escarpment bedrock has revealed denudation rates of 4 - 7 mm.ka-1 over 103 &#8211; 105 year timescales, consistent with similar studies in other parts of semi-arid Australia. Calculated bedrock denudation rates were used to model burial profiles up to 6 m deep from the Jinmium sand sheet. Measured concentrations of 10Be and 26Al in two profiles, provided vertical accretion rates of ~10 - 20 mm.ka-1 over the past few hundred thousand years. Grain size, micromorphology, mineralogy and geochemistry indicate that the sand-sheet sediments are locally sourced. The rock-shelter sediments have higher relative concentrations of CaO, P205 and greater LOI, than the surrounding sand-sheet sediments, reflecting higher levels of charcoal, guano and organic matter. Post-depositional reddening of the sediments reflects groundwater variation rather than any proxy for depositional age. A total of 33 thermoluminescence (TL) and 15 optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dates were obtained from the rock-shelters, sand sheets and creek embankments. U- and Th-series analyses indicate relative equilibrium, with slightly higher dose rates (3.0 &#177; 0.83 Gy.ky-1) for mottled sediments than elsewhere (1.3 &#177; 0.29 Gy.ky-1). Foreshortened TL plateaux in some sand sheet sediments at Goorurarmum and Jinmium, and stepped TL plateaux in the sediments alongside Sandy Creek are indicative of episodic rapid deposition events. Basal OSL ages for the Goorurarumum rock shelter and adjacent sand sheet excavation are 0.3 &#177; 0.07 ky BP and 14.3 &#177; 0.4 ky BP respectively, and near-basal OSL ages for the Karlinga rock shelter and more distant sand sheet excavation are 18.4 &#177; 5.4 ky BP and 18.0 &#177; 0.6 ky BP respectively. The 18 ka age for the Karlinga rock shelter is uncertain, and a much younger basal radiocarbon age of ~ 4 ka is preferred. The deepest OSL ages for the Karlinga creek profile (KR99CP) and Sandy Creek Gorge profile is 8.6 &#177; 0.3 ky BP and 13.9 &#177; 0.4 ky BP respectively. An increase in the sand sheet accumulation rates from ~ 100 mm.ka-1 in the late Pleistocene to over 200 mm.ka-1 in the Holocene is interpreted to reflect enhanced monsoonal activity following postglacial marine transgression rather than human activity. The preceding results are integrated with information from radiocarbon analyses, regional archaeology, and local palaeobotanical, stone artefact and rock-art studies. Chronological results support initial evidence of seed processing, stone point production, and rock art around 3 &#8211; 4 ka. However, it is questioned whether these trends reflect &#8216;intensification&#8217; or preservation and sorting of the archaeological records. The combined chronological data from the Keep River region indicates that although there is evidence of occupation from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), the majority of occupation deposits in the Keep River region are Holocene in age. However, this is biased by the greater number of rock shelter sequences sampled and by the poor preservation potential of the semi-arid monsoonal climate which favours younger sediment sequences. Better preservation of older sequences is found in open sites. The overall geoarchaelogical history describes a relatively insensitive sedimentary record of the comparatively sensitive Aboriginal occupation of the sandstone landscapes in the Keep River region. Scope remains for further multi-disciplinary geoarchaeological nvestigations in similar semi-arid monsoonal environments.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/352</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Palaeoenvironments of the Gulf of Carpentaria from the last glacial maximum to the present, as determined by foraminiferal assemblages</field><field name="creator">Holt, Sabine</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a palaeoenvironmental study of the Gulf of Carpentaria, northern Australia, from around the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to the present. Foraminifers, microscopic unicellular aquatic organisms, occur throughout the sediment in the time frame studied. Data on the species composition and preservation of the microfossils found in the Gulf of Carpentaria cores are utilised to reconstruct past environments by comparison to the known assemblages of living foraminifers in various modern environments. The Gulf of Carpentaria is a shallow epicontinental sea, situated between Australia and Papua New Guinea, and is a maximum of 70m deep. It is separated from the Pacific Ocean to the east by Torres Strait, which is 12m deep at its shallowest, and from the Indian Ocean and Arafura Sea to the west by the Arafura Sill, which is 53m below sea-level (bpsl) at its shallowest. For at least ten thousand years in the lead up to the LGM (which reached its peak about twenty thousand years ago), and for about ten thousand years after, sea levels were lower than the 53m-deep Arafura Sill. The continental shelf in the Gulf of Carpentaria area between Australia and Papua New Guinea was exposed, creating a land bridge between the two islands, and a lake developed in the Carpentaria Basin. This palaeolake is termed Lake Carpentaria (named by Torgersen et al., 1983). Documentation of the timing in fluctuations in the extent and salinity of Lake Carpentaria provides information on local and regional climatic systems, such as the Australian summer monsoon. Constraining the nature and timing of the postglacial rise in sea-level which flooded the lake provides evidence for global eustatic sea-level reconstructions. Analysis of sediment cores from the Gulf of Carpentaria, beginning around 40ka cal BP (forty thousand calendar years before present), shows the existence of Lake Carpentaria (a large, non-marine water body of fluctuating extent) until sealevel rose over the Arafura Sill and inundated the palaeolake around 10.5ka cal BP. The earliest studied phase dates to around 40ka cal BP which is a marineinfluenced brackish water lacustrine facies where Lake Carpentaria is briefly at its maximum extent: 12m deep in its deepest section. The existence of such a large body of water (around 150,000km2) supports the existence of a strong Walker Circulation in the region enhancing precipitation. Between 40ka and 18.8ka cal BP the non-marine, increasingly saline, Lake Carpentaria decreased to 7m maximum water depth, adding to the evidence of aridity around the LGM in northern Australia. At 18.8ka cal BP the lake freshened and monospecific bivalve, foraminiferal and ostracod populations dominated the still shallow (around 8m deep) lake. The lake was expanding, and from around 15&#177;2ka cal BP, fluctuations are noted in the general trend of increasing precipitation. The recorded variations in precipitation intensity may result from stronger seasonality (i.e. monsoons) and/or interdecadal variability (e.g. El Ni&#241;o Southern Oscillation). At 12.7ka cal BP Lake Carpentaria was at around 12m maximum water depth &#8211; the maximum documented extent in the studied period. At this stage there was some exchange of waters with the Arafura Sea via tidal outlet channels in the Arafura Sill (indicating sea-level around 60m below present), seen as a marine influence beginning in the western margins at 12.7ka cal BP. At 12.4ka cal BP the sealevel had risen to the same height as water levels within the lake (58m bpsl). By 12.2.ka cal BP sea-level was up to 2m higher than the previous lake level, and flowed into the lagoonal Lake Carpentaria via channels in the Arafura Sill. By 10.5ka cal BP the sea-level had overtopped the highest surface of the 53m-deep Arafura Sill and the transition to marine conditions began in the Gulf of Carpentaria, confirming the accepted models of sea-level rise.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/409</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring the contribution of professional development and training to human resources capacity enhancement in the ministry of industry and trade (MOIT) Indonesia: a case study</field><field name="creator">Simaibang, Baginda</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/970</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Social responsibility accounting, sustainability accounting and Islam</field><field name="creator">Sadeghzadeh, Akbar</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Accounting through the looking glass: a reflection of twentieth century accounting crises : the mad hatter's tea party and the measurement debate</field><field name="creator">Kurtovic, Annamaria</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1013</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spatial variations in the thickness and coal quality of the Sangatta Seam, Kutei Basin, Kalimantan, Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Nas, Chairul</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1409</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stratigraphy and sedimentology of the late Permian Illawarra coal measures, Southern Sydney Basin, New South Wales</field><field name="creator">Bamberry, William John</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1410</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The historian as moralist: a study of Edward Gibbon and The decline and fall of the Roman Empire</field><field name="creator">Dillon-Smith, David</field><field name="description">This thesis examines a significant aspect of Gibbon's thought and outlook and its effect on his major work. Part I traces the development of moral attitudes in the man and their expression in his early and exploratory writings. The first and second chapters trace this development through his reaction to Oxford, his apprenticeship in Lausanne and his return to England, as the moral foundations were laid and tested till the aspiring historian was ready to turn his mind to the choice of a satisfying subject. Chapter three pauses to survey the principles he explored and tentatively set down in his first publication and notes their significance for the emerging historian. Chapter four considers his quest for a worthy subject and suggests that the first topics were rejected as unsatisfactory, primarily on moral grounds. The experience in Rome and its importance are re-examined and attention is drawn to the emphasis on moral values in certain writings undertaken as he approached his chosen subject.Part II looks first, in chapter five, at the moral categories underlying The Decline and Fall and, in the following chapter, at their application in Gibbon's approach to character and the historian's responsibility to truth, to his public and to posterity for the faithfulness of his portraits of the figures of history. Some of these persons are seen as uniquely appropriate to Gibbon's purpose and the moral values he wished his History to exemplify. Chapter seven explores the moral emphases seen in his discussion of the causes of decline and in particular proposes that the twin factors of barbarism and religion are presented in The Decline and Fall as primarily moral rather than racial or religious categories. The question as to how far the philosophic historian and moralist does justice to religion and to his avowed ideal of strict impartiality is finally considered. Chapter eight examines a major theme of the work as it looks at Gibbon the humanist moralising on the strange and melancholy 'vicissitudes of fortune', the transitoriness of the life of man, his works and his empires, and on the value of history as the means of transcending this impermanence, this inevitable change and decay. Chapter nine focuses on the historian's use of language as an appropriate vehicle for his moral reading of history, and moves from the broader aspects of style, through the units of composition, to the choice of words, in order to show how Gibbon forged a suitable instrument for his purpose. The final chapter discusses the ambiguity of the historian's reputation in former times and particularly his standing as a moralist in view of the 'indecencies' and 'improprieties' found in his work by his contemporaries and later critics. The question of how far this affects his moral stature is considered and the relative insignificance of this element and the lasting appreciation of The Decline and Fall, not only on literary and historical grounds, but also for its positive moral value, is reaffirmed. The individual chapter outlines indicate more clearly and in greater detail the thread of the presentation and the argument throughout the thesis.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1426</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The invisible giant: a history of the Federated Miscellaneous Workers' Union of Australia, 1915-1985</field><field name="creator">Sheil, Christopher</field><field name="description">This thesis provides an account of the history of the growth and character of the Federated Miscellaneous Workers' Union of Australia from 1915 to 1985. With an emphasis on its New South Wales Branch and the years up until 1955, the argument is pursued in examinations of the union's origins and its periods of major change and development.It is argued that the union was originally created by craft unionists out of the arbitration laws enacted in Australia during the first two decades of the century. The union's general composition initially derived from the fact that its early manbers lacked the fundamental sectionalism assumed by craft unionism and these laws.The major changes to the union over its first 30 years occurred during the period of working class radicalism between 1917 and 1927 and in the aftermath of the Great Depression fran 1934 until the Second World War. As a consequence of this history, by 1945 the union reached a point of profound internal contradiction. It had a goverrment that had becone philosophically and structurally integrated with arbitration and a maonbership v*iere sections vAiich had come under militant rank-and-file leadership had developed to the extent that they were capable of taking their own direct action.Arising from this contradiction, between 1945 and 1955 the union underwent a major period of internal conflict and re-definition that ushered in a new and more radical leadership and generally accounts for the union's subsequent growth and character. Between 1955 and 1970 the organisation developed into one of the largest, more progressive and most effective unions in Australia.Against the orthodoxy that has defined trade unions primarily as autonomous instruments of sectional economic interests, it is argued throughout that the union's growth and character were determined by a much greater conplexity of social relations. While recognising the special significance of this institution's relationship with the state and the labour movanent at large, central to the thesis is the proposition that at least as important to the union's history as its immediate relationships were the wider social relations which these presupposed. Trade unions are evidence as well as agents of change in society and, it is argued, any understanding of their history depends on the extent to which both these aspects of their past and the relationship between them are able to be realised."The Giants who formed this world into its sensual existence and now seem to live in it in chains, are in truth the causes of its life and the sources of all activity, but the chains are the cunning of weak and tame minds which have power to resist energy according to the proverb the weak in courage is strong in cunning. Thus one portion of being is the Prolific, the other the Devouring: to the devourer it seams as if the producer was in his chains; but it is not so, he only takes portions of existence and fancies that the whole ... But the Prolific would cease to be Prolific unless the Devourer as a sea received the excess of his delights. Seme will say: 'Is not God alone the Prolific?' I answer: 'God only Acts &amp; Is in existing beings or Men'. These two classes of men are always upon earth, &amp; they should be enemies: whoever tries to reconcile them seeks to destroy existence."

He was held in great respect by his teachers, colleagues and students and was regarded by some as the most gifted disciple of Kliuchevskii, the greatest of all Russian historians. Kliuchevskii held Rozhkov in higher esteem than he did Mikhail Nikolaevich Pokrovskii, who eventually became the leading historian of the early Soviet period. Despite such accolades, no major work has been written on Rozhkov either in the Soviet Union or in the West. An assessment of his historical writings and of his political activities is long overdue. This thesis aims at addressing the first of these two areas. It investigates Rozhkov's understanding of history and his interpretation of early Russian history. The thesis also sheds light on Rozhkov's political ideas. It argues that Rozhkov's historical views led him to adopt a Menshevik position after 1907. For Rozhkov, the political ideas of Menshevism were consistent with the mechanical determinism of his theory of historical development. The thesis therefore offers an explanation of his political career as well as assessing his historical ideas.The thesis examines Rozhkov's theory of history with the aim of determining what kind of historian he was. In so doing, the thesis tries to ascertain what the most important influences on Rozhkov were and to determine the concepts that formed the essential ingredients of his theory of historical development. These concepts are then examined in a detailed study of Rozhkov's interpretation of Kievan Rus'. The thesis demonstrates that from his earliest work Rozhkov believed that history was a science. So he also believed that the methods used in the natural sciences could be applied to all social sciences, especially the science of history. The thesis further demonstrates that by 1905 Rozhkov had already formulated his theory of history. This theory was the product of several schools of thought that existed in Russia, but two were particularly important. Rozhkov was influenced by Auguste Comte's writings and the positivist ideas that existed in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries in Russia. The most important result of this positivist influence was Rozhkov's conviction that there existed laws of social statics and laws of social dynamics and that the study of history has as its purpose the discovery and verification of these laws.While his theory of history owed most to positivism, his approach to historical methodology and to the interpretation of historical evidence owed most to the influence of his teacher and mentor, Kliuchevskii. From Kliuchevskii, Rozhkov inherited a passion for documentary research, a concern for social and economic factors and an interest in formulating general laws of historical development. It was also from Kliuchevskii that he came to believe in the value of the primacy of the economic factor in history. It is a shame that Rozhkov did not also acquire Kliuchevskii's sensitivity to the difficulty of identifying and applying historical laws in practice. Contrary to accepted opinion, Marxism was a less important influence on Rozhkov than either positivism or the work of Kliuchevskii. It is true that by 1905 Rozhkov was familiar with aspects of Marxist thought. He believed that Marxism was essentially about economics and that economic factors played a vital role in history. There can be no doubt that in his early works he rejected certain tenets that are central to Marxist thought. Rozhkov placed no great emphasis upon class analysis and class struggle in his history writing. He also criticised Marxism for not taking into account the important insights provided by the psychological school in sociology. The thesis concludes that Rozhkov was a prolific historian who, in the tradition established by Kliuchevskii, had acquired a huge appetite for primary research. His skill in analysing primary sources provided a sound base for his historical research. His work is very impressive by virtue of the enormous detail and erudition it contains. It is also important and valuable because in his desire to make sense of the past, Rozhkov produced a grandiose classification scheme that organised data and led to many interesting and profound questions. Yet, despite producing some historical studies that were as impressive and scholarly as those written by Kliuchevskii, Rozhkov was a flawed historian.He was a flawed historian not only because he believed that the social sciences ought to be treated and analysed as natural sciences, but chiefly because he believed that all phenomena could be explained and predicted when the universal laws that governed them were discovered.Although the search for historical laws was common among some thinkers at the turn of the century, in the end, Rozhkov's sociological theory of history was too rigid to do justice to the complex situations it was trying to explain.Despite the fact that Rozhkov believed his laws of social statics and social dynamics were derived from the historical evidence that he presented, this thesis will demonstrate that Rozhkov was unable to marry successfully the disciplines of history and sociology as he defined them. This is so because Rozhkov could not escape from the simplistic positivist belief that simple, mechanical laws can be deduced that explain historical development. The legacy of such an assumption was an interesting but unsuccessful blend of impressive mastery over historical details with a naTve belief in unconvincing and crude historical laws. In the final analysis, Rozhkov produced a history of Russia that, although interesting, was tainted with laws of social development that were mechanical and wooden in nature. This is not to suggest that Rozhkov's history should not be read and studied. Despite its faults and weaknesses, Rozhkov's historical work and theory serve as an excellent illustration and reflection of the complex array of philosophical thoughts that existed at the turn of the century and that determined the character of late Russian imperial and early Soviet historical writing. His work also counts as one of the most thoroughgoing attempts by a pre-revolutionary Russian historian to identify and explore the role of general laws in the historical process.The principal question of what kind of  historian Rozhkov was leads to other questions about him and about his place in Russian and Soviet historiography. Rozhkov has fared poorly at the hands of Soviet critics because he embraced Menshevik views from 1907. In the past, the narrow manner in which the origins and early development of Soviet historiography have been analysed has made for a rejection of Rozhkov's historical works. Both inside and outside the Soviet Union, this analysis has been carried out within a narrow "Marxist versus non-Marxist" framework. This approach is a legacy of Bolshevik and Stalinist intolerance; it should no longer affect the way historians approach the past. It resulted in a distortion of historical reality. Not only was the false impression gained that a single "Marxist doctrine" existed but that people and ideas could be evaluated according to some yardstick of orthodox Marxism. This study argues that the Marxist versus non-Marxist account is a most inadequate way of examining the historiography of this period. It not only prevents the researcher from posing broader questions about historians that are considered "Marxist" but, more significantly, it belittles or denies the importance and merit of those historians who are characterised as "non-Marxist".It is inadequate to discuss Rozhkov's work purely within the Marxist tradition. By placing Rozhkov firmly within the positivist tradition, this thesis allows for a much better understanding of his ideas. At the same time, an implication of this conclusion is that positivism played a greater role in historical thinking in Russia at the turn of the century than did Marxism. To my knowledge, the thesis also contains the fullest, existing bibliography of Rozhkov's writings.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1436</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A thermo-elasto-hydrodynamic study of journal bearings</field><field name="creator">Freund, Norman Owen</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1568</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Applying diversity to OFDM</field><field name="creator">Raad, Ibrahim Samir</field><field name="description">In today's world, wireless communications has become an essential part of every day life. An example of this is the exchange and transmission of data in many forms. Multi-user access systems provide a method to allow multiple users to transmit and exchange this type of information concurrently. Due to its orthogonality, Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) has been used in Ultra Wide Band (e.g. MB-OFDM), WLAN (such as IEEE802:11a and IEEE802:11g) and mobile broadband systems (such as 3GPP LTE) as an e&#177;cient scheme to achieve the expected outcomes for today's society needs for communications.Although OFDM achieves an excellent transmission rate and its application can be seen in everyday life, it still su&#174;ered from corruption especially in indoor wireless environments in applications such as Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANS) in business o&#177;ces, universities and shopping centers as an example. In these types of environments OFDM su&#174;ers the greatest in degradation of performance. This degradation is due to multipath and fast frequency channels. Many solutions for this performance degradation have been proposed and the application of di&#174;erent types of diversity has been used.This thesis proposes three applications of three di&#174;erent types of diversity to improve the OFDM system performance in terms of Bit Error Rate (BER). Firstly, a new spreading matrix called the Rotation Spreading matrix used to introduce frequency diversity to OFDM is proposed. This new spreading ma- trix employs the use of a rotation angle to increase the correlation between the transmitted symbols to ensure in an indoor environment the system maintains an excellent performance. This thesis provides many studies through experi- ments and simulations of this new spreading matrix against other well known matrices such as the Hadamard and the Rotated Hadamard. This includes the introduction of methods to increase the size of this new matrix to ensure it is scalable to higher order matrices.Secondly, time diversity is employed through the use of delaying the block sym- bols of Block Spread OFDM (BSOFDM) to allow each symbol of an OFDM packet to be transmitted across independent channels.Thirdly, a new scheme called Parallel Concatenated Spreading Matrices OFDM is presented which employs coding gain to improve the overall BER performance of Block Spread OFDM in frequency selective channels.As a direct result of the solutions and methods proposed in this thesis to im- prove the OFDM system, 15 international peer reviewed publications have been achieved. Two of these include book chapters.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field

radiation therapy</field><field name="creator">Hardcastle, Nicholas</field><field name="description">Modern radiation oncology is constantly improving and becoming more complex. Novel dosimetric planning, delivery and dosimetry techniques have allowed for im- proved plan quality and confidence in delivery. This thesis is an investigation into the impacts of novel radiotherapy planning and delivery techniques and the efficacy of novel dosimetry methods for modern, complex radiotherapy.The first part of the thesis involved investigation into novel treatment planning optimisation techniques for prostate cancer radiotherapy. Advantages and disadvantages of IMRT for simple prostate radiotherapy in the Australian clinical setting is investigated, showing small gains compared with high quality conformal radiotherapy. The use of a radiobiological parameter, specifcally the generalised Equivalent Uniform Dose (gEUD) was investigated for prostate IMRT optimisation to reduce rectal dose. The gEUD metric was found to be a useful optimisation objective that provided rectal dose reductions over the full dose range. The result of the optimisation was heavily dependent on the value of a (describing organ architecture), with a lower value of a resulting in the largest reductions in rectal dose. A commercial Volumetric Modulated Arc Radiotherapy (VMAT) tool was investigated for prostate radiotherapy. Single arc VMAT plans were compared to static gantry angle IMRT plans for prostate cancer cases. It was found that VMAT resulted in equivalent target coverage with reductions in rectal V25Gy. The VMAT plans required on average 18.6% fewer monitor units and were theoretically up to 3.75 times faster to delivery compared with static gantry angle IMRT.The second part of the thesis looked at using modern radiation detectors for verification of treatment dose in regions of electronic disequilibrium. Rectal balloons filled with air are used for prostate immobilisation and rectal dose reduction in prostate photon radiotherapy. This introduces an air cavity into the patient, immediately adjacent to the target. Radiochromic film was used to show that two commercial convolution/superposition dose calculation algorithms slightly over-predict the anterior rectal wall dose and under-predict the posterior rectal wall dose. The feasibility of a novel MOSFET detector, the MOSkin, coupled to a commercial rectal balloon was investigated for real time in vivo rectal wall dose verification. In this phantom study, the MOSkin was shown to be an excellent real time dosimeter, with minimal angular response and reproducible sensitivity. The MOSkin was then used with radiochromic film to verify the dose delivered to the skin during total scalp irradiation with helical tomotherapy. It was shown that the helical tomotherapy RTPS accurately calculated the dose to surface voxels and that the dose delivered to the skin is less than the prescription dose, which suggests a bolus may be required to achieve prescription dose to the skin. Finally, the dosimetric effect of end leaf leakage was investigated for a commercial multileaf collimator for wide-field IMRT. It was shown that end leaf leak- age can contribute significant doses to treatment fields, but provided the effects are quantified it is reasonable to accept these as the allowance of wide fields avoids complicated dual overlapping field feathering. The commercial RTPS investigated slightly under-predicts the magnitude of these end leaf leakage dose contributions.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field

women's (re)constructions of life and learning</field><field name="creator">Pamphilon, Barbara</field><field name="description">The oral histories of nine aged women provide the vehicle for this feminist poststmctural exploration of life-long learning in its formal, non-formal, informal and incidental modes. As personal nanativas are historically, culturally, socially and personally mediated, it becomes possible to see that the oral histories are at once individual and coUectiva. The women's accounts illustrate that despite discourses providing competing and often contradictory subject positions, it is possible, indeed necessary, to speak as a rational, coherent self. I illustrate how this group of women (re)constmctad what I call 'enabling fictions'.The poststmctural, multidisciplinary analysis consisted of four levels: the macro, the meso, the micro and the interactional. Through the macro analysis it was possible to locate the narratives in their cultural and historical time and place, revealing collective meanings as they relate to individual experience. The meso analysis drew on the personal level shedding light on individual values, interpretations and positioning. On the micro level, nanatives were examined for the subtleties of the telling, exploring emotions and voice in particular. Finally, the interactional analysis recognised that these nanatives were a product of the relationship between each of the women and myself. The poststmctural analysis of personal nanatives reveals that what events mean to a woman depends on her ways of interpreting her world from the discourses available to her at that given moment. I do not suggest that these women's accounts illustrate 'the' women's ways of learning, rather I argue that different discourses bring with them different ways of seeing one's self and of speaking as a learner. As a result learning is seen not as a linear progression, but rather as a constant forming and re-forming situated within a particular discursive field. The nine women were able to utilise the discourses sunounding home and family to claim particular maternal competencies which they found to be transportable into their community activities. This group of women Ulustrate how it is possible to (re)constmct a subjectivity in a way that indeed 'makes the best of life'.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1786</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Netcitizens: information hunters and gatherers</field><field name="creator">Arrighi, Michael</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1789</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Where angels fear to tread: the development of leadership capacity through simulation-based learning</field><field name="creator">McDonald, Tracey T.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1814</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A model for guiding and measuring company performance towards achieving manufacturing excellence</field><field name="creator">Sukarma, Lukman</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1815</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation and analysis of acid sulphate soil remediation via tidal restorations</field><field name="creator">Glamore, William Carlos</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1822</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Far infrared spectroscopy of some impurities in germanium</field><field name="creator">Baker, Richard</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1825</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Extensions and evaluations of adaptive processing of structured information using artifical neural networks</field><field name="creator">Hagenbuchner, Markus</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1848</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling and field-oriented control of a synchronous reluctance motor with rectangular stator current excitation</field><field name="creator">Coates, Colin</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1849</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of the rules of the international law of the sea governing the delimitation of maritime areas under national sovereignty</field><field name="creator">Talaie, Farhad</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1854</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Early school leaving: a crisis in secondary schooling in Tonga</field><field name="creator">Tatafu, Makafalani</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1874</field></doc><doc><field name="title">NW Borneo reservoir characterisation based on sedimentological evaluation of turbidite facies</field><field name="creator">Nyipong, Mavise Sharon</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1933</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Savings, investment, foreign capital inflows and economic growth in India 1950-2005</field><field name="creator">Verma, Reetu</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1935</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Three dimensional sensing by digital video fringe projection</field><field name="creator">Baker, Matthew J.</field><field name="description">Fast, high precision and automated optical noncontact surface profile and shape measurement has been an extensively studied research area due to the diversity of potential application which extends to a variety of fields including but not limited to industrial monitoring, computer vision, virtual reality and medicine. Among others, structured light Fringe Projection approaches have proven to be one of the most promising techniques.Traditionally, the typical approach to Fringe Projection 3D sensing involves generating fringe images via interferometric procedures, however, more recent developments in the area of digital display have seen researchers adopting Digital Video Projection (DVP) technology for the task of fringe manufacture. The ongoing and extensive exploitation of DVP for Fringe Projection 3D sensing is derived from a number of key incentives the projection technology presents relative to the more traditional forms of projection. More specifically, DVP allows for the ability to accurately control various attributes of the projected fringe image at high speed in software, along with the capabilities to develop multi-channel techniques via colour projection. Furthermore, considering the typical DVP source is capable of projecting a standard 24 bit bitmap computer generated image, when interfaced to a personal computer, DVP makes for a very affordable projection source. However, despite the aforementioned incentives, in contrast to the more traditional methods of generating fringe images, the digitally projected fringe signal presents a number of shortcomings which ultimately hinder the effective application of the technology for Fringe Projection 3D sensing. This thesis aims to improve the effectiveness of the deployment of DVP technology for Fringe Projection 3D sensing approaches. The proposed initiative is facilitated through extensive analysis of the application of DVP technology for fringe processing, and furthermore by the proposal of new digital fringe calibration procedures. Firstly, this work demonstrates a comprehensive survey of current Fringe Projection 3D sensing approaches including an introductory review of the rudimentary notion of projecting fringes for 3D data acquisition. The survey also provides a thorough description of the evolution of the three major forms of fringe processing i.e. Fringe Phase Stepping Fourier Fringe analysis and Direct Detection. The limitations of DVP for Fringe Projection are demonstrated through the development of a novel fringe phase emulation approach. The phase emulation approach is subsequently employed to establish empirical insight into the application of DVP technology for Fringe Projection. More specifically, the preliminary empirical analysis is used to test the veracity of the application of the two chief DVP technologies (Liquid Crystal Display, LCD and Digital Light Processing, DLP, Texas Instruments) for Fringe Projection. Through this study the camera / projector non-linear intensity response is shown to be the single most significant shortcoming inherent to DVP based Fringe Projection implementations. Following the findings of the preliminary empirical analysis the influence of the Display Gamma attributes of the projection system is extensively investigated. The harmonic structure of a typical digitally projected fringe signal is examined and an approximate analysis framework proposed. The framework is subsequently utilised to form a set of equations defining the true sensitivity of a range of highly exploited fringe processing techniques. The approximate analysis is later verified and the practical significance of the findings demonstrated. Through this study the true nature of the Display Gamma related phase measuring residual error is revealed. With the aid of a verified framework, investigations into additional Display Gamma related Fringe Projection phenomena is undertaken. More specifically, the optimisation of digitally projected fringes by fringe parameter manipulation is demonstrated. The temporal nature of digitally projected fringe images is studied for the well exploited single shot Fourier Transform Profilometry technique and the digital fringe harmonic dependence on the projector optical modulation transfer function is revealed. Subsequently, the elimination of Display Gamma related Fringe Projection phase measuring residual error for phase stepping techniques by projector defocus optimisation is shown. Finally, a novel digital fringe calibration approach ideal for minimum shot fringe processing techniques is proposed. The calibration procedure is centered on the application of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to correct the non-linear intensity distortion associated with the camera / projector system. Unlike previously proposed gamma correction techniques, the neural fringe calibration technique requires no additional data acquisition with effective calibration requiring no more than a single cross-section of a reference fringe. The neural network fringe calibration approach is also shown to significantly outperform simple filter based techniques of similar computational complexity. Given the reduced data requirements for the neural approach its application for multi-channel fringe calibration is also considered.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1960</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Late tertiary and quaternary geology of the East Java Basin, Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Susilohadi,</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1973</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Champion of Anzac: General Sir Brudenell White, the First Australian Imperial Force and the emergence of the Australian military culture 1914-18</field><field name="creator">Bentley, John</field><field name="description">It is a curious fact that Brudenell White remains one of the least known and least analysed of Australia's military commanders. It is curious because White had a profound influence not only on the organisational culture of the First AIF but on the organisational history of the Australian military. This thesis examines White's influence from the perspective of organisational culture theory.According to Peters and Waterman founders create both the tangible aspects of an organisation, such as structure and technology, as well as the symbols, deologies, language, and beliefs that embody the organisation's culture. The founder provides the momentum that gets the organisation moving and chooses the original core members. As the organisation takes form the founder's responses to organisational problems create new values, beliefs and procedures to be followed by the group which are accepted as the way of doing things. In the First Australian Imperial Force this task fell largely to White.At the outbreak of hostilities in 1914 White was a relatively junior Major, but was fulfilling the extremely important functions of both Director of Military Operations and Chief of the General Staff. It was White who shouldered the very large responsibility of advising the Government and organising Australia's initial military contribution which later became known as the Australian Imperial Force. It was his ideology and world view that shaped the new organisation and from that point on. White became a key figure in the development of the Australian Imperial Force.White was appointed Chief of Staff, the most senior staff officer in the Australian Imperial Force. Under General Birdwood, White's inherent aptitude for administrative and operational matters was recognised and consequently White became the de facto commander of the Australian Imperial Force. During this period White plarmed and directed the two most successful Australian operations. The first, a tactical operation, resulted in the withdrawal of Australian troops from Gallipoli, an operation that was achieved with only two minor casualties. The second operation was administrative and resulted in the expansion and restructuring of the AIF fi-om two divisions to four divisions.Whilst in Egypt White began to construct the administrative machinery that would lead to the administrative self-government of the Australian Imperial Force. This process began with the formation of an intermediate administrative base in Cairo. In France this was expanded when White successfully pressed for the establishment of an Australian Administrative Headquarters. White designed the principles upon which it would operate.At Gallipoli and in France White quickly demonstrated his tactical aptitude. In the early operations White established tactical principles that guided the operational development of the Australian Imperial Force. Over time even British commanders came to regard White as the driving force behind the Australian Imperial Force. Hamel is often seen as the ultimate example of Australian expertise in the art of war. Although Monash gained the credit the original plans for the operation were prepared by White.Throughout the war White played a major role in every facet of the development of the organisational culture of the Australian Imperial Force and protected what he had built by marginalising Australian officers he believed represented a threat to the First AIF. The beliefs, values and principles that were established during this period became the foundations upon which Australian military culture later developed. White established himself as the champion of Anzac and Australia's foremost soldier.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1997</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development and support of complex information systems in emergent organizations: structures, processes and governance</field><field name="creator">Kingsford, Richard</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1999</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis and design of message authentication codes</field><field name="creator">Bakhtiari Haft Lang, Shahram Bakhtiari</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2003</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Artificial neural networks for pattern recognition</field><field name="creator">Fulcher, John Alan</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2004</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantitative analysis of sedimentation and structure relating to the permo-triassic succession of the Southern Sydney basin</field><field name="creator">Jakeman, B.

In doing so it draws on two broad areas of theory, on the social nature of technology and on the state as an institution of political domination. Technology is important to the state for it provides new means for state actors to achieve desired ends (state actors thus have an instrumental interest in technology), and it sets an agenda of policy problems for the state to deal with. Conversely, the state is important to technology for it is a major orienting agent and an organisational locus for much technological development.The thesis advances a number of central theoretical themes on technology and the state. While technology is a social construction, the product of deliberate choices and actions by particular social actors, it is also socially structuring in that technologies are ways of building order in the world and can therefore have political properties. Technologies embody the values and interests of those groups informing their development, so inherent in any new technology there is a potential for conflict between those responsible for it and those affected by its social implementation. The state is an independent political actor which has its own power base and which can mobilise its own administrative, coercive and ideological resources. However, the state in capitalist society has to act within a national and international context which both constrains and influences its capacity to exercise its power. The societal context enmeshes the state in contradictions, and in seeking to resolve these, foster consensus and mobilise acceptance of their policies, state actors deploy ideology, political language and symbolic action as political resources. Drawing on this theoretical framework, the thesis analyses the changing political discourse on technology in Australia from the mid-1970's to the mid-1980's. During this period, against a background context of growing economic crisis, there arose a technological change debate in which a "technology as threat" perspective prevailed. The central themes in this were that the rate of technological change was increasing and was moving beyond human control, and consequently the associated social dislocations (particularly the prospect of widespread "technological unemployment") were becoming a major problem. What was sought by many groups was some form of centralised control over technological change to ensure that the costs and benefits were equitably distributed. This perspective, and the demands arising from it, presented a challenge to the economic order, its decision-making structures and the ideologies that legitimated them. Governments within the Australian state responded to these challenges, and two such responses are analyzed in the thesis: the Fraser Government's Myers Inquiry into Technological Change in Australia and the New South Wales Technology Research Unit. Both embodied the concept of technology assessment, but in different forms. These responses were important symbolic actions, for they not only provided symbolic reassurance through the propagation of a rhetoric of control (technology can be managed to the benefit of all) and a legitimation of the order by reasserting the ideology of technological progress, they also were attempts to contain subordinate group pressures. Such actions went some way to rehabilitating technology in the political discourse, and they marked the beginning of the end of the technology as threat perspective therein. Another aspect of the political rehabilitation of technological change was the promotion of the strategic economic importance of technology through the rhetoric of "technology as opportunity". Through this state actors have sought to gain the positive acceptance of the technological order and a consensus on the desirability of new technology. In order to mobilise consent, the rhetoric of technology as opportunity has been embedded in a language of crisis ("there is no alternative"), strategies to improve the public image of science and technology have been deployed, and the concerns about the social implications of technological change have been displaced from the policy arena. These activities have been most successful under the auspices of the Hawke Labor Government's "Accord". In a context of "cooperation among social partners", a policy of public support for private  technology has been implemented, consensus maintained and dissent contained. If in the technological change debate, technology had been politicised, in a political climate where technology as opportunity dominated, technology had become depoliticised.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2112</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Executive dysfunction in schizophrenia</field><field name="creator">Leicester, Susan</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2127</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development from below: an exploratory study of the concept and process of development from lay people's point of view</field><field name="creator">Makhoul, Jihad</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2158</field></doc><doc><field name="title">MOSFET dosimetry for radiotherapy interface measurements</field><field name="creator">Bengua, Gerard B.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2163</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On the margins of post-coloniality: Vilas Sarang's work and the politics of reception</field><field name="creator">Ur-Rehman, Saeed</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2164</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mathematical models for the Wollongong urban area</field><field name="creator">Shaw, Joan A.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2181</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The sand extraction industry in Wollongong, N.

The proposed Perspectival ITS Management Model is an approach to reconciliation/integration of object/subject from a phenomenological viewpoint. The development of the Perspectival ITS Management Model has been heavily influenced by the work of John Haynes (2001a). In order to investigate the applicability of the Perspectival ITS Management Model a constructionist epistemological stance is taken in the thesis, which describes an overview of current objective ITS management theory, that is analysed and focussed through a normative ITS Management Model (developed by the candidate in the early stages of the thesis). The thesis goes on to develop the objective theoretical view of the management of open systems architectures and uses this to investigate the subjective case study accounts of the management of open systems architectures from 1993-1996 in the Australian federal government. These cases are used to highlight how the Perspectival ITS Management Model can be utilised to enhance, extend and transform our understanding of ITS Management in ways that the current body of theory does not.A postscript has also been developed to illustrate how the Perspectival ITS Management Model can also be applied to the ITS management landscape (whole-of-government ITS outsourcing) of the Australian federal govenment (1996 - 2001) after the initial open systems case study period (1993-1996).</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/844</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Critical sets of f-squares, latin squares and youden squares</field><field name="creator">Fitina, Lakoa F.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2011</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The management of large scale heavy industrial projects</field><field name="creator">Vidins, Vidvuds</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2637</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hydrocarbon source rocks in the Balikpapan Bay area, East Kalimantan, Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Marbun, Anthony</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2644</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sedimentation in Lake Albert, Wagga Wagga, NSW</field><field name="creator">Caitcheon, Gary Gordon</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2646</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The petrology of the Goobarragandra District, Southeast of Tumut, New South Wales</field><field name="creator">Ohmsen, Graham S.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2651</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An encoder system for the 18-inch telescope and uvbyHB photometry of bright UV stars</field><field name="creator">Wade, Brian R.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2662</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling of Ground parrot (Pezoporus wallicus) habitat in Barren Grounds Nature Reserve and Budderoo National Park</field><field name="creator">Marthick, John Keith</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2892</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The contribution of teacher talk to the production and reproduction of gendered subjectivity in physical education lessions</field><field name="creator">Wright, Janice E.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2922</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developments in the abatement of atmospheric pollution caused iron and steel works</field><field name="creator">Dymet, A.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2967</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Feeding, metabolic rate, and peptide YY regulation in obese-prone and obese-resistant mice</field><field name="creator">Rahardjo, Gita L</field><field name="description">Some individuals become obese while others remain lean on a high energy diet. The cause of this susceptibility to the development of diet-induced obesity is still unknown. Variations in energy intake, expenditure and the type of substrate being oxidised, as well as Peptide YY (PYY) system regulation are believed to contribute to differential susceptibility to the development of dietinduced obesity. This project aimed to compare energy balance regulation including energy intake and expenditure, and the PYY system in diet-induced obese (DIO) and diet-resistant (DR) mice. To investigate energy balance this project measured food intake, body mass gain, spontaneous activity, 24h-metabolic rates and body composition in DIO, DR and low-fat-fed (LF) mice. Plasma PYY was measured by radioimmunoassay and its central binding sites (Neuropeptide YY1, 2 &amp; 5 receptors) were measured by quantitative autoradiography. This study has shown that body weight gain was significantly (50%) higher in DIO mice compared to DR and LF mice (F2,32= 101.5, p&lt;0.001). The higher net energy gain in DIO mice was due to their significantly higher food intake compared to DR mice (F2,33=7.79, p=0.002). There were no differences in the metabolic rate, spontaneous activity or type of substrate being oxidized between the DIO and DR mice. The levels of plasma PYY were 32% lower in the DIO mice than in LF mice (p=0.007). PYY and NPY-Y2 receptor binding densities in the DIO mice were significantly higher than DR mice (52% and 24%, respectively) and LF mice (44% and 37%, respectively) at the caudal medulla. Overall, the major contributing factor to diet-induced obesity in this animal model was increased viii energy intake, not a difference in energy expenditure, assimilation efficiency or the substrate types that were oxidized. Reduced plasma PYY in DIO mice may have resulted in the compensatory upregulation of PYY and NPY-Y2 receptor binding density in the caudal medulla. This may contribute at least partially towards the development of diet-induced obesity as this pathway suppresses food intake.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3057</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intergenerational cultural differences among Muslim women in Wollongong</field><field name="creator">Munawar, Riffat</field><field name="description">This thesis considers the interrelationship between migration and religiosity of the first and second generation Pakistani women in Wollongong, New South Wales. It addresses the question of why religious commitment becomes a more significant source of social identity for these women. There are two basic manifestations of this greater significance of religion. First, it is manifested in the nature of fundamental ideals; namely, where religious ideals reinforce ethnic allegiance, it is likely to arouse especially fervent expressions of commitment. This expression of commitment rests on the assumption that Pakistani ethnicity relates to religious identity and its people, whereas an Islamic state it has a universal relevance.The social boundaries which encompass expressions of religious identity among Pakistani women are pervasive and clear-cut compared to relatively permeable ethnic boundaries.In addition the overall goal of this research was to identify and describe the inter-generational cultural differences among women. Most cultural elements such as religion, language, in-group marriage and certain customs as well, were maintained by the second generation. However, there are marked changes in the attitude of first generation which are reflected in the jobs taken up by the daughters, in the way the daughters' consent are sought in the selection of the marriage partners.

In order to understand this relationship a series of five case studies located within three schools from a Catholic school system were explored.Within Australia there have been calls for increased investments in the professional learning of teachers (McKenzie, 2002; Vinson, 2001; Ramsay, 2000) and more extensive understanding regarding the impact of professional learning on teachers beliefs (Rodgers, 2002). There class have been motivated in part by pressures linked to globalisation (Fullan, 2000; Darling-Hammond, 1996; Hargreaves, 1994; DEST, 2003; NITL 2005) and driven by the need for educators to produce students who realise the need for diverse, continuous and appropriate or life-long learning (Darling-Hammond, 2005; Fullan, 2000). Of interest to this inquiry is the notion that individual teacher change occurs within an organisational context (Weick, 1995; Vaughan, 1996; Mills, 2003; Coburn, 2001, 2004, 2005) fraught with powerful organisational and cultural factors that work to either enable or inhibit teacher change (Datnow, 2002; Fullan, 2000; Goodson, 2001).There is a paucity of literature reporting studies conducted at a classroom level that focus upon understanding how teachers transform professional learning experiences into their individual classroom environments. This study aims to address this research gap by working towards the development of a more robust theory of the change process involved in the transfer of literacy based professional learning experiences into classroom practice.This inquiry utilises a qualitative constructive methodology in a &#8216;bricolage&#8217; (Denzin &amp; Lincoln, 2000a: 4; Arminio &amp; Hultgren, 2002:456) that reflects the complex nature of classroom research and enables both a grounded theory methodology and case study methods to be utilised within this study. This choice acknowledges the importance of understanding the &#8216;multiple realities&#8217; of the respondents (Guba &amp; Lincoln, 1989:143) as well as the complex nature of the phenomena under study. The elements of Case Study and Grounded Theory, the way they are used in this inquiry, the unique setting and the interconnections between and among various methods of data collection and analysis serve to create the environment within which this inquiry is contained.The resultant grounded theory presents a theory that is grounded in or emerges from data (Dick, 2002; Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967; Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1990). This is represented in diagrammatic form and demonstrates and discusses the type of change processes that teachers engage in. Implications and recommendations for a range of stakeholders are discussed in a number of related areas.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/847</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structure of properties of the heat affected zone of P91 creep resistant steel</field><field name="creator">Sulaiman, Samsiah</field><field name="description">This investigation is concerned with the characterisation of actual welded samples of P91 - a 9%Cr heat resisting steel that is widely used for pressure vessels in the power generation industry. Although the creep resistance of the normalised and tempered base steel is excellent, weld fabrication compromises creep performance because of degraded properties in the heat affected zone (HAZ). In order to elucidate the structure and properties of the HAZ, dilatometer heat treatments and simulations of HAZ sub-zones were carried out using both a dilatometer and a Gleeble thermo-mechanical simulator. The simulated samples were used to study the microstructure of the HAZ sub-zones and to subject them to creep testing.In actual welding, post weld heat treatment (PWHT) is used to produce a uniform tempered martensite structure across the weldment, making it difficult to distinguish the HAZ sub-zones and the boundary with the unaffected base plate. Nevertheless, hardness profiles across the HAZ and measurements within the sub-zones confirmed that softening occurs below the base plate hardness after PWHT in the intercritical (IC) and grain refined (GR) sub-zones. The creep fracture times of cross-weld creep samples were also lower than parent metal because of type IV fracture in these HAZ sub-zones.Dilatometric investigations shed new light on the sensitivity of the properties of the martensite to the thermal cycle associated with austenitisation and subsequent cooling. The AC1 and AC3 temperatures were increased with increasing heating rate and MS was lower for a lower heating rate. MS was found to vary from 420&#176;C to 370&#176;C and the hardness of the martensite from 365 to 480 HV, depending on the thermal cycle. This varialibilty is due to the extent of carbide solution. There was a marked increase in hardness with increasing peak temperature of the thermal cycle, but subsequent simulated PWHT substantially decreased the hardness and the hardness range of the simulated sub-zones.An excellent correlation was found between the structures and properties of the HAZ of the actual welds and the simulated sub-zones produced by both dilatometric and Gleeble techniques. It was established that the heat input (1.6 or 2.6 kJ/mm) had only a minor effect on the microstructure and hardness of Gleeble simulated sub-zone samples. TEM results confirmed the presence of coarse Cr-rich, M23C6 and fine V-and Nb-rich, MC in all simulated sub-zones, before and after PWHT, except for the as simulated GCHAZ in which carbide solution occurred.Accelerated creep testing showed rapid creep failure of both AR and simulated IC and GR sub-zone samples for testing at higher temperatures in the range of 630&#176;C to 670&#176;C and at a higher stress, 100 MPa compared to 80 MPa. Failure was associated with high creep ductility and the phenomenon of rehardening in the region adjacent to the neck due to rapid work hardening prior to fracture. This type of failure has been labelled Mode 1 and is characterised structurally by grains and creep cavities that are strongly elongated parallel to the tensile axis. Another characteristic type of creep failure, Mode 2, exhibits a low creep ductility and transversely aligned creep cavities. This mode was found in notched AR samples and notched simulated GCHAZ samples tested at 630&#176;C and a stress at 80 MPa. However, for both Mode 1 and 2 failures, non-metallic inclusions were found to play a significant role in the nucleation of creep cracking and cavition. The research work identified that the GRHAZ is the most creep susceptible HAZ sub-zone because the thermal cycle results in carbide coarsening, reduced precipitation and solid solution strengthening and a high &#947; prior grain boundary surface area/unit volume. The creep resistance was most marked for the simulated GCHAZ samples and this property relates strongly to the hardness of the P91 steel prior to creep testing.The important role of non-metallic inclusions in the nucleation of creep cracking and cavitation indicates that control of the type, size distribution and content of inclusions should have a significant effect on the creep life of P91 steel.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/777</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental impacts and the ecology of sponges and ascidians in south-eastern Australian coastal lakes and lagoons</field><field name="creator">Barnes, Peter Brendan</field><field name="description">Estuaries worldwide are under threat from urbanisation and development and will need effective management for their successful conservation. Coastal lakes and lagoons have been identified as one of the estuary types most susceptible to human impacts largely because of their isolated nature and slow flushing times. Management of estuaries will be most effective when based on a sound scientific understanding of the patterns of distribution, biology and ecology over the full range of biodiversity of these systems, however, such an understanding is lacking for many systems and many taxa. Studies of sponges and ascidians in coastal lakes and lagoons are rare compared to other taxa, particularly in the southern hemisphere. This study represents the first detailed scientific investigation of the ecology of sponges and ascidian in coastal lakes and lagoons of southeastern Australia. Consequently, a large part of this thesis was devoted to quantifying basic patterns of distribution. I started with a pilot study to develop an effective sampling design, followed by large-scale comparisons among different types of lake, comparisons among habitats within lakes and an environmental impact study. I concluded with a manipulative experiment to examine processes responsible for smallscale patterns of distribution of sponges in seagrass meadows.In the pilot study, distributions of sponges and ascidians were quantified at a hierarchy of three spatial scales in each of two coastal lakes. Nested analyses of variance were then used to identify spatial scales at which variation was significant. Most sponges and ascidians were very patchily distributed at a range of spatial scales from 10s of metres up to 100s of kilometres. Unlike other published examples of cost&#8211; benefit analyses, very few taxa were widespread over the larger spatial scales. Cost&#8211; benefit analyses done to determine the optimal sampling design revealed inclusion of patchily distributed taxa in analyses improved the overall precision of sampling for comparisons of assemblages among lakes.Large-scale comparisons of assemblages of sponges and ascidians were made among lakes of different size (big versus small), opening regime (mostly open to the ocean versus mostly closed) and level of environmental modification (extensively modified versus more pristine). Similar to other taxa studied in coastal lakes, in general there were more species in lakes mostly open to the ocean compared to the mostly closed lakes, and importantly, no sponges and only one species of ascidian was found in the small closed lakes. There also appeared to be an effect of the level of modification of a lake with relatively smaller abundances of ascidians in extensively modified lakes, and a complete absence of sponges from one of the extensively modified lakes.Habitat-associated patterns were examined at smaller spatial scales by comparing the distributions of sponges and ascidians with the species composition and percentage cover of seagrass and macroalgae within two lakes; St Georges Basin and Wallis Lake. Several patterns of association were observed, but these varied among species of sponge and ascidian. In St Georges Basin, the most common sponge, Aplysinella cf. rhax and the native ascidian Pyura stolonifera were positively correlated with the seagrass, Posidonia australis. In contrast, the introduced ascidian, Styela plicata was more abundant in areas dominated by the seagrass, Zostera capricorni. In Wallis Lake, sponges were most diverse and some species most abundant in large beds of the macroalga, Lamprothamnion sp., while other sponges were found only on the holdfasts of brown macroalgae. In both lakes, sponges were generally less common in areas dominated by dense meadows of the seagrass, Zostera capricorni.Among the many anthropogenic impacts threatening the ecology of coastal lakes, the discharge of cooling water from coal-fired power stations represents an almost ideal case study from which to develop appropriate sampling regimes for detecting impacts on sponges and ascidians. Using reference locations both within and outside Lake Macquarie which has two cooling water outlets, I found assemblages of sponges and ascidians were often more diverse, more abundant and less temporally variable near to the outlets compared to reference locations.Based on the observation that the sponge, Suberites sp. which contains photosynthetic symbionts was absent from meadows of dense Zostera capricorni, I used in situ manipulative experiments in Smiths Lake to investigate processes which maybe affecting their distribution. Individual Suberites sp. were shaded, had water flow reduced and were transplanted into areas of dense Z. capricorni. There were no measurable short-term effects of shading or reduced water flow, but transplanted sponges were quickly eaten and I concluded predation by fish was likely to be a key process determining small-scale patterns of distribution of Suberites sp. in seagrass meadows. This result was in stark contrast to the majority of previous studies of the effects of seagrass habitat complexity on predation which have found predation to decrease with increasing density or complexity.In conclusion, I have sought to provide sound scientific information to aid in the management of these systems. A simple, but nevertheless key finding was that sponges and ascidians are indeed present and widespread in coastal lakes and lagoons of southeastern Australia and should not be continually overlooked in the management and conservation of these systems. Conservation will be complex and requires an understanding of environmental impacts and the consequences of management on the full range of biodiversity. The distributions of sponges and ascidians at large &#8216;lakewide&#8217; scales appear to behave similarly to other taxa. Management strategies which change the characteristics of a lake at these large spatial scales such as artificial openings of entrances could therefore be predicted to have similar effects across a range of taxa including sponges and ascidians. In contrast, at smaller spatial scales such as the complexity of seagrass meadows, some species of sponges and ascidians may behave very differently from other taxa. At present, our understanding of these naturally variable and complex systems is incomplete and will require ongoing scientific investigation to identify natural patterns of distribution, environmental impacts, important natural processes and the ecological consequences of management strategies.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/849</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Relationship factors and outcome in brief group psychotherapy for depression</field><field name="creator">Crowe, Trevor Patrick</field><field name="description">Relationship factors such as a psychotherapy group's cohesion and interpersonal climate have been touted as being analogous to the therapist-client alliance in individual psychotherapy, and as such should predict treatment outcome. However, predicting and explaining contributors to outcome in group psychotherapy remains unclear. This series of studies examined therapist-client alliance, group cohesion and climate, self-other differentiation processes (using a repertory grid method) and mastery of Core Conflictual Relationship Themes (CCRT) in brief dynamic group therapy for depression. These studies also integrated qualitative-phenomenological and clinical-quantitative research methodologies to examine in detail significant helpful and hindering psychotherapy events. It was found that therapeutic alliance is not analogous with group cohesion, but is associated with group member's engagement in therapeutic tasks. Perceived levels of conflict and group developmental processes helped explain the dimensions of cohesion. How group members defined themselves in relation to others meaningfully changed over therapy. Changes in perceived conflict in the group, and an individual's mastery of their CCRT patterns predicted outcome. In particular, through the experience of telling their stories, clients were able to change their responses to conflicts both within the group and in their wider interpersonal circle.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/850</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Study of newly discovered two dimensional cobalt based perovskite compounds doped with various rare earth elements</field><field name="creator">Yao, Qi Wen</field><field name="description">This thesis focuses on the study of a newly discovered two-dimensional CoO2 layer structured peroskite compound, Sr2CoO4. To explore doping effects on the physical properties of the new compound, a systematic and detailed experimental study has been carried out, relating to the aspects of synthesis, structure, transport and magneto-transport behaviour, magnetism, and dielectricity. Theoretical investigations have also been carried out for both crystal and electronic band structures, using Rietveld refinement and first-principles band structure calculations. Various rare earth element doped Sr2CoO4 polycrystalline compounds (Sr2-xRExCoO4, where x = 0.25 &#8211; 1.5 and RE = Pr, La, Gd, Eu, and Nd) were studied systematically. It has been found that the size and valence, as well as the doping level of the rare elements, control the physical properties of the Sr2CoO4. Ferromagnetic behaviour is found to exist in some of the doped compounds and to have interesting properties. It was observed that the lattice parameter a reminds relatively stable, with values around 3.7 to 3.8 &#197; for x = 1 for various RE doped compounds of Sr2-xRExCoO4. The Co-O(2) in-plane bond lengths were also not sensitive to different RE dopants for the x = 1 doping level. In contrast, lattice parameter c, as well as the out-of-plane bond length Co-O(1), varies with different RE dopants in the compound for the doping level of x = 1, and consequently, the unit cell volume also changes, depending on the RE dopant. It was found that Sr2CoO4 is the most tolerant to Pr as a dopant. For x values from 0.5 to 1.5, single phase Sr2CoO4 structured samples were achieved. La doping was compatible with single phase compounds for x = 1 &#8211; 1.25, and for Eu doping, single phase compounds were formed for x = 0.75 &#8211; 1. For both Gd and Nd doping, near single phases are formed for all the tested x values (x = 0.5 &#8211; 1.25).Our results show that some of the Pr-doped and La-doped single phase samples have large coercive fields, and hence, they have good potential industrial applications (permanent magnets in electric motors, magnetic recording media, etc.), while Eu-doped samples can have high magnetoresistance (MR) values, making the Eu-doped compound a good candidate for application as a colossal magnetic resistance (CMR) material. For the Pr-doped Sr2-xPrxCoO4, the lattice parameter c decreased with the Pr doping level x. The Curie temperature (TC) was found to be 200 K for Sr1.5Pr0.5CoO4. The resistivities were found to increase with doping level x. A large coercive field of about 1 Tesla (T) was found for the sample with x = 0.75. The values of the dielectric constant (&#949;) were over 2000 at low frequencies of less than 1 kHz (not shown here) and gradually decreased with increasing frequencies. The &#949; of the x = 1 sample is greater than that of the x = 0.75 sample, indicating that the charge induced capacitance in the x = 1 sample is greater than that of the x = 0.75 sample. This is in agreement with the trend of their resistivity measurements.   For the Eu-doped compounds of Sr2CoO4, single 214 phase was achieved for x = 0.75 - 1. The lattice parameter c decreased with the Eu doping level. The Curie temperatures were found to be around 160-200 K for samples with x = 0.75 and 1. An antiferromagnetic transition is observed at 35 K for the x = 0.75 sample. Magnetic semiconductor characteristics were observed for all the Eu-doped samples. The existence of unusually high magnetoresistance in these compounds makes them stands out from the rest of the RE doped compounds in this regard. For example, the sample with x = 1.25 showed a MR value of about 46% at 8 Tesla at 100 K. For the La-doped Sr2CoO4 compounds, the temperature dependence of the resistivity shows a semiconductor-like behavior over a wide range of temperatures, a metal-insulator transition at 240 K, and an upturn at 160 K for the x =1 , 1.25, and 0.75 samples. The coercive field was about 1 T for the sample with x = 0.75, while it is about 0.05 T for the x = 0.75 and 0.1 T for the x = 1.25 sample. A negative field hysteresis in the magnetoresistance in close correlation with the coercive field has been observed and can be explained by the grain boundary tunneling effect. First-principles band structure calculations were carried out for Sr1.5La0.5CoO4, and the results indicate that the system is metallic, with a high spin polarization which is responsible for the observed large magnetoresistance. The phonon density of states (PDOS) reveals that the Co 3d electrons and planar oxygen electrons are responsible for the high spin polarization at the Fermi surface in the compound. The Gd-doped Sr2CoO4 compounds were found to be paramagnetic semiconductors with MR values of only around 3 to 5%. Their transport properties can be described by the hopping model for semiconductors. Band structure calculations indicate that the spin polarization is high in the Gd-doped Sr2CoO4. Nd-doped compounds were found to be ferromagnetic semiconductors at temperatures of about 250 and 170 K for the x = 1 and 0.75 samples, respectively. Their MR valves were about 5 %, similar to those of the Gd-doped samples. The Nd doping raised the Curie temperature of Sr2CoO4, so that it reached 210 K for doping with Nd at levels up to x = 0.5.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/857</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Illumination invariant face detection</field><field name="creator">Cordiner, Alister</field><field name="description">The purpose of face detection is to process input images in order to determine the locations of any faces in the image. Faces are complex objects and detecting them remains a challenging task for computer vision systems, despite the relative ease with which humans are able to do so. One of the major difficulties faced by face detection systems is challenging illumination conditions, such as low level lighting and cast shadows. This thesis reviews the state of the art face detection methods (with particular emphasis on the method of Viola and Jones) and explores methods of overcoming adverse illumination conditions. These methods can be broadly classified as invariant features, normalization and variation modelling. Four novel approaches to overcoming illumination that fall into these 3 categories are proposed in this thesis, namely: (i) log-ratio Haar-like features; (ii) DC Haar-likefeatures; (iii) local variance normalisation; and (iv) classifier fusion. Furthermore, a new type of feature called the generalised integral image feature (GIIF) is proposed as an alterative to Haarlike features. The GIIF method is not specifically related to illumination invariant face detection, but instead applies to the more general task of face detection and is therefore presented as a separate chapter. Experimental results on standard face databases are provided for all of the proposed methods to verify that they achieve improved accuracy.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/864</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"Days of tears and longing": war, grief and memory in the Illawarra 1914-1925</field><field name="creator">Hawksley, Jennifer</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/883</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of chemically-modified proteins electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry</field><field name="creator">Bennett, Keiryn Lynn</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1118</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gamma-glutamyl compounds in human tissues</field><field name="creator">Hammond, Judith Winifred</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1153</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of the martensite in beta copper-tin alloys</field><field name="creator">Kennon, Noel F.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2080</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Parents' and adolescents' perceived influences and barriers to mental health services</field><field name="creator">Wahlin, Tim J.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2136</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Children of the killing fields: a study of Kampuchean adolescents in New South Wales</field><field name="creator">Chanthou, Chanthou</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2184</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Women: migration, culture and religious experience</field><field name="creator">Onley, Norma Claire</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2185</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Canon formation and indigenous anthologies</field><field name="creator">Virtich, Marisa</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2191</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of wearing a wetsuit on the thermoregulatory and cardiovascular responses observed during a triathalon in elite male competitors</field><field name="creator">Groeller, Herbert</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2841</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Strip detector for high spatial resolution dosimetry in radiation therapy</field><field name="creator">Cullen, Ashley James</field><field name="description">Radiation therapy is an established modality in the treatment of tumours. With treatments ever evolving and increasing in terms of their complexities, the need arises to ensure the best quality treatment is delivered; the survival of the patient relies upon it. A modern treatment such as Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy employs steep dose gradients varying dynamically to deliver complex dose profiles, whilst the experimental Microbeam Radiation Therapy (MRT) involves the delivery of an array of intense beams tens-of-microns wide separated by several hundred microns. In both cases, conventional dosimetry is inadequate in providing both spatial and temporal information about complex dose profiles.The silicon strip detector was created to fill this void in current dosimetry techniques. Designed to withstand the intense beam of a synchrotron wriggler x-rays whilst not significantly perturbing the beam, the detector provides linear sensitive volume elements two hundred microns in pitch. This enables the ability to perform high spatial resolution dosimetry in real time.This thesis investigates the use of the silicon strip detector as an on-line dosimetry system for MRT with applications to clinical radiotherapy. Of particular interest is the distribution and magnitude of energy deposition within the detector and the perturbative effect the strip detector has on a synchrotron wriggler x-ray beam.Monte Carlo simulations are performed to investigate the properties of radiation incident upon the detector. These seek to understand how a beam traversing the detector interacts with it, as well as the effects the detector has on the transmitted beam and its properties.The energy deposition spectrum within the detector was found to be predominant at low energies of below 100 keV. The deposition of dose through the detector was found to be largely constant with depth through the central axis of a beam, dropping to ~10-3 of the central value at 50 &#181;m off the central beam axis for an infinitesimally thin pencil beam and ~10-4 at 100 &#181;m off-axis. Energy deposition laterally through water was determined as dominated by secondary electrons from the beam-edge to 150 &#181;m, and Compton photons thereafter.The depth dose of a MRT pencil beam was found to have an average decrease in dose of (1.44 &#177; 0.15) % (95% C.I.) when the strip detector was introduced into the beam. The probability of interaction of incident photons with the detector for the MRT spectrum was determined with GEANT4 and theoretically with a comparison made. The overall interaction probability of an MRT photon is (1.97 &#177; 4.43&#215;10-4) % (95% C.I.).A simulation to determine the PVDR (peak-to-valley dose ratio) in a MRT field was created, however only the peak dose could be determined due to an inadequate primary photon count. The peak dose was found to decrease by 1.41 &#177; 0.03 % (95% C.I.). Qualitative film measurements (deliberate overexposure of peak regions) displayed an increase of valley dose to film at 10 mm in water with the strip detector in the beam, but no such phenomenon at a depth of 1 mm. A simplified GEANT4 simulation was created to replicate such results with only five beamlets. Peak-to-valley dose ratio calculations from the simulation show no discernible effect at 1 mm depth, but a discernible increase in the PVDR at 10 mm depth; replicating experimental results.Since charge collection across a semiconductor device is often complex and dynamically varies with the bias conditions. Ion beam induced charge collection (IBICC) studies seek to investigate the charge collection properties of the detector in various voltage-biasing conditions. It was found that the application of reverse bias to strips adjacent to that being read out reduced the effective sensitive volume of the read-out strip. This provides evidence for a proposal to incorporate biased guard-ring structures to prevent charge sharing, and improve the confinement of the sensitive volume.Finally, clinical irradiations are performed with a highly collimated orthovoltage x-ray beam down to beam sizes of hundreds of microns. The spatial resolution of the detector in this configuration was found to be 500 &#181;m. The efficacy of the detector in contemporary radiotherapy is also investigated through the use of a 6 MV linear accelerator&#8217;s photon beam. Excellent agreement was found between strip detector read-outs and reference data for the linear accelerator. A quadratic relation was found between dose rate and charge per strip.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/848</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Yeast water stress physiology</field><field name="creator">Mackenzie, Kylie Frances</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1082</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Human lens uv filters</field><field name="creator">Taylor, Lisa M.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1156</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Discursive production of the pacific in Australian colonial discourse</field><field name="creator">Hayes, Michael</field><field name="description">The thesis examines the genealogy of Austrahan coloniahsm in the Pacific by examining the production of 'the Pacific' as an object of knowledge in a variety of texts, disciplines, and practices. In arguing for an Austrahan colonial discourse I propose a distinct Australian formation of colonialism, informed by particular systems of knowledges, concepts, and institutions, which function in agi"eement with discourses of nation. The primary areas of research for this thesis are adventure narratives, tourism, and academic study. The discursive production of the Pacific is validated by the Romantic concept of 'imagination,' which positions the west as able to intervene, and represent by 'imagining,' Pacific Islander cultures and terrains. Imagination is used in discourses of Pacific history to justify the constmction of Pacific Islanders past by western academic discourses. I examine the institutional network in which Pacific history and anthropology are articulated by discussing the first school of Pacific history at the Australian National University. The historical context of the stereotypes of the cannibal Pacific Islander man and sexualised woman, particularly the compUcity of the university in reproducing these stereotypes, is discussed. Finally, I turn to the tourist industry to examine Austrahan colonialism as a discursive practice. The economies and administration of colonialism can be introduced by regulating the activities, sights, and relationships with Pacific Islanders of the Australian tourist. Importantly, I argue that Australian colonial discourse is a contemporaiy discourse which is currentiy active in areas such as tourism and academic research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1925</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Capital expenditure budgeting &amp; organisational change</field><field name="creator">Greenwell, Mary M.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2275</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contributions to secure and privacy-preserving use of electronic credentials</field><field name="creator">Shahandashti, Siamak Fayyaz</field><field name="description">In this thesis, we make contributions to secure and privacy preserving use of electronic credentials in three different levels.First, we address the case in credential systems where a credential owner wants to show her credential to a verifier without taking the risk that the ability to prove ownership of her credential is transferred to the verifier. We define credential ownership proof protocols for credentials signed by standard signature schemes. We also propose proper security definitions for the protocol, aiming to protect the security of both the credential issuer and the credential owner against concurrent attacks. We give two generic constructions of credential ownership proofs based on identity-based encryption and identity based identification schemes. Furthermore, we show that signatures with credential ownership proofs are equivalent to identity-based identification schemes, in the sense that any secure construction of each implies a secure construction of the other. Moreover, we show that the GQ identification protocol yields an efficient credential ownership proof for credentials signed by the RSA signature scheme and prove the protocol concurrently-secure.Then, we give a generic construction for universal (mutli) designated-verifier signature schemes from a large class of signature schemes, referred to as Class C. The resulting schemes are efficient and have two important properties. Firstly, they are provably DV-unforgeable, non-transferable and also non-delegatable. Secondly, the signer and the designated verifier can independently choose their cryptographic settings. We also propose a generic construction for (hierarchical) identity-based signature schemes from any signature scheme in C and prove that the construction is secure against adaptive chosen message and identity attacks. We discuss possible extensions of our constructions to identity-based ring signatures and identity-based designated-verifier signatures from any signature in C. Furthermore, we show that it is possible to combine the above constructions to obtain signatures with combined functionalities.Finally, inspired by the recent developments in attribute-based encryption, we propose threshold attribute-based signatures (t-ABS). In a t-ABS, signers are associated with a set of attributes and verification of a signed document against a verification attribute set succeeds if the signer has a threshold number of (at least t) attributes in common with the verification attribute set. A t-ABS scheme enables a signature holder to prove possession of signatures by revealing only the relevant (to the verification attribute set) attributes of the signer, hence providing signer-attribute privacy for the signature holder. We define t-ABS schemes, formalize their security and propose two t-ABS schemes: a basic scheme secure against selective forgery and a second one secure against existential forgery, both provable in the standard model, assuming hardness of the computational Diffie-Hellman problem. We show that our basic t-ABS scheme can be augmented with two extra protocols that are used for efficiently issuing and verifying t-ABS signatures on committed values. We call the augmented scheme a threshold attribute based c-signature scheme (t-ABCS). We show how a t-ABCS scheme can be used to realize a secure threshold attribute-based anonymous credential system (t-ABACS) providing signer-attribute privacy. We propose a security model for t-ABACS and give a concrete scheme using t-ABCS scheme. Using the simulation paradigm, we prove that the credential system is secure if the t-ABCS scheme is secure.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3036</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of acoustic emissions in orthogonal cutting operations</field><field name="creator">Park, Yong-Jin</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2415</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of quantitative nutritional guidelines for a central kitchen: a tool for classifying menu items into diabetic, cholesterol-lowering and weight reduction diets</field><field name="creator">Jukkola, Katja</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2696</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Air conditioning systems used in Australia</field><field name="creator">Blundell, J.

Conseauently there has been considerable activity and research to provide the engineer with information that will enable him to design bulk solid storage facilities for unobstructed and predictable flow. There also has been an increasing tendency in industry to handle finer materials which has led to considerable difficulties especially in cases where the actual flow rate was considerably less than plant capacities.Such misfortunes have prompted a number of investigations in this field in an endeavour to understand the flow of fine materials and to make suitable modifications to gravity flow bins to improve the flow situation. This thesis is concerned with the prediction of the flow rates of fine bulk solids from mass fLow bins and hoppers. In this initiaL treatment the two-phase nature of the flow will become apparent. The analysis requires the imultaneous consideration of the continuity of the bulk solid and the interstitial fluid,and the inclusion of the effects of the interstitial gas pressure gradients in the equation of motion of the flowing bulk solid.This analysis will be applied ihitially to an incremental element of bulk solid,the flow through which is described by a number of partial differential equations whose solution requires considerable numerical effort. An approximate analysis is then be developed by considering the flow through an assumed element . Three non-linear total differential equdtions result which also require numerical techniques for their solution.By making suitable assumptions for the forni of the flow stress field ,analytical solutions for the flow rate, the interstitial gas pressure distribution and the flow stress field are obtained for channels with or without surcharge. Pesults for coarse bulk solids are then derived by neglecting the effects of interstitial fliud pressure graaients. The predicted flow rates compare favourably with observed flow rates from an experimental pLane flow bin.It must be stressed that this is only an initial treatment, extensive work still is required to completely understand and predict the flow of general bulk solids from bins.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1581</field></doc><doc><field name="title">My spouse is a "stranger": a journey unravelling the nature of the intimate marital relationships of spousal caregivers of dementia sufferers from a personal construct perspective</field><field name="creator">Rudd, Marilyn Georgina</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1670</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Place, sexualities and community: theorising the constitution of 'lesbian' identities</field><field name="creator">Lambert, Karen</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1791</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bite your tongue</field><field name="creator">Rendle-Short, Francesca</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/918</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Undergraduate accounting programmes in developing countries: the case of Iran</field><field name="creator">Roudaki, Jamal</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1033</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling the macroeconomic consequences of oil shocks for the Indonesian economy, 1973-1991</field><field name="creator">Thaha, Atifah</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with developing a dynamic long run macroeconomic model of Indonesia, focussing upon the contribution of oil developments upon that economy's income, investment, wealth, balance of payments, and trade performance. The model incorporates the main characteristics of the oil sector m the Indonesian economy, emphasising the crucial role of government in the distribution of oil production for domestic usage and for export, and the spending of oil generated revenue upon consumption (routine) and investment (development) (equivalent to a capital transfer to the private sector) expenditure. While focus is placed upon oil developments, the model is sufficiently general for analysing the economic effects arising from non oil shocks and that arising from a wide range of policy options.A numerical simulation procedure is adopted to identify how the domestic economy is affected by oil related shocks, and how such outcomes can be altered through the adoption of alternative policy responses. The roles of alternative nominal exchange rate policies, combined with different degrees of control over international capital mobility, are also incorporated, in order to capture the impact of such policies upon the domestic economy. This is particularly prevalent in the context of an economy such as Indonesia's, which is engaging in extensive economic liberalisation.The study indicates that the influence of the oil sector on the Indonesian macroeconomy has been significant over the long run, and that this has been more so from oil price shocks in comparison to that of oil production shocks. A dynamic and long run analysis is adopted in order to identify the most appropriate policy responses in order to moderate the possible Dutch disease effects, and to enhance the benefits arising from such oil shocks.The major results of this study suggest that adopting a more development-oriented policy (investment) towards additional oil revenue, would moderate the Dutch disease consequences, improve the longer term economic development of the economy, and also smooth the adjustment process. The opposite would be so from stimulating consumption expenditure. Adopting a more export oriented policy towards oil production worsens the Dutch disease consequences, however this would be compensated by a greater accumulation of net foreign asset stocks and vice versa.It is also found that a flexible exchange rate policy, combined with perfect international capital mobility, is a preferable response to an oil price increase, whilst adopting a flexible exchange rate, together with high degree of control over international capital mobility, is a preferable response to an oil production increase. Hence adopting a more market oriented policy, that leads to a greater role for the private sector and closer integration with the global market economy, is found to be preferable for the case of Indonesia.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1321</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Two phase resonant link inverter</field><field name="creator">Irvine, David R.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1354</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Two-layer coding schemes for ATM environment</field><field name="creator">Khademi-Doroh, Morteza</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1355</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Skin dose from radiotherapy x-rays:</field><field name="creator">Butson, Martin Jonathan</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1366</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Edge waves</field><field name="creator">Louis, John Peter</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1545</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A tale of three varieties</field><field name="creator">McPhail, Carolyn E.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2040</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rural income and employment in Indonesia: a case study of the Cimanuk River basin in Java</field><field name="creator">Mark, Sandra</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2287</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Technology work and management: workplace industrial relations in steelmaking at Port Kembla Steelworks, 1967-87</field><field name="creator">Kelly, Diana</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2288</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Automatic measurement of overhead power line joints</field><field name="creator">Huang, Huang</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2443</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cold model study of top blowing effect on dispersion in a channel reactor</field><field name="creator">Winarti, Destini Rosa</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2475</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Creep-fatigue behaviour and life prediction</field><field name="creator">Goswami, Tarun</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2476</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of size segregation on coal bulk density in the coke oven</field><field name="creator">Wang, Jie-Ming</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2593</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessment of candidate antigens of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae for the serodiagnosis of porcine pleuropneumonia</field><field name="creator">Dixit, Sameer M.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2908</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of urbanisation on the superb fairy-wren (malurus cyaneus)</field><field name="creator">Parsons, Holly Maree</field><field name="description">The process of urbanisation is altering much of the world&#8217;s natural habitats, resulting in landscapes vastly different from those they replace. However, the urban matrix is not devoid of wildlife. In fact, its capacity to support a wide diversity of fauna is becoming increasingly valued. Urbanisation changes the patterns of resources and habitat structure, creating mosaics of optimal and sub-optimal patches. Therefore we would expect to see changes in the behaviour and ecology of species living in urban habitats. The superb fairy-wren (Malurus cyaneus) is a small insectivorous bird species whose response to urbanisation is unclear. It has been shown to prefer the edges of remnant habitat, particularly in weed-infested areas, yet is patchy in its distribution in urban landscapes, and thought to be in decline there. In this thesis I have examined how (a) vegetation characteristics, (b) territory size, (c) behaviour, including foraging and (d) food availability differ by living in urban habitats compared to rural/remnant habitats. Superb fairy-wrens showed a preference for suburban landscapes with shrubs, usually native, and avoided suburban locations without them. In both rural/remnant edge habitat and suburban habitat they were also associated with the introduced weed lantana (Lantana camara). It is likely that this shrub provides important shelter, especially in the absence of native vegetation that provides equivalent structure. Radio-tracking of female superb fairy-wrens revealed that territories in suburban locations were, on average, half the size of territories in rural/remnant habitats when calculated using the minimum convex polygon method. Calculations made with the fixed kernel method indicated that there was no difference in territory size. This difference in size calculated by different methods suggests that superb fairy&#172; wrens utilise more of the vegetation within suburban territories and avoid larger areas of unsuitable habitat in rural/remnant edge locations. The sizes of both the suburban and rural/remnant habitats were similar to that in higher quality fragmented habitats, as calculated by previous studies. Regardless of the location of their territories, superb fairy-wrens foraged largely on the ground but spent the most of their time, on average, in shrubs. Males spent significantly longer foraging in suburban locations than rural/remnant habitat, with females showing the same, but non-significant trend. This increase in foraging time was not taken at the expense of other behaviours however and appeared to be due to the size of food items in suburban territories. The biomass of individual arthropods was smaller in suburban locations than rural/remnant territories but the total biomass per site was the same, largely due to the greater abundance of orthopterans in rural/remnant areas. This suggests that superb fairy-wrens foraged for longer in suburban territories to obtain equivalent intake to that in rural/remnant territories. Suburban areas without superb fairy-wrens did not have a lower biomass of arthropods than suburban fairy-wren territories and therefore it is unlikely that birds in suburban habitats were selecting their territories based on food availability. Superb fairy-wrens instead appear restricted in their distribution in urban habitats due to a shortage of suitable vegetation, primarily comprised of the shrub layer. While there were changes to food resources, the flexible behaviour of this species with urbanisation allows it to modify its foraging behaviour to compensate for this difference. We do not know the long term consequences faced by individuals occupying the urban landscape, but it appears that that these two habitats, with varying degrees of urban impact, provide suitable habitat for this species to persist.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/821</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Accounting implications in social welfare payments: a Foucauldian analysis</field><field name="creator">Alagiah, Ratnam</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1011</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Theorem proving algorithms using lambda calculus and combinatory logic</field><field name="creator">Rizkalla, Ramzy Master</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2848</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of rock mass characterisation to slope stability problems</field><field name="creator">Khanlari, Gholam Reza</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1226</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of design and analysis of reinforced soil dams</field><field name="creator">Maghareh, Mohammad Reza</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1227</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The test-retest reliability of a skills audit questionnaire</field><field name="creator">Bargon, Paul</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1474</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Semantic memory in Alzheimer's disease</field><field name="creator">Bliokas, Vida Victoria</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1677</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contemporary aboriginal songs and songwriters: post-colonialism, categorisation and orality</field><field name="creator">Beniuk, David</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2193</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Oil injection methods for uniting and separating pressure joints</field><field name="creator">Jeffcoat, Ron</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2980</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bush fire patchiness</field><field name="creator">Heemstra, Simon</field><field name="description">All bush fires are patchy at some scale and to some degree. In their most obvious form, bush fire patches are unburnt islands of vegetation within a fire boundary. Bush fire patchiness is an important part of the fire regime, because it can affect ecological processes such as local extinction and recolonisation and can contribute to the post-fire resilience of populations of animals that need vegetation cover. During a fire, the survival of plants and animals can often depend on the degree of patchiness. Unburnt patches may therefore affect the post-fire dynamics of plant and animal populations. Continuity of fuel loads is a major contributor to bush fire behaviour including the intensity and rate spread of the fire. Further, the degree of patchiness is one measure of the effectiveness of a hazard-reduction fire in reducing fuel and thus modifying subsequent wildfire behaviour. An understanding of the patchiness of fires is of critical importance for landscape bush fire risk management. Quantifying patchiness is no simple task, partly because of the continuous range of scales at which patchiness occurs and partly because patches cannot always be readily detected by remote sensing techniques, especially in forested systems in which canopy scorch is not closely aligned with burning of the understorey. Moreover, remotely sensed data are expensive at the fine resolution required to detect the small scale patterns that are ecologically relevant (i.e. of the order of metres). In such systems, a method of rapidly assessing patchiness in the field is much needed. The first aim of this study was to develop a field technique for the quantification of patchiness. The second aim was to determine the effectiveness of the technique in estimating overall patchiness in a site, using a simulation model based on a range of known patch sizes and distributions. The third was to use field estimation of patchiness to investigate the environmental parameters that influence the patchiness of fires. A range of methods was assessed and transect sampling the post bush fire landscape using Global Positioning Systems (GPS) to produce a spatial model within a Geographic Information System (GIS) was found to be an accurate and simple method for assessing the patchiness of a fire. This method was time efficient and cost effective. It produced an output that provided a clear description of the overall patchiness of a site as well as the relative distribution of the sizes of the patches. The spatial model can display the distribution of proportion of areas burnt within the landscape. I tested the statistical effectiveness of this transect sampling method using spatial modelling within a GIS. I wrote a program to simulate thousands of transect samples on a range of different spatial arrangements of patches within a landscape. This simulation revealed that the minimum number of transects required to provide an estimate of the actual 'patchiness' is dependent on the type of fire and range between 5 and 10, to obtain 90% accuracy of the estimate of the patchiness. The empirical transect data from each site was used using GIS to develop a spatial model assessing the relative influences of a range of topographic and environmental variables on the patchiness of a fire. The relative influence of these variables was different for each fire. From this analysis, a map was produced from a GIS that described the spatial distribution of patchiness within a given fire. This transect data was graphed to indicate the relative distribution and abundance of unburnt patches. The studies performed indicate these methods have important applications for managing biodiversity and wildfires.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Environmental Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A history of Australian journalism in Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Tapsell, Ross</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the changing professional practice of Australian journalists since they began reporting in Indonesia from 1945. Existing literature on the Australian media in Indonesia has emphasised the problem of biased and troublesome Australian journalists who have deliberately caused bilateral relations disturbances between Australia and Indonesia. It is argued that the existing literature overstates the agency of Australian journalists, and downplays the attitudes and roles of governments and news forces in the shaping of journalists&#8217; professional practice. This thesis will show how Australian journalists and their Indonesian staff have attempted to report what they saw as the &#8216;truth&#8217; from the archipelago, yet have been subjected to numerous pressures and vii constraints that hinders their professional practice and limits their autonomy. In particular, Indonesian staff working for Australian news agencies have been subjected to numerous pressures from a hierarchical system of newsgathering and from their own government. The Indonesian Government and military have attempted to control the flow of news through often crude and violent tactics to hinder journalists&#8217; professional practice. The Australian Government, which supports the notion of a free press, has also limited Australian journalists&#8217; professional practice in Indonesia. The news system requirement for journalists to seek elite sources and the improvements in communications technology have also hindered the freedoms for Australian journalists as they operate from Indonesia. Thus, it is argued that Australian journalists in Indonesia and their local staff have worked under a range of constraints and have been pressured to serve a variety of competing masters in reporting from the archipelago. Their work has to be understood as a complex artefact crafted in response to this range of insistent and intrusive pressures.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3028</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship between ploidy, gene expression and vigour in citrus</field><field name="creator">Lee, L.

A motorist is often forced to take some emergency action to avoid a potential accident.In most situations on the road there are many visual cues to give motorists an indication of an appropriate travel speed as well as conferring a perception of the speed actually being travelled. These may take the form of longitudinal lines on the road, warning signs or the general roadside landscaping.However, in fog these cues cease to be visible and motorists commonly drive at speeds well in excess of the available stopping distance, frequently unaware they are doing so having lost the cues that help create the perception of speed. This problem is obviously accentuated on higher speed roads such as divided carriageways where the only cues are to tell drivers they are on a high speed road and no apparent threats are available to prompt a lowering of speed.To address this there have been many attempts to provide Driver Aid Systems to warn motorists of the hazards they face. One such system was provided on the Waterfall - Bulli section of the F6 in 1974. However the continued occurrences of multiple vehicle accidents culminating in a 66 vehicle event in 1986 suggested that the system may no longer be as effective as was originally intended. (No research was ever undertaken to assess whether the system actually met its objectives although this was unlikely, given the nature of the fog in the Bulli Tops area, the way the system operated and the fact a number of features of the original proposal were never actually installed).Proposed Solution Rather than simply replace a system which was no longer maintainable or visible in bad fog conditions with a similar system, a research project was proposed to examine changes in technology which had become available since the 70s and to determine whether these could be used to develop a workable system.The new solution proposed a dynamic, site independent system which could monitor both the fog and the motorists and provide real-time advice to the motorist if vehicle speed was inappropriate to the conditions.Research Before developing a new system based purely on the theory, a trial site was selected and research undertaken to assess the effectiveness of the arrangement outlined.Over a three year period studies were undertaken on the characteristics of vehicles when travelling in various fog visibilities ranging from 250 m to under 50 m.The research was undertaken in three discrete stages; April - December, 1992, - characteristics of vehicles unaffected by any sign display January - April, 1993, - evaluation of the 1974 sign system modified to provide some limited dynamic information May, 1993 - December, 1994, - evaluation of an improved sign arrangement with full dynamic information provided on fog and speed where appropriate.The results showed that an independent dynamic sign display could be used which would be effective in modifying vehicle speed characteristics, particularly at times when the speeds were highest without the use of such a sign.Outcome As a result of the results of this research project, the RTA proceeded with the design and construction of a new Driver Aid System for the F6 Waterfall-Bulli Freeway. The work involved a $3.5m contract with Telstra and was commissioned in 1996. A number a factors in the design were directly attributable to the findings of the research including:&#8226; the use of dynamic independent sites &#8226; incorporation into each site of fog detection equipment, speed detection and warning signs capable of displaying appropriate warning messages for individual motorists relative to the situation &#8226; location of the appropriate areas for the system to be located &#8226; use of flashing warning lights in association with each sign displayPapers Published The following papers on this research have been published at various major Conferences:BRISBANE G.J.B.

With the changing banking environment, corbanking services enter a new phase, from the traditional way of reciprocal products and services received, to the modem way of using corbanking as a strategic tool. Corbanks can offer their clients solutions that cross individual product boundaries and span multiple currencies and geography. Corbanking is therefore identified as a good altemative for boosting profit and share price targets of banks. Corbanking has been neglected in the banking literaUire and many research problems and questions have not been tackled and remain unresolved. This thesis aims at prof ling intemational corbanking practices, operations and management in Australia, leading to answer two questions: why banks choose to enter into corbanking relationships and how they select individual correspondents. Substantial background information derived from chapters of corbanking developments, Australian banking and payment systems, literature reviews and methodology opened the way for original work on a case study of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) and an empirical survey of the intemational corbanking industry. Eighteen determinant factors of intemational corbanking relationships and nineteen selection criteria of international correspondents were identified from literature reviews and an exploratory survey. Empirical surveys on forty three corbanking function units of all banking groups in Australia and further categorizing of the ten banking groups were carried out by questionnaires and single or group interviews. The corbanking prof les of CBA and banks in Australia were thereby determined. The results of the survey were used in regression modelling of determinant factors and selection criteria. Simple models of one or two explanatory variables determinant factors and number of correspondents for selection criteria were also concluded for each bank group of the ten banking groups. The most signif&#237;cant factor explaining corbanking relationships for all banks was bank size. In addition for Australian banks a significant explanatory factor was "location not physically present." The most signif&#238;cant criterion for all banks to select correspondents was formal banking presence and less important criteria were operational capabilities and reliability of supply for Australian banks and locations for foreign banks.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1476</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigations on Ti2Ni hydrogen storage alloy electrode for rechargeable nickel-metal hydride batteries</field><field name="creator">Luan, Ben Li</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1507</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of new iron based shape memory alloys</field><field name="creator">Huijun, Huijun</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1523</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mathematical modelling of rate-limiting mechanisms of pyrific oxidation in overburden dumps</field><field name="creator">Davis, Gregory Bruce</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1551</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improving scale-up procedures for the design of pneumatic conveying systems</field><field name="creator">Pan, Renhu</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1584</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Social recovery after childbirth: an investigation into the relationship between functional status after childbirth, self-esteem, social support and anxiety</field><field name="creator">McVeigh, Carol</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1618</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Astrophysical gas dynamics of structure formation</field><field name="creator">Maguire, Peter J.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1627</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experimental and theoretical piezospectroscopy of neutral copper impurity in germanium</field><field name="creator">Salib, Emil Habib</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1628</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Near and far infrared observations of protostars and dark clouds</field><field name="creator">Suters, Mark Gerard</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1629</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An evaluation of in-patient alcohol</field><field name="creator">Farina, Mario Antony</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1646</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Changing the public attitude towards psychologists</field><field name="creator">McNamara, Barry M.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1650</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Construing religious experience</field><field name="creator">Preston, Carol</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1651</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Consumer loyalty re-assessed: measurement, determinants and intervention</field><field name="creator">Divett, Megan</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1652</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sex role identity: an alternate paradigm</field><field name="creator">Ravinder, Shashi</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1679</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Shiftwork, sleep, fatigue and time of day: studies of a change from 8-h to 12-h shifts and single vehicle accidents</field><field name="creator">Di Milia, Vitale</field><field name="description">The thesis presents the findings from three separate studies. The first two studies (chapter two) are concerned with the impact of the compressed workweek (CWW) on the well-being of shiftworkers. One study was based in a Coal mine and the other, in a Steelworks. The Steel study also included an interview of the shiftworkers (Chapter three), an analysis of absenteeism (Chapter four) and safety (Chapter five). The third study (Chapter six) made use of a road accident database to demonstrate the effect of time of day on the distribution of single vehicle accidents (SVA). In addition this database also allowed an investigation of the omission recording errors by shiftworking policeman as a function of time of day (Chapter seven).The Coal and Steel studies used a longitudinal repeated measures design to examine the impact of a change from a continuous weekly 8-h shift to a continuous fast rotating 12-h shift. In both these studies, survey and sleep data served as dependent measures. The survey material was primarily based on scales from the Standard Shiftwork Index (Barton et al. 1995). Sleep data was obtained across complete shift cycles using sleep diaries. The sleep data were examined in terms of the expectations from the Sleep Deprivation Model (Tepas &amp; Mahan, 1989). The quantitative analysis of these data were supported by some qualitative analysis of changes in sleep pattern. Specifically, changes in the daily deviation from mean sleep and cumulative sleep gain/loss across the shift cycle, between 8-h and 12-h shifts were examined.In the Steel study, the effect of the change to 12-h shifts was further supported by additional studies. The interview study (chapter three) had two primary aims. The first was to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the change in rotation speed and shift length by interviewing the shiftworkers. The second was to explore the changes in sleep strategies as a result of the change to a faster rotation. Shiftworkers completed 'estimated' sleep durations based on a number of hypothetical shift patterns and provided a rationale for these choices. Consistent with many studies, strong support was found for 12-h shifts and this was attributed to the increased time away from work and the reduced number of consecutive night shifts. In general, a number of SSI measures showed improvements but few were significant.Self report and interview data both recorded shiftworker awareness of trading sleep loss for social gain. The intent to leave shiftwork was reduced but nonetheless present on 12-h shifts. This suggested that 12-h shifts do not solve, but reduce the problems associated with shiftwork. In the Coal study, shiftworkers reported a willingness to 'slow' their 12-h shifts to provide more rest days between work periods. Other indicants of fatigue were self reported increases in sleep need and changes in napping behaviour. No main effects for total sleep time (TST) were found between 8-h and 12-h shifts. Mean TST was achieved by a marked redistribution of sleep on 12-h shifts. In particular, 12-h shifts were associated with significant reductions in sleep for night shifts and increased sleep on day shift and days off. These findings need to consider the high probability of a type II error due to the low power findings associated with the small sample size, expected effect size and choice of alpha. While the changes in mean TST were of interest, the sample size also allowed for an extensive analysis of complete sleep records as a function of the change in shift schedules. In particular, it was suggested that changes in mean distribution of TST may be a more important indicant of fatigue than simply using the mean as the marker.The effect of the faster rotation on cumulative sleep gain/loss across the shift cycle provided mixed results. In the Coal study, the number of shifts worked and the total number of days in the cycle when mean daily sleep was below the cycle mean sleep average, decreased on 12-h shifts. In the Steel study, the number of shifts worked increased when mean TST was below the mean for the cycle but an improvement was found for the total number of days. These differences may be attributed to the different forms of the 12-h shifts in the two studies.Absence (chapter four) in the Steel study was significantly less on 12-h shifts but this was best explained by a remuneration policy that no longer provided overtime payment A case study analysis of absence suggested that absence was used in combination with other factors to redesign the shift schedules.During 8-h shifts absence was used o 'compress' the workweek and overtime was used to increase mean earnings. On 12-h shifts, absence was augmented by examining when single days of annual leave and small periods of annual leave, were taken across the shift cycle (non-attendance). This analysis suggested non-attendance was used to reduce exposure to three consecutive shifts, especially night shifts. This strategy also served to increase the number of days off from two to three days. The interview data also reported three night shifts were problematic and that two days off were insufficient.The change to 12-h shifts in the Steel study had no effect on safety (chapter five). This is most likely due to the fact that accidents are rare events and that too short a time period for comparison had elapsed. Nonetheless, some indication of increased accident frequency was found for the same time of day on 12-h shifts.The methodological and practical difficulties of examining performance in the Coal and Steel studies, led to the use of a road accident database to demonstrate the performance implications by time of day. This database was used to conduct two studies. Chapter six examined the time of day distribution in single vehicle accidents by driver age, gender and day of the week. Chapter seven examined the time of day variability in omission errors by shiftworking police officers.The time of day accident distribution for SVA was in line with international findings (Home &amp; Reyner, 1995a, 1995b). Correcting the accident rate for traffic density suggested the greatest accident risk was at 03.00, with a secondary peak at 14.00. The effect of age, gender and day of the week on accident frequency was also demonstrated. These data were also used to develop an alternative method to using traffic density to adjust accident frequency. The Driver Characteristics Model may provide a better measure for examining the effects of sleepiness. The timing of these single vehicle accidents suggested the influence of the sleepiness rhythm on performance, after a number of other accident causation factors were removed from the analysis.This database also reflected the accuracy in accident form completion of shiftworking policemen. Performance was lowest at 02.00 but a clear afternoon peak was not obtained. The error rate was found not to be related to accident severity or workload. This analysis also suggested that night time performance is sensitive to task differences.The final chapter seeks a synthesis of the studies presented in this research. In particular, it makes some additional comments concerning methodology and some recommendations for designing 12-h shifts. Key limitations to these results and suggestions for future study are also made.While 12-h shifts are clearly supported by employees, it is reasonable to suggest they are superior in comparison to poorly designed 8-h shifts (Lowden et al. 1998). Therefore, innovative shiftwork solutions need to be developed and tested, in order to provide flexibility and a safe working environment. A key message is that 12-h shifts may reduce chronic exposure but not the total exposure to night work. Therefore, innovative shift systems need to reduce the number of night shifts and not repackage the same number of night shifts into smaller blocks.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1680</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Students' and their parents' attributional style, trait anxiety, and socio-demographic factors as predictors of teachers' perceptions of a academic performance in late childhood</field><field name="creator">Khodayarifard, Mohammad</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1682</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Substance dependence: a search for security?</field><field name="creator">Carse, Mary Carmel</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1683</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Taking a transactional view of occupational stress into self-report management</field><field name="creator">Abson, Harlan Thomas</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1684</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The derivation of a psychological theory: Gestalt therapy</field><field name="creator">Barlow, Allen Richard</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1685</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development with and beyond the market: in search of economically rational alternatives to neo-liberalism</field><field name="creator">Burgess, Michael</field><field name="description">The world-wide trend over the last quarter of a century has been towards allowing markets much greater freedom to allocate resources. Unlike many in the community, economists have generally been enthusiastic about this trend. In fact, not only have the majority of economists been strongly supportive of economic reforms such as financial deregulation and tariff reduction, they have also demonstrated a remarkable degree of faith in the value of the narrow neoclassical economic approach to addressing policy dilemmas. This has meant, among other thmgs, that they have lacked an adequate framework for dealing with some important factors influencing the long-term evolution of economies, such as technological change.In recent years, economists such as Paul Krugman and Paul Romer have taken advantage of developments in computer technology and the techniques of modelling, and have sought to develop economic models which have a more 'real world' look about them. The conclusions reached in some of the neoclassical revisionist literature have undermined, to some extent, economists' faith in the optimality of market outcomes. In the case of developing countries, some of the recent literature by economists can even be reasonably utilised to present a relatively strong case in support of a 'big push' strategy. Despite this, the majority of economists are still of the opinion that the potential benefits of interventionist policies are still not sufficient, when compared with the risks involved, to justify states intervening much beyond what neoclassical theorists have generally regarded as desirable. Among other reasons for questioning this conclusion is the fact that so-called new economic models still ignore, or deal simplistically with, a range of factors that have an important influence on the long-term evolution of economies such as institutions, firmbased innovation, and the role of demand.Among the more sophisticated and less doctrinaire critics of neo-liberal economic policies, significant differences exist about what needs to be done to encourage more satisfactory economic and social development. However, as this thesis shows, in many areas sufficient evidence now exists to draw some strong conclusions. In fact, the most pressing problem at the present time is arguably not a lack of good ideas about what is wrong with conventional thinking and what policy changes are required, but rather the failure of many critics of neoliberal economic poHcies to fiilly appreciate the unportance of these ideas. This has, if anything, been especially a problem m debates involving developing countries - the concerns of which are the main focus of this thesis.Initially, the main reason why so many social theorists struggled to develop a viable set of alternative strategies was their strong attachment to dependency theory and other equally flawed Marxist-mfluenced development perspectives. In recent years, critics of neoliberalism have sought to develop less generalised and reductionistic theoretical frameworks which are less prone to divorcing theorising from 'real world' issues. However, progress has generally been slow, and some important areas of discourse, including those involving globalisation, the enviromnent and rural development, still suffer from a good deal of confiised analysis. As this thesis shows, even the work of some of the most prominent and widely-respected critics of orthodox development thinking is seriously deficient in a number of respects. All this has provided supporters of neo-liberal economic policies within national and international bureaucracies and elsewhere more opportunity than they should have been allowed to deflect attention away from their own analytical limitations and ideological obsessions.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1709</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Post-Fordism and the politics of industry development in Australia</field><field name="creator">Hampson, Ian</field><field name="description">Post-Fordism suggests the world's economic travails are the birth-pangs of a new, post- Fordist industrial system, with implications for national industrial adjustment. The thesis is a study of post Fordism and the course of the recent industrial policy debate in Australia. It is also a critique of post-Fordism (and its sister doctrine 'flexible specialisation'), as an analysis of events in the world economy, and as a model of industrial development. The thesis focuses on the role and fate of the labour movement, in the recent industrial policy debate, for two reasons. First, the labour movement drove the debate over industry policy in the early 1980s, and second, post- Fordism offers misleading prescriptions for the role the labour movement should play in industrial adjustment.Part one is devoted to exposition and critique of post-Fordism; part two surveys some of the literature on industry development and work organisation, with the question of the roles of the state and the labour movement in mind; part three is devoted to the debates in Australia around industry policy and post-Fordism. The thesis argues that post-Fordism is a flawed account of recent industrial change, and a poor guide to labour movement strategy. It suggests that the union movement's flirtation with enterprise ...i gaining and certain hostile forms of work organisation is, in some measure, due to strategic miscalculations deriving from the influence of post-Fordism.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1713</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An exploration of artefact imagery: its nature and sources</field><field name="creator">Warren, Joyce</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1750</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Les Murray and the task of the translator[and] The raft</field><field name="creator">Lambert, Helen</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1754</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Memory: salvage and invention</field><field name="creator">Anderson, Lisa</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1755</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A curriculum development model for Tafe NSW: linking the planned and experienced curriculum</field><field name="creator">Ball, Antony Noel</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1765</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aesthetics, athletics and art: a study of men who dance</field><field name="creator">Gard, Michael</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1767</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of an extended stay outdoor education school program upon adolescent participants</field><field name="creator">Gray, Tonia L.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1799</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Surface engineering of coinage dies</field><field name="creator">Yasbandha, H.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1838</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The fundamental mechanisms involved in the production of thin films pulsed laser</field><field name="creator">McKinnon, Jeffery Ronald</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1839</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transport boundaries for pneumatic conveying</field><field name="creator">Yi, Jianglin</field><field name="description">Pneumatic conveying is being selected for an increasing number of industrial applications and products and is playing a more vital and integral role in the transportation of solid materials such as plastic pellets, grain and chemicals. However, despite all the minimum conveying velocity research (one of the operating boundaries for pneumatic conveying) that has been undertaken for several decades, the wide scatter and contradictions in the predictions of the minimum conveying velocity for dilute phase pneumatic conveying exist yet, determination of the operating boundaries for pneumatic conveying (mainly maximum conveying velocity for dense phase and minimum conveying velocity for dilute phase) still has been one of the most important tasks to be solved for the design, optimising and upgrade of pneumatic conveying systems as a consequence of that the mechanisms involved in the formation of boundaries between dilute-phase and dense-phase pneumatic conveying through a horizontal pipeline have not been well explored.Saltation velocity was investigated initially in this thesis and then the emphasis was placed on the transition between dilute-phase and dense-phase. With careful observations, it is found that pneumatic conveying of granular solid materials through a horizontal pipeline can exhibit five different flow modes (as the air velocity is decreased): fully suspended flow; strand flow; stable or unstable strand flow over a stationary layer for low solid mass flow rates; stable or unstable strand flow over a slowly moving bed for high solid mass flow rates; low-velocity slug-flow. The pressure fluctuations within the unstable zone result from the flow mode alternation between a strand flow over a stationary layer (or slowly moving bed) and slug flow starting at the inlet due to a decrease in air velocity. The first slug moves quickly at a relatively high velocity and picks up a relatively thick stationary layer in front of it but only deposits a small amount of the material behind it. The increase in slug length and large increase in pressure cause severe pressure fluctuations and pipeline vibrations. Two different flow modes may exist simultaneously in the conveying pipeline: strand flow over a stationary layer or slowly moving bed near the feed point followed by the dilute-phase (suspension) flow of particles. For the latter, material erodes away from the end of the stationary layer or slowly moving bed and is conveyed in the form of small dunes (or pulsating strand flow).Based on the mass balance, force balance, momentum balance and the unstable flow forming mechanism, a theoretical three-layer model for the prediction of the transition zone boundaries has been established. With stability analysis, the boundaries of the transition zone in the state diagram have been identified, and have been found to agree very well with experimental data. According to the model established, the discussion on the influence of design parameters of particle and bulk properties of the material being conveyed and pipe wall properties on boundaries in the state diagram has been conducted.The discussion on the operating boundaries for pneumatic conveying of granular materials has been extended to conveying of powder materials and a principle for classification of granular materials and powder materials, which have different flow mode in PCC, has been proposed.The research also has been carried out on the pressure drop prediction for pneumatic conveying of granular materials in the form of low-velocity slug-flow in order to have a perfect PCC state diagram. A new approach for the direct measurement of stress transmission factor has been developed in this thesis. The effect of the weight of the granular material in the slug on pressure drop is taken in account according to the experimental test results. The model for pressure drop prediction also includes a modified equation for the frontal force of the moving slug - allowing for momentum balance of accelerating particles and the additional force from the stationary layer to resist the movement. The modelling predictions agree very well with test results obtained on poly pellets conveyed through 98 mm and 60.3 mm ID horizontal stainless steel pipelines, each 21 m in length.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1840</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring and enhancing the self-concept of students with learning difficulties, with and without attention deficit hyperactivity disorder</field><field name="creator">Tabassam, Waheeda</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the self-concept, attributional style and self-efficacy beliefs of students with learning difficulties (LD) with and without attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), compared to normally achieving peers. The thesis also examines the effectiveness of the attributional retraining technique in enhancing the academic self-perceptions of students with learning and attentional difficulties.The thesis is developed in three stages: Stage-1 is concerned with the development of two instruments for the assessment of academic attributional style and academic self-efficacy beliefs for students in Grade 3 to 6. This stage examines the factor analysis, reliability and validity outcomes of these instruments. Stage-2 concerns itself with a comprehensive examination of the self-concept, attributional style and self-efficacy beliefs of students with LD, students with comorbid LD/ADHD and normally achieving peers. Based on the existing literature, a number of hypotheses concerning the directions of the difference in the self-perceptions of students with LD and with comorbid LD/ADHD were examined. Stage-3 is concerned with the implementation and assessment of the effectiveness of an intervention program that was designed for the enhancement of academic self-concept. Students with LD and students with comorbid LD/ADHD whose academic self-concept scores fell in the lowest quartile participated in this intervention program. The intervention utilized the attributional retraining technique and the effectiveness of attributional retraining in enhancing academic self-concept of students with LD and with comorbid LD/ADHD was examined. The results obtained from Stage-2 revealed that students with LD and students with comorbid LD/ADHD possessed significantly lowered academic self-concept compared to normally achieving peers. However the three groups (LD, LD/ADHD and normally achieving peers) did not differ significantly on non-academic self-concepts. A comparison between students with LD and students with comorbid LD/ADHD indicated that the two groups did not differ significantly on self-concept, attributional style and self-efficacy beliefs. The results obtained from Stage-3 supported the effectiveness of a cognitive model in changing maladaptive attributions and indicated that academic selfconcept of students with LD and with LD/ADHD can be enhanced indirectly using attributional retraining technique.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1841</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Perfectionism in sport: factor analyses of the Frost Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale, association with psychological skills, and perspectives of perfectionist athletes</field><field name="creator">Lee, Bervyn Peng</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1842</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of family relations and personality factors on delinquent behaviours among youth</field><field name="creator">Peiser, Nadine C.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1843</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Conservation status of the seagrass Posidonia australis Hook f. in south east Australia</field><field name="creator">Meehan, Alexander</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1864</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Preschool children exploring spatial concepts</field><field name="creator">Thorpe, Patricia N.G.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1876</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aggregation and regional television</field><field name="creator">East, Neryl</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1883</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Computer-assisted reporting in Australia: diffusion of the Internet at daily newspapers</field><field name="creator">Quinn, Stephen</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1884</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A mechanism for glu-plasminogen binding: an important aspect of the plasminogen activation cascade</field><field name="creator">Andronicos, Nicholas Matthew</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1915</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design and development of peptide-based HIV-1 integrase inhibitors</field><field name="creator">Dalton, Neal</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1921</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Organizational innovations and their impact on economic growth: historical and contemporary evidence from the USA and Japan</field><field name="creator">Sanidas, Elias</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1937</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adaptive predictive vibration control in vehicular rear view mirrors</field><field name="creator">Larchez, Antoine</field><field name="description">Reduction in rear view mirror vibration has been identified as a research and development priority by large automotive mirror manufacturers, such as Schefenacker Vision Systems Australia Pty Ltd (SVS), the industrial partner of this project. Mirror vibration, particularly in luxury and heavy vehicles, has proved to be a major source of complaints received from the customers. Such vibration may result in image blurring and the loss of rear vision. This can adversely affect the driver, the control of the car, and the safety of the driver and the passengers. The vehicle mirror vibration is also generally perceived to indicate the poor quality of a vehicle. Mirror glass vibration is primarily caused by wind as the result of the motion of the vehicle. The structure-borne vibrations also contribute to vibration by affecting the mirror&#8217;s housing. The vibration intensity will depend on parameters, such as the roughness of the road, the engine speed, and wind intensity. Under some circumstances, the image provided by the mirror is not indicative of the true conditions behind the car, which can lead to incorrect perception and to driver misjudgement, resulting in the increased risk of an accident. The main focus of this thesis is to investigate the feasibility of developing an intelligent active vibration controller capable of maintaining a sharp reflected image under all driving conditions. An adaptive predictive controller is proposed. As an adaptive method, the proposed system can generate a control signal, according to the driving conditions, to cancel the vibration. The predictive characteristics of the approach can minimise the effect of delay between the measurement of the vibration signal and the generated control signal. An extensive review of the literature relevant to rear view mirrors, measurement techniques and active control of noise and vibration is carried out. The nature of the mirror vibration based on the road data is obtained empirically and statistically characterised. In order to develop and validate the vibration compensator, a number of experimental rigs are designed and developed. In a rigorous and systematic approach, a number of active vibration techniques are developed and validated through computer simulation and experimental work. The structure of nearly all of these algorithms is based on internal model control, where the actual disturbance signal is reconstructed analytically. The control structures include at least one variant of the FxLMS adaptive filter in different configurations. The results of modelling and validation are systematically recorded in the thesis. The results obtained show that the methodologies proposed in this study, outperform the conventional controllers in reducing vibration levels in rear view mirror.</field><field

His greatest poem, "The Prelude" had as its subject matter the growth of his own poetic mind; something that can also be understood as the growth of his 'imagination'. His friend and fellow poet, later turned philosopher, Samuel Taylor Coleridge developed a novel and romantic understanding of 'the Imagination' in the early years of his friendship with Wordsworth. He identified Wordsworth's genius, as a poet, as the product of a particularly gifted imagination, something he conceived of as an innate ability. In this thesis I challenge this 'Romantic' representation of Wordsworth's genius, one that has become canonical, largely as a result of Coleridge's treatment of Wordsworth, Poetry and Imagination in "Biographia Literaria". In making a more detailed analysis of Wordsworth's own claims about his identity, his poetic art, and imagination, I develop an argument that proposes a very different ethos to the one still largely considered normative in English Studies. The argument depends on a better recognition of Wordsworth's Classical Republican sympathies in the 1790s, and the extent to which the example of the famous Roman statesman, orator, philosopher, and poet, Marcus Tullius Cicero captured Wordsworth's imagination. Contrary to those who would romanticise Wordsworth's genius, I suggest his best work was the product of a theory of poetry based on principles that defined a very classical ideology. My argument builds on the work of recent, more detailed, representations of Wordsworth as a historical subject whose ideas were defined by particular historical circumstances, and whose identity developed out of those experiences. In addition to paying more attention to the 'historical' Wordsworth, I have also made a detailed analysis of his language, discovering the existence of a particular idiom. Wordsworth's vocabulary reflects, not only a classical humanist ideology, but also strong Stoic sentiments and an attitude of Socratic, Academic Scepticism. I trace the source of this characteristic idiom back to the influence of Cicero whose works, along with Marcus Quintilian's "De Institutione Oratoria" defined key aspects of Wordsworth's poetic theory in the late 1790s and early 1800s.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5677</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling and analysis of hydrogen-based wind energy transmission and storage systems : HyLink system at Totara Valley : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Technology in Energy Management at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Sudol, Peter</field><field name="description">Distributed generation has the potential to reduce the supply-demand gap emerging in New Zealand&#8217;s electricity market. Thereby it can improve the overall network efficiency, harness renewable energy resources and reduce the need for upgrading of existing distribution lines. A typical New Zealand rural community consisting of three adjacent farms at Totara Valley near Woodville represents a demonstration site on distributed generation for Massey University and Industrial Research Limited. Local renewable energy resources are being used for the purpose of sustainable development. Alternative micro-scale technologies are being combined to achieve a valuable network support. This paper is an in-depth report on the implementation process of the HyLink system; a system which utilises hydrogen as an energy carrier to balance and transport the fluctuating wind power. The report documents its development from the laboratory stage to commissioning at Totara Valley, which was carried out under direction of Industrial Research Limited. The PEM electrolyser&#8217;s performance at different stack temperatures was investigated. It was found that hydrogen production increases at the same voltage with a higher stack temperature. This is due to the improved kinetics of the electrochemical reactions and decreased thermodynamic energy requirement for water electrolysis. The electrolyser efficiency measurement at the half of its maximal power input (247 W) resulted in 65.3%. Thereby the stack temperature attained less than half of the allowed limit of 80&#176;C. The capture of the excess heat by insulation can improve the electrolyser&#8217;s efficiency. Pressure tests were performed on the 2 km long pipeline at Totara Valley using hydrogen and natural gas in order to test their permeability. The results were compared with previous studies at Massey University and with data obtained from the industry. The hydrogen permeability was measured to be 5.5 * 10[to the power of]-16 mol m m[to the power of]-2 s[to the power of]-1 Pa[to the power of]-1 for a 2 km MDPE pipe. This is about half the result obtained from previous studies on hydrogen permeability through MDPE at Massey University which was undertaken at room temperature. The reason for this discrepancy is likely to be the lower ambient temperature during the measurement at Totara Valley, which can be supported with the Arrhenius equation. It was furthermore measured that the power loss due to hydrogen diffusion through the pipeline walls during the fuel cell operation is about 1.5 W at the current system operation mode. A techno-economic analysis of the system was undertaken applying the micro-power optimisation software HOMER as a simulation tool. Two operation modes of the system were investigated, the load following and the peak demand compensating. The simulation results reveal that the durability and the cost of the electrochemical energy conversion devices; electrolyser and fuel cell, are the main hurdles which need to be overcome on the path in introducing hydrogen based energy systems like HyLink. Finally, economic optimisation modelling of the small-scale system by best component alignment was performed. It was found that the electrolyser capacity down-rating of 80% in relation to the wind turbine capacity, leads to a minimal system levelised cost. In addition to this, the impact of various wind turbine/electrolyser subsystems and pipeline storage capacities on the fuel cell capacity factor and on the system levelised cost in the load following operation mode was analysed. The outcomes can be useful for further HyLink related energy system planning.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hydrogen</field><field name="subject">energy carrier</field><field name="subject">fluctuating wind power</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290900 Electrical and Electronic Engineering::290901 Electrical engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/786</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Expressibility of higher-order logics on relational databases : proper hierarchies : a dissertation presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Information Systems at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ferrarotti, Flavio Antonio</field><field name="description">We investigate the expressive power of different fragments of higher-order logics over finite relational structures (or equivalently, relational databases) with special emphasis in higher-order logics of order greater than or equal three. Our main results concern the study of the effect on the expressive power of higher-order logics, of simultaneously bounding the arity of the higher-order variables and the alternation of quantifiers. Let AAi(r,m) be the class of (i + 1)-th order logic formulae where all quantifiers are grouped together at the beginning of the formulae, forming m alternating blocks of consecutive existential and universal quantifiers, and such that the maximal-arity (a generalization of the concept of arity, not just the maximal of the arities of the quantified variables) of the higher-order variables is bounded by r. Note that, the order of the quantifiers in the prefix may be mixed. We show that, for every i [greater than or equal to] 1, the resulting AAi hierarchy of formulae of (i + 1)-th order logic is proper. This extends a result by Makowsky and Pnueli who proved that the same hierarchy in second-order logic is proper. In both cases the strategy used to prove the results consists in considering the set AUTOSAT(F) of formulae in a given logic F which, represented as finite structures, satisfy themselves. We then use a similar strategy to prove that the classes of [Sigma superscript i subscript m union Pi superscript i subscript m] formulae in which the higher-order variables of all orders up to i+1 have maximal-arity at most r, also induce a proper hierarchy in each higher-order logic of order i [greater than or equal to] 3. It is not known whether the correspondent hierarchy in second-order logic is proper. Using the concept of finite model truth definitions introduced by M. Mostowski, we give a sufficient condition for that to be the case. We also study the complexity of the set AUTOSAT(F) and show that when F is one of the prenex fragments [Sigma superscript 1 subscript m] of second-order logic, it follows that AUTOSAT(F) becomes a complete problem for the corresponding prenex fragment [Sigma superscript 2 subscript m] of third-order logic. Finally, aiming to provide the background for a future line of research in higher-order logics, we take a closer look to the restricted second-order logic SO[superscript w] introduced by Dawar. We further investigate its connection with the concept of relational complexity studied by Abiteboul, Vardi and Vianu. Dawar showed that the existential fragment of SO[superscript w] is equivalent to the nondeterministic inflationary fixed-point logic NFP. Since NFP captures relational NP, it follows that the existential fragment of SO[superscript w] captures relational NP. We give a direct proof, in the style of the proof of Fagin&#8217;s theorem, of this fact. We then define formally the concept of relational machine with relational oracle and prove the exact correspondence between the prenex fragments of SO[superscript w] and the levels of the relational polynomial-time hierarchy. This allows us to stablish a direct connection between the relational polynomial hierarchy and SO without using the Abiteboul and Vianu normal form for relational machines.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">relational databases</field><field name="subject">computer logic</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280100 Information Systems::280108 Database management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/799</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Choice of acquisition form, domestic liquidity costs for US cross-listed firms, and convergence in information environment : an investor protection perspective : a dissertation submitted in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Finance, Department of Commerce, Massey University</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Nhut Hoang</field><field name="description">This dissertation contains three empirical studies that examine the effect of investor protection on three different aspects of corporate governance: mergers and acquisitions, US cross-listings, and convergence of information environment around the world.1 The first study investigates the relation between investor protection and the choice of acquisition form (partial versus full acquisition). I argue that if private benefits are a motivation for mergers and acquisitions, an acquirer is more likely to bid for a controlling fraction (but not a hundred percent) of a target firm in countries with weak investor protection because in these countries private benefits of control are an important asset. The empirical results support this argument: compared to full mergers, partial acquisitions are the preferred form of acquisition when target countries do not effectively protect minority investors. Partial acquisitions are also more common among foreign acquirers from countries with poor legal systems. Finally, I show that firm-level corporate governance of the target firm is negatively related to the likelihood of partial acquisition. The second study examines the effect of investor protection on domestic liquidity for cross-listed firms. If US cross-listing can improve a firm&#8217;s information environment because of more stringent disclosure requirements in the US, I expect the information improvement to be reflected in a reduction in domestic liquidity costs. The empirical results are consistent with this prediction: local bid-ask spreads and price impact (a proxy for the cost of adverse information) significantly decrease while local trading volume significantly increases one year after US cross-listing. In addition, the liquidity improvement is larger for cross-listed firms that are from poor investor protection countries, and that are listed on the NYSE. The results in the second study are consistent with the &#8220;bonding&#8221; argument by Coffee (2002). The third study tests Coffee&#8217;s (1999) prediction of a convergence in corporate governance around the world. Since information environment is a key factor of corporate governance, it is important to see if there is a convergence in information environment across countries over the past two decades. Using various common proxies for information environment, I show that the quality of information environment generally improves through time, but the improvement is larger for developed markets and countries with better institutional quality. In the third study, I also reproduce the main results in Bailey, Karolyi and Salva (2006), and Fernandes and Ferreira (2008). These studies report similar divergence in information environment for cross-listed firms post-US-listing, but fail to control for the quality of information environment in the domestic market. After we control for this market effect, we do not find support for their results: there is no improvement in information environment for cross-listed firms, and no difference in the change between developed and emerging countries.  1 The second and third empirical studies are co-authored work with my supervisor, Professor Henk Berkman.

Regarding the latter, from the cognitive anthropology perspective the research highlights Bradd Shore&#8217;s (1996) view on cognitive models, together with the theories put forward by the sociocultural approach in psychology based on Vygotsky&#8217;s school of thought. The main objective of the study is to achieve a broad view on the use of traditional korero paki and korero o nehera (Maori folktales/legends and myths) as pedagogical tools and as cognitive models. The latter includes a bibliographical review which covers the analysis of narratives and their usage from different areas, such as Maori epistemology and education, cultural psychology and cognitive anthropology. Being a research stemmed from an anthropological concern &#8211;how do people from different sociocultural backgrounds construct and transmit knowledge- it considered as a fundamental element an empirical or &#8220;fieldwork&#8221; approach to the matter. Therefore, the research analyses &#8211;based on semi-structured interviews- the perspectives and understanding of the usage of traditional Maori narratives as educational tools of scholars in the Maori studies/education field and of a sample of Maori teachers, most of them connected to a Kura Kaupapa Maori school, constituting a &#8220;study case&#8221; for this qualitative study. A period of complementary participant observation was also carried out, focusing on the pedagogical practises and styles of the participant teachers. Through this, the research aims to contextualise the bibliographical and theoretical findings, considering the contemporary applications, limitations and understandings encountered through concrete experience.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">construction and transmission of knowledge</field><field name="subject">Maori folklore</field><field name="subject">Maori stories</field><field name="subject">cognitive models</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/889</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Key success drivers in offshore software development : New Zealand and Indian vendors' perspectives : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Information Technology at Massey University, Albany campus, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Mathrani, Anuradha</field><field name="description">Offshore software development (OSD) is a leading business sector in the present &#8216;glocal&#8217; IT marketplace, and vendors in different countries are opening software development centres worldwide to take advantage of the new business opportunities. However, software development is both a technical and a social process as various software modules need to be integrated, which requires ongoing interaction between the stakeholders. The software modules rely upon local knowledge regarding customer wants, project specific features, chosen design methodologies by development team members and synchronisation of activities to confirm the next design iteration. This study focuses on knowledge sharing processes involving the interplay between acquiring local knowledge and applying the knowledge acquired into the design of the client-specific software builds. New knowledge is created as new processes are applied and new outcomes realised, resulting in re-definition of software development practices. Building on existing theories with empirical case study evidence, this research reveals the socio-technical influences on knowledge management in the OSD process. Ideographic research methods have been applied to bring sensitivity in the everyday organisational activities for knowledge sharing across diverse social and cultural groups within two country contexts (New Zealand and India). Empirical data from ten case studies is used to inductively develop a conceptual framework, which has been applied to make within case and cross case comparisons across three levels of analysis (micro, meso and macro) for knowledge sharing. The micro level analysis explores individual key success drivers (behaviours and methodologies), the meso level explores organisational level practices (work processes and structures) and the macro level gives a holistic evaluation across two country contexts. Country contexts reveal that New Zealand vendors share closer cultural proximity with their clients, are engaged in client facing skills and have further outsourced software development tasks to other low cost countries. The Indian vendors are involved in software construction, prefer technical specialist skills and have defined more discipline in their software development processes. The thesis offers new insights on how vendors&#8217; shape their software development styles based upon their beliefs and understanding of the offshore market and is especially relevant to both vendors and clients who intend venturing into the offshore market.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">software localisation</field><field name="subject">knowledge sharing</field><field name="subject">case studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/903</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Unlocking the M13 (f1 and fd) virion : investigation into the role of the pIII C-domain of F specific filamentous bacteriophage in infection : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Biochemistry at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand. EMBARGOED until 1 January 2012</field><field name="creator">Bennett, Nicholas James</field><field name="description">Ff filamentous bacteriophage infect male (F+) strains of Escherichia coli and are assembled at the cell membranes, by a secretion-like, non-lethal process. The pIII protein, located at one end of the virion-filament, is required at both the beginning and the end of the phage life cycle. During infection, the N-terminal domains of pIII, N2 and N1, bind to the primary and secondary host receptors, F pilus and TolA protein, respectively. At the end of the life cycle, the pIII C-domain mediates the termination and release of virions. Thus, both entry and release involve structural transitions of the virus coupled to membrane transactions of the virion proteins. "Unlocking&#8221; of the highly stable virion presumably results in membrane integration during entry, whereas a reverse event, &#8220;locking&#8221; of the virion, occurs upon detachment from the membrane at termination step of assembly/secretion. Recently, it was shown that the pIII C-domain plays an active role at the step of entry. This finding implicates the C-domain of pIII in &#8220;unlocking&#8221; of the virion, presumably resulting in the exposure of the membrane anchor at the very C-terminus of pIII (Bennett &amp; Rakonjac, 2006). To further this work, this thesis has mapped the portion of the pIII C-domain required for infection, by constructing a set of nested deletions of the C-domain fused to the receptor binding domains N1 and N2, and then determined the infectivity of phage carrying the mutant proteins. This mapped the portion of the C-domain required for phage infection is different to that required for termination of assembly. The different requirement for entry and release suggests that the two processes are carried out by distinct mechanisms and/or depend on different sets of accessory proteins. In addition, a system was designed for the efficient production and purification of very short virions, the length of which is 1/20 that of the wild-type f1. These short virions, called microphage, are the first step towards the structural analyses of the phage termini cap structures, of which one contains pIII in the &#8220;locked&#8221; conformation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ff filamentous bacteriophage</field><field name="subject">microphage production system</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1221</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Self-reported oral health and access to dental care among pregnant women in Wellington : a thesis presented in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Public Health at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Claas, Bianca Muriel</field><field name="description">Pregnancy can have important effects on oral health and pregnant women are a population group requiring special attention with regard to their oral health and their babies? health. International research shows that oral health care for pregnant women has been inadequate, especially in relation to education and health promotion and there is some evidence of disparities by SES and ethnicity. Improving oral health is one of the health priorities in the New Zealand Health Strategy (Ministry of Health, 2000) and the Ministry of Health (Ministry of Health, 2006a) has recently identified a need for more information on the oral health and behaviour of pre-natal women. The aims of this study were to gain an understanding of pregnant women?s oral health care practices, access to oral health care information and use of dental care services and to identify any difference by ethnicity and socio-economic position. A self-reported questionnaire was completed by 405 pregnant women (55% response rate) who attended antenatal classes in the Wellington region. The questionnaire was broadly divided into four parts: (1) care of the teeth when the woman was not pregnant; (2) care of the teeth and diet during the pregnancy; (3) sources of oral health information during pregnancy and; (4) demographic information . Data were analysed by age, ethnicity, education and income and odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were calculated using logistic regression. The majority of women in this survey were pakeha (80.2%), compared to 19.7% &#8222;Others? (8.8% Maori, 1.9% Pacific, 8.6% other). Most of the subjects were aged 31-35 years (34.5%), of high SES (household income and education level). Half of the women reported having regular visits to the dentist previous pregnancy while a significant percentage of women saw a dentist basically when they had problems. The usual dental hygiene habits were maintained during pregnancy. However, during pregnancy more than 60% of women reported bleeding gums. Just 32% of women went to see the dentist during pregnancy and less than half had access to oral health information related to pregnancy. &#8222;Others? (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.15-0.91) and low income (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.10-0.76) groups were significantly less likely to report access to oral health information compared to pakeha and high income groups (respectively). Women who went to see the dentist during pregnancy were more likely to receive information on dental health. However, low income women were more likely to report the need to see a dentist (OR 2.55, CI 1.08-5.99). Information on dental health and access to oral care should be prioritised to low income women, Maori, Pacific and other ethnic groups. Little attention has previously been given to oral health for pregnant women in New Zealand and there is a need to increase awareness of the importance of this area amongst health practitioners particularly Lead Maternity Carers and Plunket and tamariki ora nurses.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dental care services</field><field name="subject">maternity services</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1205</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dipyrrin complexes as dyes for dye-sensitised solar cells : a thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Masters in Science in Chemistry at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Smalley, Serena Jade</field><field name="description">With increasing concerns of global warming and the impending exhaustion of fossil fuels attention is being turned to renewable sources of energy. The sun supplies 3 x 1024 J per year to the earth which is around 104 times more energy than what the human race consumes. The world&#8217;s energy needs would be satisfied if a mere 0.1% of the planet&#8217;s surface was covered with solar cells(&lt; = 10%)1, causing the conversion of solar energy (sunlight) into electricity to represent a very practical renewable source. Past research into solar energy has produced a photovoltaic device, which when coupled with highly coloured coordination compounds, enables this conversion. This device is known as a dye-sensitised solar cell (DSSC). Further research has been conducted into the properties of the dyes, and has shown that highly coloured coordination compounds are able to convert solar energy into electrical energy with the highest efficiencies. The dominant compounds in this area to date have been Gr&#228;tzel&#8217;s ruthenium complexes and porphyrins. However, there exists a class of smaller compounds called dipyrrins, described most simply as &#8220;half a porphyrin&#8221;, which possess many of the attractive qualities for DSSC dyes. Although there are no examples of ruthenium-dipyrrin complexes in the literature, the combination of advantageous properties from both components represent very attractive synthetic targets with huge potential as dyes for DSSCs. The objectives of this thesis were firstly to develop a series of dipyrrin complexes which would be suitable as dyes for DSSCs; then to fully characterise the complexes and investigate the spectroscopic properties of each complex; and finally to determine the suitability of the complexes as dyes for DSSCs. These objectives were fully met, resulting in a set of generic target compounds characterised via 1H NMR, 13C NMR, mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), elemental analysis, and x-ray crystallography. From analyses of the UV-visible, fluorescence, emission, and Raman spectra; and electrochemistry results; the complexes were concluded to be suitable as dyes for DSSC&#8217;s. An additional bonus is that the syntheses for these complexes are applicable to any dipyrrin, thus aiding future studies into the use of dipyrrins as dyes for DSSC&#8217;s. This thesis summarises the findings of the above outlined research project.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dye-sensitised solar cells</field><field name="subject">dipyrrin complexes</field><field name="subject">photovoltaic devices</field><field name="subject">DSSC dyes</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1220</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A functional analysis of RYR1 mutations causing malignant hyperthermia : a thesis presented to Massey University in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Biochemistry</field><field name="creator">Sato, Keisaku</field><field name="description">Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a rare pharmacogenetic disorder in humans induced by volatile anaesthetics and depolarising muscle relaxants. An MH reaction shows abnormal calcium homeostasis in skeletal muscle leading to a hypermetabolic state and increased muscle contracture. A mutation within the skeletal muscle calcium release channel ryanodine receptor gene (RYR1) is associated with MH and is thought to cause functional defects in the RYR1 channel leading to abnormal calcium release to the sarcoplasm and consequent MH reactions. Mutations within RYR1 are also associated with a rare congenital myopathy, central core disease (CCD). CCD is characterised by muscle weakness and is thought to be caused by insufficient calcium release from the RYR1 channel during excitation-contraction (EC) coupling. To investigate functional effects of RYR1 mutations, the entire coding region of human RYR1 was assembled and cloned into an expression vector. Mutant clones containing RYR1 mutations linked to MH or CCD were also constructed. Wild-type (WT) and mutant RYR1 clones were used for transient transfection of HEK-293 cells. Western blotting was performed after harvesting and expressed WT and mutant RYR1 proteins were successfully detected. Immunofluorescence showed co-localisation of RYR1 proteins and the endoplasmic reticulum in HEK-293 cells. [3H]ryanodine binding assays showed that RYR1 mutants linked to MH were more sensitive to the agonist 4-chloro-m-cresol (4-CmC) and less sensitive to the antagonist Mg2+ compared with WT. Two C-terminal RYR1 mutants T4826I and H4833Y were very significantly hypersensitive to 4-CmC and they may also result in a leaky channel. This hypersensitivity of mutants linked to MH may result in abnormal calcium release through the RYR1 channel induced by triggering agents leading to MH reactions. RYR1 mutants linked to CCD showed no response to 4-CmC showing their hyposensitive characteristics to agonists. This study showed that the human RYR1 proteins could be expressed in HEK-293 cells. Moreover, using the recombinant human RYR1 clone, a single mutation within RYR1 resulted in a functional defect in expressed RYR1 proteins and functions of mutant RYR1 proteins varied from hypersensitive to hyposensitive depending on the mutation and whether it was linked to MH or CCD.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">malignant hyperthermia genetic aspects</field><field name="subject">ryanodine receptors</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1228</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Parental choice and education : the practice of homeschooling in New Zealand : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Education at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Roache, Leo Ernest</field><field name="description">This thesis reports an investigation into eight New Zealand homeschooling families. It also offers an opportunity, to these parents, to share and discuss the reasons why they chose to educate their children at home and how they went about doing so. The families interviewed were all volunteers and, with the exception of two families, all interviews took place in the family homes. The families, urban and rural, were distributed from Wellington to Northland. All families had an opportunity to review and revise their narratives and my reviews of the narratives which related to them. No attempt was made to verify the stories of why families chose homeschooling but there was good accord between their stated reasons for homeschooling, and the practices they adopted. The reasons advanced for choosing to homeschool were found to be complex. They ranged from parental experiences and philosophical beliefs to concern about teacher behaviour and sustaining their culture. The variations in teaching/learning practices and curricula, which were largely parent designed in consultation with their children, were equally complex. The testimony and experiences of these families bear out the notion of &#8220;communities of learning practice&#8221;, with all families repeatedly emphasising the centrality of the family. It was evident that the families changed over time, in the reasons for their choice and their practices. One significant feature was that all families elected to teach their children the basic skills of language and mathematics, with the intention of facilitating independent learning. Homeschooling was seen by the families studied as a way of gaining some control over the education of their children, and thereby strengthening the family unit, whilst providing opportunities to cater for individual needs and preferred approaches to learning. Comparisons with overseas studies thus demonstrated some commonalities and some significant differences regarding the New Zealand sample. The study suggested that further research is needed to provide an accurate picture of homeschooling in New Zealand.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">home schooling</field><field name="subject">parental choice</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330199 Education studies not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1227</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Consolidating mistakes of the heart and mind : toward a dual process theory of regret : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Psychology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Towers, Andrew James</field><field name="description">There are many idiosyncrasies in the emotion of regret that we do not fully comprehend and our traditional reliance on economic theories of human decision-making, which view regret as stemming from illogical and explicit decision-making processes, may be the cause. This thesis explores the development and testing of the Dual Process Theory of Regret (DPTR) which claims that individuals use both implicit &#8216;orientation&#8217; and explicit &#8216;justification&#8217; systems of thought to guide their daily decision-making and the differential use of these systems should be reflected in the intensity of regret felt for a poor outcome. To assess its utility in predicting variation in regret intensity the DPTR was tested in conjunction with two popular theories of regret; one focussing on the distinction between actions and inaction, and the other focussing on decision justification.  Three thousand adults were randomly selected from the New Zealand electoral roll and invited to participate in a postal survey of short and long-term life regrets. Of this initial sample 653 participants returned questionnaires with usable data, a response rate of approximately 23% which, while a relatively low response rate, was expected given the sensitive topic and provided more than enough respondents for the present analysis.  Results showed that the DPTR had greater utility in predicting trends in short and long-term regret intensity than either of the current regret theories. Results also illustrated that changes in justification strength had little effect on regret intensity and that explicit justifications only influenced regret in the long-term. In contrast results supported the conceptualisation of the implicit orientation and showed that it was a key source of influence on regret intensity in both the short and long-term.  This research concludes that the DPTR&#8217;s focus on both implicit and explicit cognitive systems provides greater insight into the nature of regret than the reliance on explicit cognitive analysis alone. Implicit feelings of right and wrong are a better indicator of eventual regret than our ability to justify our decision. These results help resolve past anomalies in regret research, clarify conflicting trends in regret highlighted in the current media, and have application for understanding criminal recidivism.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">regret</field><field name="subject">remorse</field><field name="subject">decision making</field><field name="subject">psychology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1226</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teaching health education in New Zealand secondary schools : policy into practice : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Education at Massey University, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Weir, Kama Jean</field><field name="description">Teaching Health Education in New Zealand secondary schools: Policy into practice. Health education has a long informal history in New Zealand schools. This study attempted to illuminate and explain the effects on a small sample of secondary school health teachers of official policy changes in curriculum and assessment for Health Education in the period 1999 &#8211; 2004. These teachers were deeply concerned about the health issues that they perceived their students were facing, and saw Health Education as a means of helping students address these. The publication of Health and Physical Education in the New Zealand curriculum (Ministry of Education, 1999) legitimated their teaching in a general way through the inclusion of issues they were concerned with (such as mental health and sexuality). Teachers positioned themselves idiosyncratically in relation to a variety of personal discourses. Different subject positions were possible at school level because of the weak classification (Bernstein, 1971; 1996) of the 1999 curriculum. This was less likely to occur in senior health which was assessed at system level through the National Certificate of Educational Achievement (the NCEA). Health Education&#8216;s inclusion in the NCEA resulted in pedagogical change for teachers in the study due to greater prescription of content and assessment requirements. This study also illustrated the pedagogical and relational tensions that were created when Health and Physical Education were placed within the same official curriculum. Internal subject politics were intensified as teachers competed for resources within the one learning area. Sexuality, gender and emotionality were three further layered discourses of teaching secondary Health Education illuminated by this study. Teachers generally positioned themselves in relation to a reproductive health discourse and several positioned themselves within an essentialist gender discourse. Emotionality was shown to have both personal and institutional dimensions. Implications based on the findings were considered for teachers, policy makers, teacher educators and researchers.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">health education</field><field name="subject">high schools</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330200 Curriculum Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1225</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New Zealand's experiment with prudential regulation : can disclosure discipline moderate excessive risk taking in New Zealand deposit taking institutions? : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree Doctor of Philosophy at Massey University, Albany</field><field name="creator">Wilson, William Robert</field><field name="description">The New Zealand economy in the period up to 2006 provides an opportunity to assess an alternative disclosure based approach to the prudential regulation of deposittakers, in a market free of many of the distortions which arise from traditional regulatory schemes. The overall objective of this research has been to assess the effectiveness of the prudential regulation of New Zealand financial institutions and judge if the country is well served by it. Analysis of New Zealand&#8217;s registered bank sector suggests public disclosure adds value to New Zealand&#8217;s financial system. However, the significant relationship found between disclosure risk indicators and bank risk premiums was not as a result of market discipline, rather it is argued self-discipline was the mechanism, demonstrating bank management and directors are discharging their duties in a prudent manner. A feature of the New Zealand disclosure regime for banks is the significant responsibilities placed on bank directors; directors are then held accountable for their actions. Findings in the management of banks were in contrast to non-bank deposittakers, where disclosure was judged to be ineffective, and of no practical use due to its poor quality. The management of non-bank deposit-takers appeared to receive very little oversight from depositors, their trustees or official agencies. As a result, many appear to have managed their institution in their own interests, with little consideration given to other stakeholders. Failures which occurred in NBDTs from 2006 resulted from deficiencies in the prudential regulation of these deposit-takers, demonstrating the severity of asymmetric information and moral hazard problems which can arise if prudential regulation is not correctly designed and management interests are not aligned with other stakeholders. The New Zealand disclosure regime will never guarantee a bank will not fail, nor should it try to do so, but it should assist the functioning of a sound and efficient financial system. To this end, it is recommended that the Reserve Bank, in re-designing the regulatory framework for NBDTs, hold the management and directors of NBDTs similarly accountable, while also incorporating regular disclosure and minimum prudential standards.

This ability of the organizations depends on providing the technological support for the creation of knowledge, organizational structures (such as the organization reward systems) and the willingness of their employees to share their knowledge. Developments in information and communication technologies have facilitated organizations in developing the infrastructures that are required for the dissemination of knowledge. Organizations are thus left with the challenge of developing organizational structures that will motivate knowledge sharing among its employees. The knowledge sharing problem, which was once seen as an issue of capturing can codifying information, is now seen as a challenge of motivating individuals, the true owner of knowledge, to share their valuable resource. Behavioural scientists have taken interest in knowledge sharing as a form of helping behaviour which is directed at the organizations or member within the organizations. Although organizations have great desire that their managers engage in this behaviour, it is the discretion of their employees whether they want to share or withhold their knowledge. Organizational structural control mechanisms (such as the performance evaluation systems) have limited success in enforcing such behaviour as there are no means of measuring its outputs. Organizations depend on their incentive systems to motivate knowledge sharing. Research into motivation indicates that there is no easy fix to achieve this. Organizations have to balance the use extrinsic and intrinsic motivators, considering the specific motivational requirements of their employees. Motivational interventions, such as the use of incentives, are dependent on the level of trust the employees have in their managers and the organization in whole to deliver on those incentives in a fair and equitable manner. Where trust levels are not sufficient, employees tend to ignore such incentives and tend to further disinvest discretionary efforts. The current study used the psychological contract theory as a frame work for understanding the dynamics of the employee-employer exchange. The central premise of the theory is that employees tend to lose trust in the organization or the agent of the organization, when they perceive that their expectations have not been met. In addition to the lost of trust, psychological contract violation is also negatively associated with desirable organization behaviours and attitudes &#8211; such as commitment, in-role and extra-role effort &#8211; and is positively associated with undesirable organization behaviours and attitudes such as intention of turnover. The current study used a qualitative research design to investigate how the violation of the psychological contract can add to the ineffectiveness of the organization incentive system to motivate knowledge sharing. Using semistructured interviews the participants were provided with short scenarios (vignettes) which simulated occurrences of psychological contract violation. The participants, acting as informants, responded to question with regards to how the situations depicted in the vignettes would affect the vignette characters&#8217; work behaviours, specifically their desire to share knowledge.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">organisational knowledge</field><field name="subject">employee motivation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1223</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Kia Ng&#257;wari ki te Awatea : the relationship between wairua and Maori well-being : a psychological perspective : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Clinical Psychology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Valentine, Hukarere</field><field name="description">Western health professions have historically struggled with the notion that spirituality could be studied empirically. This trend has changed in recent decades with there being a marked increase in the health literature pertaining to spirituality. For indigenous people spirituality is a fundamental attribute of their worldviews. M&#228;ori, as the Indigenous people of Aotearoa, have always acknowledged the importance of wairua, (spirituality as defined by M&#228;ori worldviews) to their health and well-being. This thesis aims to explore wairua as an important aspect of M&#228;ori well-being from a psychological perspective. Two research goals underpin this thesis. The first goal involved developing an understanding of what M&#228;ori mean when they talk about wairua. This was achieved through a qualitative study. While there are implicit shared understandings among M&#228;ori regarding the nature of wairua, this study was one of the first attempts to make some of those shared understandings more explicit. The second goal involved investigating the relationship between an orientation to wairua and M&#228;ori well-being using a newly developed measure. This was a quantitative study. Conceptualisations of wairua fell into four themes; direct descriptions, personal experiences, personal beliefs and M&#228;ori worldviews. According to the qualitative information, wairua was described as a fundamental attribute that enables M&#228;ori to engage with their reality; an intuitive consciousness. Through wairua M&#228;ori identity is expressed, relationships are forged, balance is maintained, restrictions and safety are adhered to, healing is transmitted, and the connection between te ao wairua and te ao M&#228;ori are maintained. These aspects of M&#228;ori reality are inclusive and interconnected. The qualitative study information led to the formation of a 30 item self report measure named the Kia Ngawari ki te Awatea Orientation to Wairua measure. This measure was used to investigate the relationship between an orientation to wairua and M&#228;ori health and well-being. The results showed that orientations to wairua had relatively modest associations with wellbeing when conceptualised and measured in a variety of ways. Due to the variability in the results, support for the overarching hypothesis of a relationship between wairua and well-being was mixed. A number of limitations were acknowledged with recommendations for future research offered. The findings of these studies have a number of implications for clinical psychological practice with M&#228;ori clients.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori well-being</field><field name="subject">Maori health</field><field name="subject">wairua</field><field name="subject">Kia Ngawari ki te Awatea</field><field name="subject">spirituality health aspects</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380107 Health, clinical and counselling psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1224</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Progressing towards conservatism : a gramscian challenge to the conceptualisation of class, agency, corruption and reform in 'progressive' analyses of policing</field><field name="creator">Kennedy, Michael H.</field><field name="description">This thesis about rank and file police takes place from within a class framework with its foundations in the works of Marx, Engels and Gramsci who theorised that revolution is the result of the contradictions in class society reaching breaking point.

This thesis investigated memory retrieval processes in trauma survivors with and without symptoms of posttraumatic stress, and in non-traumatised individuals exposed to a highly arousing event. Study 1 examined deliberate avoidance of unwanted memories in recent trauma survivors. The results indicated that attempts to forget were associated with poorer recall of forgotten information, but the size of this effect did not depend on the presence or absence of Acute Stress Disorder (ASD). Study 2 investigated automatic retrieval inhibition in trauma survivors with or without Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The results suggested that repeated retrieval of trauma-related information by individuals with PTSD can cause inhibition of related, but unpractised information. Studies 3 and 4 examined the relationship between the vantage point of trauma memories, avoidance and posttraumatic stress symptomatology. The findings indicated that recalling a traumatic event from an observer perspective is associated with post trauma avoidance. They also showed that an observer vantage point in the initial few weeks after trauma is associated with poorer long-term post trauma adjustment. Studies 5, 6 and 7 were analogue studies which analysed the impact of heightened arousal on memory retrieval in novice skydivers. The results suggested that elevated arousal can interfere with retrieval of information related to the arousal-inducing event. Study 7 also indicated that autobiographical memory for the event may be impaired. Finally, Study 8 examined the qualities of trauma memories that were accessed via different modes of retrieval. The results provided evidence that intrusive memories were experienced as more realistic and with more intense affect than memories for the same event that were deliberately retrieved. Together, the findings of this program of research extend current  theories of PTSD by highlighting the mechanisms through which retrieval of trauma memories may be impaired. The results suggest that the quality of trauma memories is affected by avoidance processes, elevated arousal and level of conscious control the individual exerts over retrieval.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Post-traumatic stress disorder</field><field name="subject">Psychic trauma</field><field name="subject">Memory</field><field name="subject">Stress (Psychology)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25206</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The mythological state and its empire</field><field name="creator">Grant, David John, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">legitimate because it is not the persistence of a secularised theological concept. Although it reoccupied mirror-image pre-Enlightenment questions, say regarding absolutism, it is not first concerned with such categories as ???sovereignty, raison d???etat, will, decision, friend-enemy??? but with ???contract, consent, liberty, law and rights???. However, in Work on Myth, he proposes that man is, and has always been, a maker of mythological magnitudes, of which there can be argued to be an archetypal form. These magnitudes are so fearsome as to allow man to convert his existential fear into fear of an entity the fate of which he can gradually bring into his own hands. In this way, there is the promise of the elimination of existential fear and of the experience of sympathetic conditions of existence. Blumenberg does not address political issues, such as the nature of the State. However, if the State can be shown to be such a magnitude and therefore a political realisation of such an archetype, then it is mythological and so is not modern, even if it is legitimate. It then needs to be criticised to allow the introduction of a radical notion of Enlightenment. The effect of such criticisms would be the replacement of the notions of fear and sympathy with that of self-responsibility as the first interest of the State. Selfresponsibility would need to be promoted progressively. It would require a reconfigured State the prime purpose of which is the promotion of respect and self-reliance of individuals. Its first concern would therefore not be the elimination of fear, which would be understood as unable to be eliminated, nor the creation by it of sympathetic conditions of existence, which would be better a matter for properly prepared and supported, selfreliant individuals. The debate then would be around this axis, where contingency is accepted and managed, not the mythological axis of liberalism and republicanism which has dominated modern political theory since Hobbes. This thesis is first an exploration of the viability of the mythological idea of the State, whether the State is a political realisation of the archetypal myth. It does this through an examination of such thinkers in the political tradition as Hobbes, Locke, Montesquieu, Rousseau, Kant, Rawls and Pettit. The conclusion of this examination is, in sum, that the idea of the State since Hobbes has been, and remains, mythological since it shows all the key characteristics of a mythological entity and the arguments for it have mythological presumptions. It is still first concerned with the fear/sympathy nexus and the debates of the political tradition from Hobbes to Pettit have been carried out around that axis. Further, this is argued to be an arrangement which promotes dominant interests rather than widespread participation of non-autonomous, self-responsible individuals. But if this notion of the State as a progressively refined and dispersed mythological entity is viable, it cannot have existed only in the minds of those in the political theoretical tradition. We should expect to see evidence of it in the beliefs and practices of individual  men and women. It must have been not just a political realisation of the mythological State as an idea, but an embodied notion. This thesis is also an exploration of the evidence for that embodiment. It does this by looking at Elias??? analysis of the civilising process in the Middle Ages, at Foucault???s analysis of the emergence and proliferation of the disciplines and the art of government from the 17th century and at the dispersal of the myth through cultural imperialism in the 18th century. The conclusions of these analyses are reinforced by the social ontology of Wittgenstein. Further argument for this embodiment is presented regarding both the common notion of citizenship and the perception of other cultures, that each manifest mythological characteristics. Such embodied practices can be seen as strategies promoted through the State by dominant interests, the purpose of which are the claims to generally eliminate fear and create sympathetic conditions of existence. This embodiment reinforces the initial argument that the idea of the State did emerge and has been established and gradually refined as mythological. In essence and in large part, this is a genealogy of post-Hobbesian political society as mythological. That is, as the political realisation of the archetypal mythological form and its embodiment in the material practice of individuals. The explanatory value of this way of perceiving the State is then demonstrated by its application to the complex conditions of the destruction of traditional Aboriginal culture by the colonising and civilising British, that is the dispersal of the mythological State as empire. From this, it is argued that the mythological understanding of the State is more illuminating that other approaches.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">State, The</field><field name="subject">Mythology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26140</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The politics of ???environmental refugee??? protection at the United Nations</field><field name="creator">McNamara, Karen Elizabeth, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis seeks to better conceptualise how and why there is an absence of international protection for ???environmental refugees???, and to place these findings in the critical geopolitics literature. A poststructuralist framework, drawing on Foucault???s ideas of discourse, subjectivity, power and governance, was deemed most appropriate for this thesis, and provided a means of differentiation from previous literature on ???environmental refugees???. This thesis develops a genealogy of the subject category of ???environmental refugees??? since the 1970s, to better understand how the United Nations, Inter-Governmental Organisations (IGOs), Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) and the media have constructed environmental issues and refugees in texts. Fieldwork undertaken in 2004 enabled me to conduct 45 semistructured interviews with United Nations diplomats and representatives from IGOs and NGOs. Critical scrutiny of these interview texts revealed the constructions of ???environmental refugees??? as various subject identities, particularly in relation to climate change. Pacific ambassadors to the United Nations were also interviewed in 2004 to explore how they negotiated discourses on climate change and ???environmental refugees???, and attempted to articulate their concerns at the United Nations. This thesis contends that an absence of policy at the United Nations to protect ???environmental refugees??? has been produced by a combination of discursive and institutional politics. Unequal power structures at the United Nations have limited the capacity of small island states to lobby and articulate concerns, while subject categories of ???environmental refugees??? have been constructed in ways that alter the terms of debate, evade legal response, or deflect blame away from the perpetrators of environmental damage. Reasons for this policy absence have been the shifting attitudes towards environmental issues and the role of multilateral political institutions. The overall contribution of this thesis is to critical geopolitics, through its examination of the role of multilateralism, representations of environmental issues causing population displacement, and how and why policy absences are created within multilateral institutions such as the United Nations.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Refugees -- Protection</field><field name="subject">Refugees -- International cooperation</field><field name="subject">Human rights</field><field name="subject">Internally displaced persons</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26972</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Autobiographical memory in posttraumatic stress disorder</field><field name="creator">Sutherland, Kylie Anne, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This program of research investigated the nature and processes of autobiographical memory deficits in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Study 1 examined the proposition that difficulties in the retrieval of specific memories present a risk factor for posttraumatic psychopathology. A prospective study of fire-fighters found that a significant predictor of posttraumatic stress was a deficit in retrieving specific memories to positive cues before trauma. Study 2 investigated whether autobiographical retrieval deficits in PTSD can be modified by psychological treatment. Results found that as PTSD symptoms reduced following treatment, individuals with PTSD retrieved more specific memories to positive cues. Together, these results indicated that specific retrieval deficits to positive cues present a vulnerability factor for PTSD. However, this memory style appears to be receptive to modification following therapy. Study 3 investigated the association between autobiographical retrieval deficits and impaired problemsolving in PTSD. Participants with PTSD retrieved more overgeneral categoric memories and took longer to retrieve memories than non-PTSD trauma controls. This deficit was associated with impaired social problem-solving, suggesting that specific retrieval is related to successful problem solving. In an analogue design, Studies 4 and 5 investigated the proposition that resource limitations may underpin autobiographical retrieval deficits. Results generally supported the proposal that reduced cognitive resources may be a mechanism contributing to specific retrieval deficits. Studies 6 and 7 examined rumination as another possible mechanism responsible for these retrieval deficits. Study 6 found high anxious participants retrieved fewer specific memories to positive cues following rumination, compared  to distraction. Study 7 found evidence that negative rumination in the high anxious group increased categoric retrieval, whereas positive rumination had no effect. Study 8 found retrieval of trauma-related self-defining memories was strongly associated with personal goals connected to the trauma. Study 9 found that discrepancies in one???s self construct were related to the retrieval of trauma memories to positive cues.

The optimised mix achieved a compressive strength at the age of 28 days of 70 and 58 MPa after initial curing at 70??C for 12 hours and at 23??C for 24 hours, respectively. The resultant Geopolymer has an amorphous aluminosilicate structure. Efflorescence and the potential risk of alkali-silica reaction for the Geopolymer used in this study are both very low.  The research confirmed that the Geopolymer concrete developed in this study is far superior to Portland cement concrete when exposed in a sulphuric acid environment. The standard immersion tests finally selected for this research were in 10% sulphuric acid for 56 days and in 1% sulphuric acid for one year. Geopolymer concrete samples retained their shape without softening though they experienced a mass loss of about 5% and a strength loss of some 30%. Portland cement concrete recorded a mass loss of some 40% in a 10% sulphuric acid for 28 days.  The penetration rate of sulphuric acid into the Geopolymer concrete was found to approximately follow Fick&#146;s first law of diffusion and a linear relationship between the neutralisation depth and the square root of immersion time (in day) was established.  The degradation processes of Geopolymer concrete in sulphuric acid environments were intensively studied. The first stage involved the preferential liberation of alkali ions. The tetrahedral aluminium in the Si-O-Al configuration was removed and converted to octahedral aluminium. Consequently, the original units of Si(1Al) degraded to a silica polymorph structure in the corroded Geopolymer, which continued to serve a cementitious role. In contrast, in the case of Portland cement concrete, the acid solution dissolved the hydration products of the cement paste.  The residual reaction products were found to be soft and have no structural strength. Geopolymers with alkaline activators of mixed sodium hydroxide and sodium silicate did not exhibit any cracking problems. Class F fly ash with low calcium content was found to be suitable for developing a Geopolymer binder able to withstand sulphuric acid attack.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fly ash.</field><field name="subject">Concrete.</field><field name="subject">Sulphuric acid.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44429</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of the appropriateness of internet technology for inter-firm communication in the Thai tourism industry.</field><field name="creator">Vatanasakdakul, Savanid, Information Systems, Technology &amp; Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is to investigate the appropriateness of B2B technology transfer in developing countries, particularly in Thailand. This study seeks an understanding of how Thai culture affects the appropriateness of B2B technology adoption for inter-firm communication in Thailand. A research model was developed for investigating this issue via a strategic fit lens. The proposed model extended the Task-technology fit (TTF) model by Goodhue and Thompson (1995) by integrating interorganisational theories and theories of national culture. This research takes the view that, to achieve a high utilisation of B2B technology adoption, firms in developing countries need to adopt effective IT strategies that align with their local environment. Hence, this research proposes that cultural fit is a major influence on the perception of appropriateness of B2B technology adoption in Thailand.  The study was conducted using both qualitative and quantitative approaches. The first study, the qualitative study, was conducted as a preliminary study by interviewing officials in the Thai government and companies in the tourism industry. The objectives were to explore and identify the cultural dimensions that impact on the appropriateness of B2B technology adoption in Thailand. The resulting dimensionalities of cultural fit are: personal relationships; long-term relationships; interorganisational trust; ability to communicate in the English language and materialism. The second study was conducted via a quantitative approach and scales were developed to validate the proposed research model. Data were collected through a survey questionnaire, and analysed by using Structural Equation Modeling with Partial Least Squares (PLS) method.  This study found that cultural fit does influence the appropriateness of B2B technology adoption in Thailand. A better perceived fit between Thai culture and B2B technology results in higher technology utilisation. In addition, the results of moderating effect analysis found that, although task-technology fit had no direct impact on utilisation, task-technology fit did have indirect impact on utilisation by moderating the impact of culture. Nevertheless, the results indicated that task-technology fit still had a greater impact on firms' perceived performance than utilisation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Thai culture.</field><field name="subject">Structural Equation Modeling.</field><field name="subject">B2B technology.</field><field name="subject">Thai tourism industry.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44428</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Telepathy in contemporary, conceptual and performance art</field><field name="creator">Drinkall, Jacquelene Ashley, School of Art History &amp; Theory, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the impact of telepathy and psi on conceptual and performance art from 1968. Emerging from the author???s art practice, the thesis argues telepathy is a key leitmotif and creative concern within much post 60s art, and has become central to the practice of a number of contemporary video, performance and new media artists. This thesis is composed of two interrelated parts: an exhibition of the artwork by the author concerning telepathic processes, and a written project which uses the major themes of the exhibition to frame an historical study of a number of key contemporary artists whom, it is argued, work with telepathy. These artists, Jane and Louise Wilson, Suzanne Treister and Susan Hiller are discussed under the themes of ???twinning and doubling,??? ???technological mediums??? and ???telepathy experiments???. These themes also overlap in the authors artwork, are introduced through an overarching analysis of the work of performance artist Marina Abramovi?? and philosopher Jacques Derrida who, it is argued, provide a new model of telepathy as an art practice. In addition, the thesis argues that telepathy is an often suppressed thematic in art which may not appear to directly address it, and uses the work on the Wilsons, Treister and Hiller to re-look at other 20th Century artists and artistic themes in the light of the conclusions it draws on telepathy and art. Walter Benjamin greatly admired the Surrealists, but had virtually no time for their interest in telepathy, hypnosis and psi. Together with positive materialist misappropriations of Adorno???s Thesis Against Occultism, artistic and theoretical work with telepathy and psi has been sidelined from other important themes in art and critical theory, all of which telepathy and psi illuminate, energise and empower. The art of the author and other more recognised and established artists can be seen to work with telepathy in ways that flow into and reinforce the grain of progressive leftist practice and aesthetics. Women???s work with telepathy should be considered as important as women???s work with sexuality. Women, sexuality, Otherness, liminality, spirituality, telepathy, trauma, healing, radical politics, and other taboo areas of patriachal codes, were adandoned by macho participants of fluxus and Conceptual art. The recent conceptual and performance tilt in contemporary art sheds new light on the problem of working within and developing an effective and dynamic lineage of telepathy in post 60s art as well as early modern art movements. Contemporary developments in science, engineering, biology, psychoanalysis, warfare, popular culture and sociology show the wider relevance of discourse on telepathy. There is much at stake for visual art, aesthetics and visuality in representing, celebrating and interrogating the theme of psi and telepathy in current practice and art history. Artists??? work with telepathy and psi, although not always explicitly psychological, political or aesthetic, is often very psychologically, politically and aesthetically effective.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">telepathy</field><field name="subject">modern art</field><field name="subject">performance art</field><field name="subject">conceptual art</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31097</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improvement of bearing strength of laminated composites by nanoclay and Z-pin reinforcement.</field><field name="creator">Huong, Tran Phuong Nam, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The bearing behavior of bolted composite joints is significantly poorer than that of their metallic counterparts. The objective of the present study was to examine ways of improving the bearing performance of bolted joints in carbon fibre reinforced epoxy laminates. Two strategies were examined, namely stiffening of the matrix using nanofillers and through- thickness reinforcement of the laminates using z- pins. The development of a nanoparticle reinforced matrix resin, and its performance in a composite loaded in bearing, was the focus of the first part of the study. A commercial nanoclay, I30E from Nanocor, was chosen as the reinforcement since the nanoclay particles are modified with long alkyl chain amines which improves dispersion in the epoxy resin. The c onditions for preparing nanocomposites based on the nanoclay were examined for two epoxy resin systems , DGEBA and TGDDM. Significant improvements in the elastic modulus were obtained , with a 20% increase being recorded w ith 8.4 phr nanoclay content in the DGEBA resin and a 50% increase with 20 phr nanoclay content in the TGDDM system. Carbon fibre reinforced laminates w ere prepared from nanoclay reinforced TGGDM matrix resin, using a vacuum assisted prepregging process. The bearing strength and stiffness of the laminated composites was improved by 7% and 15% respectively but the strain to failure was reduced. The addition of nanoclay to the matrix resin was found to change the failure mode. Enhancement of the bearing performance of laminates by through-thickness reinforcement (z-pins) was examined as the second strategy trialed in this thesis. The bearing strength, stiffness and energy to failure of carbon fibre laminates was found to increase progressively with increasing volume content of z-pins , with increases of 10%, 10% and 16%, respectively , being achieved at a z-pin volume content of 4%. No significant change in strength, stiffness or failure energy was observed when the z-pin diameter was changed from 0.28 to 0.51 mm at the same volume content.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31913</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Appendicitis protects against colitis: an exploration of underlying immune mechanisms</field><field name="creator">Ng, Wa Sang Watson, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Inflammatory bowel disease-(IBD) is a chronic relapsing and remitting disorder of the gastrointestinal tract characterised by inflammation. The underlying immunopathogenesis is unknown but excessive effector and defective regulatory immune responses play a significant role. The aetiology of IBD is not yet fully resolved, but interactions between genetic and environmental factors, including the gut flora, contribute significantly to the development of IBD. Appendicectomy for intra-abdominal inflammatory conditions before the age of 20 protects against colitis. The mechanism underlying this protective effect is unclear. This thesis examined the hypothesis that appendiceal regulatory T lymphocytes (Treg) mediate the protection. Despite human and murine data showing that the appendix is involved in the prevention of colitis, few studies of human or murine appendices have been reported. A novel murine model of appendicitis was created using an operative technique of band-ligation of an induced-tubular-appendix. Histological assessment showed that this model recapitulated all of the histological features of human acute appendicitis, namely mucosal ulceration, transmural neutrophilic and lymphocytic infiltration and serositis. This local pathology was associated with a systemic host response, evidenced by raised serum Creactive- protein. The impact of inflammation on the appendiceal lymphocyte constituents was assessed by flow cytometry. The inflammation caused a shift from B-lymphocyte to T-lymphocyte predominance. In particular there was a 75% increment in Treg numbers, which was restricted to juvenile mice only (&amp;lt 10 weeks old). Furthermore, appendiceal Treg expressed the gut-homing chemokine-receptor, CCR9, and the intestine-specific integrin, &#945;4&#946;7. These cells were shown to preferentially migrate to the colonic lamina propria. Lastly, appendicitis and appendicectomy protected against TNBS-colitis which was also restricted to juvenile mice. Evidence for antigen dependence was suggested by the effect being heightened when mice were pre-sensitised against TNBS. Exploration of the colonic lamina propria (cLP) lymphocyte population showed an increase in Treg, especially CD8+Foxp3+- Treg, in ??protected?? mice only, which may have originated in the appendix. Intracytoplasmic cytokine detection showed that these cLP-Treg were potent producers of the regulatory cytokine, IL-10. These findings strongly suggest that appendicitis triggers an expansion of Treg which then emigrate to the colon and mediate long-lasting protection against colitis.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Appendicitis</field><field name="subject">Colitis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41442</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lost in the archive: vision, artefact and loss in the evolution of hypertext</field><field name="creator">Barnet, Belinda, English, Media, &amp; Performing Arts, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">How does one write the history of a technical machine? Can we say that technical machines have their own genealogies, their own evolutionary dynamic? The technical artefact constitutes a series of objects, a lineage or a line. At a cursory level, we can see this in the fact that technical machines come in generations - they adapt and adopt characteristics over time, one suppressing the other as it becomes obsolete. It is argued that technics has its own evolutionary dynamic, and that this dynamic stems neither from biology nor from human societies. Yet 'it is impossible to deny the role of human thought in the creation of technical artefacts' (Guattari 1995, p. 37). Stones do not automatically rise up into a wall - humans 'invent' technical objects. This, then, raises the question of technical memory. Is it humans that remember previous generations of machines and transfer their characteristics to new machines? If so, how and where do they remember them? It is suggested that humans learn techniques from technical artefacts, and transfer these between machines. This theory of technical evolution is then used to understand the genealogy of hypertext. The historical differentiations of hypertext in different technical systems is traced. Hypertext is defined as both a technical artefact and also a set of techniques: both are a part of this third milieu, technics. The difference between technical artefact and technical vision is highlighted, and it is suggested that technique and vision change when they are externalised as material artefact. The primary technique traced is association, the organisational principle behind the hypertext systems explored in the manuscript. In conclusion, invention is shown to be an act of exhumation, the transfer and retroactiviation of techniques from the past. This thesis presents an argument for a new model of technical evolution, a model which claims that technics constitutes its own dynamic, and that this dynamic exceeds human evolution. It traces the genealogy of hypertext as a set of techniques and as series of material artefacts. To create this geneaology I draw on interviews conducted with Douglas Engelbart, Ted Nelson and Andries van Dam, as well as a wide variety of primary and secondary resources.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44384</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Methods for training people's decision-making judgment: a review</field><field name="creator">Moulton, Bruce David, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The subject of enquiry is the variation seen in the results of a specific set of studies about methods for training people&#146;s judgment. This review attempts to synthesise the studies&#146; findings, and tests hypotheses about the causes of the variation. Research questions ask if variation is attributable to differences in participant characteristics, different aspects of judgment having been targeted, different tasks having been performed or different training strategies having been used. Relevant literature was reviewed, and studies that reported a method for training an aspect of judgment were selected for further quantitative analysis if at least two groups had been randomly selected from a larger set of human adults, one of which received training that another did not, and where, during the test phase, members of no group had access to tools or resources, performed tasks, or received feedback which members of another group did not. A meta-analysis of statistical data from 39 published studies was conducted. The findings are interpreted as indicating variation in the effect of training is attributable to differences in task type and differences in training strategy. The effect of training is greatest in the studies that have diagnostic tasks (p&lt;0.05). The studies that trained participants with examples have, on average, greater effect sizes than studies that did not (p&lt;0.05). Implications, limitations, and avenues for further research are discussed. It is concluded that the findings indicate that different tasks and different training strategies account for a significant proportion of the variation in training effect seen between the selected studies.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Choice</field><field name="subject">Judgement</field><field name="subject">Decision</field><field name="subject">Training</field><field name="subject">Decision-making</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41431</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Capability building for the manufacture of photovoltaic system components in developing countries</field><field name="creator">Bruce, Anna Gabrielle, Photovoltaics &amp; Renewable Energy Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The manufacture of photovoltaic (PV) system components has a role to play in the industrialisation and poverty reduction strategies of developing countries. It has also been suggested that small scale local manufacture of balance of systems components has the potential to improve the maintenance, installation and use of the technology. However, PV is a complex technology and most developing countries have not been able to build the capabilities required to manufacture PV system components of an appropriate quality and price, either in the modern or small scale sectors. The factors that determine the success of PV manufacturers in developing countries are therefore of interest.  Previous studies on learning in the PV industry have been focused on industry-wide concerns and have not explicitly addressed enterprise-level capability building or challenges specific to developing countries. In particular, there has been very little published about small scale PV manufacture. This thesis therefore aims to improve understanding of the factors that influence capability building, with a view to assisting decision making in relation to PV manufacture in developing countries.  The aims of the study have been fulfilled by the development and assessment of a software simulation training tool for PV cell production line engineers, the development of an analysis framework, and application of it to several case study PV enterprises. Through the application of the framework to the case studies, it has been possible to assess the role of software simulations, the suitability of countries with different types of infrastructure for hosting PV manufacturing and the institutional arrangements or interventions that could be used to promote capability building for PV manufacturers in developing countries.  While further case studies are required to make more than tentative conclusions, the framework developed and tested in this thesis may now be used as a tool to systematically and rapidly analyse the appropriateness of different types of PV manufacture in particular countries, to identify the weaknesses in their PV technological systems and therefore to suggest where resources should be invested and where appropriate institutional changes could be made. The simulation software has been demonstrated to be an effective capability building tool, thus providing one of the key elements required for successful manufacturing.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Manufacture.</field><field name="subject">Photovoltaics.</field><field name="subject">Development.</field><field name="subject">Capability building.</field><field name="subject">Capacity building.</field><field name="subject">Technological systems.</field><field name="subject">Small-scale manufacture.</field><field name="subject">Simulation software.</field><field name="subject">Photovoltaic cells.</field><field name="subject">Photovoltaic power generation -- Developing countries.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41861</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Building a theory of action from the philosophies of Hannah Arendt and Michel Foucault</field><field name="creator">Kingston, Mark, History &amp; Philosophy, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis develops a theory of action, drawing chiefly on the work of Hannah Arendt and Michel Foucault. I begin with a discussion of some popular theories of action. As I argue, these theories tend to suffer from three problems: they do not distinguish action from everyday behaviour, they do not account for the way in which action transforms the identity of the actor, and they tend to neglect the innovative and initiatory character of action. In chapter two, I discuss Arendt&#146;s theory of political action, which goes a long way toward redressing these problems. However, the value of Arend's work is limited by her characterisation of the public sphere as subsumed by a 'social' rather than political form of community. Accordingly, I follow Dana Villa and Bonnie Honig's suggestions that a broader understanding of action is required in order to overcome the weaknesses of Arendt's work. In chapters four and five, I demonstrate that a reading of Foucault can yield just such a broader understanding. I begin with an analysis of The History of Sexuality and the argument that the transformation of ethical subjectivity can function as a means of resistance to the normalising effects of power, before moving on to discuss the essay 'What Is Enlightenment?' I argue that these works are part of a 'transformative project,' in which Foucault aims to facilitate the transformation of subjectivity as a means of resistance to social normalisation. This transformative project can be adapted into a theory of action that locates action within contemporary society but shares some of the best aspects of Arendt's theory. Finally, drawing on the work of Foucault and Adriana Cavarero, these theoretical reflections are applied to a discussion of action in the context of small communities. Small-community models of action are an important consideration because they allow us to avoid the traditional dichotomy between action as a task for the individual who transgresses social norms and action as a project of social reform.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cavarero</field><field name="subject">Foucault</field><field name="subject">Arendt</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44427</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An immunologically inspired self-set for sensor networks</field><field name="creator">Bokareva, Tatiana, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), consisting of many small sensing devices working in concert, have the potential to revolutionise every aspect of our lives. Although the technology is still in its infancy offers an unlimited number of possible applications, ranging from military surveillance to environmental monitoring. These WSNs are prone to physical sensor failures due to environmental conditions such bio fouling and an adverse ambient environment, as well as threats that arise from their operation in an open environment. Consequently, reliability and fault-tolerance techniques become a critical aspect of the research associated with WSNs. In mission critical applications, such as the monitoring of enemy troops, unreliable or faulty information produced by WSNs could potentially lead to fatal outcomes. In such applications, it necessary to receive both a correct notification of event occurrences and uncorrupted data. Developing a fault-tolerance system for WSNs is a challenging task. New self-configuration, self-recognition and self-organisation techniques are needed due to unique aspects of the operation of WSNs. Our current understanding of WSNs leads to an immunologically inspired solution to the design of a fault-tolerant network. One of the main roles of the Natural Immune System(NIS) is the recognition of self and the elimination of non-self proteins. Hence, in order to have an immune system equivalent for a sensor network, we must have a clear and stable definition of what constitutes the Self and the Non-Self Sets in a sensor network. This thesis explores two different approaches to modelling, collection and representation of the Self-Set in distributed sensor networks. We approach this problem, of identifying what constitutes the Self-Set in terms of sensor readings, using pattern recognition techniques from the machine learning field that leverages a small number of past observations of sensor nodes. We have chosen Competitive Learning Neural Network (CLNN) for the construction of the Self-Set. We define and evaluate two approaches for the aggregation of the Self-Set across multiple sensors in a WSN. The first approach is the Graph Theory Based Aggregation (GTBA) which consists of two main parts, namely: classification of the sensor readings by means of CLNN, which provides the multimodal view data and GTBA of the CLNN output, which takes intersections of intervals produced by CLNN. In this thesis we define and evaluate two different interpretations of GTBA, namely: Midpoint Intersection (MPI): one that considers the midpoint of intervals. Midpoint Free Intersection (MFI): one that does not take the midpoints into account but assigns the confidence levels to each of the resulted intersections. We evaluated both interpretations on three different types of phenomena and have shown that the second interpretation, MFI, consistently produced more precise representations of the environment under observation. However, MFI produced a very strict representation of the phenomenon, which consequently led to a large number of systems' retraining. Hence, we defined and evaluated a technique which produced a more relaxed representation of the Self-Set and at the same time preserved the finer variation in the phenomenon. The second approach is based on unsupervised learning. We define and evaluate three related unsupervised learning procedures ?? Divergence and Merging (DMP), Suboptimal Clustering (SOC), and Simple Clustering (SC) for the collection of the Self-Set. We explore the design tradeoffs in unsupervised learning schemes with respect to the clustering quality. We implement and evaluate these related unsupervised learning procedures on a realworld data set. The outcome of these experiments show that, out of the three unsupervised learning procedures studied in this thesis, the Suboptimal Clustering procedure appears to be the most suitable for the classification of sensor readings, provided that the amount of free memory is large enough to store and recluster an entire training set. We evaluate aggregation of the Self-Set produced by means of the distributed implementation of the unsupervised learning procedures. The aggregation is based on extended unsupervised learning and we evaluate the possibilities of the autonomous retraining of the system. Our experiments show that, in a naturally slowly changing environment, 40% of nodes reporting deviations is a large enough number to reinitialise the retraining of the system. The final conclusion is that it is possible to have a distributed implementation of the unsupervised procedure that  produces an almost identical representation of the environment, which  makes unsupervised learning suitable for a large number of sensor network architectures.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sensor networks</field><field name="subject">Immunology</field><field name="subject">Self-set</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43396</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The utilisation of quantitative information in groups' capital investment decisions</field><field name="creator">Ang, Nicole Pamela, Accounting, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">One explanation for the increased use of interactive groups in organisations is that benefits are obtained from pooling individuals?? differing knowledge and abilities.  However, prior experimental research has established that groups often do not discuss and use information effectively, exhibiting a bias toward information that is commonly known by all group members, rather than information that is unique to individual group members (common information bias).  This dissertation investigated whether the provision of quantitative information resulted in improved group performance in two respects.  First, it investigated whether quantitative information was discussed and used more than qualitative information.  Second, it examined whether the quantification of information reduced the common information bias.  This is important because a basic purpose of managerial accounting is to provide information that improves employees?? abilities to make optimal decisions. This dissertation utilised an experimental task known as a ??hidden profile?? to achieve the research objectives.  In a hidden profile experiment, each group member receives some information that is common to everyone in the group, and some information that is unique to them.  The group must discuss and use members?? unique information in order to uncover the optimal task solution.  This dissertation examined the effect of information availability (common or unique) and information type (quantitative or qualitative) on information discussion and use.  There were two stages to the experiment.  First, individual group members had to make a capital investment decision, and write down their reasons for that decision.  Second, groups had to discuss the information, come to a group decision, and write down their reasons for that decision. The results confirmed a common information bias at the group decision level, with groups significantly favouring common information over unique information, for all measures of discussion and information use.  In contrast, while a preference for quantitative information was found at the individual decision level, at a group decision level there were no significant differences in the discussion or use of quantitative and qualitative information, with only one exception: significantly more statements were made about quantitative information.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Quantification</field><field name="subject">Group decision making</field><field name="subject">Accounting</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44426</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Trends and development of non-communicable diseases and risk factors in Samoa over 24 years</field><field name="creator">Viali, Satupaitea, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Abstract inserted as part of Final MPH Thesis:  Non-Communicable Diseases like diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancers and others, have become the major cause of premature death, morbidity and disability in many Pacific countries including Samoa. These are linked by common preventable risk factors like obesity, hypertension, smoking, unhealthy diets and physical inactivity. OBJECTIVES: To determine the trends and development of Non-Communicable diseases and its risk factors in Samoa over the last 24 years using the recently developed diagnostic criteria. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This research thesis combines 3 large surveys that were done in 1978, 1991, and 2002, looking at the trends in the prevalence of diabetes, and the prevalence of the NCD risk factors such as blood pressure, obesity, cholesterol and smoking. The 3 survey samples were selected randomly from around similar regions (Urban Upolu, Rural Upolu, and Rural Savaii) of Samoa in 1978, 1991 and 2002, with a total of 5973 individuals (1978 survey = 1467; 1991 survey = 1778; 2002 survey = 2728) available for the thesis analysis. The 1978 and 1991 data sets were secured from Professor P Zimmet, and the 2002 STEPs survey data set was secured from the Samoa Ministry of Health. The 3 surveys methodologies, survey procedures, questionnaires and anthropometric measurements were similar though the diagnostic criteria used to measure obesity slightly differ between the surveys. The blood pressure measurements were similar though the diastolic blood pressure measure in 1978 was higher. The 1978 and 1991 surveys used fasting venous blood sampling to measure fasting plasma glucose, and cholesterol levels at the laboratory. OGTT was also used in 1978 and 1991, but not 2002. The 2002 survey used capillary sampling to measure fasting glucose using a glucometer, and cholesterol level using a cholesterol meter. The combined data was then cleaned, standardized and matched with each survey, to make analysis easier. The recent diagnostic criteria were then applied to all the surveys to diagnose diabetes (1999 WHO Diabetes Criteria), hypertension (WHO 1999, JNC-VII 2003, NHF 1999 Hypertension Criteria), obesity (BMI &#8805;30 kg/m??), and hypercholesterolaemia. The prevalences using the recent diagnostic criteria were then mapped out.  RESULTS: The overall age-standardized prevalence of type 2 diabetes (known or previously unknown) utilizing the current 1999 WHO diagnostic criteria for men and women &#8805;20 years of age has increased from 5.4% (males 4.8%, females 5.9%) in 1978, to 12.0% (males 10.9%, females 13.5%) in 1991, and to 20.1% (males 17.2%, females 22.2%) in 2002. Among the individuals with diabetes in the 3 surveys, more than 60% had previously undiagnosed diabetes. Compared with the 1978 survey, the diabetes prevalence in 2002 represents a 4-fold increase over the 24 year period. This has occurred along with increasing obesity, urbanization and modernization, aging, cultural changes, and changes in physical activity. There is a high prevalence of non-communicable disease risk factors. The age-standardized prevalence of hypertension defined by the WHO 1999 and JNC-VII 2003 criteria was 47.2% in 1978, 22.5% in 1991, and 24.0% in 2002. The high prevalence of hypertension in 1978 was due to the method used for recording diastolic blood pressure. Hypertension was more common in the urban regions than rural regions in 1978 and 1991 while in 2002, there was no statistical difference between the rates of hypertension between the different regions due to the rise in the prevalence rate of hypertension in rural regions.   There is a high prevalence of overweight and obesity in Samoa. Using the WHO classification for BMI, there was an increase in obesity (BMI &#8805; 30kg/m??) prevalence in Samoa in the last decade, increasing steeply from 34.9% in 1978 to 51.3% in 1991, and slowing down to an increase to 57.4% in 2002. The prevalence of obesity is significantly higher in females compared with their male counterparts. The overweight prevalence (BMI 25-29.9kg/m??) was 34% in 1978, 31% in 1991 and 29% in 2002. The prevalence of obesity has increased by 65% from 1978 to 2002 with an increase of 47% from 1978 to 1991, and 12% from 1991 to 2002. Prevalence of obesity is increasing with age and is more of a problem in women than men. It is higher in the urban regions but there has been a faster rise in obesity prevalence in rural regions from 1978 to 2002 as the rural regions become urbanized. The prevalence of hypercholesterolaemia (total cholesterol &#8805; 5.2 mmol/l) was 30.5% in 1978, and this increased to 51.1% in 1991. There was a marked decline of hypercholesterolaemia in 2002 (14.4%), which may be due to differences in the method of measurement. Although smoking prevalence remains high in Samoa it declined significantly from 42.4% 1978 to 35.3% 1991 but remained essentially steady at 38% in 2002. There was a significant gender difference in smoking with about 60% of men and 20% of women smoking regularly. CONCLUSION: Samoa is experiencing an increasing problem with Non-Communicable diseases like diabetes and some of its risk factors.  Diabetes prevalence has dramatically increased by 4-fold in the last 24 years. The prevalence of hypertension has stabilized around 23% though there was a decrease from 1978. The prevalence of obesity has also increased. Smoking prevalence has slightly increased from 1991 to 2002 with a significant number of the population smoking. Hypercholesterolaemia is more common in 1991 with an apparent decrease in 2002. These findings have important implications for public health efforts and policy developments to contain the epidemic of Non-Communicable diseases in Samoa.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Obesity</field><field name="subject">Non-Communicable Diseases</field><field name="subject">Diabetes</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40404</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Daily to decadal embayed beach response to wave and climate forcing</field><field name="creator">Harley, Mitchell Dean, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">A multi-decadal survey program undertaken at the Collaroy-Narrabeen embayment in SE Australia identifies medium-term (~2-7 year) cycles of both erosion and accretion across the entire embayment ('beach oscillation') and at its two extremities ('beach rotation'). These cycles have been observed to respond to phase shifts in the El Ni??o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO). To investigate wave and climate controls of embayment variability in finer detail, this study combines historical surveys with 45 years of wave data from the ERA-40 reanalysis and four years of high-resolution beach measurements using RTK-GPS and image-derived survey techniques. ENSO and Southern Annular Mode (SAM) controls of wave variability in the Sydney region are first explored. In general, wave heights increase/decrease and wave directions become more easterly/southerly during La Ni??a/El Ni??o phases. A positive correlation is observed between the SAM and summer wave heights, and a negative correlation between the SAM and winter wave directions. Storm variability is observed to be modified by the ENSO, but not the SAM. In particular, La Ni??a phases are generally associated with longer duration, higher energy events from a more easterly direction when compared to those during El Ni??o phases.  Wave controls of embayment variability are subsequently investigated. In the short-term (days - months), beach oscillation/rotation is observed to be the most dominant process, accounting for approx. 60%/20% of overall embayment variability. Beach oscillation is related to changes in wave height and storms, whereas beach rotation is related to changes in wave direction and/or wave period. An empirical model that estimates the beach response to individual storm events is developed. In the longer-term (months - years), beach rotation is observed to respond to both wave heights and directions. Larger waves are sheltered somewhat at the southern end, creating an apparent clockwise rotation under energetic wave conditions. Clockwise/anticlockwise rotations are also observed to follow southerly/easterly wave shifts at lags of up to 12 months. Comparisons between the ENSO and beach oscillation/rotation agree with previous observations that El Ni??o/La Ni??a phases are associated with an overall accretion/erosion and clockwise/anticlockwise rotation of the embayment. In general, the SAM shows little influence on embayment variability. While it is clear that beach oscillation is driven by cross-shore processes, to what extent beach rotation is a longshore and/or cross-shore phenomena requires further investigation.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wave climate</field><field name="subject">Embayed beaches</field><field name="subject">Coastal imaging</field><field name="subject">ENSO</field><field name="subject">Southern annular mode</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44391</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A tale of two surveys: searching for extrasolar planets from Australia and Antarctica</field><field name="creator">Christiansen, Jessie Leigh, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The transit method of detecting extrasolar planets relies on the small periodic changes in the brightness of the planet's host star as the planet orbits between the observer and the star. Transiting planets are extremely useful discoveries due to the significant gain in information that can be obtained on the planet and its host star than extrasolar planets discovered with other methods. The field of transiting planets has matured rapidly in the last 5 years, particularly in the area of wide-field surveys. This thesis describes the results of two such surveys.  The Vulcan South Antarctic Planet Finder was designed to exploit the conditions at the South Pole, which are ideal for a transit survey. Several hardware failures resulted in the acquisition of only a small amount of corrupted data on a single field.  The University of New South Wales Extrasolar Planet Search is an ongoing transit survey using the 0.5-m Automated Patrol Telescope at Siding Spring Observatory, Australia. 25 fields were observed for 1-4 months each between 2004 October and 2007 May. Light curves were constructed for ~87,000 stars down to I= 14th magnitude, and from these 23 planet candidates were identified. Ten candidates were eliminated using higher spatial resolution archived images and online catalogue data. Eight were followed up with higher spatial resolution imaging and/or medium resolution spectroscopy and were determined to be eclipsing binaries. Five candidates remain that require additional observation to determine their nature. No planets have been confirmed in this data set thus far.  The large sets of high precision light curves generated by transit surveys hold significant potential for additional data-mining. To demonstrate this, a variable star catalogue was compiled from the full data set. A total of 850 variable stars were identified, with 659 new discoveries. In the course of compiling this catalogue, the first example of a high-amplitude &#948; Scuti star in an eclipsing binary was identified. This represented the first opportunity for a dynamical mass measurement of a highamplitude &#948; Scuti star, and the system was studied comprehensively.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Extrasolar planets -- Detection.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43629</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design methodology for ontology-based multi-agent applications (MOMA)</field><field name="creator">Ying, Weir, Information Systems, Technology &amp; Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Software agents and multi-agent systems (MAS) have grown into a very active area of research and commercial development activity. There are many current emerging real-world applications spanning multitude of diverse domains. In the context of agents, ontology has been widely recognised for their significant benefits to interoperability, reusability, and both development and operational aspects of agent systems and applications. Ontology-based multi-agent systems (OBMAS) exploit these advantages in providing intelligent and semantically aware applications.  In addressing the lack of support for ontology in existing methodologies for multi-agent development, this thesis proposes a design methodology for the building of such intelligent multi-agent applications called MOMA. This alternative approach focuses on the development of ontology as the driving force of the development process. By allowing the domain and characteristics of utilisation and experimentation to be dictated through ontology, researchers and domain experts can specify the agent application without any knowledge of agent design and lower level programming. Through the use of a structured ontology model and the use of integrated tools, this approach contributes towards the building of semantically aware intelligent applications for use by researchers and domain experts.

The literature suggests that IS implementation and use can affect and stimulate organisational learning, including higher order learning. However, it is not well understood when and how IS enable and support and when they disable and prevent organisational learning. Furthennore, studies of the relationship between IS and organisational learning tend to reflect theoretical fragmentation of organisational learning literature - focusing either on the individual or on the organisation as a learning entity.  The objective of this thesis is to explore the relationship between IS and organisational learning beyond these limitations, including different learning views from the individual up to the organizational. This is achieved by drawing from a Sensemaking perspective of organizations (Weick, 1995) that fills an important gap in linking infonnation systems, organizing, and learning. The Sensemaking perspective offers an understanding of human sensemaking and sense-'unmaking' as an essential individual, collective and organisational ingredient of organising and learning. By integrating Argyris and Sch??n' s (1978) theory of organisational learning with the sensemaking model of organizations this thesis suggests a more comprehensive view to explore the relationship between IS and organisational learning. Specifically this thesis examines the following research question: What are the ways and mechanisms by which information systems' implementation and use engage sensemaking in organisations, and how does such engagement engender or prevent organisational learning? This research question is investigated through an interpretive, longitudinal case study of the implementation and use of a loan approval information system in a large South-East Asian Bank. The study involved an extensive collection of data from the Bank headquarters and its branches, including 43 interviews, strategic and operational documents, IS project documents and informal discussions. The thesis makes two important contributions to knowledge. Grounded in empirical data, it first argues that the emergence of organizational learning when instigated by an IS implementation is likely to follow the pattern from 'not learning', to 'single-loop' to 'double-loop' learning. Secondly, it also proposes that an IS's likelihood to instigate organizational learning depends on the nature of sensemaking involved: a) if an IS implementation engages only individual, intra-subjective sensemaking organizational learning is not likely to occur and system is at risk of being rejected; b) for single-loop learning to emerge the engagement of intra- and inter-subjective sensemaking, mutually intertwined during an IS implementation, is required, and c)the change of mindset and double-loop learning can be achieved through the interplay of all sensemaking processes (intra, inter, generic-subjective and extra-subjective) in an IS implementation. This thesis puts to the test and demonstrates the value of the Sensemaking approach to the understanding of the relationship between IS implementation and organisational learning.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Strategic planning.</field><field name="subject">Management information systems</field><field name="subject">Learning</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44497</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling outcomes from orthokeratology</field><field name="creator">Yoon, Jeong Ho, Optometry &amp; Vision Science, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This research aimed to develop and validate a new method for calculating anterior and posterior corneal topography. The novel calculation method was then used to evaluate the influence of orthokeratology (OK) lens wear and overnight edema on posterior corneal shape, and to develop a physical model for anterior and posterior corneal shape changes during myopic overnight OK. The new method uses anterior corneal topographic data derived from the Medmont E300 corneal topographer, and total corneal thickness data measured along the horizontal corneal meridian using the Holden-Payor optical pachometer. The data are then entered into an Interactive Data Language computer program, which calculates the anterior and posterior corneal apical radii of curvature and Q (asphericity) based on the calculated anterior ellipsoid curve, the locations of corneal pachometry measurements, direction of thickness measurements, and the local radius of curvature. Pachometry data were optimised based on the local radius of anterior corneal curvature and an exact solution for the relationship between real and apparent thickness. The newly developed method was validated using a range of test surfaces and repeatability was also investigated with five adult subjects. Eighteen young adult subjects wore BE OK lenses overnight only in both eyes for 14 days. Ten young adult subjects participated as a control group, wearing J-Contour RGP lenses in one eye only for one night. OK subjects were assessed on days 1, 4, 7, and 14, and control group subjects on day 1, in the morning and evening. Subjective refraction, visual acuity, corneal topography and corneal thickness were measured. Most change in refractive error occurred within the first 7 nights of overnight OK. This rapid reduction in myopia was associated with improvement in unaided VA, and flattening of anterior corneal curvature. There were no changes in posterior corneal apical radius but an increase towards an oblate posterior corneal Q was found during 14 days of overnight OK, at both morning and evening measurements. Fixed anterior corneal points were determined at 8.13mm and 5.30mm chords at morning and evening measurements in the OK group. The points of maximum increase in anterior corneal elevation at evening and morning measurements were at 6.90mm and 7.00mm chords respectively. In the OK group, significant backwards movement of anterior and posterior corneal apices was found relative to the fixed anterior corneal points at the morning measurement. Backwards movement of the anterior corneal apex remained during the day whereas the posterior corneal apex recovered to baseline. In conclusion, our results support the theory that the OK refractive effect is achieved through remodelling of anterior corneal layers, without overall corneal bending. Central corneal thinning in the evening after overnight OK lens wear is primarily due to to posterior movement in space of the anterior corneal apex. The posterior direction of overnight corneal edema across the cornea in OK lens wear is consistent with previous models that predict that the cornea swells in a posterior direction during edema.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40944</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Frames in the flight deck: a sociological approach to situation awareness</field><field name="creator">Henderson, Simon Thornton, Aviation, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Situation Awareness (SA) is the aviation term for the construct describing how actors extract meaning and make sense of their dynamically changing environment. Within the aviation domain, it is broadly acknowledged that SA plays a crucial role for pilots in coping with hazardous situations and its loss is cited as a significant factor in aircraft accidents and incidents. A broad range of psychologically based theories has been applied to conceptualise SA. The aim of this research thesis is to develop an alternative, sociologically based approach, largely drawn from Erving Goffman??s (1974) Frame Analysis, and assess whether it can be used to effectively describe, analyse and discuss SA. An open observation method was used to collect data in the flight deck during ten commercial international flight sectors conducted in an advanced wide-body aircraft. A running narrative of flight activity and associated context was recorded from a purposeful sample of flights operated by consenting flight crews. Data was managed in the NVIVO?? qualitative software analysis program. Strips of activity associated with the establishment or maintenance of SA were identified and examined in accordance with key concepts derived from frame analysis. The results show that key concepts drawn from Goffman??s (1974) frame analysis are able to be applied to the coding and discussion of data. Several emergent themes describe distinct SA behaviours relating to frame establishment and maintenance. These behaviours include; frame confirming, questioning, seeking, setting, proposing, clearing, accepting, reviewing and anticipating. Some unique modifications are made to Goffman??s underlying concepts in order to address specific contextual issues emergent in flight deck operations. SA is supported as a meaningful construct in the aviation domain. This thesis establishes that Goffman??s (1974) general theory of frame analysis supports the major underlying concepts of the specific SA construct. Additionally, a method derived from frame analysis is used to examine and analyse the observed intersubjective SA processes. This analysis also develops several unique perspectives concerning flight crew task performance that have wide ranging implications in procedural design, training and airspace integration. Lastly, practitioner based notions of SA are shown to be equivalent to that of ??frame.??</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aviation</field><field name="subject">SA</field><field name="subject">Situation Awareness</field><field name="subject">Flight deck</field><field name="subject">Sociology</field><field name="subject">Goffman</field><field name="subject">Frame</field><field name="subject">Frame analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40907</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reduction and softening/melting behaviour of olivine pellet in the experimental blast furnace</field><field name="creator">Lee, Si Hyung, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">An in-depth study has been carried out on the reduction, softening and melting behavior of olivine based pellets in the experimental blast furnace. The aim of the project was to develop a fundamental understanding of the reduction mechanisms of olivine based pellets and to develop a correlation between the reduction rate and the softening behavior in the cohesive zone of blast furnace. The carburization characteristics of reduced iron were also investigated by examining olivine pellet and coke samples excavated and probed from an experimental blast furnace as well as the experimental investigations of pure hematite and heat treated coke. X-ray diffraction analysis was used to successfully determine the reduction degree of olivine pellets in different parts of the experimental blast furnace. These results were found to be consistent with assessments of reduction degree based on a detailed chemical analysis. The average reduction degree of iron oxide was seen to increase as the pellets descended towards lower zones of the EBF. Up to 75% reduction was completed before the pellet had reached the cohesive zone; remaining reduction was completed within the cohesive zone. Coke Lc showed a linear variation with experimental temperature above 11000C; a correlation was established to estimate furnace temperature as a function of EBF depth. The reduction degree of iron ore pellet showed a linear correlation with distance from the stock line of the EBF to the upper part of cohesive zone. But an abrupt increase in reduction rate was observed in the cohesive zone, a result observed in both EBF and experimental studies. The presence of olivine did not have much influence on the reduction degree of iron ore pellets for temperatures below 1100oC in the upper shaft zone of the EBF. However, olivine was found to increase the rate of reduction in the advanced stages of reduction in the cohesive zone for temperatures in excess of 1100oC. This effect was attributed to the formation of increased amount of molten iron oxide within the pellet. The initial melt formation and acceleration of the reduction rate in the cohesive zone of the EBF were also investigated. From the comparison between the reduction degree of excavated olivine pellets in this study and previous studies of EBF, it was found that the excavated pellets were located in the cohesive zone and increase of reduction rate in this zone could be verified by not only the change of gas composition, but also initial melt formation containing FeO phase. The chemical composition of slag phases of excavated pellet samples were located on the line between 2FeO??SiO2 and 2MgO??SiO2 in the FeO-MgO-SiO2 ternary phase diagram. This result is in good agreement with the assumption that the initial slag formation of the olivine pellets had proceeded from the fayalite and after reduction the FeO contents in the slag phase had decreased and eventually precipitated as slag with a higher melting point. From the analysis of carbon contents of the excavated pellets in cohesive zone, it was observed that the carburization of iron pellets began after the complete reduction. This study has established that the reduction rate of iron pellet is the rate controlling step for carburization irrespective of the carburization reaction by the solid carbon.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pellet</field><field name="subject">Reduction</field><field name="subject">Softening</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40939</field></doc><doc><field name="title">US foreign policy, the Arab-Israeli dispute and the ??Peace Process?? Mirage: Lausanne 1949 and Camp David 2000</field><field name="creator">Blomeley, Kristen Nicole, Social Sciences &amp; International Studies, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">The purpose of this thesis is to understand why the Arab-Israeli conflict has remained irreconcilable for sixty-one years.  While the details and forms of the conflict have changed over time, the central factors dividing Zionists and Arabs in the Middle East have altered little.  In this thesis I examine what these factors are and why they have been so effective in frustrating every peace effort. To understand the fundamental factors which keep the dispute alive I have conducted a comparative study of the two major peace initiatives which frame it diplomatically.  The first formal peace conference between Israel and her Arab adversaries took place in Lausanne in 1949.  The issues of borders, Jerusalem and refugees would not be seriously engaged with again until the last peace effort to date, the Camp David talks of 2000.  Through a detailed comparative analysis of both conferences I seek to understand the positions taken by the warring parties towards these issues and the broader motivating factors separating them and preventing them from achieving peace.  As the most important third party and supposed ??honest broker?? in both talks, I also closely examine the behaviour and policy of the US at each case. I find that the positions taken towards each issue by Israel, on the one hand, and the Arab party, on the other, were remarkably consistent in 1949 and 2000.  Israel was not fully committed to peace in either instance, while the Arabs twice refused to sign what amounted to documents of surrender.  These consistent positions starkly contrasted with that of the US, which completely changed its positions in ways which, by 2000, had almost wholly aligned it with Zionist demands. I conclude that future peace will rest on the ability of each party to re-examine its past in order to produce a spirit of reconciliation.  For Israel, this will mean honestly revisiting Zionism in order to confront what its triumph meant for the Palestinian inhabitants of the land.  The Arabs must also seek a broader understanding of their role in the dispute and demonstrate forcefully to Israelis that they seek peace rather than retribution.  Above all, if the US is to retain its role as mediator it must abandon its ??special relationship?? with Israel and return to a more genuinely?? even handed alignment with the broader international consensus on the dispute.  As it stands, the US??s more or less unconditional support of Israel has the effect of leading Israelis and Palestinians ever further from peace even as an ever more empty ??peace process?? is rhetorically trumpeted abroad.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Camp David</field><field name="subject">Middle East</field><field name="subject">Peace Process</field><field name="subject">Lausanne</field><field name="subject">United States</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44396</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A parameter optimisation tool for excitable cell mathematical models based on CellML</field><field name="creator">Hui, Ben Bunny Chun Bun, Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Mathematical models are often used to describe and, in some cases predict, excitable cellular behaviour that is based on observed experimental results. With the increase of computational power, it is now possible to solve such models in a relatively short time. This, along with an increasing knowledge of cellular and subcellular processes, has led to the development of a large number of complex cellular models, capable of describing a broad range of excitable cell behaviour. But the use of complex models can also lead to problems. Most models can accurately reproduce results associated with the data on which the models are based. However, results from complicated models, with large numbers of variables and parameters, are less reliable if the model is not placed under the same physiological conditions as defined by the model author. In order to test a model??s suitability and robustness over a range of physiological conditions, one needs to fit model parameters against experimental data observed under those conditions. By using the modelling standard and repository offered by CellML, model users can easily select and adapt a large number of models to set up their own applications to fit model parameters against user-supplied experimental data. However, currently there is a lack of software that can utilise CellML model for parameter fitting. In this thesis, a Java-based utility has been developed, capable of performing least square parameter optimisation for a wide range of CellML models. Using the developed software, a number of parameter fits and identifiability analyses were performed on a selected group of CellML models. It was found that most of the models were ill-formed, with larger numbers of parameters worsening model identifiability. In some cases, the usage of multiple datasets and different objective functions can improve model identifiability. Finally, the developed software was used to perform parameter optimisation against two sets of action potentials from a sinoatrial node experiment, in the absence and presence of E9031, a specific ion channel blocker.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">CellML</field><field name="subject">Parameter optimisation</field><field name="subject">Ionic model</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41447</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Culture, motivation, and vocational decision-making of senior high school students</field><field name="creator">Jung, Jae Yup, UNSW</field><field name="description">The purpose of this investigation was to examine the cultural and motivational perspectives associated with the occupational or vocational decision-related processes of senior high school students. Two theoretical frameworks were developed to guide the investigation by integrating theories from the culture, motivation, decision-making, and vocational decision-making literatures. One theoretical framework investigated the roles of culture and motivation in the vocational decisions made by senior high school students, while the other examined the vocational decision-related processes of senior high school students in terms of the extent to which they may be amotivated about choosing a future occupation. A mixed methods approach (incorporating a cross-sectional and correlational research design for the quantitative component) was implemented using a specially developed questionnaire. In the first phase of the investigation, the questionnaire was administered to 492 Year 11 students attending a stratified random sample of six Independent high schools located in the Sydney metropolitan area. In the second and main phase, a refined version of the questionnaire was administered to 566 Year 11 students attending a stratified random sample of 16 government high schools located in the Sydney metropolitan area. Structural equation modelling, discriminant analyses, and qualitative techniques were used to analyse the data collected in the two phases. The major findings of the investigation included the development and confirmation (after modifications) of two new theoretically-justifiable models of vocational decision-related processes. One model provided empirical support for relationships between cultural orientation, values, and attitudes/intentions toward occupations, while the other identified relationships between amotivation, indecision toward occupations, expectancy-value variables, and influences from the family. Multiple themes that were identified in the qualitative data analyses supplemented and partially supported elements of the two empirical models, and enabled a richer understanding of the issues surrounding the vocational decision. The findings of the investigation may be used by career advisors, psychologists, educators, and families to advise and assist senior high school students faced with the vocational decision. The investigation may contribute to reducing the gap in the literature on the roles of culture and motivation in the vocational decision-related processes of senior high school students.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Vocational decision-making</field><field name="subject">Culture</field><field name="subject">Motivation</field><field name="subject">Vocational indecision</field><field name="subject">High school students</field><field name="subject">Structural equation modeling</field><field name="subject">Discriminant analysis</field><field name="subject">Qualitative data analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41504</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Internal symmetry networks for image processing</field><field name="creator">Li, Guanzhong, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Internal Symmetry Networks are a recently developed class of Cellular Neural Network inspired by the phenomenon of internal symmetry in quantum physics.

PKA effects are regulated by protein phosphatases, which reverse the actions of PKA by dephosphorylation of PKA-substrates. Localization of specific PKA effects is mediated by the binding of A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs). Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is an important regulator of lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis, and represents a large proportion of total protein constitutively secreted from macrophages. The signalling and trafficking pathways regulating secretion of apoE are unknown. Catalase is a peroxisomal enzyme which contributes to defence against hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The primary hypothesis of this thesis is PKA and related protein phosphatase pathways are involved in the regulation of apoE secretion. The secondary hypothesis is that these pathways also regulate cellular clearance of H2O2. In Chapter Three, I have investigated the role of PKA in apoE secretion from primary human macrophages. Structurally distinct inhibitors of PKA (H89, KT5720, inhibitory peptide PKI14-22) all decreased basal secretion of apoE by between 50-80% whereas apoE mRNA or cellular protein are unaffected. Disruption of PKA-AKAP anchoring also significantly inhibited apoE secretion from human macrophages. Secretion of apoE was not immediately stimulated by PKA activity, suggesting that although PKA activity may be permissive for apoE secretion, it is in itself insufficient to stimulate apoE secretion above basal levels. Data from confocal microscopy and live cell imaging revealed PKA inhibition paralysed apoE vesicular movement from and to the plasma membrane. In Chapter Four, I investigated the effects of protein phosphatase 2B (PP2B) inhibition on apoE secretion by cyclosporin A (CsA). This was found to dose- and time-dependently inhibit secretion of apoE from primary human macrophages and increased cellular accumulation of apoE without affecting apoE mRNA levels. The role of PP2B in regulating apoE secretion was confirmed by using additional peptide and chemical inhibitors of PP2B. This effect was independent of the known inhibition of ABCA1 by CsA. Live cell imaging and confocal microscopy all demonstrated that inhibition of PP2B did not affect the apparent cellular distribution of apoE. Biochemical and microscopy studies indicated distinct mechanisms for PKA and PP2B regulation of apoE secretion. Chapter Five identified PKA-anchoring AKAPs in human macrophages, and investigated AKAP220 expression and its role in PKA-dependent processes relevant to atherosclerosis. AKAP220 protein was absent in human monocytes but was detectable after their differentiation into macrophages, with stable expression during late stages of maturation. It was also present in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells (CHO) cells. AKAP220 silencing had no effects on lipoprotein cholesteryl ester accumulation, total cellular apoE levels, apoE secretion or cholesterol efflux from human macrophages. Confocal microscopy in CHO cells revealed peroxisomal localisation of AKAP220. Catalase activity was confirmed to be PKA-regulated process, and AKAP220 was found to be a negative regulator of catalase activity, such that cell lysate catalase activity increased during AKAP220 silencing. AKAP220 silencing also decreased basal secretion of H2O2, detected using a sensitive and specific Amplex?? Red assay kit from intact CHO monolayers.   In conclusion, this thesis has provided evidence that apoE secretion occurs via PKA- and PP2B-dependent pathways in human macrophages, and has identified the A-kinase anchoring protein AKAP220 as a regulator of cellular H2O2 clearance. These results will provide a basis for future investigations into the roles of PKA-related pathways in apoE secretion and catalase activity.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Protein phosphatase 2B (PP2B)</field><field name="subject">Apolipoprotein E (apoE)</field><field name="subject">Protein kinase A (PKA)</field><field name="subject">A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAP)</field><field name="subject">Catalase activity</field><field name="subject">Macrophages</field><field name="subject">Atherosclerosis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41512</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Defendants, mental illness and negligence law: a critique</field><field name="creator">Bromberger, Nikki, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">At common law, liability in negligence is based generally on an objective standard of reasonable care. As a consequence of this idea those who possess reduced capacities, as compared to the ordinary reasonable person, may be held to standards which they are incapable of reaching. Yet there are exceptions to this general rule. Children are not required to behave the way reasonable adults behave. Rather, when the defendant is a child, courts take into account the capabilities which are a concomitant of the defendant???s age. A defendant???s mental illness, on the other hand, is not considered by courts in Australia (or elsewhere) to be relevant when determining liability in negligence. It has been argued that in this regard the common law is incoherent and unfair. This thesis considers whether these claims of incoherence and unfairness can be substantiated. In so doing, it considers the philosophical underpinnings of tort law in order to explore possible bases for the current law. It also examines a number of more specific accounts which attempt to justify the present law as it relates to mental illness. It is argued that none of these discussions provide a convincing basis for the different treatment in law between child defendants and defendants with a mental illness. The discussion extends beyond the confines of tort law to criminal law for explanations for the apparent incoherence. It notes the suggestion that the criminal law???s response to defendants with a mental illness has been fuelled to some extent by a misunderstanding of mental illness and a fear of those suffering from such illnesses. The thesis examines whether this negative attitude towards mental illness, which some scholars have referred to as ???sanism???, is at work in the few Australian decisions which have considered the common law position in relation to mentally ill defendants. Possible changes to this area of law are then outlined and considered.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41550</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The rise of China and its impact on Australia's relations with the United States</field><field name="creator">Shen, Yi, Social Sciences &amp; International Studies, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Despite Australia enjoying good relations with both the United States and China at the moment, the long-term prospects are uncertain due to US-China strategic rivalry.

The strategic competition only increases the prospect of conflict; it does not mean a US-China conflict is bound to happen. Although the risks of a US-China military confrontation over Taiwan are real, the chances are small due to America&#146;s continued strategic presence in the region and its military preponderance. If a Sino-US conflict were to occur, Australia would most likely side with the US despite China being economically significant to Australia.

The Indonesian Government is interested in means by which the safety of these vessels can be improved, and this was the main catalyst for commencing research in this area. Any solution should be capable of being retrofitted to both existing vessels and new designs to improve their stability and, hence, their safety. The research therefore focused on the intact stability of the bare hulls, and with addition of side casings, for the vessels for which data was made available by the Indonesian Government.  The research covered both quasi-static analysis, based on the objective of meeting the IMO intact stability criteria, and a dynamic approach using time-domain simulation in regular beam waves. A parametric study of the stability parameters of the twenty vessels demonstrated that, without the presence of side casings, the vessels had difficulties in complying with the IMO intact stability criteria. The problems were solved by introducing side casings (watertight spaces above the vehicle deck) either inboard of the vessel&#146;s side-shell plating, or partially inboard and partially outboard of the side shell. The minimum extent (breadth) of side casings required was determined by iteration on each of the twenty vessels, incorporating variations in the height of the centre of gravity and loading conditions. The implementation of the minimum side casings showed that each vessel then met the IMO intact stability criteria.  However, the assessment of the vessels&#146; dynamic stability characteristics using time-domain simulation provided inconsistent results for these vessels with side casings which met the IMO intact stability criteria. For some particular conditions, the existence and the different forms of side casings could decrease vessel survivability by increasing the roll motion amplitudes for both inside and outside casings and could lead the vessel to capsize. The results of the dynamic stability analysis also confirmed the vulnerability of small vessels with small stability parameters to large waves, and the different roll seakeeping behavior of the different vessel stability parameters.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Side casings</field><field name="subject">Roll-on/roll-off passenger ferries</field><field name="subject">Ropax</field><field name="subject">Ship stability</field><field name="subject">Time domain simulation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44412</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Musical instrument sound source separation</field><field name="creator">Gunawan, David Oon Tao, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The structured arrangement of sounds in musical pieces, results in the unique creation of complex acoustic mixtures. The analysis of these mixtures, with the objective of estimating the individual sounds which constitute them, is known as musical instrument sound source separation, and has applications in audio coding, audio restoration, music production, music information retrieval and music education.  This thesis principally addresses the issues related to the separation of harmonic musical instrument sound sources in single-channel mixtures. The contributions presented in this work include novel separation methods which exploit the characteristic structure and inherent correlations of pitched sound sources; as well as an exploration of the musical timbre space, for the development of an objective distortion metric to evaluate the perceptual quality of separated sources.  The separation methods presented in this work address the concordant nature of musical mixtures using a model-based paradigm. Model parameters are estimated for each source, beginning with a novel, computationally efficient algorithm for the refinement of frequency estimates of the detected harmonics. Harmonic tracks are formed, and overlapping components are resolved by exploiting spectro-temporal intra-instrument dependencies, integrating the spectral and temporal approaches which are currently employed in a mutually exclusive manner in existing systems. Subsequent to the harmonic magnitude extraction using this method, a unique, closed-loop approach to source synthesis is presented, separating sources by iteratively minimizing the aggregate error of the sources, constraining the minimization to a set of estimated parameters. The proposed methods are evaluated independently, and then are placed within the context of a source separation system, which is evaluated using objective and subjective measures.  The evaluation of music source separation systems is presently limited by the simplicity of objective measures, and the extensive effort required to conduct subjective evaluations. To contribute to the development of perceptually relevant evaluations, three psychoacoustic experiments are also presented, exploring the perceptual sensitivity of timbre for the development of an objective distortion metric for timbre. The experiments investigate spectral envelope sensitivity, spectral envelope morphing and noise sensitivity.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sinusoidal estimation</field><field name="subject">Source separation</field><field name="subject">Music</field><field name="subject">Instrument modelling</field><field name="subject">Phase estimation</field><field name="subject">Psychoacoustic</field><field name="subject">Timbre</field><field name="subject">Spectral envelope</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41751</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Scalable resilient overlay networks</field><field name="creator">Qazi, Sameer Hashmat, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The Internet has scaled massively over the past 15 years to extend to billions of users. These users increasingly require extensive applications and capabilities from the Internet, such as Quality of Service (QoS) optimized paths between end hosts. When default Internet paths may not meet their requirements adequately, there is a need to facilitate the discovery of such QoS optimized paths. Fortunately, even though the route offered by the Internet may not work (to the required level of performance), often there exist alternate routes that do work.  When the direct Internet path between two Internet hosts for instance is sub-optimal (according to specific user defined criterion), there is a possibility that the direct paths of both to a third host may not be suffering from the same problem owing to path disjointness. Overlay Networks facilitate the discovery of such composite alternate paths through third party hosts. To discover such alternate paths, overlay hosts regularly monitor both Internet path quality and choose better alternate paths via other hosts. Such measurements are costly and pose scalability problems for large overlay networks. This thesis asserts and shows that these overheads could be lowered substantially if the network layer path information between overlay hosts could be obtained, which facilitates selection of disjoint paths. This thesis further demonstrates that obtaining such network layer path information is very challenging. As opposed to the path monitoring which only requires cooperation of overlay hosts, disjoint path selection depends on the accuracy of information about the underlay, which is out of the domain of control of the overlay and so may contain inaccuracies. This thesis investigates how such information could be gleaned at different granularities for optimal tradeoffs between spatial and/or temporal methods for selection of alternate paths.  The main contributions of this thesis are: (i) investigation of scalable techniques to facilitate alternate path computation using network layer path information; (ii) a review of the realistic performance gains achievable using such alternate paths; and (iii) investigation of techniques for revealing the presence of incorrect network layer path information, proposal of new techniques for its removal.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Peer to Peer Systems</field><field name="subject">Quality of Service in the Internet</field><field name="subject">Resilient Overlay Networks</field><field name="subject">Service Oriented Networks</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44536</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of copper-alumina composites for abrasive wear applications</field><field name="creator">Toth-Antal, Bence, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Copper-alumina composites were developed for testing in abrasive wear applications. The composites featured a porous continuous ceramic-preform network infiltrated by a liquid metal to form the final consolidated composite. The liquid metal phase was pure copper.  Six different ceramic preform variants were tested. Ceramic volume fractions of 40, 50 and 60% were used, of two preform types; one pure-alumina, and one with additional 2wt% copper(I) oxide (CU20), functioning as an infiltration aid, the effects of which were determined in a previous study; the copper-oxide reduced infiltration pressure and allowed the use of higher ceramic phase volume fraction in the final composite.  Abrasive wear tests against two automotive braking system materials were conducted. Grey cast iron of alloy type GG15 was used to establish a baseline for behaviour of the six different composite samples and compare them. Following this, the three volume fraction variants of samples using the copper-oxide infiltration aid were trialled against a commercially-available European passenger vehicle brake pad friction material; ABEX 6091.  Wear tests were conducted on a pin-on-disc tribometer. Hemispherical-headed pins were made from the composite and tested against rotating discs of the grey cast iron and the ABEX friction material. Contact velocity was kept constant at Ims-?? at room temperature in air, and contact loads up to 15N were used. Test loads of 1-4N were used against grey cast iron, and 15N against the ABEX friction material.  Optical micrography was used to monitor the wear rate of samples tested against grey cast iron. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to characterise bulk microstructures and evaluate surface wear features. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used for further microstructural investigation of the sintering and interfacial features of the undamaged pin samples, as well as damage zones and tribofilm compositions. Focussed ion beam (FIB) milling was used to create subsurface cross-sections of wear regions and prepare TEM samples.  The wear performance of the different sample types was compared by ceramic content and preform additives. It was found that the wear resistance of pure-alumina preform composites was dependent on ceramic volume fraction. Increasing ceramic content lead to increased wear resistance. The lower sinter temperature of the samples with the copper oxide additive led to reduced wear resistance compared with the monolithic alumina preforms and changes in ceramic volume fractions were not discernable in wear resistance against grey cast iron. This could be further supported by qualitative micrographic observations. All tests against grey cast iron were dominated by tribochemical film formation, which was determined to be oxidation of the iron which formed at the composite pin contact surface.  Further testing of the copper-oxide containing samples against the ABEX friction material revealed a mixed result; the 50 and 60% ceramic volume samples produced near-identical wear performance, while the 40% sample suffered poor wear resistance. The dominant wear mechanism of composite pins tested against the ABEX friction material was abrasive wear. Sub-surface analysis of wear pins revealed a prominent damage layer forming at the contact surface of all pin samples which progressively grew into the bulk material. This layer was believed to have an important effect on the wear behaviour of the materials.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)</field><field name="subject">Copper-alumina composites.</field><field name="subject">Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44504</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Customization of floating-point units for embedded systems and field programmable gate arrays</field><field name="creator">Chong, Michael Yee Jern, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">While Application Specific Instruction Set Processors (ASIPs) have allowed designers to  create processors with custom instructions to target specific applications, floating-point units (FPUs) are still instantiated as non-customizable general-purpose units, which if under utilized, wastes area and performance.  However, customizing FPUs manually is a complex and time-consuming process. Therefore, there is a need for an automated custom FPU generation scheme.  This thesis presents a methodology for generating application-specific FPUs  customized at the instruction level, with integrated datapath merging to minimize area.  The methodology reduces the subset of floating-point instructions implemented to the minimum required for the application.  Datapath merging is then performed on the required datapaths to minimize area.  Previous datapath merging techniques failed to consider merging components of different bit-widths and thus ignore the bit-alignment problem in datapath merging.  This thesis presents a novel bit-alignment solution during datapath merging.  In creating the custom FPU, the subset of floating-point instructions that should be implemented in hardware has to be determined.  Implementing more instructions in hardware reduces the cycle count of the application, but may lead to increased delay due to multiplexers inserted on the critical path during datapath merging.  A rapid design space exploration was performed to explore the trade-offs.  By performing this exploration, a designer could determine the number of instructions that should be implemented as a custom FPU and the number that should be left for software emulation, such that performance and area meets the designer's requirements.  Customized FPUs were generated for different Mediabench applications and compared to a fully-featured reference FPU that implemented all floating-point operations.  Reducing the floating-point instruction set reduced the FPU area by an average of 55%.  Performing instruction reduction and then datapath merging reduced the FPU area by an average of 68%.  Experiments showed that datapath merging without bit-alignment achieved an average area reduction of 10.1%.  With bit-alignment, an average of 16.5% was achieved.  Bit-alignment proved most beneficial when there was a diverse mix of different bit-widths in the datapaths.  Performance of Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) used for floating-point applications is poor due to the complexity of floating-point arithmetic. Implementing floating-point units on FPGAs consume a large amount of resources. Therefore, there is a need for embedded FPUs in FPGAs.  However, if unutilized, they waste area on the FPGA die.  To overcome this issue, a novel flexible multi-mode embedded FPU for FPGAs is presented in this thesis that can be configured to perform a wide range of operations.  The floating-point adder and multiplier in the embedded FPU can each be configured to perform one double-precision operation or two single-precision operations in parallel.  To increase flexibility further, access to the large integer multiplier, adder and shifters in the FPU is provided.  It is also capable of floating-point and integer multiply-add operations.  Benchmark circuits were implemented on both a standard Xilinx Virtex-II FPGA and on the FPGA with embedded FPU blocks.  The implementations on the FPGA with embedded FPUs showed mean area and delay improvements of 5.2x and 5.8x respectively for the double-precision benchmarks, and 4.4x and 4.2x for the single-precision benchmarks.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">embedded systems</field><field name="subject">floating-point</field><field name="subject">FPGA</field><field name="subject">FPU</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44399</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The disutility of assessing trust beneficiaries on income derived by trustees: a critique of the existing regime whereunder beneficiaries are taxed on trust income before they receive it</field><field name="creator">Rankine, Campbell, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">The Australian tax policy of assessing trusts and their beneficiaries has been buffeted by changes that have occurred over the last 10 years or so, chiefly in the rules that equity has adopted and applied in its restatement of the rights and interests that a beneficiary has in a trust.  Broadly, the scheme of div 6 of Part III of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 ?? the general provisions for assessing trustees and beneficiaries ?? has remained largely unaltered, its machinery has now become ill-suited to equity??s new jurisprudence concerning beneficiaries' interests in trusts. This thesis examines the rules that seek to identify in a beneficiary an interest that she or he has in a trust??s subject matter, and it questions whether the tax legislation is still adequate to work its policies in the light of changes in the rules of equity.  Most pressing amongst them is the concept of present entitlement to income as a criterion for assessing beneficiaries of trusts on incomes derived by their trustees ?? at least before the income is physically paid or dealt with by the trustees so that there is some actual or constructive receipt by the beneficiary of that income. In addition to this, the thesis points to other difficulties that have arisen ?? largely because of changing jurisprudence ?? that portend the unworkability of the current tax policy.  The proposition is that the only way to correct the present and forthcoming problems, and the tensions they will cause in the Australian tax system, is to abandon the conventional policy of seeking primarily to assess a beneficiary on a mere present entitlement, and instead to assess tax on physical distributions.  Under this proposition, a beneficiary will no longer be assessed on anticipated distributions: she or he will now be assessed only on those distributions that are actually made thereto.  Naturally enough, a number of other trust assessing issues are affected by the proposal, and the changes to them ?? largely in a way that makes them simpler ?? are proposed and submitted.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Entity Tax</field><field name="subject">Trust Income</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44522</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pattern-based data and application integration in service oriented architectures</field><field name="creator">Kongdenfha, Woralak, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The success of Web services comes from the benefits that it brings in reducing the cost and the time needed to develop data and applications by reusing them, and simplifying their integrations through standardization. However, standardization in Web services does not remove the need for adapters due to possible heterogeneity among service interface and protocol definitions. Moreover, the current service APIs are targeted toward professional programmers, but not accessible to a wider class of users without programming expertise, but would never the less like to build their own integrated applications. In this dissertation, we propose methods and tools to support both service developers and non-expert users in their data and application integration tasks. To support service developers, we propose a framework that enables rapid development of Web service adapters. We investigate particularly the problem of service adaptation focusing on business interface and protocol layers. Our study shows that many differences between business interfaces and protocols are recurring. We introduce mismatch patterns to capture these recurring differences and provide solutions to resolve them. We present the notion of adaptation aspects, which is based on the aspect-oriented programming paradigm, to enable rapid development and deployment of service adapters. We also present a comparative study between standalone and aspect-oriented adapters development. The study shows that the aspect-oriented approach is preferable in many cases, especially when adapters need to access internal states of services. The proposed approach is implemented in a prototype tool, which is used to illustrate how it simplifies adapters development through a case study. To support users without programming expertise, we propose a spreadsheet-based Web mashups development framework, which enables users to develop mashups in the popular spreadsheet environment. First, we provide a mechanism that makes structured data first class values of spreadsheet cells. Second, we propose a new component model that can be used to develop fairly sophisticated mashups, involving joining data sources and keeping spreadsheet data up to date. Third, to simplify mashup development, we provide a collection of spreadsheet-based mashup patterns that captures common Web data access and spreadsheet presentation functionalities. Users can reuse and customize these patterns to build spreadsheet-based Web mashups instead of developing them from scratch. Fourth, we enable users to manipulate structured data presented on spreadsheet in a drag-and-drop fashion. Finally, we have developed and tested a prototype tool to demonstrate the utility of the proposed framework.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Web data mashups</field><field name="subject">Service Oriented Computing</field><field name="subject">Web services integration</field><field name="subject">Web services adaptation</field><field name="subject">Aspect-oriented programming</field><field name="subject">Mismatch patterns</field><field name="subject">Spreadsheets</field><field name="subject">Component model</field><field name="subject">Spreadsheet-based Web mashups Patterns</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42600</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Implied volatility: general properties and asymptotics</field><field name="creator">Roper, Michael Paul Veran, Mathematics &amp; Statistics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates implied volatility in general classes of stock price models. To begin with, we take a very general view. We find that implied volatility is always, everywhere, and for every expiry well-defined only if the stock price is a non-negative martingale. We also derive sufficient and close to necessary conditions for an implied volatility surface to be free from static arbitrage. In this context, free from static arbitrage means that the call price surface generated by the implied volatility surface is free from static arbitrage. We also investigate the small time to expiry behaviour of implied volatility. We do this in almost complete generality, assuming only that the call price surface is non-decreasing and right continuous in time to expiry and that the call surface satisfies the no-arbitrage bounds (S-K)+&#8804; C(K, &#964;)&#8804; S. We used S to denote the current stock price, K to be a option strike price, &#964; denotes time to expiry, and C(K, &#964;) the price of the K strike option expiring in &#964; time units. Under these weak assumptions, we obtain exact asymptotic formulae relating the call price surface and the implied volatility surface close to expiry. We apply our general asymptotic formulae to determining the small time to expiry behaviour of implied volatility in a variety of models. We consider exponential L??vy models, obtaining new and somewhat surprising results. We then investigate the behaviour close to expiry of stochastic volatility models in the at-the-money case. Our results generalise what is already known and by a novel method of proof. In the not at-the-money case, we consider local volatility models using classical results of Varadhan. In obtaining the asymptotics for local volatility models, we use a representation of the European call as an integral over time to expiry. We devote an entire chapter to representations of the European call option; a key role is played by local time and the argument of Klebaner. A novel alternative that is especially useful in the local volatility case is also presented.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Small expiry asymptotics</field><field name="subject">Mathematical Finance</field><field name="subject">Implied Volatility</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44519</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Oligomeric Abeta, inflammation and tau in Alzheimer's Disease</field><field name="creator">Warden, Lolita Airlie, Clinical School - Prince of Wales Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Alzheimer??s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia affecting the elderly. Extracellular deposition of beta amyloid (Abeta plaques), intraneuronal tau accumulation, inflammation (activated astrocytes and microglia), and neuronal loss are all consistent pathological features of the disease. Unlike Abeta plaques, inflammation correlates with neuronal loss and cognitive decline in AD, suggesting it plays an important role in disease progression. Recent research has also identified soluble oligomeric Abeta species in the AD brain, which correlate with disease progression and are proposed to be more neurotoxic than their fibrillar counterpart. The main aims of this thesis were to determine whether oligomeric Abeta is a more powerful stimulator of the inflammatory response compared to fibrillar forms of the protein, to identify potential mediators of this response and to determine downstream neuronal changes. Isolated human primary astrocytic, microglial and neuronal cell cultures were used to assess which Abeta alloform and conformation was more neurotoxic and neuroinflammatory. A total of 17 inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were measured simultaneously using a Multiplex approach and neurotoxicity was assessed by lactate dehydrogenase release. Cell cultures involving all three cell types were also used to examine these inflammatory mediators in a more complex system, and direct changes in tau levels and/or phosphorylation determined by western immunoblotting. Further immunohistochemical analysis determined the localisation of oligomeric Abeta within post-mortem human AD brain tissue.  The data clearly shows that oligomeric Abeta was more neurotoxic and neuroinflammatory than fibrillar Abeta, with oligomeric Abeta40 favoured in toxic plaque deposits in AD brain tissue. Cell culture experiments showed that glia clearly mediate neuroprotection against oligomeric Abeta. Soluble TNF-alpha, IL-2, IL-4 and IL-12 mediate this response early in disease, with a decline in their secretion and a sustained increase in IL-1alpha, IFN-gamma, GM-CSF,  MIP-1beta, and IL-8 provoking increased tau protein expression. Overall, the data clearly demonstrates oligomeric Abeta more powerfully stimulates a suite of inflammatory mediators affecting neuronal survival and tau pathology, although the contribution of additional glial-derived factors must also be determined. The identification of these inflammatory mediators, in combination with other potential factors, may lead to the development of mechanistic therapeutic interventions that could target these early pathological changes.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">amyloid</field><field name="subject">inflammation</field><field name="subject">Alzheimer's Disease</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42741</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structural and acoustic responses of a submerged vessel</field><field name="creator">Caresta, Mauro, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Excitation of the low frequency vibrational modes of a submerged vessel can generate significant radiated noise levels. Vibrational modes of a submarine hull are excited from the transmission of fluctuating forces through the shaft and thrust bearings due to the propeller rotating in an unsteady fluid. The focus of this work is to investigate the structural and acoustic responses of a submarine hull under axial excitation. The submarine hull is modelled as a cylindrical shell with internal bulkheads and ring stiffeners. The cylindrical shell is closed by truncated conical shells, which in turn are closed at each end using circular plates. The entire structure is submerged in a heavy fluid medium. The structural responses of the submerged vessel are calculated by solving the cylindrical shell equations of motion using a wave approach and the conical shell equations with a power series solution. The displacement normal to the surface of the structure in contact with the fluid medium was calculated by assembling the boundary/continuity matrix. The far field radiated sound pressure was then calculated by means of the Helmholtz integral. Results from the analytical model are compared with computational results from a fully coupled finite element/boundary element model. The individual and combined effects of the various influencing factors, corresponding to the ring stiffeners, bulkheads, conical end closures and fluid loading, on the structural and acoustic responses are characterised by examining the contribution by the circumferential modes. It is shown that equally spaced internal bulkheads generate a periodic structure thus creating a grouping effect for the higher circumferential modes, but do not have strong influence on the sound radiation. Stiffeners are found to have an important effect on both the dynamic and acoustic responses of the hull. The contribution of the conical end closures on the radiated sound pressure for the lowest circumferential mode numbers is also clearly observed. This work shows the importance of the bending modes when evaluating the sound pressure radiated by a submarine under harmonic excitation from the propulsion system.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Shells</field><field name="subject">Submarine</field><field name="subject">Vibrations</field><field name="subject">Fluid-structure interaction</field><field name="subject">Conical shell</field><field name="subject">Cylindrical shell</field><field name="subject">Coupled shells</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44404</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Artificial vision: feasibility of an episcleral retinal prosthesis &amp; implications of neuroplasticity</field><field name="creator">Siu, Timothy Lok Tin, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Background. A visual prosthesis is a conceptual device designed to activate residual functional neurons in the visual pathway of blind individuals to produce artificial vision. Such device, when applied to stimulate the vitreous surface of the retina, has proven feasible in producing patterned light perception in blind individuals suffering from dystrophic diseases of the retina, such as aged-related macular degeneration (AMD). However the practicality of such approach has been challenged by the difficulty of surgical access and the risks of damaging the neuroretina. Positioning a visual implant over the scleral surface of the eye could present a safer alternative but this stimulation modality has not been tested in diseased retinas. Additionally, recent research has shown that the adult neocortex retains substantial plasticity following a disruption to its visual input and the potential deterioration in visual capabilities as a result of such experience modification may undermine the overall bionic rescue strategy. Methods. Two animal models mimicking the principal pathologies found in AMD, namely photoreceptor degeneration and reduced retinal ganglion cell mass, were used to evaluate the efficacy of trans-scleral stimulation of the retina by recording electrical evoked potentials in the visual cortex. The visual performance following the loss of pattern vision induced by bilateral eyelid suturing in adult mice was examined by analysing visual evoked potentials. Findings. Spatially differentiated cortical activations were obtained notwithstanding the underlying retinopathy in the experiment animals. The charge density thresholds were found to be similar to controls and below the bioelectric safety limit. After prolonged visual deprivation (weeks) in the mouse, the visual cortical responses evoked by either electrical or photic stimuli were both significantly reduced. An assessment of different visual capabilities using patterned stimuli demonstrated that whilst visual acuity and motion sensitivity were preserved, significant depression in luminance and contrast sensitivities was detected. Conclusion. Trans-scleral stimulation of the retina is a feasible approach for the development of a visual prosthesis. Following visual loss the adult brain exhibits significant experience-dependent modifications. These new insights may force a revision on the current bionic rescue strategy.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Evoked potential</field><field name="subject">Visual prosthesis</field><field name="subject">Neural plasticity</field><field name="subject">Visual deprivation</field><field name="subject">Rabbit</field><field name="subject">Mouse</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42879</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Proteolytic enzymes in grass pollen and their relationship to allergenic proteins</field><field name="creator">Saldanha, Rohit Gregory, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Pollen grains are ubiquitous triggers of allergic asthma and seasonal rhinitis. Proteolytic enzymes in pollen as well as other sources are capable of disrupting airway epithelial integrity in vivo and in vitro. This provides a plausible mechanism for the initiation of sensitisation of the respiratory immune system to inhaled pollen allergens, comparable to that suggested for Group 1 allergens from house dust mites and cat dander, which are known to possess intrinsic proteolytic activity. This thesis explores the relationship between pollen allergens and proteolytic enzymes. It describes the different strategies used for the characterisation, purification and identification of immunogenic and proteolytic proteins in the complex mixtures of pollen diffusates. The peptidases in the diffusates of Kentucky blue grass, ryegrass and Bermuda grass pollens were characterised by a sensitive fluorescence assay and gelatin zymography. Among these, Bermuda grass pollen demonstrated the presence of a serine peptidase at Mr ~30,000 Da, which corresponded to an intense band by Western blotting using a monoclonal antibody to the timothy grass (Phleum pratense) group 1 allergen, Phl p 1. Purification of this enzyme from Bermuda grass was complicated by the low levels of the enzyme present in the diffusate, as well as by its autohydrolysis. Partial purification of the serine peptidase activity by affinity chromatography using Concanavalin A Sepharose demonstrated that the diffusate contained a trypsin-like peptidase, detected by the fluorescent assay, in addition to the ~30,000 Da serine endopeptidase, detected on gelatin zymography. Proteomic analysis of the ~30,000 Da protein using one- and two-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrometry identified it as the major pollen allergen of Bermuda grass, Cyn d 1. The studies reported here provide, for the first time, evidence that a pollen allergen may possess intrinsic proteolytic activity. This activity may play a role in the initiation of airway inflammation and allergic sensitisation.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Proteolytic enzymes</field><field name="subject">Allergens</field><field name="subject">Pollen.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20824</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Combat modelling with partial differential equations</field><field name="creator">Keane, Therese Alison, Mathematics &amp; Statistics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">In Part I of this thesis we extend the Lanchester Ordinary Differential Equations and construct a new physically meaningful set of partial differential equations with the aim of more realistically representing soldier dynamics in order to enable a deeper understanding of the nature of conflict. Spatial force movement and troop interaction components are represented with both local and non-local terms, using techniques developed in biological aggregation modelling. A highly accurate flux limiter numerical method ensuring positivity and mass conservation is used, addressing the difficulties of inadequate methods used in previous research. We are able to reproduce crucial behaviour such as the emergence of cohesive density profiles and troop regrouping after suffering losses in both one and two dimensions which has not been previously achieved in continuous combat modelling. In Part II, we reproduce for the first time apparently complex cellular automaton behaviour with simple partial differential equations, providing an alternate mechanism through which to analyse this behaviour. Our PDE model easily explains behaviour observed in selected scenarios of the cellular automaton wargame ISAAC without resorting to anthropomorphisation of autonomous 'agents'. The insinuation that agents have a reasoning and planning ability is replaced with a deterministic numerical approximation which encapsulates basic motivational factors and demonstrates a variety of spatial behaviours approximating the mean behaviour of the ISAAC scenarios. All scenarios presented here highlight the dangers associated with attributing intelligent reasoning to behaviour shown, when this can be explained quite simply through the effects of the terms in our equations. A continuum of forces is able to behave in a manner similar to a collection of individual autonomous agents, and shows decentralised self-organisation and adaptation of tactics to suit a variety of combat situations. We illustrate the ability of our model to incorporate new tactics through the example of introducing a density tactic, and suggest areas for further research.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lanchester</field><field name="subject">Partial differential equation</field><field name="subject">Combat</field><field name="subject">Numerical methods</field><field name="subject">Modelling</field><field name="subject">Predator-prey</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43086</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Legal and professional challenges confronting practising lawyers in contemporary Vietnam</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Thi Minh, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">The policy of developing a market economy and of international integration as well as the major impetus to seek to build a law-based state and engage in judicial reform, are bringing practising lawyers (luat su) in Vietnam more opportunities than ever before, and the role of luat su is much improved. Given the importance of luat su in the period of transformation, attention should be paid to the enormous challenges encountered by them, as they are affected by a number of issues involving cultural, social, and legal aspects. This thesis tries to identify the professional and legal challenges that luat su face which directly and specifically affect their role: notably widespread devaluing of the potential and role of law, and the role of luat su in society, the inappropriate attitude of some government officials towards practising lawyers, the inadequacy of many lawyers' qualifications, the inferior position of luat su in the judicial system, the use of 'connections' (quan he) as a substitute for legal services, and especially substantial degree of inconsistencies, overlapping, uncertainty and unpredictability of the legal system, which prevent luat su from being able to render useful and practical advice. There is a causal relation between those issues and the marginal role of practising lawyers in contemporary Vietnam.  This study also uses comparisons to draw experiences from other countries to see whether their experience can be made use of in Vietnam, The thesis makes a number of recommendations and concludes that in order to overcome difficulties and to improve the role of lawyers it is critical to create a good infrastructure for lawyers, including ensuring a closer approach to the rule of law in practice, Lawyers do not live and function in their own isolated world, but closely relate to the operation of other organs administering law and exercising justice. It is therefore concluded that the degree of improvement in the legal profession largely depends not only on the reform of the legal profession itself, but also on the success or failure of the current judicial and legal reforms.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Practising lawyers in Vietnam.</field><field name="subject">Lawyers (luat su)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44503</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tributaries: public art, connecting &amp; reflecting people and place</field><field name="creator">Martini, Nerine Yvette, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">Tributaries are geographic fingers of water moving across the landscape making connections with a main water source. As a title for my Master of Fine Arts research paper this metaphorically refers to the political, social and cultural streams which are expressed through my public artworks. It is also a poetic play on notions of paying tribute.  This research examines the process of collaboration and cross-cultural arts practice and the relationship between a public artwork, the site and the audience. Four diverse yet interrelated public art projects are presented for my Master of Fine Arts degree. This research investigates the conceptual links between the four projects and the current discourse of cross-cultural collaborations. Although my art practice varies in location, materials, forms and approach, generally it is focussed around sculpture and installation and includes temporary and permanent public artworks. Two of the projects discussed took place in the Blue Mountains, west of Sydney, the other two took place in Vietnam.  This research discusses the advantages, disadvantages and challenges in choosing to work collaboratively and questions the relationship of the author to the work and the importance of the process in creating an artwork. It also explores notions of hierarchy and power relationships that occur between artists from within the same culture and between artists from different cultures.   Exploring the connections between public art and specific communities/sites has expanded my research into related notions of homes, homelessness and displacement. My approach to public sculpture is deliberately anti-monumental. This takes into account the relationship of scale within a public artwork: including the relationship of the work to the human body and to the surrounding environment I examine how contemporary public art can serve as a form of tribute to historic events and people of the past. My poetic approach to creating public art differs from more conventional monuments and statues of tribute and can be considered as a non-linear approach to presenting history. While the events these artworks refer to have taken place in the past, the issues surrounding them continue to have relevance to political situations of today.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Public art</field><field name="subject">Community</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44425</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physiological and molecular responses of the marine oligotrophic ultramicrobacterium Sphingopyxis Alaskensis rb2256 to visible light and ultraviolet radiation</field><field name="creator">Matallana Surget, Sabine-Astrid, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Ultraviolet radiation reaching the Earth&#146;s surface (UVR, 280-400 nm) may penetrate deep into the clear oligotrophic waters influencing a large part of the euphotic layer. Marine heterotrophic bacteria at the surface of the oceans are especially sensitive to the damaging solar radiation due to their haploid genome with little or no functional redundancy and lack of protective pigmentation. In a context of climate change and ozone depletion, it is clearly important to understand the physiology and underlying molecular UVR responses of abundant marine bacteria species. We chose the marine ultramicrobacterium Sphingopyxis alaskensis as a reference species to study the impact of solar radiation due to its numerical abundance in oligotrophic waters and its photoresistance, previously reported. For this purpose, we focused on the formation of the two major UVB-induced DNA photoproducts (CPDs and 6-4PPs) as well as the differential protein expression under solar radiation.  We first demonstrated that the GC content of prokaryotic genome had a major effect on the formation of UVB-induced photoproducts, quantified by HPLC-MS/MS. Due to its high GC content, S. alaskensis presented a favoured formation of highly mutagenic cytosine-containing photoproducts and therefore would be more susceptible to UVinduced mutagenesis. By comparing S. alaskensis to another marine bacterium Photobacterium angustum, we observed for the latter strain a remarkable resistance to high UVB doses associated with a decrease in the rate of formation of CPDs explained by a non-conventional activity of photolyase. We also demonstrated that DNA damage in S. alaskensis was markedly modulated by growth temperature and time spent in stationary phase.  In order to assess the effects that environmental UV-R had on regulatory networks and pathways of S. alaskensis, and determine how the cell&#146;s physiology was affected, a quantitative proteomics investigation was performed. Changes in proteome were analyzed, with the recent and powerful mass spectrometry based approach using iTRAQ methodology. Approximately, one third of the proteome of S. alaskensis was identified, with 119 statistically and significantly differentially abundant proteins. Cellular processes, pathways and interaction networks were determined and gave us unique insight into the biology of UV response and adaptation of S. alaskensis.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marine bacteria</field><field name="subject">UV radiation</field><field name="subject">Visible light</field><field name="subject">DNA damage</field><field name="subject">Proteomics</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43251</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The "safety net" and human capital formation in Australia</field><field name="creator">Taylor, Fiona May, Social Sciences &amp; International Studies, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study explores the validity of key assumptions and arguments about the nature, extent, depth, causes, and consequences of poverty that underpinned the statements and policy of the Howard Government during its decade in office. One important assumption appeared to be that an inability to afford the essentials of life plays a relatively unimportant, even negligible role in generating the low levels of human capital and school achievement exhibited by many ??poor?? parents and their children. Drawing on extensive secondary evidence from disciplines as diverse as economics, sociology, neurobiology, epidemiology and developmental psychology, the study demonstrates that these assumptions and arguments do not stand up to close empirical scrutiny. The adequacy of income support payments as a ??safety net?? from poverty, and the validity of various poverty ??lines?? are examined against the costs of obtaining the ??essentials?? that Australians believe no citizen should have to go without. This analysis reveals that the depth and prevalence of poverty in Australia is considerably more serious than has been admitted by the Howard Government and in many academic analyses. Next, the study demonstrates that the rise in so-called ??welfare dependence?? is a product of economic, rather than cultural developments; that income support ??customer?? data contradicts the claim that poverty is mostly a transitory phenomenon; and that ??work first welfare to work policies?? are not a solution to poverty, even during an economic boom. The second half of the thesis explores evidence from a variety of disciplines that suggests that the financial stress and material hardship associated with poverty have direct, indirect and cumulative impacts which commonly include compromised brain function and development and a reduced capacity for physiological and behavioural self-regulation. These consequences undermine physical and mental health, inter-personal relationships, parenting and health behaviours, learning capacities, and the development and maintenance of cognitive and non-cognitive abilities that are valued in the labour market. Contrary to the policy conclusions that flow from mis-characterisation of these consequences as symptoms of the intrinsic deficits of the poor, the multi-disciplinary evidence suggests that the real economic costs of allowing poverty to continue are likely to be higher than the costs of preventing it.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Income support</field><field name="subject">Poverty</field><field name="subject">Human capital</field><field name="subject">Child development</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43269</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular interactions and chirality</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Tuong Vi, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">- Alicyclic diols can hydrogen bond in many different ways and yield most interesting structures. In this thesis, eight C2-symmetric diols 48-50, 78, 79 and 81-83 were synthesized and their crystal structures were determined. No less than seven of these show unusual solid state behaviour: 48 and 78 are inclusion hosts; 49, 50 and 78 form doubly-stranded hydrogen-bonded ladder structures, where there is a strong preference for each strand to be homochiral; 78, 81 and 82 undergo self-resolution during recrystallization; and 83 forms chirally pure crystals (but the material is still racemic). - One of the favourable supramolecular synthons for hydroxy compounds is the (O-H)6 cycle of hydrogen bonds. When this cycle is formed by a racemic compound, its enantiomers alternate down-up-down etc. around the cycle. No case of an (O-H)6 cycle involving chirally pure hydroxy compounds is known. These observations indicate a strong preference for the (O-H)6 cycle being constructed from achiral or racemic molecules rather than from chirally pure hydroxyl compounds. Racemic (??)-48 and (??)-92 which are already known to form (O-H)6 cycles in the solid state were prepared in chirally pure form and their X-ray crystal structures determined. No (O-H)6 cycles were observed for these homochiral diols. These findings confirm that the (O-H)6 motif occurs only for achiral or racemic compounds. - Similarly, the edge-to-edge eight-membered aryl C-H???N dimer involves either achiral molecules or those of opposite chirality. No chirally pure dimers of this type are reported. Racemic compounds 42-44 that are known to pack using the C-H???N dimer were synthesized in chirally pure form. No edge-to-edge eight-membered aryl C-H???N dimers were formed in the solid state. Hence this supramolecular synthon is only favoured for achiral or racemic compounds only. - Other major conclusions are that the cause of self-resolution is due to packing energy. In some cases it is likely that solvent choice, or solvent plus temperature selection, can be used to control self-resolution.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chirality</field><field name="subject">Molecular dynamics.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/21891</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessing the integrity of sympathetic pathways in human spinal cord injury</field><field name="creator">Brown, Rachael, Clinical School - Prince of Wales Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Spinal cord injury can result in partial or complete loss of supraspinal control of sympathetic outflow below the lesion. Despite the importance of the sympathetic nervous system in autonomic dysreflexia and orthostatic hypotension, its integrity is not currently assessed in the clinical determination of lesion level - only motor and sensory pathways are examined. The aim of this thesis was to develop non-invasive means of assessing the integrity of sympathetic pathways following human spinal cord injury. Brief innocuous electrical stimuli applied to the forehead evoked cutaneous vasoconstrictor and sudomotor responses in the fingers and toes of able-bodied subjects, which were abolished by complete spinal lesions. Application of these same stimuli to the abdominal wall (below lesion) generated long-lasting cutaneous vasoconstriction (but not sweat release) and significant increases in blood pressure that accumulated with repeated stimuli. Moreover, the magnitude and duration of these spinal somatosympathetic reflexes did not depend on the number of impulses or duration of the sensory input, suggesting that only the initial part of the sensory barrage elicits reflex responses. This work has shown that cutaneous vascoconstriction provides a more robust measure of the integrity of sympathetic pathways than does sweat release. This was confirmed during natural stimulation of somatic afferents during vibroejaculation, which caused marked increases in blood pressure and marked cutaneous vasoconstriction but negligible sweat release below lesion. Muscle vasoconstrictor function below lesion was assessed by asking subjects to perform a maximal inspiratory breath-hold, which is known to cause a sustained activation of muscle vasoconstrictor neurones that counteracts the fall in blood pressure in able-bodied subjects. Blood pressure remained low in paraplegics and, especially, quadriplegics during this manouevre; importantly, heart rate showed a linear increase only in the spinal patients. In the absence of blood pressure measurements, the latter infers an interruption of descending muscle vasoconstrictor pathways. In conclusion, this thesis has demonstrated simple, non-invasive techniques that can be utilised to assess the function of the sympathetic nervous system in spinal cord injury, and highlighted the need to assess the injury in terms of the integrity of the sympathetic nervous system below the lesion level.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Autonomic dysreflexia</field><field name="subject">Spinal cord injury</field><field name="subject">Blood pressure</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44505</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Monitoring and control of the CO2 laser cutting process</field><field name="creator">El-Kurdi, Zeyad, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Laser cutting is one of the most important applications of laser in manufacturing industry; it is mainly used for sheet metal cutting. In laser cutting, performing real-time evaluation of laser cut quality is very important to the advancement of this process in industry. However, due to the dynamic nature of the laser cutting process specially when cutting ferrous alloys using oxygen as an assist gas, laser cut quality cannot be easily predicted; therefore, the quality inspection of the laser cut is performed by off line inspections of the edges of the metal by skilled operators. This methodology is carried out after the process and thus cannot maintain a good quality if the process performance is out of control. Therefore, the objective of the research project is to qualify and develop a sensor system that ensure fault recognition online and can automatically control the laser metal cutting process to achieve good quality cut. For the realization of this objective the following has been done: -	study the relationship between process parameters and cut quality characteristics;  -	identify the best sensors that can be used to monitor the process;  -	design and develop an experimental setup to test the proposed sensors;  -	collect and analyze data from the proposed sensors and correlate them to specific cut quality characteristics (process state variables);  -	develop direct relationships between the process signals and cut quality;  -	develop appropriate strategy for process control;  -	design and develop an integrated monitoring and control system;  -	test and evaluate the proposed system using simulation.  In this study, a new technique for the determination of cut quality of sheet steels under the CO2 laser cutting process has been established. It is based on on-line detection and post-processing analysis of light radiation and acoustic emissions from the cut kerf. Determination of machining quality during cutting is best done through the measurement of surface roughness and kerf widths, as these are the two parameters that vary in successful through cuts. These two quality parameters can further be correlated to the two dominant process parameters of laser power and cutting speed. This study presents an analysis of acoustic emissions and reflected light for CO2 laser cutting of steel plates, and discusses their use for the estimation of cut quality parameters of kerf width and striation frequency for mild steel plates of 3mm, 5mm, 8mm, and 10mm thicknesses. Airborne acoustic and light signals are acquired with a microphone and a photodiode respectively, and recorded with a PC based data acquisition system in real time. The signals are then analyzed to establish a correlation between the signals obtained and the cut quality achieved. Experimental evidence shows that the energy levels of acoustic emission signals (RMS analysis) can be used to maintain the cutting process under steady state condition. On the other hand, the light intensity signal fluctuates with a frequency that corresponds to the frequency of striations formed on the cut surface; therefore it can be used to regulate cutting speed and laser power to obtain an optimum cutting condition and best cut quality. The validity of the proposed control strategy was tested experimentally by simulating the variations of cutting speed and examining their effect on the signals. So far, the prototype used for experimentation has been successful in providing correct information about cut quality in terms of striation frequency, and also about the state of the process where the microphone signal was successful in determining system failure or improper cutting conditions. A microprocessor based control system utilizing the PID control algorithm is recommended for the implementation of the control strategy. The implementation requirements of the proposed system for industrial use are then discussed. A new setup for the coaxial monitoring of CO2 laser cutting using a photodiode is proposed to enhance the quality of the signal and also to protect the photodiode from the harsh cutting environment. It is also proposed that an open control architecture platform is needed to enhance the integration of the proposed process control functions. Conclusions and future research directions towards the achievement of Autonomous Production Cell (APC) for the laser cutting process are then given.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Laser beam cutting</field><field name="subject">Metal-cutting</field><field name="subject">Carbon dioxide lasers</field><field name="subject">Industrial applications.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/21900</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Three essays on econometric evaluation of public health interventions</field><field name="creator">Johar, Meliyanni, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This dissertation consists of three independent essays evaluating the impact of public health interventions in two countries, Indonesia and Australia. The first two essays concern the national pro-poor health card program in Indonesia, which fully subsidises health care purchases by its recipients. In quantifying the impact of the program, the combination of propensity score matching and difference-in-differences techniques is used to address bias due to non-random assignment. Covariates to match include both variables affecting demand and eligibility and variables measuring local health care supply. Using data from the single, nationally-representative longitudinal study of Indonesian households, the program is found to have limited impact. The second essay evaluates the program??s impact on supply variables. In the absence of a wage revision or additional staff, the program lowers the incentives for health workers to maintain their public position. This is particularly true for those workers providing outpatient care as patients can not be controlled by waiting lists. The analysis finds some evidence of reduced number of full-time doctors in areas where the distribution of health cards were most extensive. The final essay uses Australian data to investigate changes in women??s preferences for cervical screening following a screening promotion campaign and a vaccination program. Discrete choice experiments were used to elicit preferences, and results from experiments conducted prior and after the interventions were compared. Several additional comparison groups were created based on spatial variations and by variation induced by randomisation. The study finds that the interventions have minor impact on how women valued various screening attributes. However, there was a general reduction in the willingness to screen, which was unexpected given the awareness campaign. Through simulation, it is shown that an effective way to increase the screening rate is through encouraging a more active role of the provider.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Program evaluation</field><field name="subject">Health economics</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43400</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of Perlecan in human cartilage development</field><field name="creator">Chuang, Christine Yu-Nung, Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Cartilage development relies on the coordinated presentation of biological signals to direct chondrocyte morphology and function. This is largely controlled by perlecan, a heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG).  Understanding the role of perlecan and its pendant glycosaminoglycan chains (GAG) in cartilage development is essential for advances in tissue engineered cartilage replacement strategies.  Perlecan was immunolocalised to the pericellular matrix of prehypertrophic and hypertrophic chondrocytes in human fetal feet. Human fetal chondrocytes were isolated and cultured in 3-dimensional (3D) scaffolds for a period of 4 weeks.  Their chondrogenic phenotype, based on extracellular matrix (ECM) components, was assessed and compared to 2D cultures. Chondrocyte perlecan was immunopurified from human fetal chondrocytes grown in vitro and fetal cartilage tissue and characterised using a combination of antibody-based techniques (ELISA, Western blotting) and gel electrophoresis.  The biological function of chondrocyte perlecan was determined by its ability to form ternary complexes with fibroblast growth factors (FGF) and their receptors (FGFR) using an antibody-based technique as well as a cell proliferation assay using cells expressing FGFR isotypes.  Perelcan was restricted to the prehypertrophic and hypertrophic zones of cartilage. This zonal organisation of chondrocytes and chondrogenic properties, determined by their morphology and PG deposition, was recapitulated in the 3D constructs while 2D cultures displayed dedifferentiated chondrocytes.  Exogenous FGF2 promoted chondrocyte proliferation, while FGF18 stimulated the synthesis of perlecan, reflecting chondrocyte hypertrophy.  Chondrocyte perlecan (630kDa) contained HS, chondroitin sulfate (CS) and keratan sulfate (KS) chains.  Chondrocyte perlecan formed HS dependent ternary complexes with FGF2-FGFR1c and FGF18-FGFR3c, while FGF18-FGFR3c binding to perlecan protein core was also observed.  Binding of FGF18-FGFR3c to chondrocyte perlecan HS was more promiscuous than FGF2-FGFR1c.  Furthermore, chondrocyte perlecan HS mediated biological activity with FGF18 via FGFR3c, which was modulated by mammalian heparanase, while no biological activity was elicited by FGF2-FGFR1c.  The findings underline how perlecan and its GAGs interact with FGF and FGFR in a spatio-temporal manner to promote signalling, effecting chondrocyte behaviour and morphology in cartilage development.  This insight can be utilised in tissue engineering to improve the development of biologically functional cartilage replacements.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cartilage</field><field name="subject">Perlecan</field><field name="subject">Heparan sulfate</field><field name="subject">Fibroblast growth factors</field><field name="subject">Chondrocytes</field><field name="subject">Tissue engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44417</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Carbothermal synthesis of titanium oxycarbide</field><field name="creator">Dewan, Mohammad Ashikur Rahman, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The aim of the project was to establish the rate and mechanisms of solid stage reduction of titania and ilmenite ores. The project examined carbothermal reduction of titania and various types of ilmenite ores in argon, helium, hydrogen, and their mixtures. Effect of CO in the gas atmosphere on reduction behavior of titania and primary ilmenite ore was also studied. Isothermal and non-isothermal reduction experiments were conducted in a fixed bed reactor in the high temperature furnace in the temperature range up to 1500oC. The off-gas composition in the reduction process was monitored by a CO/CO2/CH4 infrared analyser. The extent of reduction was calculated using data on gas composition and LECO oxygen analysis. Phase composition and morphology of reduced samples were studied using XRD, SEM and optical microscopy. The major findings of this project are as follows:  &#149; The reduction of titania to titanium oxycarbide occurred in the following sequence: TiO2 &#8594; Ti5O9 &#8594; Ti4O7 &#8594; Ti3O5 &#8594; Ti2O3 &#8594; (TiO-TiC) solid solution. &#149; Carbothermal reduction of ilmenite concentrates proceeded in two main stages. In the first stage pseudorutile and ilmenite were reduced to metallic iron and titania. Second stage involved the reduction of titania to titanium oxycarbide. &#149; Rate and degree of reduction of titania and ilmenite concentrates increased with increasing temperature. &#149; Reduction rate of titania and ilmenite concentrates was faster in hydrogen than in helium and argon. The difference in the reduction behavior in helium and argon was insignificant; reduction rate of ilmenite was slightly faster in helium than in argon. &#149; High rate of reduction of titania and ilmenite in hydrogen was attributed to formation of methane which facilitated mass transfer of carbon from graphite to oxide. Hydrogen was also directly involved in reduction of titania and ilmenite concentrates; hydrogen reduced pseudorutile to iron and titania. Titania was further reduced to titanium oxycarbide by carbon through methane. &#149; Increased gas flow rate slightly improved the reduction rate in hydrogen and suppressed the reduction in inert gases. &#149; Addition of CO to hydrogen and inert gases above 3 vol% suppressed the reduction process.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Helium</field><field name="subject">Carbothermal Reduction</field><field name="subject">Hydrogen</field><field name="subject">Argon</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44511</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Behavioural cloning robust goal directed control</field><field name="creator">Isaac, Andrew Paul, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Behavioural cloning is a simple and effective technique for automatically and non-intrusively producing comprehensible and implementable models of human control skill. Behavioural cloning applies machine learning techniques to behavioural trace data, in a transparent manner, and has been very successful in a wide range of domains. The limitations of early behavioural cloning work are: that the clones lack goal-structure, are not robust to variation, are sensitive to the nature of the training data and often produce complicated models of the control skill. Recent behavioural cloning work has sought to address these limitations by adopting goal-structured task decompositions and combining control engineering representations with more sophisticated machine learning algorithms. These approaches have had some success but by compromising either transparency or robustness. This thesis addresses these limitations by investigating: new behavioural cloning representations, control structures, data processing techniques, machine learning algorithms, and performance estimation and testing techniques.  First a novel hierarchical decomposition of control is developed, where goal settings and the control skill to achieve them are learnt. This decomposition allows feedback control mechanisms to be combined with modular goal-achievement. Data processing limitations are addressed by developing data-driven, correlative and sampling techniques, that also inform the development of the learning algorithm. The behavioural cloning process is developed by performing experiments on simulated aircraft piloting tasks, and then the generality of the process is tested by performing experiments on simulated gantry-crane control tasks.  The performance of the behavioural cloning process was compared to existing techniques, and demonstrated a marked improvement over these methods. The system is capable of handling novel goal-settings and task structure, under high noise conditions. The ability to produce successful controllers was greatly improved by using the developed control representation, data processing and learning techniques. The models produced are compact but tend to abstract the originating control behaviour. In conclusion, the control representation and cloning process address current limitations of behavioural cloning, and produce reliable, reusable and readable clones.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Learning Control</field><field name="subject">Behavioural Cloning</field><field name="subject">Machine Learning</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43367</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Corporate governance and firm outcomes: causation or spurious correlation?</field><field name="creator">Tan, David Tatwei, Banking &amp; Finance, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">The rapid growth of financial markets and the increasing diffusion of corporate ownership have placed tremendous emphasis on the effectiveness of corporate governance in resolving agency conflicts within the firm. This study investigates the corporate governance and firm performance/failure relation by implementing various econometric modelling methods to disaggregate causal relations and spurious correlations. Using a panel dataset of Australian firms, a comprehensive suite of corporate governance mechanisms are considered; including the ownership, remuneration, and board structures of the firm. Initial ordinary least squares (OLS) and fixed-effects panel specifications report significant causal relations between various corporate governance measures and firm outcomes. However, the dynamic generalised method of moments (GMM) results indicate that no causal relations exist when taking into account the effects of simultaneity, dynamic endogeneity, and unobservable heterogeneity. Moreover, these results remain robust when accounting for the firm??s propensity for fraud. The findings support the equilibrium theory of corporate governance and the firm, suggesting that a firm??s corporate governance structure is an endogenous characteristic determined by other firm factors; and that any observed relations between governance and firm outcomes are spurious in nature. Chapter 2 examines the corporate governance and firm performance relation. Using a comprehensive suite of corporate governance measures, this chapter finds no evidence of a causal relation between corporate governance and firm performance when accounting for the biases introduced by simultaneity, dynamic endogeneity, and unobservable heterogeneity. This result is consistent across all firm performance measures.  Chapter 3 explores the corporate governance and likelihood of firm failure relation by implementing the Merton (1974) model of firm-valuation. Similarly, no significant causal relations between a firm??s corporate governance structure and its likelihood of failure are detected when accounting for the influence of endogeneity on the parameter estimates. Chapter 4 re-examines the corporate governance and firm performance/failure relation within the context of corporate fraud. Using KPMG and ASIC fraud databases, the corporate governance and firm outcome relations are estimated whilst accounting for the firms?? vulnerability to corporate fraud. This chapter finds no evidence of a causal relation between corporate governance and firm outcomes when conditioning on a firm??s propensity for fraud.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dynamic Panel GMM</field><field name="subject">Corporate Governance</field><field name="subject">Firm Performance</field><field name="subject">Generalised Method of Moments</field><field name="subject">Corporate Fraud</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43371</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The organizational diffusion of service-oriented computing</field><field name="creator">Luthria, Haresh, Information Systems, Technology &amp; Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Corporations are actively pursuing business model innovation and organizational agility in the quest for sustainable competitive advantage in today??s global marketplace. The paradigm of service-oriented computing (SOC) has emerged as a popular approach to flexibility and agility, not just in systems development but also in business process management. The associated concept of service-oriented architecture (SOA) enables the defining of business flows as technology independent services, potentially providing avenues for agility in business process transformation. This architectural concept is growing in popularity and is being rapidly adopted by industry organizations. Studies of the practical impacts of adopting SOA are crucial because it involves a non-trivial and expensive overhaul of both business and technology infrastructures. There is, however, a paucity of critical research on the adoption of SOA. What is needed is a focus on the study of the real-world adoption of SOA across the enterprise and the factors that aid or impede such adoptions. This research examines the organizational use of SOA, both analytically and empirically through case studies, and posits a diffusion framework for the adoption and implementation of SOA as an enterprise strategy. The SOA Diffusion Framework addresses the following key areas ?? the organizational factors influencing the decision to adopt SOA, the organizational aspects of adopting and implementing SOA, and the outcomes or realized benefits of implementing SOA across the enterprise.  For researchers, this study (i) fills a crucial knowledge gap because there is little empirical evidence of the practical use of SOA, (ii) adds to the innovation diffusion literature, (iii) introduces a tool to assess the organizational impact of SOA, and (iv) provides direction for future research into the organizational factors relating to the enterprise adoption of service-orientation.

In addition to my own heuristic contribution in which I connect my university experiences to the university as place, the thesis documents the experiences of three living generations of Australian undergraduate students through 36 qualitative in-depth interviews and analyses their perspectives on how they experienced the university as place while they were students. It examines the trajectory of the university experience from 1964 when the Baby Boomers first entered the university system to the current university experience with students from Generation Y. The thesis is also a comprehensive blend of progressive commentary from in-depth expert interviews selected from demography, higher education, youth, campus planning, and society.  The thesis demonstrates that the university as place can be manifested in attachment to the built form, significant and meaningful connections with members of the university community. However, how each generation felt connected, why they were attached to certain places, who they formed significant relationships with, when they most felt like they belonged, and what they considered meaningful in their undergraduate years at university differed. The thesis contends that generational perspectives on the university as place are inextricably linked to the attitude and beliefs of the generational cohort to which one belongs.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Intergenerational</field><field name="subject">University</field><field name="subject">Place</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43538</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A technical feasibility study of an automated evaluation system for assessing the care needs of residents living in Australian residential aged care facilities</field><field name="creator">Chan, Leroy Lai-Yu, Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">An aging population is one common challenge faced by many developed countries including Australia. The Australian government has realised that the existing healthcare system must be improved to provide better support longer-term for the healthcare needs of this population. This research examines one such opportunity by suggesting a reform on how the care needs of residents living in Australian residential aged care facilities (RACF) are assessed. A recent study has shown that the current assessment system, known as the Residential Classification Scale (RCS), is subjected to high administrative procedural overhead costs and significant deviations in assessment results. This thesis documents a technical feasibility study of a novel method aimed to solve issues related to the time demands and subjectivity of the RCS through the design and implementation of a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). This WSN is engineered to unobtrusively collect data from wireless sensor nodes either embedded in the RACF environment or attached to the resident??s body. The collected data can be potentially used to provide automatic and accurate care level assessments for the resident. The methodology of preparing and conducting the experiments to prove the hypotheses is justified and described, including the experimental instruments and procedures involved. The results show that this WSN surpasses similar research systems in terms of its application scale, the number and types of sensor nodes involved and the complexity of its hardware and firmware architectures. The major contributions of this thesis are: ??	The WSN developed satisfies certain technical requirements to be declared fit for use in a mock Australian RACF. ??	The WSN provides high sensor detection accuracies (between 88% and 100%), superior location tracking capability (94.75%) and activities of daily living inference capability over similar studies. Opportunities for further improvements of this WSN include: ??	Fine tuning the detection accuracy of Passive Infra-red (PIR) motion sensors. ??	Minimising the down time of the sensor nodes due to firmware memory leak. ??	An extra location tracking mechanism to improve location accuracy determination.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ZigBee</field><field name="subject">Wireless Sensor Networks</field><field name="subject">Telehealth</field><field name="subject">Residential Aged Care</field><field name="subject">Activities of Daily Living</field><field name="subject">Wellness Monitoring</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43543</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The pricing or mispricing of earnings quality in Australia</field><field name="creator">Wong, Leon Keat Leong, Accounting, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the pricing (or mispricing) of earnings quality in Australia.  It investigates whether information in earnings quality is used by investors in valuing firms, evidenced by an association between earnings quality and the cost of equity.  In the alternate form, the question may be posed as whether earnings quality is mispriced by investors such that there may be opportunities to earn abnormal profits from trading strategies based on earnings quality.  Ten earnings quality constructs are studied: total accruals, unexpected accruals, cash-to-profit, accrual quality, persistence, predictability, smoothness, relevance, conservatism and timeliness.  In the cost of equity pricing tests, when earnings quality is proxied using one construct (accrual quality), it is found to be associated with the cost of equity.  However, when the additional nine constructs are included in the regression models, accrual quality loses statistical significance.  Various other constructs are found to be associated with the cost of equity depending on the choice of the cost of equity proxy.  In the trading strategy tests, there is some initial evidence of trading strategy opportunities for firms with high quality earnings.  However, after deleting outlier observations with annual buy-and-hold returns of greater than 200% the potential for earning abnormal returns from a hedge portfolio strategy disappears.  The existence of Australian evidence on the accruals anomaly provides a convenient basis to validate the results of the earnings quality trading strategy tests.  Although no clear evidence on the accruals anomaly is found, results are obtained which appear to be consistent with prior Australian evidence of the accruals anomaly, depending on the research design choices made.  Overall, the evidence on whether earnings quality is priced or mispriced in Australia is best viewed as inconclusive.  It highlights the importance of conducting thorough robustness tests and suggests a need for caution by researchers in making inferences from a narrow set of earnings quality constructs and research design specifications.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cost of equity</field><field name="subject">Earnings quality</field><field name="subject">Trading strategies</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43569</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design and control of autonomous crop tracking robotic weeder : GreenWeeder</field><field name="creator">Dang, Kim Son, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis reports the design and control of the ??GreenWeeder??, a non-herbicidal autonomous weeding robot, in order to autonomously track crop rows for weeding through electrocution in the inter-row space. The four wheel mobile robot platform was designed and built with a motorised Ackerman steering system allowing the robot to steer up to 30 degree left and right. It was also equipped with an electronically geared rear wheel drive, a pair of stereo cameras, a SICK LMS-291 laser range finder to localize itself with respect to the crop rows, a GPS system for obtaining the robot position in the field and a long-range communication system for tele-supervision by operators. The first prototype of the robot electrocution system was also designed and constructed to ignite 22kV electrical arcs to destroy weeds. Its operation was tested in the research field of the University of Sydney and the results of this experiment were analysed to improve the efficiency of this first prototype. An improved prototype of the electrocution system was then constructed and attached to a cradle extending out at the back of the mobile robot platform. The testing of this improved prototype was conducted at Lansdowne farm, a research field of the University of Sydney.  After the construction of the robot platform, the robot control was considered with the demands for robot localization with respect to crop rows, an autonomously tracking control system and a manual control mode in order to take the robot to transportation vehicles. Firstly, the robot localization was accomplished by utilizing SICK LMS-291 laser range finder sensor for the sensing and perception of the robot. Secondly, the robot control system was developed with a PID controller, a second order model of the robot system and a first order filter. The PID controller is in the standard form with the filtered derivative and the PI part being in automatic reset configuration. The second order model was identified using Matlab System Identification toolbox based on the robot kinematic analysis. The first order filter is utilized for filtering out the lateral deviations of the robot with respect to the crop rows received from the SICK laser sensor. A Simulink simulation model of the robot control system was also built in order to fine-tune PID and  filter parameters. Thirdly, the manual control mode of the robot was produced. In this mode, a joystick can be attached to a notebook to wirelessly drive the robot around or it can be plugged into a USB port at the back of the robot to drive it without the notebook. After the robot control was implemented and simulated, some experiments were conducted with the robot autonomously tracking  a strip of reflective tape mimicking a crop row stuck into the ground of a laboratory. Depending on distances from the row assigned to the controller, the robot tried to keep those distances away from the row. The results showed the lateral errors of the robot with respect to the row were approximately 4.5 cm which were sufficient for our current agricultural application.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">System identification</field><field name="subject">Crop tracking</field><field name="subject">Autonoumous weeder</field><field name="subject">PID control</field><field name="subject">Weed electrocution</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44418</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using formal management accounting controls to account for value in kind in inter-organisational alliances : a case study of the Sydney 2000 olympic games</field><field name="creator">Burfitt, Brian Anthony, Accounting, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the role of management accounting control practices in interorganisational alliances (IOAs) involving non-cash, &#145;value in kind&#146; (VIK) transactions. The research involves a retrospective case study of the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games, which examines how the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games, (SOCOG), managed and accounted for over $360 million of VIK. The case study is based on document study and interviews with individuals involved with this aspect of the 2000 Olympic Games.  Following a review of previous research concerning both the life cycle (Das and Teng 2002, Moores and Yuen 2001) and the nature of formal accounting controls (Dekker 2004) in IOAs, two research questions are developed. Firstly, what kinds of formal accounting controls are required to manage VIK over the life cycle of an IOA? Secondly, how are extant accounting controls localised through the practice of managing VIK?  This thesis finds the VIK resources are significant to the recipient parties and the IOAs in general. These VIK transactions, however, have been overlooked in previous accounting research with little significant recognition in prior studies or contemporary professional discourse. There is a lack of directly transferable expertise from traditional accounting practices in relation to the following aspects of the management and control of VIK &#150; recognition, planning/budgeting, procedures/rules and performance monitoring. Formal control activities were all experimented with and improvised in order to deal with the challenges presented by the significance of VIK. A &#145;drift&#146; in accounting technologies has been documented by this study (Andon et al 2007).  Given the potential economic significance of VIK transactions, this suggests a need for both further research and professional discourse in this area to ensure sufficient visibility of, and management planning and control for, VIK transactions. Future research could include studies of: management and control of VIK in real time; provider organisations and the impact of VIK on their formal accounting controls; the role of social or informal controls and trust in negotiating and managing VIK; IOAs involving organisations that are operated as an indefinite going concern and, the recognition, valuation and attestation of VIK resources across a range of organisations.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Interorganisational alliances</field><field name="subject">Value In kind</field><field name="subject">Formal management accounting controls</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44411</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chlorination of Titanium Oxycarbide and Oxycarbonitride</field><field name="creator">Adipuri, Andrew, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The project undertook a systematic study of chlorination of titanium oxycarbide and oxycarbonitride with the aim to develop further understanding of kinetics and mechanisms of the chlorination reactions. The project studied titania, ilmenite ores, and synthetic rutile reduced by carbon in argon and nitrogen and chlorinated at different temperatures, gas flow rates and compositions. Chlorination of titanium suboxides, iron and impurities in ilmenite was also examined. Chlorination of titanium oxycarbide Ti(O,C) or oxycarbonitride Ti(O,C,N) can be implemented at 200 to 400 deg.C, while the commercial chlorination process in the production of titanium metal or titania pigment requires 800 to 1100 deg.C. This makes chlorination of Ti(O,C) or Ti(O,C,N) an attractive technology in processing of titanium minerals. Chlorination reaction is strongly exothermal, which increased the sample temperature up to 200 deg.C above the furnace temperature. The chlorination of Ti(O,C) or Ti(O,C,N) was ignited at 150 deg.C to 200 deg.C depending on the sample composition. Their chlorination at 235 deg.C to 400 deg.C was close to completion in less than 30 min. The chlorination rate of titanium oxycarbide or oxycarbonitride increased with increasing gas flow rate. Sample composition had a significant effect on the extent of chlorination. The optimum results were obtained for titanium oxycarbide or oxycarbonitride produced with carbon to titania molar ratio of 2.5; these samples contained no detectable excess of carbon or unreduced titanium suboxides. In chlorination of reduced ilmenite ores and synthetic rutile, Ti(O,C) or Ti(O,C,N), metallic iron and Ti2O3 were chlorinated. The rate and extent of chlorination of titanium increased with increasing carbon to TiO2 ratio.  Chlorination of Ti2O3 was slow relative to Ti(O,C) or Ti(O,C,N) and iron; chlorination of impurity oxides such as MgO, SiO2 and Al2O3 was not observed. The project also examined chlorination of Ti(O,C) or Ti(O,C,N) in ilmenite ore and synthetic rutile after removal of iron, which was achieved by aerated leaching of reduced samples in heated flask containing 0.37 M of ammonium chloride solution. Iron removal from the ilmenite ore or synthetic rutile resulted in higher rate and extent of chlorination of titanium oxycarbide or oxycarbonitride.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Carbothermal reduction</field><field name="subject">Mineral processing</field><field name="subject">Ore treatment</field><field name="subject">Chlorination</field><field name="subject">Titanium oxycarbide</field><field name="subject">Titanium oxycarbonitride</field><field name="subject">Titanium tetrachloride</field><field name="subject">Extractive metallurgy</field><field name="subject">Leaching</field><field name="subject">Titanium</field><field name="subject">Titania</field><field name="subject">Titanium oxide</field><field name="subject">Ilmenite</field><field name="subject">Rutile</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44405</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The regulation of Saxitoxin production in Cyanobacteria</field><field name="creator">Cavaliere, Rosalia, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Aquatic microalgae produce a variety of toxic secondary metabolites, which are a concern for public health and seafood industries, while also presenting a source of pharmacologically valuable compounds. The present study deals with the physiology and molecular genetics of saxitoxin (STX), a cyanobacterial neurotoxic alkaloid. Ecological and chemical parameters have been investigated for their effects on growth and STX production in the cyanobacterium Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii T3, in order to better understand the physiological responses of this cyanobacterium to the anthropogenic eutrophication of water bodies. The results indicated that phosphate, in particular, had an incremental effect on STX production, as well as promoting the up-regulation of transcription of the STX biosynthetic gene cluster (sxt). High temperature was found to negatively affect growth and STX production in this organism. The effects of the plant hormone, jasmonic acid, were also tested, since it has previously been shown to affect plant alkaloid production. The hypothesised similarity between cyanobacterial and plant secondary metabolism in response to this plant hormone was confirmed in the neurotoxic cyanobacterium, C. raciborskii T3, as well as the non-toxic Anabaena sp. PCC7120. Furthermore, investigation of the sxt gene cluster transcriptional map in C. raciborskii T3 was carried out, with identification of three main polycistronic and one monocistronic transcripts. Promoter regions putatively involved in the regulation of STX production in C. raciborskii T3 were also identified. Transcription factor consensus motifs, the pho boxes, were identified in the main promoter region. These conserved motifs are the binding regions for the transcriptional regulator, PhoB, to the pho regulon genes, involved in phosphate uptake during conditions of its depletion in the environment. Moreover, a genomic region adjacent to the sxt gene cluster in C. raciborskii T3 was identified and characterised, putatively encoding a regulatory two-component system. This system appears to be involved in the sensing of environmental signals, in particular depleted phosphate, while activating the transcription of genes involved in its uptake and transport. The results of this study lead to a greater understanding of the complex factors associated with the regulation of STX biosynthesis and bloom-formation, by the cyanobacterium C. raciborskii T3.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii T3</field><field name="subject">Aquatic microalgae</field><field name="subject">Saxitoxin (STX)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44403</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Repositioning human resource management in a global airline : the struggle for legitimacy.</field><field name="creator">Wilcox, Tracy Patricia, Organisation &amp; Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a study of intra-organisational legitimation of the Human Resource function in a large Australian airline. Major changes in senior management and strategy, under tumultuous circumstances for the industry and the firm, saw a repositioning of human resources in the organisation. The study draws on empirical ethnographic research conducted within a large global airline over approximately fourteen months, focusing on 2001. Using a longitudinal and processual research strategy, the study adopted enabled the close examination of the interrelationships between institutional structures and organisational action, embedded in an organisational setting.  In particular, it considers the loss of legitimacy and agency of managers in a corporate human resources department and their response in re-establishing legitimacy in a new institutional context. Legitimacy implies the actions and existence of these actors and their sub-unit are both valued and considered valid by their constituencies.  In the analysis of the unfolding multi-layered processes of legitimation, I employed elements of neo-institutional theory and critical realist ontology and applied this analysis to a modified conception of structuration, mapping out the HR managers' experience of the inner context and how it came to position their practices and constrain their agency.  The study found that the human resource actors in the airline were able to re-form and regain the legitimacy of their sub-unit and of their major strategic initiative, by drawing on their stock of political relationships and on the plurality of logics, values and norms available within the large, diverse firm" Their reflexive awareness of their contextual positioning enabled them to alter their legitimation strategies and regain legitimacy"  This thesis makes a contribution to our understanding of processes of deinstitutionalisation and legitimation and ongoing structuration in organisational settings. It also expands our conceptualisation of legitimacy, by focusing on legitimation as an act of becoming, and developing the notion of legitimacy struggles as institutional politics. Finally, the thesis contributes to critical human resource management research and our understanding of human resource managers' capacity for agency within broader institutional contexts.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Legitimacy.</field><field name="subject">Human resource management.</field><field name="subject">Global airline.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44514</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nitrate, nitrite and nitrosamine: contents and analyses in selected foods; effect of vitamin C supplementation on N-nitrosodimethylamine formation in humans; and an investigation of natural alternatives to nitrites as preservatives in cured meat products</field><field name="creator">Hsu, James Chun Hou, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Dietary nitrite intake has been implicated in numerous gastrointestinal cancers in humans due to the formation of a group of carcinogens called N-nitroso compounds. The need to estimate their intake is vital in establishing at risk population and to monitor and perhaps one day manage their dietary intake. This is the first study to estimate nitrate and nitrite in selected vegetables, cured and fresh meat in Australian food supply using ion-paired reversed-phased HPLC. Nitrite content in meat products analysed ranged from 0 to 83.9 mg/kg in medallion beef and Frankfurt, respectively; nitrate content ranged from 18.7 mg/kg in minced beef to 142.5 mg/kg in salami. The nitrite content was below the maximum limit set by the Food Standards Australia and New Zealand. Nitrate content in selected vegetables ranged from 123 to 4850 mg/kg in Iceberg lettuce and English spinach, respectively; only minimal nitrite at 20 mg/kg was present in Gai choy, which was most likely due to bacterial contamination during storage. Based on the food consumption pattern of Australians, the dietary nitrite and nitrate intake from bacon were 1.51 and 3.42 mg per capita per day, which was below the Adequate Daily Intake set by the European Union Scientific Committee for food in 1995. Taking into considerations of oral nitrate reduction to nitrite and the endogenous nitrate formation, the upper extreme of dietary nitrite and nitrate intake in Australians were 44 and 2.4 times over the ADI, respectively. However, this does not take into effect of other dietary promoters and inhibitors. Eighteen healthy human volunteers were put on a low nitrate, nitrite and antioxidant diet for three days during which they were fed one serving of cured meat with and without 500 mg of vitamin C. Using GC-MS, N-nitrosodimethylamine was not detected in the urine before or after vitamin C supplementation, suggested that a diet low on nitrate and nitrite cannot produce NDMA and thus may reduce the risk of developing gastrointestinal cancers. Different extraction methods and combination of herbs and spices were demonstrated in vitro to show inhibition against B. cereus, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella Enteritidis and Staphylococcus aureus. In addition, autoclaved turmeric powder at 0.3 % (w/v), hot water extracted turmeric with ginger at 0.5 % and rosemary at 1.0 % showed growth inhibition against Clostridium sporogenes, which was used as a surrogate for Clostridium botulinum. The use of these combinations of herbs and spices may replace or at least reduce the use of nitrite as a preservative in cured meat products to prevent botulism and reduce dietary nitrite intake.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">N-nitrosodimethylamine</field><field name="subject">Nitrate</field><field name="subject">Nitrite</field><field name="subject">N-nitroso compounds</field><field name="subject">Nitrosation inhibitors</field><field name="subject">Botulism</field><field name="subject">Natural preservatives</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43740</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Planning for sustainable water and sanitation projects in rural, developing communities</field><field name="creator">Barnes, Rebecca Ruth, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Premature failure or abandonment of water or sanitation interventions in developing communities is a common phenomenon and one which is preventing potential benefits from being fully realised. While the causes of project failure are complex and varied, the literature addressing project failure implicates poor planning in many unsustained small-scale projects. In particular, a number of authors criticise planning that fails to include consideration of key sustainability areas.  This thesis explores the relationship between planning for rural water and sanitation development projects and their sustainability using both ??depth?? of information gathered through a case study in rural Philippines and ??breadth?? of information gathered from key informants representing a range of regions and organisational types. Key informant interviews show the case study findings to be generally transferable between regions. Both methods illustrate the need for interpersonal relationships of trust and unity, commitment and integrity in project personnel, significant time spent in data-gathering and consensus development, creative modes of communication, ongoing contact and detailed long-term financial planning.  A critical evaluation of 17 prominent, existing planning frameworks for rural water supply and sanitation projects is presented with respect to key attributes of good planning practice as identified during the case study and interviews. The evaluation reveals both strengths and inadequacies in current planning frameworks, illuminating possible causes of persistent poor planning. Finally, methods are identified by which planning processes can be improved so as to reduce the incidence of early water and sanitation project failure. An existing decision framework, the Water Services Association of Australia (WSAA) Sustainability Framework, was trialled during the Philippines Case Study. The new Planning Framework for Rural Water and Sanitation was developed as a result of the trial, the case study and the interviews. The new framework employs the primary sustainability criteria in the decision process in the form of constraints developed using participatory processes, thereby defining a safe space within which the beneficiaries may have freedom and confidence to select their desired technical solutions. Other key elements of good planning practice are incorporated, including those typically omitted by existing frameworks in the rural water and sanitation development sector.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Developing countries</field><field name="subject">Water</field><field name="subject">Sanitation</field><field name="subject">Sustainability</field><field name="subject">Planning</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44507</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sydney apartments: the urban, cultural and design identity of the alternative dwelling 1900-2008</field><field name="creator">Butler-Bowdon, Caroline, School of Planning and Urban Development, Faculty of Built Environment, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis argues that the significance of apartments in Sydney's urban history has not been recognised due to a cultural resistance to apartment living. This lack of acknowledgement has masked the urban, social and architectural impact of the apartment building type in Sydney's history. As an interdisciplinary reading of the development of the purpose-built apartment building in Sydney since its inception in 1900, the thesis is premised on a desire to use the apartment building as a vehicle to tell an alternative housing history to the more commonly told one of house and garden. In the process, it provides a different story of the city's development through the lens of the apartment building and challenges cultural prejudices against apartment living. The research documents the growth and changes of apartments, tracking their location, diversity of type and scale across the Sydney metropolitan region. The research analyses prototypical and generic apartment buildings in the context of the city's history. Drawing on the intersection of eras and themes as a method of critical inquiry, the thesis covers aspects of domestic debates, market, regulation, scale, demography, geography distribution, design and typology, traversing a time period of 1900 to 2008. The thesis explores the debates for and against apartment living in Sydney, emphasising the roles played by apartments in the broader discourses of Australian cultural and design history. The thesis concludes that after more than a century, the debates between apartment and cottage living continue to rage. In systematically providing a trajectory for the history of apartments from ideology to typology, this thesis establishes a place for apartments in Sydney's urban and cultural history; and simultaneously provides a deeper historical context to assist the process of better understanding and responding to the contemporary debate about high-density living and its consequences for the life of the city. Despite the size of its largely undocumented subject, this thesis demonstrates the effectiveness of its rationale: to use analysis of a specific, controversial building type to provide new insights into Sydney's urban history, ideologies and built forms.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australain cultural and design history.</field><field name="subject">Sydney apartment buildings.</field><field name="subject">Urban history.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44495</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Composing women and feminism at the turn of the twentieth century in England, France and Germany</field><field name="creator">Harris, Amanda Jane, English, Media, &amp; Performing Arts, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">The turn from the nineteenth century into the twentieth saw an increase in the number of composing European women attaining prominence in the music world. This period of history is also now recognised as one of the key phases of the first wave of feminism. Feminists and musical women moved in a similar stratum of society. Although women of this era have increasingly been the subject of scholarly research, music historians have rarely investigated the links between the turn of the century??s wave of composing women and feminists.  This dissertation uses the feminist and musical press as a means to investigate composing women??s engagement with feminism. I examine feminists?? regard for women musicians and conversely composing women??s views on feminism. The thesis also reframes the privatelives of composing women through an analysis of primary sources. The composers who form the focus of this biographical investigation include Lili Boulanger (1893-1918), Ethel Smyth (1858-1944), Luise Adolpha Le Beau (1850-1927), Louise H??ritte-Viardot (1841-1918) and Armande de Polignac (1876-1962). Using a large body of newly analysed, unpublished correspondence and private papers, this research offers fresh insights into the biographies of composing women as well as their own self-portrayal, revealing the complex nature of Ethel Smyth??s sexuality and reassessing the fatalistic portrait of Lili Boulanger which has been drawn in some previous studies. These biographical insights background the contentions of the thesis that composing women and feminists shared common ground.  Through investigating the presence of musicians in the feminist press and of feminism in the musical press, the thesis reveals an ambivalent relationship between feminists and musicians. The disappointed expectations of feminists are contrasted with the reasons composing women had for retaining a distance from feminism. The exploration of composing women??s political and personal context enables an understanding not only of their contribution to music history, but also of their place within the greater history of women??s development.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nineteenth century</field><field name="subject">Wwomen</field><field name="subject">Feminism</field><field name="subject">Twentieth century</field><field name="subject">Composers</field><field name="subject">England</field><field name="subject">France</field><field name="subject">Germany</field><field name="subject">Smyth</field><field name="subject">Boulanger</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43745</field></doc><doc><field name="title">States of unrest: photography and trauma</field><field name="creator">Peterson, Tanya, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">States of Unrest: Photography and Trauma is an interdisciplinary study of the dialectic between photography and trauma. It examines the relationship between photography and affect, read primarily through current trauma theory and contemporary photographic discourse. The study explores trauma??s mnemonic processes and symptoms and their structural similarities to photography??s modes of registration and representation. The framework of the study is developed through a close reading of three different manifestations of war-related images as a way of considering the language, circulation, and impact of traumatic images. It considers this field, firstly, in terms of the function of domestic photography produced during the time of World War II; secondly, in relation to photographic documentation of the Vietnam War; and thirdly, through imagery made in response to the ongoing war in Afghanistan. It examines the relationship between photography and trauma in terms of theories of absence and presence, ultimately arguing in favour of a model of understanding based on a surplus economy of meaning, as opposed to a framing of absence. The overall research findings were presented as a thesis comprising of a written study and an exhibition of photographic and sculptural work.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43761</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The late effects of therapy in an Australian cohort of childhood cancer survivors</field><field name="creator">Wilson, Carmen Louise, Children's Cancer Institute Australia for Medical Research, UNSW</field><field name="description">In Australia, up to 80% of individuals diagnosed with childhood cancer are now expected to survive for more than five years after their initial diagnosis. However, survivors of childhood cancer are at risk of developing late sequelae as a consequence of therapies received during childhood. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of selected late sequelae in a cohort of Australian childhood cancer survivors and identify treatment and genetic factors that may modify the risk of late sequelae in survivors. Our study included 1150 individuals treated for childhood cancer at the Sydney Children??s Hospital between 1962 and 1999, who had remained in remission &gt;3 years and were confirmed to be alive. Rates of mortality and second cancers among survivors were compared against population rates to determine standardised mortality and incidence ratios. Survivors completed a questionnaire on the incidence of adverse health conditions and provided a buccal specimen. Real time PCR was used to detect polymorphisms in genes involved in drug detoxification and transport. Rates of mortality and secondary cancers were found to be 7.5-fold (95%CI 5.4-10.1) and 4.9-fold (95%CI 2.9-8.0) higher among survivors of childhood cancer relative to the general population, respectively, with the highest risks observed for those survivors previously treated for Hodgkin??s disease. Over 60% of survivors reported at least one cardiopulmonary, endocrine or sensory-motor condition following diagnosis of childhood cancer; the most frequently observed conditions included growth hormone deficiency, hypothyroidism, and hypertension. Late sequelae were most frequently reported by females and survivors of brain tumours. Genetic investigations showed that an increased risk of growth hormone deficiency was associated with homozygosity for the GSTM1 null polymorphism, while no gene associations were observed to influence the risk of second cancers among survivors. Our study demonstrates that survivors of childhood cancer are at risk of developing a variety of health conditions as a result of anti-cancer therapies received during childhood. Determining risk factors for late sequelae based on therapy type, lifestyle and genetic predisposition will enable the optimisation of treatment protocols and promote the future well-being of childhood cancer survivors.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Polymorphism</field><field name="subject">Cancer survivor</field><field name="subject">Childhood cancer</field><field name="subject">Late effects</field><field name="subject">Neoplasms</field><field name="subject">Second primary neoplasms</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43794</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The social cognitive neuroscience of empathy in older adulthood</field><field name="creator">Bailey, Phoebe Elizabeth, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Empathy is an essential prerequisite for the development and maintenance of close interpersonal relationships. Given that older adults are particularly vulnerable to the negative consequences of loneliness and social isolation, it is surprising that few studies have assessed empathy in this group. The current programme of research addressed this gap in the literature by testing competing predictions derived from Socioemotional Selectivity Theory and the Ageing-Brain Model for age-related sparing and impairment of empathy, respectively. 	Study 1 compared young (N = 80) and older (N = 49) adults?? self-reported levels of cognitive and affective empathy, and engagement in social activities. It was found that although affective empathy is spared, cognitive empathy is subject to age-related decline, and this decline mediates reductions in social participation. These data therefore affirmed the importance of further investigation into the nature, causes and potential consequences of age-related differences in empathy. 	Since disinhibition is one mechanism contributing to difficulty taking the perspective of another, and is known to increase with age, in Study 2, behavioural measures sensitive to inhibitory failure and to cognitive empathy were  administered to young (N = 36) and older (N = 33) adults. One of the measures of cognitive empathy directly manipulated inhibitory demands, involving either high or low levels of self-perspective inhibition. The results indicated that older adults were selectively impaired on the high-inhibition condition, with cognitive disinhibition mediating this association. Study 2 therefore provided important evidence relating to one potential mechanism that contributes to age-related difficulties in perspective-taking. 	Studies 3 and 4 provided the first behavioural assessments of age-related differences in affective empathy by using electromyography to index facial expression mimicry. Study 3 found that young (N = 35) and older (N = 35) adults?? demonstrate comparable mimicry of anger, but older adults?? initial (i.e., implicit) reactions were associated with reduced anger recognition. Thus, to test the possibility that despite explicit recognition difficulties, implicit processing of facial expressions may be preserved in older adulthood, Study 4 compared young (N = 46) and older (N = 40) adults?? mimicry responses to subliminally presented angry and happy facial expressions. As predicted, the two groups demonstrated commensurate subconscious mimicry of these expressions. 	Taken together, these studies indicate that separate components of empathy are differentially affected by healthy adult ageing. Implications for competing perspectives of socioemotional functioning in older adulthood are discussed.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Social functioning</field><field name="subject">Ageing</field><field name="subject">Empathy</field><field name="subject">Executive control</field><field name="subject">Mimicry</field><field name="subject">EMG</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44506</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The lion in Chinese space and social life</field><field name="creator">Young, Min-Chia, Built Environment, Faculty of Built Environment, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is a systematic examination from a historical point of view of the rich diversity of forms and images of the lion motif in Chinese space and social life. Drawing on textual, linguistic and archaeological sources, it addresses the fundamental problem inherent in the study of the lion motif in China, that is, why a foreign import was adopted, transformed and assimilated into an existing culture and how it was then widely rendered in various forms and images as though it had been an indigenous image all along. The examination begins with a search for the origins, names for and appearance of the real lion in China and a comparison of this with the images, roles and powers of the ideological lion in the Chinese mind. It proceeds through an investigation into the liking of the ruling class for lions as tomb guardian beasts in their search for a better afterlife. The thesis then focuses on the adoption of the lion motif by ordinary people as a means of approaching the divine and gaining recognition, in the process of which the image of a ferocious beast was gradually transformed into that of a rotund pet. The pet-like ??look?? of the lion came to be associated with various vernacular cultures of Southern China and assumed a unique style during Ming (1368??1644), when the form and image of the animal became a living concept with little emphasis on its physical appearance. In other words, what perpetuated the significant role of the lion in Chinese space and social life was its conceptual image, not its physical shape. Two case studies, one based in Kinmen and the other in Sydney, further demonstrate that the physical appearance of the lion motif has little effect on the power and mechanism of the mighty animal in the Chinese mind. What matters most, when placing the lion motif in front of an entry way, is the reiteration or reenactment of the conceptual image of the lion through symbols, rituals and ??traditional?? beliefs by which this particular animal motif has become an enduring legacy of Chinese communities around the world. The thesis, then, summarises the changes in the lion motif and its transformation from a physical object to a living concept free from image and form constraints as a gradual process of Chinese perception that integrated the real animal with the imagined animal, strange and unfamiliar phenomena, and the dominant and popular cultures. The context of this integration may have been significantly influenced by the bureaucratic metaphor of the ruling class. The lasting meaning and significance of the lion motif, however, is due to the vision and determination of ordinary people, who are as much prone to seeking a comfortable space and the promise of a better life as have been their rulers.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mortuary art</field><field name="subject">Chinese lion</field><field name="subject">Social life</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43802</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Terrestrial and freshwater turtles of early cretaceous Australia</field><field name="creator">Smith, Elizabeth T, Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">An unusual turtle fauna from Lightning Ridge, New South Wales (Albian) reveals that Australian turtles had a more extensive Mesozoic history than previously indicated. Reevaluation of several primitive groups provides novel information on turtle evolution in the southern hemisphere. Seven turtle taxa are identified at Lightning Ridge. Two are Testudines indet. and two indeterminate chelid groups are evinced by isolated elements. Three new taxa are assigned to the new family Spoochelyidae in the superfamily Meiolanoidea. Spoochelys ormondea n. fam., gen. et sp., Sunflashemys bartondracketti n. gen. et sp. and Opalania baagiwayamba n. gen. et sp. are predominantly land-living turtles with high-domed shells and short manus and pes. The sister-group relationship with the Meiolaniidae, supported by a suite of cranial and postcranial synapomorphies, increases the stratigraphic range of the horned turtles by around ~ 50 my. Primitive structures in Spoochelys (postparietal, supratemporal and interpterygoid vacuity), occur with derived features that are variably developed across Triassic and Jurassic turtles. Phylogenetic analysis precariously resolves the meiolanoids as sister group to a clade containing Palaeochersis and Proterochersis. Limited pleurodiran attributes suggest that meiolanoids may be pleurodiromorphs, closer to primitive pleurodires than to cryptodires. As basal &#145;side-necked&#146; turtles, the Lightning Ridge meiolanoids permit first insights into cranial and postcranial progressions in pleurodiran stem taxa. Evidence of diverse meiolanoids in Early Cretaceous Australia and ancient radiations of meiolanoid-like turtles in southern Pangea, suggest that the horned turtles are a Triassic group and that the dichotomy between Pleurodira and Cryptodira occurred well before the Late Triassic. Early Cretaceous chelids at Lightning Ridge occur at higher palaeolatitude than in South America. The temporal range of Australian chelids is extended by ~ 50 my, demonstrating that chelids had a Jurassic history in Australia, with broad diversifications across the polar supercontinent. The palaeoecological setting of Lightning Ridge is comprehensively described for the first time. Diverse invertebrates and vertebrates include terrestrial, freshwater aquatic and rare marine forms that are anomalous at this near-polar palaeolatitude (~65-70oS). The anachronistic occurrence in Early Cretaceous Australia of distinctive radiations of &#145;Triassic-type&#146; turtles, and other relic groups, implies prolonged intervals of biogeographic isolation in the eastern provinces of Pangea.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Meiolanoidea</field><field name="subject">Early Cretaceous Australia</field><field name="subject">Lightning Ridge</field><field name="subject">Chelidae</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43808</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The stakes involved in Emancipatory Acts</field><field name="creator">Roberts, Jamie Quasar, Social Sciences &amp; International Studies, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">The thesis develops a comprehensive account of human political ontology through the discussion of Plato, Rousseau, Lacan, Lyotard, Hugo, Conrad, Tolstoy and Nietzsche. At the heart of this account lies the dialectical struggle between an individual's need to belong and their fidelity to an intuitively recognisable, yet difficult to define good (or set of goods), that has, over the millennia, been conceptualised as, amongst other things, the form of the good, self interest, compassion, love, friendship, the event, conscience, reason and truth. Through the development of this account of human political ontology the thesis will elucidate the stakes involved in emancipatory acts, be they broad social movements or individual transformations. Its most important argument is that people almost always fail to recognise that to which they belong; the consequence of this being that they mistake the acts which function to reaffirm their belonging for acts that are indicative of their sovereign being. This phenomenon becomes particularly troubling once we recognise that the acts which function to reaffirm an individual??s belonging can depend upon the individual sacrificing both themself and others.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ontology</field><field name="subject">Emancipation</field><field name="subject">Protest</field><field name="subject">Ethics</field><field name="subject">Political philosophy</field><field name="subject">Hypocrisy</field><field name="subject">Social movements</field><field name="subject">Lyotard</field><field name="subject">Hugo</field><field name="subject">Progressive</field><field name="subject">Sacrifice</field><field name="subject">Philosophy</field><field name="subject">Literature</field><field name="subject">Tolstoy</field><field name="subject">Lacan</field><field name="subject">Conrad</field><field name="subject">Nietzsche</field><field name="subject">Dialectic</field><field name="subject">Truth</field><field name="subject">Love</field><field name="subject">Faith</field><field name="subject">Liberty</field><field name="subject">Jouissance</field><field name="subject">Other</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44523</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nociception, pain and the sympathetic nervous system: neural and effector organ responses in healthy and spinal cord injured human subjects</field><field name="creator">Burton, Alexander Robert, Clinical School - Prince of Wales Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Relatively few studies have examined the effects of nociception pe se on sympathetic nerve activity in awake healthy human subjects. Painful stimuli can produce differential responses from cutaneous and muscle postganglionic sympathetic neurones in the anaesthetised cat, and some animal and human studies suggest that nociceptive stimuli originating in different tissues may produce differential sympathetic effects- deep nociception causing vasodepressive and superficial nociception triggering an excitatory effect on cardiovascular state. It is important to understand how the sympathetic nervous system responds to nociception in healthy subjects in order to make more meaningful comparisons with the behaviour which occurs following damage to sympathetic pathways, e.g. nerve lesions (chronic regional pain syndromes) and spinal cord injury (autonomic dysreflexia (AD)). Additionally, it has been suggested that muscle spindles afferents may play a role in chronic pain, most notably the 'vicious cycle' of pain. While this has been investigated in animal studies, it has not been thoroughly investigated in healthy human subjects. Muscle spindle and sympathetic nerve activity from muscle and skin postganglionic neurones were directly recorded in healthy awake human subjects using microneurography; effector organ responses (blood pressure, heartrate, skin blood flow and sweat release) were recorded in both healthy and spinal cord injured subjects. Deep and superficial nociception was induced by intramuscular and subdermal injections of hypertonic saline given at unexpected times and in quasi-random order. Regardless of the origin of nociception (deep or superficial), general responses tended to be excitatory with increases seen in muscle and skin sympathetic nerve activity, heartrate, blood pressure and sweat release. A gender effect was noted regarding skin blood flow, with males largely showing decreases and females increases. No changes were noted in spindle firing rates and painful stimuli did not significantly increase effector organ responses in spinal cord injured subjects. Contrasting with previous studies, we did not see a differential sympathetic response or change in spindle firing rate to painful stimuli originating in different tissues. While it is believed that noxious stimuli trigger AD, we did not see exaggerated sympathetic responses in spinal cord injured subjects. More investigation is required regarding innocuous triggers of AD.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sympathetic Nervous System</field><field name="subject">Nociception</field><field name="subject">Pain</field><field name="subject">Autonomic Dysreflexia</field><field name="subject">Spinal Cord Injury</field><field name="subject">Microneurography</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44517</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mental health and wellbeing of Mandaean refugees</field><field name="creator">Nickerson, Angela Marissa, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This program of research investigated the mental health of Mandaean refugees living in Sydney, Australia (N=315). Participants evidenced high rates of psychological disorders including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD, 23%), depression (34%), anger attacks (58%), complicated grief (10%) and impaired mental health-related functioning (42%). Participants also reported high levels of exposure to traumatic events, and experiencing multiple resettlement stressors. It was found that intrusive fear regarding traumatic events that may be experienced by family members remaining in Iraq contributed to PTSD, depression and mental health-related disability over and above the effects of past trauma and post-migration living difficulties. In addition, fear for family predicted frequency of anger attacks beyond the contribution of past trauma, living difficulties and PTSD. Fear of cultural extinction emerged as a salient concern for the Mandaean community, with path analyses revealing it was directly predicted by symptoms of PTSD. The effects of change in visa status on the mental health of Mandaean refugees who had also taken part in a previous survey were explored. Participants who had attained permanent residency status after previously holding Temporary Protection Visas (TPVs) evidenced greater reductions in psychological distress than those who had consistently held permanent residency. Results suggested that that temporary protection may have exerted negative effects on mental health by creating high levels of post-migration living difficulties. Analyses modelling pathways from trauma and loss to other mental health outcomes at both the individual and family levels indicated that grief played a key role in the mental health of the Mandaean community, and that the refugee experience has implications for family mental health and functioning. This thesis represents an attempt to extend knowledge regarding factors that influence refugee mental health, and common psychological outcomes, by examining the relationship between circumstances of ongoing threat to the individual and the collective, family-level processes, and psychological difficulties including PTSD, depression, grief, anger and mental health-related disability. These findings have implications for government policies and service providers working with refugee groups.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Trauma</field><field name="subject">Refugees</field><field name="subject">Mental health</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44529</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cucurbit[n]uril - a delivery host for anti-cancer drugs</field><field name="creator">Zhao, Yunjie, Physical, Environmental &amp; Mathematical Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Multinuclear platinum complexes</field><field name="subject">Anti-cancer drugs</field><field name="subject">Cancer : Treatment</field><field name="subject">Albendazole</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44380</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development and infrastructure in marginalised communities: safe drinking water in rural Bangladesh</field><field name="creator">Rammelt, Crelis Ferdinand, Institute of Environmental Studies, UNSW</field><field name="description">The poor in most developing countries are persistently marginalised in their living conditions, including their access to safe drinking water. The research objectives have been (1) to better understand why this state of affairs has endured despite decades of efforts and interventions, and (2) to propose more adequate alternatives. The central case study was concerned with drinking water in rural Bangladesh ?? a matter of grave urgency since the discovery of arsenic in the groundwater more than a decade ago. Millions of users are exposed to dangerous levels of contamination, and the implementation of solutions has been slow and inadequate. Little has been done so far to integrate the research on this complex humanitarian crisis.  Many have argued that conventional views on development are ill-equipped to address the ??growing gap?? between rich and poor; the models often fail to interpret inequity beyond mere financial indicators. This thesis therefore puts forward a different analytical framework (based on the theoretical concepts of core-periphery and capital stock). This was designed to increase our understanding of marginalisation by taking into account unequal ownership of, entitlement to, and control over, ecological, technological, organisational and human assets.  Through an action research methodology, this analytical framework was informed by a participatory programme that established safe drinking water supplies in several poor and arsenic-affected villages. The learning experience was then fed back into the programme. This pragmatic approach was also systemic, i.e., it emphasised the community level, which was framed within the context of external influences, various other programmes and national policies.  This resulted in a clarification of the problem in terms of (1) lack of ownership of community land, resources, drinking water institutions and technical knowledge; (2) restricted access to (non-) governmental services and benefits from public or collective assets; and (3) exclusion from decision-making in new water sector developments. It was concluded that alternative strategies need to focus on vesting ownership, entitlement and control in marginalised communities. The steps to achieve this will have far-reaching ramifications for how organisations, policymakers and funding agencies perceive and plan development projects.  The analytical and methodological approach of this thesis is relevant to other cases of marginalisation in different socio-economic contexts.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bangladesh</field><field name="subject">Water</field><field name="subject">Drinking</field><field name="subject">Arsenic</field><field name="subject">Development</field><field name="subject">Poverty</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44524</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Institutional investors: an analysis of investment style, dividends and trading behaviour</field><field name="creator">Ainsworth, Andrew Brent, Banking &amp; Finance, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This dissertation considers two important issues relevant to the efficiency of institutional investment managers.  It examines the trading behaviour of institutional equity funds in relation to investment style drift and dividend payments to assess whether trading is beneficial to investors in these funds.  The analysis of investment style is relevant because of the prominence of multiple manager funds in Australia, while institutional investor preferences for dividend income will impact the after-tax return of fund investors.   Firstly, monthly equity fund portfolio holdings are used to examine the magnitude of investment style drift.  Institutional investor style tilts are consistent with their self-stated investment objective.  Decomposing style drift into active and passive components reveals that institutions retain a desired portfolio tilt by actively adjusting their portfolio holdings in response to passive style drift.  Furthermore, funds are most responsive to changes in book-to-market and momentum drift, with style drift affecting portfolio turnover.  Secondly, the dissertation presents an equilibrium framework of dividend valuation and ex-dividend trading under Australia??s imputation tax system.  An examination of returns, volume, and order imbalance in the Australian equity market shows that investors value dividends.  The results are consistent with long-term investors accelerating trades to the cum-dividend period and short-term traders targeting fully franked, high yielding dividends with a small bid-ask spread.  Franking credits possess a positive value for the majority of the sample while transaction costs impede the efficient adjustment of prices on the ex-dividend day.  The results show that a 45-day holding period rule reduces the amount of short-term trading from July 1999. Thirdly, the dissertation places the ex-dividend trading behaviour of institutional equity funds in the context of the findings for the Australian equity market.  Institutions accelerate their sales of long-term holdings to the cum-dividend period, and delay purchases until the ex-dividend period to avoid dividends.  Institutional trading is consistent with the provision of liquidity to short-term traders that are attempting to capture both dividends and franking credits.  The introduction of a long-term capital gains tax discount in 1999 entices institutions to trade in a more tax-efficient manner by selling long-term holdings prior to the ex-dividend day.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dividends</field><field name="subject">Institutional investors</field><field name="subject">Investment Style</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44406</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of p21WAF1 on cell death pathways in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia</field><field name="creator">Davies, Carwyn, Children's Cancer Institute Australia for Medical Research, UNSW</field><field name="description">The p53 protein is a primary mediator of apoptosis and growth arrest after exposure to DNA-damaging agents. Previous work has categorised a wild type p53 gene in the majority of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) cases, in which instance the p53 protein functions as a modulator of chemotherapy-induced cell death. In contrast, certain p53-induced proteins, such as p21WAF1, can act in an anti-apoptotic manner, and bestow resistance to chemotherapy. Previous studies of the p53 pathway in ALL have utilised cell lines and primary material. In this study a model of ALL was utilised that had previously been developed from a heterogeneous panel of patient biopsies established as xenografts in immune-deficient mice, and are adaptable for short term in vitro culture. A wild-type p53 protein response to etoposide and nutlin-3 exposure was a feature of the whole ALL xenograft panel, irrespective of clinical characteristics and disease biology. While a range of p53 target genes were induced in B-cell precursor (BCP)-ALL and T-ALL xenografts after etoposide exposure, there was negligible induction of p21WAF1 in T- ALL samples. Further work with the histone deacetylase inhibitor vorinostat facilitated p53-independent induction of p21WAF1 in BCP-ALL samples, yet failed to induce p21WAF1 in T- ALL. An association was observed between reduced p21WAF1 expression in the T-ALL samples and decreased histone H3 acetylation in the p21WAF1 promoter together with increased cytosine methylation in the first exon/intron of the p21WAF1 gene. These results suggest that p21WAF1 in T-ALL cells is subject to epigenetic modifications that cause transcriptional silencing. Defective induction of p21WAF1 in T-ALL xenografts was associated with increased sensitivity to the death-inducing effects of drugs, phosphatidylserine (PS) externalisation and caspase-3/-7 activity after drug exposure, indicating that p21WAF1 may exert an anti-apoptotic activity. As proof of principle, p21WAF1 was silenced in Nalm-6 cells by micro-RNA transduction and these cells exhibited increased sensitivity and rapid PS externalisation after drug exposure. A combination of a p21WAF1 inhibitory agent and vorinostat gave some pharmacological evidence to suggest that p21WAF1 inhibition could enhance drug efficacy. Overall, these investigations provide insight into the epigenetic regulation of p21WAF1 and demonstrate an anti-apoptotic role for p21WAF1 in childhood ALL cells.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cell death</field><field name="subject">Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia</field><field name="subject">p21WAF1</field><field name="subject">Apoptosis</field><field name="subject">Vorinostat</field><field name="subject">p53</field><field name="subject">Xenograft</field><field name="subject">Epigenetics</field><field name="subject">Phosphatidylserine</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44416</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Language identification with language and feature dependency</field><field name="creator">Yin, Bo, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The purpose of Language Identification (LID) is to identify a specific language from a spoken utterance, automatically. Language-specific characteristics are always associated with different languages. Most existing LID approaches utilise a statistical modelling process with common acoustic/phonotactic features to model specific languages while avoiding any language-specific knowledge. Great successes have been achieved in this area over past decades. However, there is still a huge gap between these languageindependent methods and the actual language-specific patterns. It is extremely useful to address these specific acoustic or semantic construction patterns, without spending huge labour on annotation which requires language-specific knowledge. Inspired by this goal, this research focuses on the language-feature dependency. Several practical methods have been proposed. Various features and modelling techniques have been studied in this research. Some of them carry out additional language-specific information without manual labelling, such as a novel duration modelling method based on articulatory features, and a novel Frequency-Modulation (FM) based feature. The performance of each individual feature is studied for each of the language-pair combinations. The similarity between languages and the contribution in identifying a language by using a particular feature are defined for the first time, in a quantitative style. These distance measures and languagedependent contributions become the foundations of the later-presented frameworks ?? language-dependent weighting and hierarchical language identification. The latter particularly provides remarkable flexibility and enhancement when identifying a relatively large number of languages and accents, due to the fact that the most discriminative feature or feature-combination is used when separating each of the languages. The proposed systems are evaluated in various corpora and task contexts including NIST language recognition evaluation tasks. The performances have been improved in various degrees. The key techniques developed for this work have also been applied to solve a different problem other than LID ?? speech-based cognitive load monitoring.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Language distance</field><field name="subject">Language identification</field><field name="subject">Language-feature dependency</field><field name="subject">Language clustering</field><field name="subject">Fusion</field><field name="subject">Audio classification</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44045</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Preclinical and phase I studies of phenoxodiol: a translational approach for the development of a novel isoflavone for the treatment of prostate cancer</field><field name="creator">de Souza, Paul Linus, Clinical School - St George Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">This work presents an investigation of the potential development of phenoxodiol, a novel isoflavone, for the treatment of prostate cancer. The literature concerning isoflavone epidemiology, pharmacology, clinical use and their effect on prostate cancer is reviewed. Isoflavone impact on signal transduction pathways is also reviewed with a particular focus on the Akt / mTOR signal transduction pathway, a key signaling pathway in prostate cancer cells. In vitro experiments and xenograft nude mice studies show that phenoxodiol inhibits the growth of DU145 and PC3 prostate cancer cells, when used alone and in combination with cisplatin or carboplatin. Phenoxodiol in combination with cisplatin is highly synergistic when inhibiting the growth of DU145 cells in particular. We show for the first time, that phenoxodiol and cisplatin or carboplatin, inhibits phosphorylation of Akt and mTOR in DU145 and PC3 cells. A first-in-human study of single dose phenoxodiol investigating its pharmacokinetic properties in cancer patient volunteers was performed. Extensive conjugation of phenoxodiol and a short half-life was noted in this study. A Phase I study of intravenous phenoxodiol administered weekly to patients with advanced cancer was then performed to assess toxicity of a repeated dose schedule, as well as the maximum tolerated dose. This schedule was well tolerated in patients, with lymphocytopenia noted as the main toxicity. Given the short half-life of phenoxodiol and our preclinical studies suggesting that combination with cisplatin and carboplatin synergistically inhibited prostate cancer cell growth, we also undertook a Phase I dose escalation study of oral phenoxodiol administered in combination with cisplatin or carboplatin to patients with advanced cancer. The main adverse events include hyperglycemia, hypocalcemia, mild transaminase rises, as well as nausea, constipation, infusion site reactions and lethargy.

This question is investigated through a focus on practice-led research, on materiality and novel methodologies. The materiality centers on the development of new biologically based Genetic art media. These new methodologies entail practice-based interpretations and experimentation of literal and invented molecular recombinant DNA processes. These procedures necessitated working inside molecular biology laboratories as art studios. The idiosyncratic and problematical dimensions of working within a science domain as part of this practical paradigm are presented to contextualize the work relative to more conventional approaches.  The conceptual basis of the project is shown to emanate out of the practice. This experiential strategy was part of the overall approach adopted for this project. Accordingly that underpins the practice as research and also forms the general structure for the written chapters.  Conceptually, the broader results were the development of two main concepts for Genetic art. These are shown to be a direct consequence of a shift in the material nature of the project&#146;s mature phases of practice. These concepts are the Genetic Portmanteaux and the concept of the Protoanimate Condition. They entail reinterpretations of recombinant semi ready-mades and the notion of the inanimate applied to non-coding DNA.  This is important in relation to extant and novel DNA code scripts, especially regarding a particular form of biological inanimate material, the noncoding DNA known as introns. In the Proto-animate Condition argument, introns represent a recondite and temporal state in a pending or protoanimated condition within a recombinant environment.  The major results and conclusions expressed in creative terms are the development of several novel DNA scripts and the practical materialization of these recombinants via the agency of installation. Seven exhibitions including five installations were created and published within curated forums. Overall they imbue qualities such as the temporal, the recondite, the anticipatory and the creative recombinant complexion of DNA material. This is proffered as a fecund area for new art-based explorations and critiques of developments in both contemporary art and science.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44087</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ecology of heteroblasty in Acacia</field><field name="creator">Forster, Michael Anthony, Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Heteroblasty defines a dramatic change in leaf form and function along a shoot and is a prominent feature of the genus Acacia (Mimosaceae). Function of different leaf types in Acacia (i.e. compound leaf versus phyllode) is well established yet it is unknown whether heteroblasty is a plastic trait. A fully factorial designed experiment established the light environment, and not nutrients or water, had a significant influence on heteroblastic development. Compound leaves, which have higher specific leaf area (SLA), are retained for longer under low irradiance and, specifically, under a low Red:Far Red light environment. Plants grown in high intraspecific density environments also retained compound leaves for longer. Blue light signals and greater ultraviolet radiation had no effect on heteroblastic development. Heteroblasty is thought to aid in seedling establishment however across all experiments there was no consistent evidence of improved plant performance. Rather, there was an optimal allocation of biomass to organs where resources were most limiting and this was more influential in assisting seedling establishment. Lastly, a meta-analysis of a global dataset of leaf traits found compound leaves to be similar to simple leaves but offset towards the cheap to construct with fast returns region of the leaf economics spectrum.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Phyllode</field><field name="subject">Light environment</field><field name="subject">Heterophylly</field><field name="subject">Compound leaves</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44100</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mortality among the recipients of methadone, buprenorphine and naltrexone maintenance for the treatment of opioid dependence: the levels, predictors and causes of mortality</field><field name="creator">Gibson, Amy Elizabeth, National Drug &amp; Alcohol Research Centre, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Opioid dependence is a complex and persistent disorder with a high mortality rate and severe impact on health and social situation. It is associated with much harm, including the transmission of blood-borne bacterial and viral infections, self-harm, traumatic injury and drug overdose. All of these harms carry a risk of death, and accordingly, mortality rates in opioid-dependent people are many times higher than those in the general population of the same age and sex. One of the more commonly used strategies for reducing the risks of opioid dependence is the provision of maintenance treatment. In Australia, available maintenance treatments include methadone, buprenorphine, oral naltrexone, and the unregistered sustained-release formulation of naltrexone, naltrexone implants. This thesis reports on a range of data collections and study designs to investigate the levels, predictors and causes of mortality in opioid-dependent persons entering methadone, buprenorphine and naltrexone maintenance treatment in Australia. The studies used data linkage to examine mortality rates and causes of death in a longitudinal cohort of the early entrants to the NSW methadone program, examined the predictors of mortality (particularly the impact of methadone and buprenorphine treatment) using survival analysis in a longitudinal cohort study, compared national mortality rates between methadone, buprenorphine and naltrexone maintenance treatments in a cross-sectional analytic study, and used a small case series of coronial cases to examine whether death from opioid overdose was possible in a recipient of a naltrexone implant. This thesis demonstrates that mortality rates as a whole and from particular causes of death are many times higher in Australian opioid-dependent subjects than the general population, exposure to methadone or buprenorphine maintenance treatment significantly reduced mortality in a sample of opioid-dependent subjects, naltrexone treatment appears to have higher mortality than both methadone and buprenorphine maintenance treatments, and fatal opioid overdose while in receipt of sustained-release naltrexone treatment is possible. These results support longer retention in and repeated access to methadone and buprenorphine maintenance treatments in order to reduce mortality in opioid-dependent people, and greater regulation of the access to and more rigorous monitoring of the mortality associated with oral and sustained-release naltrexone maintenance treatments.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maintenance treatment</field><field name="subject">Opioid dependence</field><field name="subject">Mortality</field><field name="subject">Methadone</field><field name="subject">Buprenorphine</field><field name="subject">Naltrexone</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44508</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Impact of steel ductility on the structural behaviour and strength of RC slabs</field><field name="creator">Sakka, Zafer, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the effects of reinforcement ductility on the strength and ductility of reinforced concrete slabs. An extensive experimental program examining the ultimate strength, ductility and failure mode of one-way and two-way reinforced concrete slabs is described and the results are presented and analysed. A numerical finite element model is developed and calibrated using the experimental data. The model is described and shown to accurately simulate the collapse load behaviour of reinforced concrete slabs containing reinforcement of any ductility class, including Class L welded wire fabric. Parametric studies using the numerical model to assess the effects of reinforcement ductility on structural behaviour are also presented and recommendations are made on the minimum reinforcement ductility levels appropriate for use in suspended slabs. The experimental and numerical tests investigated slabs with different types of boundary conditions (simply supported and continuous one-way slabs, corner-supported single panel two slabs and edge-supported two-way slabs), support settlement, steel reinforcement ratio, steel uniform elongation (&#61541;su), steel ultimate to yield stress ratio (fsu/fsy) and rectangularity aspect ratio in the two-way slabs. In total, thirty one slabs were tested. The one-way slabs included four simply supported slabs, seven continuous slabs, and five continuous slabs with support settlement. The two-way slabs included eleven square and rectangular corner-supported slabs and four rectangular edge-supported slabs. The one-way simply-supported slabs were 850mm in width, 100mm in depth and 2,500mm in length. The continuous one-way slabs were 850mm in width, 100mm in depth and 4,350mm in length. The continuous one-way slabs and subjected to support settlement were 850mm in width, 120mm in depth and 6,300mm in length. The square two-way slabs had an edge length of 2,400mm and a depth of 100mm and the rectangular two-way slabs had width of 2,400mm, a length of 3,600mm and a depth of 100mm.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Strain localization</field><field name="subject">Steel ductility</field><field name="subject">RC slabs</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44518</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stochastic analysis and robust design of stiffened composite structures</field><field name="creator">Lee, Merrill Cheng Wei, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The European Commission 6th Framework Project COCOMAT (Improved MATerial Exploitation at Safe Design of COmposite Airframe Structures by Accurate Simulation of COllapse) was a four and a half year project (2004 to mid-2008) aimed at exploiting the large reserve of strength in composite structures through more accurate prediction of collapse. In the experimental work packages, significant statistical variation in buckling behaviour and ultimate loading were encountered. The variations observed in the experimental results were not predicted in the finite element analyses that were done in the early stages of the project.  The work undertaken in this thesis to support the COCOMAT project was initiated when it was recognised that there was a gap in knowledge about the effect of initial defects and variations in the input variables of both the experimental and simulated panels. The work involved the development of stochastic algorithms to relate variations in boundary conditions, material properties and geometries to the variation in buckling modes and loads up to first failure. It was proposed in this thesis that any future design had to focus on the dominant parameters affecting the statistical scatter in the results to achieve lower sensitivity to variation. A methodology was developed for designing stiffened composite panels with improved robustness. Several panels tested in the COCOMAT project were redesigned using this approach to demonstrate its applicability.  The original contributions from this thesis are therefore the development of a stochastic methodology to identify the impact of variation in input parameters on the response of stiffened composite panels and the development of Robust Indices to support the design of new panels. The stochastic analysis included the generation of metamodels that allow quantification of the impact that the inputs have on the response using two first order variables, Influence and Sensitivity. These variables are then used to derive the Robust Indices. A significant outcome of this thesis was the recognition in the final report for COCOMAT that the development of a validated robust index should be a focus of any future design of postbuckling stiffened panels.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Collapse</field><field name="subject">COCOMAT</field><field name="subject">Stiffened Composite Structures</field><field name="subject">Uncertainty</field><field name="subject">Robust Design</field><field name="subject">Postbuckling and Collapse</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44217</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of low-cost carriers on regional dispersal of domestic visitors in Australia: examinations of the effects on visitors' dispersal sourced from intra-modal and inter-modal differentials</field><field name="creator">Koo, Tay Tae-Ryang, Aviation, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis was conceived in the context of post-2000 proliferation of Australian low-cost carriers and regional dispersal policy of the Australian government. The broad aim of this thesis is to examine the effects of low-cost carriers on regional dispersal of domestic visitors. Based on existing theoretical frameworks of tourists?? spatial behaviour and multi-destination travel itinerary, two theoretical constructs - intra-modal and inter-modal effects ?? were developed to conceptualise the regional dispersal effects of low-cost carriers. The former refers to differences between low-cost carriers and other models of airline business, and the latter refers to differences between low-cost carriers and other modes of transport. Logit models and national-level revealed preference data were used to examine the intra-modal effects, while stated choice method was used to examine the inter-modal effects on two representative regional tourism destinations - Ballina-Byron and Cairns - in Australia.     This thesis provides evidence that suggest low-cost carrier air arrivals tend to disperse for reasons that are different from network carrier air arrivals, supporting the significance of intra-modal effects on regional dispersal. It is claimed that the intra-modal effect is one reason why some destinations observe high growth in airport activity as a result of low-cost carrier entry, but the levels of tourism activities do not match that extrapolated from the level of growth in the incoming air traffic. Two case studies have shown that (1) ground transport policy can completely offset the negative effects on tourists?? dispersal propensity stemming from pre-determined trip characteristics, although the effectiveness of such policy variables varies significantly across destinations; and (2) significant discounts in airfares are sufficient to trigger a modal switch, even in situations when a car is the most suitable mode for the trip, suggesting a real possibility of a bypass of ground-mode-reliant regions. The findings should be of interest to regional destination managers with low-cost carrier services as much as for managers in peripheral destinations without low-cost carrier services.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44281</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Banana-kids: Chineseness in the contemporary Australian community</field><field name="creator">Cham, Douglas, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">The MFA research project Banana-kids: Chineseness in the contemporary Australian community comprises a body of studio work, largely ceramic, and an accompanying document. Its aim is to investigate the effect of ??Chineseness?? inscribed on those Chinese Australians born in Australia or arriving in infancy, in contemporary Australian society. The study commences with the experience of my Australian-born mother who dressed as an Australian, talked as an Australian and thought as an Australian, but nonetheless looked physically Chinese. She was assimilated into the Australian community; however, she was not allowed to return to Australia from Hong Kong at the end of World War II, despite holding an Australian birth certificate, since she had married in Hong Kong before the war and her passport had been burnt during the period of conflict. The studio component of the study is realized as a Chinese formal dinner setting which includes chopstick-holders reconfigured as Australian animals and a Chinese labourer??s carrying device, ??Jook-sing??, as a flower vase. Narrative and parody are engaged in the work as a means of reflecting on ??Aussie culture?? through my eyes as a Chinese artist. The twelve chopstick-holders each manifest ??Chineseness?? as well as certain characteristics of Australian culture. The document applies the methodology of exegesis to record and elucidate the development of the research. It is expected that the installation of these studio outcomes will arouse in the viewer an awareness of the attitudes and responses that the Australian-born Chinese experience everyday.

The dissolution rate was deduced from the measured changes in concentration of oxides in slag with respect to reaction time. The experimental set- up was initially tested with dissolution of magnesia in the CaO ??? 55 wt% Al2O3 slag at 1430 ??C and a measured rate of 2.7 ??10 -5 g/cm2.s was obtained. The dissolution rate was increased by slag chemistry and ranged from 6.5??10-5 to 2.1??10-4 g/cm2.s. The dissolution rate of CaO was measured in CaO ??? 42 wt% Al2O3 ??? 8% SiO2 based slag. The measured dissolution rates were found to be strongly dependent on the slag chemistry and temperature and ranged from 5.03??10 -5 to 3.3??10 -4 g/cm2.s. The dissolution rates were strongly dependent on the rotation speed and results indicate mass transfer in the slag phase to be rate- limiting step. The diffusivity of MgO / CaO was calculated from the dissolution rate and solubility data, using known mass transfer correlations. The diffusivity of MgO in the calcium aluminate slag at 1430 ??C was found to be about 1.1??10-5 cm2/s. Additions of 5 and 10 wt% Fe2O3 increased the diffusivity by a factor ~ 1.5 to 3, respectively. However, with introduction of (CaF2 5 wt% + Fe2O3 5 wt%) and (CaF2 5 wt% + Fe2O3 10 wt%) in the slag, the diffusivity increased considerably by a factor of about 29 and 11, respectively. The diffusivity of CaO in calcium aluminosilicate was measured to be in the order of 10-6 to 10-5 over a temperature range of 1430 ??? 1600 ??C. CaF2 increased the diffusivity by a factor of 3 to 5 while MnOx and FeOx, ilmenite and TiO 2 increased the diffusivity substantially and SiO2 had an opposite effect. The measured diffusivities are in accord with published data on comparable systems and are discussed with reference to Eyring theory. It was concluded that MnOx, FeOx and ilmenite in the slag increase the dissolution rate and diffusivity of lime, showing comparable results with respect to CaF2.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">slag</field><field name="subject">steel</field><field name="subject">lime</field><field name="subject">flux (metallurgy).</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22469</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Global management consultancy in China</field><field name="creator">Wang, Yaqing, Organisation &amp; Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Management consultancy has received increasing academic interest due to its growing importance in the global economy. However, current research has been predominantly focused on consulting companies in Anglo-American and European countries. This thesis aims to provide a focused study of the practice of global management consultancies operating outside of the western context. China is commonly regarded as having distinctive market and industrial conditions that distinguish it from western developed countries. Based on empirical evidence from interviews and participant observation, this thesis examines the activities of global consulting companies at market, firm and client project levels in China, with a focus on the deployment of their global knowledge resources. The central question explored in the thesis is whether and to what extent the Chinese context has limited the diffusion of global management consultancies and the applicability of their western management knowledge. This thesis finds that in China global management consultancies have emphasized their international image and extensively replicated global models of management. While importing global knowledge assets has had mostly positive effects at market and firm level of practice, it has caused a mix of benefits and challenges during the actual consultation process due to insufficient and inappropriate adaptation.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">Management Consultancy</field><field name="subject">Knowledge transfer</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44397</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The diary of Saga Moor</field><field name="creator">Garner , Soma, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">The Diary of Saga Moor is the textural component accompanying the studio-based research as part of my MFA.

The diary parallels my own life, as history imitates fiction and art imitates life.

The successful treatment of disease is hampered due to the multidrug resistant (MDR) phenotype exhibited by the bacterial pathogens.   Therefore, the aims of this thesis were to investigate MDR through several different approaches. Integrons are important contributors to the MDR profile of nosocomial isolates within Australia, therefore the incidence of integrons was assessed in a collection of 72 conjugative clinical plasmids isolated from E. coli, a cohort of 30 urinary tract infection (UTI) isolates and a cohort of four bacteria producing metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs).  Integrons were found in 63% (45/72) of the conjugative plasmids by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).  Sequencing of gene cassette arrays revealed that cassettes of the dfr and aadA families were most common.  Within the cohort of UTI bacteria, 37% (11/30) were positive for class 1 integrons, and the dfrA17-aadA5 gene cassette array was most common.  The four MBL-producers contained the gene cassette blaIMP-4 found within a class 1 integron which was responsible for the MBL phenotype.  An assay based on real-time PCR was also developed to measure the recombination activity of the integron integrase (IntI) enzymes.  The existing method of IntI measurement, the in vivo conduction assay, was used as a basis for the development of the real-time PCR assay.  Five 59-be from the gene cassettes aadB, orfA, sat2, dfrA1 and aacA4 were cloned as recognition sites used in the real-time PCR assay.  IntI1 was the most active integrase and showed an activity of 2.31 ?? 10??-1 when recombining the aadB and orfA 59-be.  The highest level of class 2 integrase activity was 2.00 ?? 10-1?? during recombination of the sat2 and dfrA1 59-be, while IntI3 showed its highest recombination frequency of 2.29 ?? 10-1?? when the aadB and orfA 59-be were used.  Additionally, the real-time PCR assay was used assess the levels of IntI activity over time.  Using this method, the level of recombination as time progressed remained stable at a level of 4.10 ?? 10-2????.  MDR was also analysed in 37 Acinetobacter baumannii isolates which were collected from four hospitals in Sydney.   Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) analysis to 25 antibiotics revealed that all isolates showed a reduced susceptibility to between five and 24 antibiotics.  PCR was performed to detect the presence of resistance determinants.  Class 1 integrons encoding resistance to aminoglycosides, antiseptics and disinfectants were found in 35 % (13/37) of the isolates.  Aminoglycoside resistance genes including aphA1 (12/37), strA (1/37) and strB (22/39) were also found.  Resistance to beta-lactams was also observed in all isolates, which correlated with the presence of the ampC and blaOXA-51-like genes.  The insertion sequence ISAba1 which provides an alternative promoter leading to increased gene expression was found upstream of the ampC gene in 29 isolates; the same isolates also contained the identical insertion sequence upstream of the carbapenemase resistance gene blaOXA-23.  These 29 isolates also possessed the tetracycline resistance gene tetB.  All but one of these 29 isolates also contained the gene blaTEM-1.  Resistance to quinolones and fluoroquinolones was attributed to the presence of a Ser83-Leu83 gyrA mutation present in 36 resistant isolates.  Furthermore, a putative dihydrofolate resistance gene, folA, was found in all isolates.  Repetitive extragenic palindromic PCR revealed the presence of seven clonal groups.  Overall, this study demonstrated the widespread impact and dissemination of MDR within nosocomial settings in Australia.  The use of new assays, such as the real-time PCR assay developed in this thesis, is essential to the understanding of dissemination of antibiotic resistance.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Clinical outbreak</field><field name="subject">Antibiotic resistance</field><field name="subject">Integrons</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44381</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In silico virulence prediction and virulence gene discovery of Streptococcus agalactiae</field><field name="creator">Lin, Frank Po-Yen, Centre for Health Informatics, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Physicians frequently face challenges in predicting which bacterial subpopulations are likely to cause severe infections. A more accurate prediction of virulence would improve diagnostics and limit the extent of antibiotic resistance. Nowadays, bacterial pathogens can be typed with high accuracy with advanced genotyping technologies. However, effective translation of bacterial genotyping data into assessments of clinical risk remains largely unexplored.  The discovery of unknown virulence genes is another key determinant of successful prediction of infectious disease outcomes. The trial-and-error method for virulence gene discovery is time-consuming and resource-intensive. Selecting candidate genes with higher precision can thus reduce the number of futile trials. Several in silico candidate gene prioritisation (CGP) methods have been proposed to aid the search for genes responsible for inherited diseases in human. It remains uninvestigated as to how the CGP concept can assist with virulence gene discovery in bacterial pathogens.  The main contribution of this thesis is to demonstrate the value of translational bioinformatics methods to address challenges in virulence prediction and virulence gene discovery. This thesis studied an important perinatal bacterial pathogen, group B streptococcus (GBS), the leading cause of neonatal sepsis and meningitis in developed countries. While several antibiotic prophylactic programs have successfully reduced the number of early-onset neonatal diseases (infections that occur within 7 days of life), the prevalence of late-onset infections (infections that occur between 7??30 days of life) remained constant. In addition, the widespread use of intrapartum prophylactic antibiotics may introduce undue risk of penicillin allergy and may trigger the development of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms. To minimising such potential harm, a more targeted approach of antibiotic use is required. Distinguish virulent GBS strains from colonising counterparts thus lays the cornerstone of achieving the goal of tailored therapy.  There are three aims of this thesis:  1. Prediction of virulence by analysis of bacterial genotype data: To identify markers that may be associated with GBS virulence, statistical analysis was performed on GBS genotype data consisting of 780 invasive and 132 colonising S. agalactiae isolates. From a panel of 18 molecular markers studied, only alp3 gene (which encodes a surface protein antigen commonly associated with serotype V) showed an increased association with invasive diseases (OR=2.93, p=0.0003, Fisher??s exact test). Molecular serotype II (OR=10.0, p=0.0007) was found to have a significant association with early-onset neonatal disease when compared with late-onset diseases. To investigate whether clinical outcomes can be predicted by the panel of genotype markers, logistic regression and machine learning algorithms were applied to distinguish invasive isolates from colonising isolates. Nevertheless, the predictive analysis only yielded weak predictive power (area under ROC curve, AUC: 0.56??0.71, stratified 10-fold cross-validation). It was concluded that a definitive predictive relationship between the molecular markers and clinical outcomes may be lacking, and more discriminative markers of GBS virulence are needed to be investigated.  2. Development of two computational CGP methods to assist with functional discovery of prokaryotic genes: Two in silico CGP methods were developed based on comparative genomics: statistical CGP exploits the differences in gene frequency against phenotypic groups, while inductive CGP applies supervised machine learning to identify genes with similar occurrence patterns across a range of bacterial genomes.  Three rediscovery experiments were carried out to evaluate the CGP methods: a) Rediscovery of peptidoglycan genes was attempted with 417 published bacterial genome sequences. Both CGP methods achieved their best AUC &gt;0.911 in Escherichia coli K-12 and &gt;0.978 Streptococcus agalactiae 2603 (SA-2603) genomes, with an average improvement in precision of &gt;3.2-fold and a maximum of &gt;27-fold using statistical CGP. A median AUC of &gt;0.95 could still be achieved with as few as 10 genome examples in each group in the rediscovery of the peptidoglycan metabolism genes. b) A maximum of 109-fold improvement in precision was achieved in the rediscovery of anaerobic fermentation genes. c) In the rediscovery experiment with genes of 31 metabolic pathways in SA-2603, 14 pathways achieved an AUC &gt;0.9 and 28 pathways achieved AUC &gt;0.8 with the best inductive CGP algorithms. The results from the rediscovery experiments demonstrated that the two CGP methods can assist with the study of functionally uncategorised genomic regions and the discovery of bacterial gene-function relationships.  3. Application of the CGP methods to discover GBS virulence genes: Both statistical and inductive CGP were applied to assist with the discovery of unknown GBS virulence factors. Among a list of hypothetical protein genes, several highly-ranked genes were plausibly involved in molecular mechanisms in GBS pathogenesis, including several genes encoding family 8 glycosyltransferase, family 1 and family 2 glycosyltransferase, multiple adhesins, streptococcal neuraminidase, staphylokinase, and other factors that may have roles in contributing to GBS virulence.

It is based on the exploration of the interpretations of busi zhi si &#19981;&#20284;&#20043;&#20284; (likeness of unlikeness), which has searched for the answers to a question how it is possible to interpret and apply the concept of ??likeness?? and ??essence?? of an object as depicted by Chinese traditional artists. More importantly, it has led to a process in which a contemporary artist endeavours to apply a particularly traditional concept to contemporary drawing practice properly. It is this approach towards Chinese aesthetics and philosophy with proper attitudes, which has greatly oriented the research in terms of its methodology. The focus of this research has been on the application of the designed methods, including the implementation of the methods in drawing, evaluation of the outcomes and reflection of the evaluation in practice. This written work serves as documentation and explanation of how this process has been carried out, as drawing has been the major component of the research. Chinese traditional learning method has been interpreted philosophically in this research in order to set up the practical methods to reach the main goal of depicting the essential likeness of the object. However, due to the various mediums being employed, distinctive from Chinese traditional medium, the Chinese learning methods have been interpreted as being imitations of the traditional way of depicting the objects. Three aspects in depicting the object, which are observation, outer likeness and interpretative likeness, have been studied in relation to Chinese aesthetics. This process of research has provided a means to build a bridge between Chinese and western aesthetical grounds on depictions of the likeness and essence of an object. The promising future of this ongoing research therefore seems to be more exciting to drawers with particular interests in applying aesthetic concepts in practice.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44347</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Controlled synthetic approach to di- and trinuclear ruthenium acetylide complexes</field><field name="creator">Shearer, Timothy Kenneth, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the synthesis and characterisation of a variety of acetylide-bridged di- and trinuclear ruthenium acetylide complexes that were prepared in a controlled fashion, and the preparation and characterisation of the ruthenium(II) complexes required for these stepwise reactions. These precursor complexes, or building blocks, include dimethyl-, acetylidomethyl-, and bis(acetylido)ruthenium(II) complexes. An introduction to metal acetylide chemistry is presented in Chapter 1. The previous research in this area is briefly reviewed, and the potential applications of these complexes are highlighted. The primary aims of this course of work are outlined, namely, to develop a controlled synthetic approach to the synthesis of oligonuclear ruthenium acetylide complexes. The synthetic strategies for this aim are introduced in Chapter 2, and the synthetic routes to cis and trans-Ru(CH3)2(dmpe)2 (25/23) and cis and trans-Ru(CH3)2(depe)2 (26/24) are described. Characterisation of the novel, synthetically important trans-Ru(CH3)2(dmpe)2 (23) is completed by an examination of its X-Ray crystallographic structure. Chapter 3 describes the thermal and photochemical metathesis reactions of trans-Ru(CH3)2(dmpe)2 (23) with terminal acetylenes, and the preparation of a variety of acetylidomethylruthenium(II) complexes, trans-Ru(CH3)(C&#8801;CR)(dmpe)2 (R = Ph (30), tBu (31), SiMe3 (32), C6H4-4-tBu (33), C6H3-3,5-tBu2 (34), C6H4-4-C&#8801;CH (35), C6H4-4-OCH3 (36), C6H4-4-CH3 (37), C6H3-3,5-(CF3)2 (38)). The characterisation of these complexes by NMR spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy and X-Ray crystallography is presented. A clean and high yielding synthesis of the synthetically significant unsymmetrical bis(acetylido)ruthenium(II) complexes was developed via the reaction of an acetylidomethylruthenium(II) complex with an excess of a second terminal alkyne in a mixture of methanol and benzene. The characterisation of the novel complexes trans-Ru(C&#8801;CR)(C&#8801;CR&#8242;)(dmpe)2 (R = Ph, R&#8242; = tBu (40), SiMe3 (41), C6H4-4-C&#8801;CH (44); R = tBu, R&#8242; = SiMe3 (42), C6H4-4-C&#8801;CH (43), C6H4-4-tBu (45), C6H3-3,5-tBu2 (46)) by NMR and IR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and X-Ray crystallography is described in Chapter 4. Additionally, Chapter 4 describes the synthesis and characterisation of symmetrical bis(acetylido)ruthenium(II) complexes, and a number of organic butenyne compounds, which were observed as by-products from the attempted synthesis of several of the bis(acetylido)ruthenium(II) complexes. Dinuclear ruthenium(II) complexes were prepared by the reaction of trans-Ru(C&#8801;CR)(C&#8801;CC6H4-4-C&#8801;CH)(dmpe)2 (R = tBu (43) or Ph (44)) with an acetylidomethylruthenium(II) complex in toluene and methanol. Both symmetrical and unsymmetical dinuclear complexes could be prepared in this way, and were characterised by a range of techniques including NMR spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and X-Ray crystallography, and are described in Chapter 5. In addition, an electrochemical study of one of the dinuclear complexes was undertaken using cyclic voltammetry. The symmetrical trinuclear ruthenium(II) complexes, trans,trans,trans- (RC&#8801;C)Ru(dmpe)2(&#956;-C&#8801;CC6H4C&#8801;C)Ru(depe)2(&#956;-C&#8801;CC6H4C&#8801;C)Ru(dmpe)2(C&#8801;CR) (R = Ph (80), tBu (81), SiMe3 (82)) was prepared by the reaction of two equivalents of an acetylidomethylruthenium(II) complex with the symmetrical bis(acetylido)ruthenium(II) complex, trans-Ru(C&#8801;CC6H4-4-C&#8801;CH)2(depe)2 (54), in toluene and methanol. These syntheses, and the subsequent characterisation of the products are also reported in Chapter 5. The primary aim of this thesis, viz. the synthesis and characterisation of acetylide bridged di- and trinuclear ruthenium acetylide complexes in a controlled fashion, was successfully achieved.

ABCA1 deficiency causes Tangier disease and several ABCA1 modulations have been recently associated with Alzheimer&#146;s disease. Prior research on ABCA7 focused on its role in macrophage lipid efflux and phagocytosis, however, tissue expression studies in mice revealed that ABCA7 is highly expressed in the brain. The function of ABCA7 in the brain is unknown and the purpose of this thesis was therefore to investigate the potential function of ABCA7 in the brain and the possible implications for Alzheimer&#146;s disease. This was achieved by using in vitro models that transiently express ABCA7 and in vivo models including ABCA7 knockout (ABCA7 KO) mice and human APP transgenic (APPSwInd Tg) mice. ABCA7 was shown to potently stimulate cholesterol efflux from cells to extracellular apoE acceptors. Additionally, apoE expression was decreased by 20% in the brains of ABCA7 KO mice compared to wild type littermate controls and by 46% in ABCA7-deficient macrophages. In vitro models that stably express human APP protein demonstrated that the transient expression of ABCA7 increased intracellular APP targeting, which led to the inhibition of APP processing and a resultant decrease in the production of A&#946;. In addition, ABCA7-deficient macrophages displayed impaired capacity to endocytose and degrade A&#946; oligomers. Finally, in aged APPSwInd Tg mice where abundant amyloid plaques were present, ABCA7 expression was significantly decreased by 48%. Since cholesterol homeostasis modulates APP processing, the findings of this thesis suggest that ABCA7 may have a role in maintaining cellular cholesterol homeostasis via cholesterol efflux to apoE acceptors and possibly by regulating intracellular trafficking of specific membrane proteins. In summary, ABCA7 was clearly shown in this thesis to have an effect on A&#946; generation, clearance and degradation. Furthermore, ABCA7 expression was also affected by A&#946; deposition in the brain. Even though more work is required to further elucidate the exact function of ABCA7, the findings presented in this thesis provide the first clues to the function of ABCA7 in the brain.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Amyloid beta</field><field name="subject">ABCA7</field><field name="subject">Alzheimer's disease</field><field name="subject">APP processing</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44409</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Deterministic and associated stochastic methods for dynamical systems</field><field name="creator">Angstmann, Christopher N., Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">An introduction to periodic orbit techniques for deterministic dynamical systems is presented. The Farey map is considered as examples of intermittency in one-dimensional maps. The effect of intermittency on the Markov partition is considered. The Gauss map is shown to be related to the farey map by a simple transformation of trajectories.  A method of calculating periodic orbits in the thermostated Lorentz gas is derived. This method relies on minimising the action from the Hamiltonian description of the Lorentz gas, as well as the construction of a generating partition of the phase space. This method is employed to examine a range of bifurcation processes in the Lorentz gas.  A novel construction of the Sinai billiard is performed by using symmetry arguments to reduce two particles in a hard walled box to the square Sinai billiard. Infinite families of periodic orbits are found, even at the lowest order, due to the intermittency of the system. The contribution of these orbits is examined and found to be tractable at the lowest order. The number of orbits grows too quickly for consideration of any other terms in the periodic orbit expansion.  A simple stochastic model for the diffusion in the Lorentz gas was constructed. The model produced a diffusion coefficient that was a remarkably good fit to more precise numerical calculations. This is a significant improvement to the Machta-Zwanzig approximation for the diffusion coefficient. We outline a general approach to constructing stochastic models of deterministic dynamical systems. This method should allow for calculations to be performed in more complicated systems.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Periodic orbits</field><field name="subject">Farey map</field><field name="subject">Lorentz gas</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44401</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The perception and comprehension of prosthetic vison: patient rehabilitation and image processing considerations from simulated prosthetic vision psychophysics</field><field name="creator">Chen, Spencer Chin-Yu, Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">A successful restoration of vision should allow the blind to look, to see and to understand. The engineering of a microelectronic vision prosthesis has come a long way over the last forty years, but the understanding of how the restored form of vision would be interpreted and functionally applied to everyday living has made little progress until recent times. Prosthetic vision is not what most people think it would be; it is a visual scene composed of relatively large, isolated, spots of light so-called "phosphenes", very much like a magnified pictorial print. This thesis dissertation seeks to obtain a complete survey of the visual description of phosphenes from the human trial reports in the literature, simulate it, obtain a measure of the functional capacity of such visual perception, and explain the measured performance against design aspects of phosphene presentation, human perception, cognition and behaviour. Specifically, "visual acuity" (VA) was assessed on normally sighted subjects (N=15) administered with "simulated prosthetic vision". VA is a functional measure of vision highly correlated to many daily activities. Aggregating the results from the study with the other VA studies in prosthetic vision, it is shown that in general, the density of the phosphene field determines the affordable VA; however, design aspects relating to the phosphene field lattice (0.03 10gMAR with the hexagonal lattice as opposed to a square lattice) and image processing routines (0.15 10gMAR at optimised settings) can be further fine-tuned to improve VA performance. Significant performance improvement also arose from learning (0.13 10gMAR over ten visitations) and visual scanning adaptation (0.20 10gMAR with a circular scanning strategy). Performance improvements are likely related to various preferences and perceptual preferences of the human visual system. A rehabilitation program targeting the appropriate behavioural adaptation coupled with image processing routine optimised for image comprehension should provide a vision prosthesis recipient with the best functional experience to restored vision.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Phosphenes</field><field name="subject">Prosthetic vision</field><field name="subject">Restored vision</field><field name="subject">Vsion acuity (VA)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44414</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dielectric thin film applications for silicon solar cells</field><field name="creator">Song, Yang, Photovoltaics &amp; Renewable Energy Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Dielectric thin films have a long history in silicon photovoltaics. Due to the specific physical properties, they can function as passivation layer in solar cells. Also, they can be used as antireflection coating layers on top of the devices. They can improve the back surface reflectance if proper dielectric layers combination is used. What??s more, they can protect areas by masking during chemical etching, diffusion, metallization among the whole fabrication process.  Crystalline silicon solar cell can be passivated by two ways: one is to deposit dielectric thin films to saturate the dangling bonds; the other is to introduce surface electrical field and repel back the minority carriers. This thesis explores thermally grown SiO2 and sputtered Si3N4(:H) to passivate n-type and thermal evaporation AlF3 to passivate p-type Float Zone silicon wafers, respectively. Sputtering is a cheap passivation method to replace PECVD in industry usage, but all sputtered samples are more likely to have encountered surface damage from neutral Ar and secondary electrons, both coming from the sputtered target. AlF3/SiO2 multi-layer stack is a negative charge combination; p inversion layer will form on the wafer surface.  Light trapping is an important part in solar cell research work. In order to enhance the reflectance and improve the absorption possibility of near infrared photons, especially for high efficiency PERL cell application, the back surface structure is optimized in this work. Results show SiO2/Ag is a very good choice to replace SiO2/Al back reflectors. The maximum back surface reflectance is 97.82%. At the same time, SiO2/Ag has excellent internal angle dependence of reflectance, which is beneficial for surface textured cells. A ZnS/MgF2/SiO2/Al(Ag) superlattice can improve the back reflectance, but it is sensitive to incident angle inside the silicon wafer. If planar wafers are used to investigate all kinds of back reflectors, and an 8 degrees incident angle is fixed for typical spectrometry measurement, the results are easy to predict by Wvase software simulation. If a textured surface is considered, the light path inside the silicon wafer is very complicated and hard to calculate and simulate. The best way to evaluate the result is through experiment.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Passivation</field><field name="subject">Back reflectance</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44486</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship between managerialism and social justice in the development of a community-networking project</field><field name="creator">Bartos, Loreto Renata, Social Sciences &amp; International Studies, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">The nature of debates about managerialism and social justice tend to be adversarial. The purpose of this study is to explore the nature of the relationship between managerialism and social justice. The thesis examines the nature of this relationship in the development of a community-networking project, a pilot website for young people in a high need community. The community-networking project was established through a novel contractual arrangement between government and a local community organisation. In this study social values comprise the analytical lens used to map out this relationship. Kekes??? (1993) approach to ethical pluralism is used to explore the nature of relations between ideas about managerialism and social justice in the process of implementing policy. The study is contextualised in a minor policy proposal of the former federal Liberal Coalition government and associated with a 1998-99 Budget proposal concerned with improving access to and the coordination of family-related information and services including information relating to mental health, child care, youth and aged care (see Black et al. 2002: 10). The policy initiative was established to test a range of assumptions about strong communities. There are two facets to the field study. The first facet explores the process of the implementation of the policy initiative through the different perspectives of three key informants, and the second facet explores the views of end-users of the service to determine whether or not young people were empowered, in the sense of being able to access knowledge about their own lives in terms that have meaning for them. The tone of the study is influenced by my own direct involvement as ???an insider???. Despite the explicit intentions that were supported by research and policy, pragmatic constraints limited the extent to which community organisations were empowered to act outside the demands of government organisations and in this instance, managerialism did act against social justice. However, this did not appear to prevent the end-users of the service that was established from achieving a sense of empowerment.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Social capital</field><field name="subject">Managerialism</field><field name="subject">Social justice</field><field name="subject">Pluralism</field><field name="subject">Social policy</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44487</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ontology of the creative writer and reader: Sartre, Barthes, and Bachelard</field><field name="creator">Lee, Gi Peel, Social Sciences &amp; International Studies, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is to discuss ontological experiences of the writer and reader of literature. It argues that literary creation entails an experience of a state of being where the distance of ??my?? being/speaking and (an)other??s disappears: hence the total union of a being with (an)other. It suggests that this state of being created in the course of literary creation is also significant for everyday life. It analyses the texts of three theorists who addressed this issue: Sartre, Barthes, and Bachelard. Whilst Sartre speaks nothing about a state of being of the creative writer in relation to inspirational otherness, he suggests the change of the writer into a free being, in relation to the reader. Sartre holds that the reader, while becoming a free being, and revealing another (the writer)??s freedom, transforms what s/he is not into his or her own in reading-creation. This implies that in reading-creation, the distance of a being and another disappears. Barthes asserts that in writing the death of the ??author-person?? as an original creator is needed; this means that, for him, writers write finding no distance between themselves and language, which is what speaks itself. Although readers create as ??subject??, Barthes holds, they may find no distance between their being and the text, losing their subjectivity. Bachelard suggests that the poetic dreamer (as both the writer and reader of poetry) experiences a state of being in which neither subjectivity nor object is sensed. In this state, he holds, the speaking of (an)other becomes the speaking of the poetic dreamer. This poetic dreaming state which involves the complete harmony between a dreaming being and other being(s) is termed by Bachelard childhood. He suggests that childhood is permanent and subsistent as an archetypal state of mind and bears witness to the childhood of humankind. As the Bachelardian sense of childhood denotes an ultimate harmonia involving the liberation from the ??prison of self??, it carries significant implications for everyday life.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Reader</field><field name="subject">Creativity</field><field name="subject">Creative Writer</field><field name="subject">Ontology</field><field name="subject">Literary Creation</field><field name="subject">Sartre</field><field name="subject">Barthes</field><field name="subject">Bachelard</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44474</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Joan Kerr in context: a biography</field><field name="creator">Steggall, Susan Margaret, English, Media, &amp; Performing Arts, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Art historian Joan Kerr (1938-2004) championed many little-known artists in her democratic approach to Australian art history. As an architectural historian she held strong views on how ??heritage?? restoration should be conducted. She was always entertaining, at times controversial. Virginia Spate described her as fulfilling Baudelaire??s definition of a critic as ??partial, passionate and political??.1 Using material from Kerr??s personal papers, interviews with Kerr herself and with family members, friends and colleagues, as well as selections from her impressive body of published work, I have aimed to write a sympathetic yet clearsighted biography of a woman who was, to quote her husband Jim Kerr, ??a teacher, writer, wife, mother and possum stirrer??.2 Biography has not always enjoyed academic attention and until late in the 20th century it was traditionally consigned to history.3 Yet this has been an uneasy liaison and biography is now considered a hybrid form, between history and literature, with links to autobiography, psychology, sociology and anthropology. In the introductory chapter I explore the potential of these disciplines for interpreting the facts of a life. I also include a survey of literary biographical writing (including useful models), a discussion of the concept of ??public intellectual?? in relation to Joan Kerr??s reputation in Australian art history and technical issues such as structure, voice and ??speaking for??. Subsequent chapters trace Joan Kerr??s private life ?? childhood, health, education, marriage and motherhood ?? as well as her academic achievements, her work in 19th- and 20th-century Australian art and architectural history, her curatorial practice and major publications, her use of humour and satire and confrontations with art critics, academics and administrators. The final chapter encompasses Kerr??s tribute dinner at Government House in June 2003, her death on 22 February 2004 and funeral on 1 March 2004. In writing this biography I have aimed to do justice to Joan Kerr??s life and work as well as to produce an informed piece of scholarship that could be enjoyed by everyone interested in Australia??s cultural heritage.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44475</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dysregulation of the IL-7/IL-7R system: implications for T-cell homeostasis in HIV-1 infection and pre-B cell oncogenesis</field><field name="creator">Sasson, Sarah Christina, National Centre in HIV Epidemiology &amp; Clinical Research, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Interleukin (IL-)7 acts via its receptor (lL-7R) which consists of a specific a-chain (CD127) dimerised to the common y-chain (CD 132). IL-7R signalling triggers survival and proliferation and plays a central role in T-cell homeostasis, however it's role in B-cell biology remains unclear as does the post ligand-binding fate ofCD127 and CD132.  IL???7 and IL-7R expression on T-cells was examined in different phases of HIV???) infection using ELlSA and flow-cytometry. Novel populations of T-cells based on lL-7R expression were further characterised by flow-cytometry, sjTREC and an HIV-DNA assay. Expression of IL-7R was screened for on a large number of B-cell derived cancers from both HIV-l infected and uninfected hosts, and plasma levels of IL-7 and a number of other cytokines was also measured in these patients by ELlSA or bead array. The effects of exogenous IL-7 on surface COl27 were studied in vitro in B- and T-Iineage cells. A COS-I cellular model of IL-7induced internalisation of CD127 and CD132 using fluorescent and biochemically tagged species was also developed and internalised proteins were studied by epifluorescence microscopy and western blot.  Plasma IL-7 was up-regulated early in primary HIV infection and further so in chronic HIV infection. Elevations of plasma IL-7 inversely correlated with absolute C04+ T-cell count and loss of surface CO127 expression on T-cells. Specifically there was a net loss of COI27+132- and gain in COI27-132+ CD4+ and C08+ T-cells. The COI27+132- T-cells depleted in HIV infection were a subset ofsjTREC-rich naive T-cells that were Ki-67-Bc1-2high. During HIV-1 infection there was an expansion of more activated CDI27+132+ and CD127132+T-cells the latter being enriched for T(E)M and tenninally differentiated T-cells that were Ki-67+BcI-2low and contained high amounts of HIV-ONA. Additionally, we found evidence of CO127 expression on pre-B-acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cells in HIV???uninfected patients which was associated with a Ki-67+Bcl-2high phenotype. Normal pre-B and leukemic cells did not undergo IL-7 induced down-regulation of COl27 to the same extend as T-lineage cells, suggesting distinct regulatory mechanisms. Finally our cellular model showed IL-7 induced internalisation of both CDI27 and CDl32 into Iysosomes within 2h in a Clathrin dependent process. Internalisation of both COl27 and CD132 from the plasma membrane was further confirmed by reversible biotinylation studies and western bIoI. Dysregulation of the IL-7I1L-7R axis contributes to altered T-cell homeostasis in HIV-1 infection and to pre-B-ALL oncogenesis.

This thesis investigates article use variation in two groups of English varieties: Inner Circle and Outer Circle. The first group, comprising British English, American English, Australian English and New Zealand English, represents English varieties in their traditional contexts. The second group, consisting of Singapore English, Indian English, Philippine English and Kenyan English, represents varieties which are deeply entrenched in their communities due to colonial roots. The study is premised on the naturalness of corpus data. Three corpus-based analyses were conducted to investigate articles and their frequency, collocation and usage types.  The frequency analysis revealed that articles are idiosyncratically used by the varieties with no clear divide between the two groups. Text types, on the other hand, emerged as a more powerful determinant of the observed frequencies. It was found that fewer articles were used in spoken language. In the collocational analysis, the varieties were found to favour different complementation patterns for two-word and multiple-world clusters. The Inner Circle varieties, however, shared more complementation patterns among them, demonstrating greater stability in terms of variation. Finally the analysis of usage types discovered &#145;marked&#146; or untypical patterns of use in the Outer Circle group&#146;s structural and situational definites. A number of untypical usages of first-mention/quantitative 'a/an' were also found in this group. In the same analysis, a case study of &#145;house&#146; uncovered a few marked uses of ??, which signalled the null form but not the zero article.  Although the collective findings in this study indicate that article use in both groups of varieties has more similarities than differences, the latter leave more impression on observers. These differences can be attributed to such diverse factors as text types, socio-cultural content of collocates, specificity, recategorisation of countness, indiscriminate rule application and ungrammaticality. Theoretically, however, the variation can be captured by the application of Chesterman&#146;s three composite meanings of definiteness &#150; locatability, inclusiveness and extensivity &#150; and their permutations. As an instance of nativisation, article use in the Outer Circle is limited in its diffusion.

All such estimates have an element of uncertainty which needs to be acknowledged.  Traditional methods of engineering economic or discounted cash flow analysis, for example, net present value, benefit/cost ratio, internal rate of return and payback period, do not take into account the uncertainty associated with the analysis parameters.  To this end, the present study proposes a number of evaluation methodologies in order to deal with the inherent uncertainty.  The present study uses second-order moment thinking to determine the expected value and the variance of feasibility measures, net present value, benefit/cost ratio, internal rate of return and payback period.  A venture???s feasibility is defined in this study as the probability of the total benefit exceeding the total cost, the probability of the internal rate of return being greater than a specified interest rate, or the probability of the payback period being less than a specified time period.  However, the determination of the variance of these measures requires the estimation of the correlation coefficients between the benefits and costs.  The task of estimating correlation coefficients is difficult without making certain assumptions.  An examination of the degree of correlation is presented which can be used for guidance in feasibility studies.  The present study also gives a theoretical formulation for feasibility for single and multiple ventures and supports this with representative results based on case studies.  Such a formulation resolves which combination of ventures is best from a viewpoint of feasibility.  Additionally, venture appraisal is modelled as a system with Markov properties.  When analysis parameters such as the interest rate, benefits and costs are defined as states, with the associated transition probabilities from one period of time to another, Markov chains can be used to estimate a venture???s feasibility.  This provides further insight into the influence of variability in the analysis parameters, and provides the solution to the problem of the determination of the optimal policy, which maximises the expected net present value or the venture's feasibility over its life span.  Markov chains provide further insights into the effect of the inter-temporal correlation coefficients on the variance of the net present value.  When each state is taken to represent a different value of inter-temporal correlation coefficient, and consequently a different variance, it is possible to evaluate the venture's expected variance and the variance of the variance of the net present value, according to the transition probabilities associated with each state.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Uncertainty</field><field name="subject">Uncertainty</field><field name="subject">Economic Feasibility</field><field name="subject">Probabilistic Benefit-Cost Analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44526</field></doc><doc><field name="title">US security engagement with Southeast Asia during the Clinton and Bush administrations</field><field name="creator">Cuong, Pham Cao, Social Sciences &amp; International Studies, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study seeks to analyze the change of US security policy in Southeast Asia from the Clinton to Bush administrations. The main aim of the study is to examine the position of Southeast Asia in US security policy and changes in US security policy toward Southeast Asia between the two administrations at both regional and bilateral levels. Besides examining the US security approach to regional institutions like ASEAN and ARF, the study especially concentrates on the US security approach to some ASEAN members - The Philippines, Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia - as well as interactions between the United States and these countries in terms of security.  The main argument of this study is that since the end of the Cold War, Southeast Asia has occupied an important position in US security strategy though it was far from being the highest priority in US foreign policy. During the Clinton administration and in the context of the post-Cold War environment which saw the decline of American economic power, the dynamic economic and political development of East Asia, and the existence of hot spots like North Korean and Taiwan, the United States supported the establishment of the ARF and strengthened its alliance with several ASEAN members, including the Philippines, Thailand, Singapore and Indonesia. With the goal to form a ???New Pacific Community???, the US had strategic interests in keeping Southeast Asia stable and preventing the emergence of a potential adversary in the future. To implement the security pillar in the Clinton Doctrine, the US provided military assistance to, and increased military exercises with the ASEAN states. During this period, the China factor was also a key element contributing to the change of the US relationship with the region. In the post-Cold War, the US has seen many challenges posed by China, especially from China???s military modernization program. Moreover, China???s activities in the South China Sea during the 1990s also contributed to the strengthening of bilateral relations between the US and ASEAN states. Under the Bush administration, Southeast Asia became more important to the US interests. Economically, Southeast Asia was the USA???s fifth-largest trading partner. At the same time, the US ranked as either the largest or second-largest trade partner of nine of the ten ASEAN states. Strategically, after September 11, 2001, Southeast Asia played a significant role in US security strategy since it served as the ???second front of terror???. Besides strengthening its relations with ASEAN and the ARF, the United States revitalized its bilateral relationships with ASEAN states, such as: The Philippines, Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia, and Malaysia. Through anti-terrorism initiatives, military assistance programs, intelligence sharing and joint military exercises, the US deepened and expanded its relations with ASEAN states. From this perspective, both the Philippines and Thailand were designated as ???major non-NATO allies??? of the US. In the long term, the USA???s objective in the region was to prevent the emergence of any potential adversary that would be capable of competing with the US in the future. Importantly, the US re-engagement in Southeast Asia under the Bush administration was not only to counter terrorism, but also to contain China. The rapid increase in China???s defense spending and the expansion of its influence in Southeast Asia concerned the United States. During the Bush era, China also played a key role in the US relationships with ASEAN states.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">US Foreign Policy</field><field name="subject">Southeast Asia</field><field name="subject">United States</field><field name="subject">US Security Strategy</field><field name="subject">Terrorism</field><field name="subject">Counterterrorism</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44527</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Steam effects on cyclic oxidation of chromia forming alloys</field><field name="creator">Othman, Norinsan Kamil, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">High temperature oxidation of Fe-Cr alloys with Cr levels of 9-30 wt% has been investigated by using isothermal and cyclic experiments at 600, 700 and 950??C. The mixed gases Ar-20%02, Ar-20%02H20, Ar-5%02-20%H20, Ar-10%H2-5%H20 and Ar-10% H2-20%H20 at total pressure of I atm were used. The effect of lanthanum alloying on Fe-Cr alloy oxidation was also studied. In general, increasing alloy chromium levels reduced the oxidation rate. In isothermal oxidation at 700??C, a protective chromia layer was formed in dry oxygen for Fe9Cr. Alloys with Cr???17% formed protective chromia layers in all gas mixtures. In thermal cyclic oxidation, at high Po2, the 9%Cr alloy exhibited breakaway oxidation at an early stage of the reaction at all reaction temperatures. However, for Cr???17%, no breakaway oxidation occurred, and the weight gains were very low at temperatures of 950 and 700?? C. At 600??C, breakaway oxidation was observed on all Fe-Cr alloys in Ar-20%02 and Ar-20%02-5%H20 gases due to scale spallation and the low alloy Cr diffusivity which slows the chromia scale re-healing. Introducing water vapour lo Ar-02 and Ar-H2 accelerated the oxidation of alloys containing ???17% Cr. However, this accelerating effect was not evident for Fe25Cr alloy at 700 and 950??C. At low Po2, breakaway oxidation of alloys with Cr???17% occurred, very early in Ar-10%H2-20%H20 and after 300 cycles in Ar-IO%H2-5%H20. The addition of lanthanum to Fe9Cr and Fe 17Cr led to increased oxidation rates due to enhanced inward oxygen transport, leading to faster scaling, and rapid consumption of chromium at the alloy surface in high H20containing gases in Ar-5%02 and Ar-10%H2 at 700??C. However, the presence of lanthanum in Fe25Cr-0.09La retarded the growth of both Fe-rich oxide and chromia, which in turn decreased the oxidation rate.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44528</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The persistence of common wombats in road impacted environments</field><field name="creator">Roger, Erin , Biological, Earth &amp;  Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">There is growing global concern over the influence of road development on the conservation of biodiversity and on the functioning of ecosystems. Published reviews in the field of road ecology have identified that most research has examined the effects of roads linearly and have advocated for research at landscape scales. Among the many effects roads have, one of the most significant is the loss of animal life resulting from collisions with vehicles. Despite this, little is known of what toll this has on animal populations and how these impacts vary with scale. This stems from the perception that impacts are localised and that animals killed are typically considered common, and therefore not of great conservation concern. This thesis challenges this notion by showing that the impacts of fatalities can affect populations at landscape extents and that commonness is not a barrier to localised extinction risk. To achieve this I focus on the common wombat; an example of a common species for which road impacts have never been previously examined. Chapter 1 provides an overview of the importance of scale in quantifying road impacts and the debate surrounding common species persistence in road environments. Chapter 2 assesses habitat use of wombats in a road environment at a local scale. Results suggest that wombats select for roadside habitat and as a result populations could be under threat. Chapter 3 is a predictive model of wombat road fatalities which demonstrates the importance of incorporating habitat use in predictive fatality modelling. Through use of a spatially explicit population viability analysis, Chapter 4 demonstrates that roads, in conjunction with other threats can affect the persistence of a common species at a local scale. Chapter 5 is a landscape extent assessment of wombat habitat use, finding that increased effort should be employed in evaluating how reserves confer resilience to species from the impacts of roads and that habitat quality can dictate road-based fatality rates. Chapter 6 summarises the research presented in the thesis and suggests direction for future work, particularly the importance of evaluating the interplay between susceptibility and abundance on species vulnerability in road environments.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Road ecology</field><field name="subject">Common species</field><field name="subject">Habitat suitability</field><field name="subject">Modelling</field><field name="subject">Road-kill</field><field name="subject">Common wombat</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44530</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hyponatraemia and ADH secretion during intravenous fluid therapy in children</field><field name="creator">Neville, Kristen Ann, Women's &amp; Children's Health, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is a fundamental regulator of fluid and electrolyte homeostasis. Osmotically unregulated ADH secretion during intravenous fluid therapy has been implicated in the development of iatrogenic hyponatraemia. The case report and 3 prospective studies of this thesis provide evidence for this and examine the relative contributions of salinity versus infusion rate of intravenous fluids to the development of hyponatraemia. Two studies of plasma and urinary electrolytes and osmolality during intravenous rehydration of children with gastroenteritis were performed.  The first, an observational study of 52 children receiving 0.45% (N/2) saline documented persistently raised plasma ADH concentrations independent of plasma sodium. In both studies, plasma and urinary biochemistry suggested osmotically unregulated ADH action. When N/2 and NS were compared in a randomised study of 102 children, NS emerged as superior in the prevention and correction of hyponatraemia, independent of infusion rate. In the third study, 124 pre-operative children were randomised to receive N/2 or NS intravenously at 100% or 50% of maintenance rates post-operatively.  Plasma ADH concentrations increased in all groups, and the plasma and urinary biochemistry indicated persistent non-osmotic ADH activity in some children for up to 24 hours.  Baseline urinary tonicity approximated NS.  Comparison of urinary tonicity with the infused fluid largely explained changes observed in plasma sodium. The risk of hyponatraemia was decreased by isotonic saline but not fluid restriction; however plasma sodium concentration decreased in the NS 100% group between 8 and 24 hours, suggesting that a decreased rate should be considered during prolonged intravenous fluid administration.  Fourteen (23%; 7NS) of those on 50% maintenance were assessed as dehydrated, with hypernatraemia in 3 receiving NS50%.  The chloride load associated with NS in the second and third studies was not associated with the development of acidosis. The studies also showed that 2.5% dextrose resolved and prevented hypoglycaemia in children with gastroenteritis but was inadequate to prevent hypoglycaemia and/or ketosis in 38% of children under 6 years when infused at maintenance rates.  Non-osmotically regulated ADH activity in hospitalised children is common, in the face of which, isotonic is superior to hypotonic saline in decreasing the risk of hyponatraemia.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Intravenous fluids</field><field name="subject">Sodium</field><field name="subject">Antidiuretic hormone</field><field name="subject">Child</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44531</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Validity contracts for software transactions</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Quan Hoang, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Software Transactional Memory is a promising approach to concurrent program- ming, freeing programmers from error-prone concurrency control decisions that are complicated and not composable. But few such systems address consistencies of transactional objects.  In this thesis, I propose a contract-based transactional programming model toward more secure transactional sofwares. In this general model, a validity contract spec- ifies both requirements and effects for transactions. Validity contracts bring nu- merous benefits including reasoning about and verifying transactional programs, detecting and resolving transactional conflicts, automating object revalidation and easing program debugging.  I introduce an ownership-based framework, namely AVID, derived from the gen- eral model, using object ownership as a mechanism for specifying and reasoning validity contracts. I have specified a formal type system and implemented a pro- totype type checker to support static checking. I also have built a transactional library framework AVID, based on existing Java DSTM2 framework, for express- ing transactions and validity contracts.  Experimental results on a multi-core system show that contracts add little over- heads to the original STM. I find that contract-aware contention management yields significant speedups in some cases. The results have suggested compiler- directed optimisation for tunning contract-based transactional programs.

Products with high-purity, sterility, and porosity can be achieved using dense gas technology (DGT). Currently, DGT has been used in different aspects of polymer processing including polymerization, micronization, and impregnation. Due to its solubility in polymers, CO2 can penetrate and plasticize polymers, while impregnating them with low-molecular weight CO2 -soluble compounds. Biodegradable polymers and other medical-grade polymers have benefited from the application of DGT. Dense CO2 processing properties of inertness, non-toxicity, and affinity for various therapeutic compounds are specifically advantageous to the medical and biomedical industries. In this work, the different applications of DGT in polymer processing are revised, then implemented.  The polymerization of polycarbonate (PC) and polycaprolactone (PCL) in dense CO2 are presented. The syntheses of both polymers were successful and were aided by the use of dense CO2 . A multi-stage approach using dense CO2 as a sweep fluid to extract the PC polymerization by-product phenol is reported. Polycaprolactone was synthesized with varying temperatures and dense CO pressures, then impregnated with a CO2 -soluble therapeutic agent. The impregnated PCL acted as a drug reservoir with a drug-loading of 27wt% and a sustained drug release profile was observed for all samples over several days.  Polymer blends of PC/PCL have potential industrial and biomedical applications both in vivo and in vitro. The applicability of PCL can be extended by enhancing its mechanical properties by creating a bio-blend with a stronger polymer such as PC. In this work, PC/PCL nonporous and porous blends were produced. Three novel dense CO2 blending techniques were used. The macroporous PC/PCL blend was impregnated with a therapeutic agent using CO2 as the carrier. A drug loading of 20wt% was achieved and sustained drug release was observed over 3 days.  The applicability of dense CO2 in polymer processing was further demonstrated by sterilizing macroporous PC/PCL blends and soft hydrogels with dense CO2 . The PC/PCL blends and hydrogels were inoculated with vegetative bacteria and bacterial endospores. Industrial standard sterilization levels were achieved.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Polymer Processing</field><field name="subject">Dense Gas Technology</field><field name="subject">Supercritical Fluids</field><field name="subject">Biomedical Polymers</field><field name="subject">Drug Delivery System</field><field name="subject">Polymer Blend</field><field name="subject">Sterilization</field><field name="subject">Polymerization</field><field name="subject">Pharmaceutical Processing</field><field name="subject">Polycarbonate</field><field name="subject">Polycaprolactone</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44499</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Winning the war against cervical cancer? - a social history of cervical screening in Australia 1950 to the present</field><field name="creator">Read, Jennifer Deirdre, History &amp; Philosophy, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis provides a social history of the introduction the Pap smear and the expansion of population-based cervical screening programs in Australia throughout the latter decades of the twentieth century.

It also highlights the tendency for public health strategies to serve as a means of social and moral control. Furthermore, the thesis examines the conflict between the population-based approach of public health and the concern of clinicians for the welfare of individual patients.

Such a study may have some impact on the development of new technology to improve performance of blast furnace operation. The blast furnace operation involves rich granular dynamics phenomena which currently attract a strong interest from wide scientific and engineering community. In this work, percolation phenomenon is analyzed extensively. Percolation phenomenon is one of the most significant factors which cause particle segregation and mixing. In blast furnace when sinter and coke of different size and density are charged, percolation phenomenon occurs.  In this work percolation properties like percolation velocity, residence time distribution and radial dispersion are checked for different material properties of percolating particles. It was found that percolation behaviour is related to many factors. Percolation properties of a single particle and also for batches of percolating particle were examined. The effect of external forces on percolation properties is also checked. DEM simulation method was found to be suitable for analysis of percolation flow behaviour of different types of particles.    It was also found that the change of packed bed conditions has a great impact on particle percolation and segregation behaviour. In a packed bed, vibration and liquid of different properties were introduced. Particle dynamics in descending packed bed condition was checked. The effect of vibration and descending velocity was measured for percolation behaviour. Both vibration frequency and amplitude are important factors for particle flow in such a packed bed. Descending velocity of packed particles combined with vibration was found to have a pronounced impact on percolation behaviour. Liquid properties like viscosity and density affect particle dynamics significantly.  Particle segregation in a pile was investigated as an extension of the percolation study. The effects of diameter ratio of binary feed, initial mixing ratio, feed rate in case of central feeding on conical pile were investigated. It was found that all of those parameters affect particle flow and segregation. Flowing layer over static pile was simulated and velocity profile and mixing ratio in different layers were observed.  3-D Screening Layer model was validated by DEM and experiment. In case of multipoint feed system, a conical pile which is similar to the deadman of a blast furnace was generated and the flowing layer characteristics over this static pile was also analysed.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Discrete Element Method</field><field name="subject">Percolation</field><field name="subject">Segregation</field><field name="subject">Blast furnace</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44502</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of superoxide in iron acquisition by marine phytoplankton</field><field name="creator">Godrant, Aur??lie Suzanne, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">It is hypothesised that, under iron limitation, phytoplankton cells develop biochemical mechanisms to increase their iron uptake efficiency with one of these mechanisms involving the production of superoxide in the extracellular environment that increases the bioavailability of iron in seawater by reducing Fe(1II) to the more soluble Fe(II). The main objectives of this work were i) to develop an appropriate method to detect extracellular production of superoxide by marine phytoplankron, and ii) to examine the relationship between extracellular production of superoxide and iron acquisition by Trichodesmium erythraeum.  A method to measure O2- production is described using red-CLA and MCLA probes, yielding considerable improvement for analysis compared to other available methods. Extracellular O2" production and iron uptake rates were measured simultaneously on iron replete and iron deplete Tr;chodumium uythraeum IMS 101 laboratory cultures: iron stan'ation l~ds to a 2.9-fold increase in superoxide production rate and 10-fold decrease in the iron uptake rate (except when a reducing compound was added) compared to iron replete cultures. Extracellular superoxide production shows a pronounced circadian rhythm in iron deplete cultures, but less so in iron replete cultures. Overall, no direct impact of extracellular superoxide production by T";chode.smium on iron uptake is obsen'ed, but both processes are shown to be related. Both iron deplete and iron replete cuhures demonstrate greater ability to uptake iron bound to weaker iron-binding ligands such as citrate.  Application of the method to field studies in the Great Barrier Reeflagoon showed an accumulation of biologically significant concentrations of reduced trace metals including Fe(JI) when [Od was lower than 1 nM. When [02"] was higher than 1 nM, most of the reduced species were oxidised resulting in high rates of H202 production through catalysed O2" disproportionation. Moreover, two Tr;chode.smium blooms exhibited high O2- production rates, consistent whh laboratory studies.  Overall, this thesis permitted the development of a method to detect O2production rates by marine phytoplank[Qn ceUs that could be used routinely in field studies. The observations are in accord with the conclusion that fit the ongoing hypothesis that the established Fe' uptake model for phytoplankton would be strongly influenced by such organisms that are able to modify the redox equilibrium of the solution at their ceU surface.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44509</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influence of material related parameters on the axial shortening of high strength concrete columns</field><field name="creator">Bursle, Sonia Jean, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The prediction of axial shortening is necessary in structures sensitive to its effects, such as tall bUildings. Potential strength and serviceability problems associated with axial shortening include damage to the building facade and rigid services such lift gUide rails. Differential shortening between adjacent elements can cause floor flatness problems and excessive additional bending moments and shear forces can be induced in horizontal members. The development of high strength concrete (HSq and the consequent increase in building heights has been rapid with little published information incorporating both axial shortening analysis and HSC material modelling.  World Tower, the tallest residential bUilding in the Sydney CBD, presented an opportunity to monitor the axial shortening of HSC vertical elements. Comparison of the measured strains with theoretical predictions allowed the verification of the calculated values. The few buildings previously studied were constructed from normal strength concrete (NSC). This study considers the prediction of axial shortening with emphasis given to the refinement of the concrete material models for compressive strength, elastic modulus, shrinkage and creep. The test results of concrete samples taken from the World Tower building are compared to theoretical models available in design codes and published research.  Compressive strength development results were best reflected by the ACI committee 209 (1992) model. An improved prediction was achieved when the actual measured strength was used instead of the specified characteristic strength. An elastic modulus model was developed in this study as most of the models considered overestimated the modulus of HSC. The basic creep factors derived from testing showed reasonable agreement with the creep model proposed by Gilbert (2002). Shrinkage models were reviewed by combining the shrinkage calculated with the verified creep and elastic strains. The shrinkage model proposed by Gilbert (2002) was found to provide the most consistent shrinkage strain prediction.  The sensitivity of the results was also considered for it can be detrimental to both over and underestimate the axial strains. Shrinkage was found to influence the overall axial strain significantly compared the to the creep and elastic strain components. Hence, accurate determination of the expected shrinkage behaviour is essential for meaningful results.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44512</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimal training sequence design for MIMO-OFDM in spatially correlated fading environments</field><field name="creator">Luong, Dung Viet, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Multiple Input Multiple Output with Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (MIMOOFDM) has been widely adopted as one of the most promising air interface solutions for future broadband wireless communication systems due to its high rate transmission capability and robustness against multipath fading. However, these MIMO-OFDM advantages cannot be achieved unless the channel state information (CSI) can be obtained accurately and promptly at the receiver to assist coherent detection of data symbols. Channel estimation and training sequence design are, therefore, still open challenges of great interest.  In this work, we investigate the Linear Minimum Mean Square Error (LMMSE) channel estimation and design nearly optimal training sequences for MIMO-OFDM systems in spatially correlated fading. We, first, review the LMMSE channel estimation model for MIMO-OFDM in spatially correlated fading channels. We, then, derive a tight theoretical lower bound of the channel estimation Mean Square Error (MSE). By exploiting the information on channel correlation matrices which is available at the transmitter, we design a practical and nearly optimal training sequence for MIMO-OFDM systems . The optimal transmit power allocation for training sequences is found using the Iterative Bisection Procedure (IBP). We also propose an approximate transmit power allocation algorithm which is computationally more efficient than the IBP while maintaining a similar MSE performance. The proposed training sequence design method is also applied to MIMO-OFDM systems where Cyclic Prefixing OFDM (CP-OFDM) is replaced by Zero Padding OFDM - OverLap-Add method (ZP-OFDM-OLA).

This program of research aims to illuminate epidemiological and clinical aspects of HIV diagnosis in resource limited settings focusing in particular on the nation of Papua New Guinea (PNG).  This body of work commences with an exploration of current literature pertaining to diagnosis of HIV infection in resource constrained settings.  This exploration encompasses the current epidemiological data available on HIV infection in the paediatric population worldwide, currently available methods of diagnosis and other aspects of diagnosis of paediatric HIV infection in developing nations including sampling considerations, breast feeding, health services, human resources and the relationship between early diagnosis and early treatment.  The next chapter presents an epidemiological analysis of the HIV epidemic in PNG and a description of the paediatric services at Port Moresby General Hospital (PMGH) the site for most of the research presented in the thesis.  The original research presented in the thesis begins with a report (Chapter 3) of a survey of paediatric diagnosis and treatment services in PNG in comparison to other countries in the Asia Pacific region.  This is followed by an exploratory retrospective study elucidating factors associated with HIV testing and HIV positive serostatus in children admitted to PMGH.   Selection for testing was found to be significantly associated with age, length of hospital stay and diagnoses of diarrhoea, malnutrition and oral candidiasis.  Tuberculosis was associated with HIV positive serostatus.  In advance of a prospective study to ascertain clinical predictors of HIV infection, a study to evaluate acceptability of HIV testing amongst carers of children admitted to PMGH was undertaken.  Testing was acceptable to the majority of carers interviewed.  This program of research concludes with a prospective cross-sectional study revealing low weight for age, persistent fever, lymphadenopathy and oral candidiasis to be independent predictors of HIV infection in children admitted to PMGH.   An algorithm for clinically directed screening of children for HIV infection in a hospital setting was subsequently developed.

Previous investigations have focused on the aerodynamic characteristics of each of these bodies in isolation. Investigations that have considered both working in unison have conflictingly reported that the wheel presence aids or hinders the wing???s performance while the wheel???s aerodynamic performance has been neglected. In order to obtain a more thorough understanding of the interaction of a wing and wheel, experimental results were used to validate a computational model used to investigate a wing and wheel in isolation and in combination.  The combined wing and wheel investigation demonstrated that three main interactions can occur, depending on the selection of wing span, angle of attack and height used, while the wheel width and track were found to have little influence. The three interacting states differ in the path that the main and secondary wing vortices take around the wheel and the subsequent variation in the combined wake structure. In general, the wing in the presence of the wheel reduced the wing???s ability to generate downforce by up to 45% due to the high pressure regions generated forward of the wheel. This was also found to alleviate the adverse pressure gradients experienced by the wing, and also reduce the drag by up to 70%. For this reason, the downforce loss phenomenon was observed to occur at a height 0.08c to 0.32c lower in comparison to the same wing in isolation, dependant on the wing span. Wheel lift and drag values were also observed to reduce in the presence of a wing by up to 65% and 38% respectively due to the influence of the wing???s flow structures have on the wake of the wheel. As a result,it was shown that the combined wing and wheel downforce and drag optima differed by up to 75% and 25% respectively to those which would be estimated if the two bodies were investigated individually and the results summed highlighting the importance of investigating these two bodies in unison.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Combined</field><field name="subject">Wing</field><field name="subject">Wheel</field><field name="subject">Aerodynamics</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44516</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Receptor mediated catabolism of plasminogen activators</field><field name="creator">Grimsley, Philip George, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Humans have two plasminogen activators (PAs), tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), which generate plasmin to breakdown fibrin and other barriers to cell migration.  Both PAs are used as pharmaceuticals but their efficacies are limited by their rapid clearance from the circulation, predominantly by parenchymal cells of the liver.  At the commencement of the work presented here, the hepatic receptors responsible for mediating the catabolism of the PAs were little understood.  tPA degradation by hepatic cell lines was known to depend on the formation of binary complexes with the major PA inhibitor, plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1).  Initial studies presented here established that uPA was catabolised in a fashion similar to tPA by the hepatoma cell line, HepG2.  Other laboratories around this time found that the major receptor mediating the binding and endocytosis of the PAs is Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor-related Protein (LRP1).  LRP1 is a giant 600 kDa protein that binds a range of structurally and functionally diverse ligands  including, activated &#945;2 macroglobulin, apolipoproteins, &#946; amyloid precursor protein, and a number of serpin-enzymes complexes, including PA??PAI-1 complexes.  Further studies for the work presented here centred on this receptor.  By using radiolabelled binding assays, ligand blots, and Western blots on cultured cells, the major findings are that:  (1) basal LRP1 expression on HepG2 is low compared to a clone termed, HepG2a16, but appears to increase in long term culture;  (2) a soluble form of LRP1, which retains ligand-binding capacity, is present in human circulation;  (3) soluble LRP1 is also present in cerebral spinal fluid where its role in neurological disorders such as Alzheimer??s disease is a developing area of interest; and  (4) the release of LRP1 is a mechanism conserved in evolution, possibly as distantly as molluscs.  The discovery, identification, and characterisation of soluble LRP1 introduces this protein in the human circulation, and presents a possible further level of regulation for its associated receptor system.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">LRP1</field><field name="subject">Soluble receptor</field><field name="subject">Low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein</field><field name="subject">Soluble LRP1</field><field name="subject">Radioisotopes</field><field name="subject">Western blotting</field><field name="subject">Tissue-type plasminogen activator</field><field name="subject">Monoclonal antibodies</field><field name="subject">Recombinant protein production</field><field name="subject">SDS-PAGE electrophoresis</field><field name="subject">Flow cytometry</field><field name="subject">Ligand blotting</field><field name="subject">tPA</field><field name="subject">Urokinase-type plasminogen activator</field><field name="subject">Alzheimer's disease</field><field name="subject">uPA</field><field name="subject">Clearance</field><field name="subject">Endocytosis</field><field name="subject">Degradation</field><field name="subject">Evolutionary conservation</field><field name="subject">HepG2 hepatoma cell line</field><field name="subject">Plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1</field><field name="subject">PAI-1</field><field name="subject">Serpin enzyme complexes</field><field name="subject">Fibrinolysis</field><field name="subject">Atherosclerosis</field><field name="subject">Vascular biology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44489</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis and electrophoretic deposition of Tin Oxide (SnO2)</field><field name="creator">Taib, Hariati, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Submicron tin oxide (SnO2) was obtained from thermal decomposition of tin oxalate (SnC2O4) precipitated at room temperature from amixture of solutions of tin (II) chloride (SnCl2) and oxalic acid (H2C2O4). Aqueous precipitation of SnC2O4 was firstly investigated by parametersvariation of starting material concentrations, addition methods and mixing times. Upon calcination, SnO2 powder tacky and subsequent grinding was found to cause nanosized SnO2 particles to agglomerate into plates. Aqueous??alcohol precipitation was then developed, based on the previously conducted aqueous precipitation  Stabilisation of SnO2 suspensions was found to be better in aqueous rather than non??aqueous media, as determined by zeta potential analysis and sedimentation tests. A detailed concept of the effects of zeta potential and sedimentation (enhanced sedimentation region (ESR)) on colloidal processing, i.e., suspension stability, was introduced.  Two systems, Sn??Al??O and Sn??Si??O, were investigated at their invariant temperatures and ternary phase diagrams, which haven??t been reported elsewhere, were constructed (at nine isothermal temperatures each). The binary diagram for the system SnO2??SiO2, which has not been reported in the literature, was constructed. The systems compatibilities were confirmed experimentally at 1000oC, with incidental finding of micron??sized fibres of single crystal SnO2 with preferential [110] growth direction obtained. It was also deduced that 1000oC can be used for SnO2 coatings sintering without undesired reaction or mutual solubility.  Successful electrophoretic deposition (EPD) of commercial SnO2 powder on dense sapphire was obtained by the use of pH 2 SnO2 suspension, but not with pH 9 suspensions leading to a review of the basis for EPD requirements in terms of suspension properties. Thus, another conceptual approach to EPD processing and setup was proposed in terms of zeta potential, suspension stability and net particle charge. Obtained homogeneous deposition of commercial SnO2 powders contradicted the findings of published works of EPD on insulating dense substrates. Thus critical factors in the design of EPD processing on dense insulating substrates and associated mechanisms responsible for the deposition were developed.  However, EPD of synthesised SnO2 powders yielded inhomogeneous coatings, even with voltage application of up to 30 V. Microcell effects, which were deduced based on localised particle leaching in the suspension, were proposed. Although deposition was relatively unsuccessful, this demonstrated possibility of aqueous EPD with the usage of high voltages without occurrence of water electrolysis which hasn??t been observed in literature.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Precipitation</field><field name="subject">Tin Oxide</field><field name="subject">SnO2</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44490</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Critical beauty: the decorative, the grotesque and the explicit in the work of Aubrey Beardsley and Kara Walker</field><field name="creator">Hughes, Natalya, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">This research project centres on a representative mode in the visual arts marked by seemingly contradictory operations. Made through a particular use of decorative form, this mode combines the operations of aesthetic pleasure and a more challenging or destabilising affect. It co-implicates formal beauty and a critical content usually associated with so-called anti-aesthetic art practices. The written component analyses the occurrence of this contradictory logic of representation in the work of late Victorian artist Aubrey Beardsley, and contemporary African American artist Kara Walker. Here I argue that while existing criticism on Beardsley and Walker points to the co-existence of these seemingly contradictory operations, it consistently privileges one term (i.e. beautiful form or critical content) over the other. As such, this criticism has failed to properly account for the formal and conceptual strategies of these artists?? work. Examining relations between the decorative, the grotesque and the sexually explicit in the art of Walker and Beardsley, and utilising Kantian and psychoanalytic theories, I examine reasons for this failure and interpret the work of each artist in a way demonstrates the critical fecundity of their dismantling of given oppositions been formal beauty and sociopolitical criticism. The practice component of this PhD engages with this contradictory logic in the medium of painting. It is similarly geared towards an exploration of grotesque and sexually explicit dimensions articulated in and through decorative form. It does so through the appropriation and manipulation of graphic traditions: mainly the Japanese tradition of Ukiyo-e, and the work of Aubrey Beardsley. Like the written component, the practice component of the project seeks a means of accommodating a critical position within the aesthetic of beauty.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44491</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gamespace: play and architecture in videogames</field><field name="creator">McGregor, Georgia, Media Arts, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">Videogames are created for play. In videogames play takes place in an artificially constructed environment &#150; in gamespace. Gameplay occurs in gamespace. To understand videogames, it is essential to understand how their spaces are implicated in play. This thesis asks what are the relationships between play and space in videogames? This thesis examines the relationships between space and play by looking at how architecture is constructed in gamespace and by looking at gamespace as an architectonic construct. In short, this thesis examines the architecture in and of gamespace. The relationships between space and play in videogames are examined by looking at the structure of gamespace, by looking at the differences between real space and gamespace and by analysing architectural and spatial functionality. This thesis discovers a series of important relationships between space and play, arguing that gamespace is used to create, manipulate and control gameplay, while gameplay dictates and influences the construction of gamespace. Particular forms of play call for particular constructions of gamespace. Particular types of gamespace construct play in particular ways. This thesis identifies a number of ways in which gamespace is configured for play. Finally this thesis operates as a conceptual framework for understanding gamespace and architecture in videogames.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44492</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Behavioural and brain mechanisms of associative change during blocking and unblocking</field><field name="creator">Bradfield, Laura Anne, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The present thesis examined the behavioural and brain mechanisms of associative change in the rat during Pavlovian fear conditioning as measured by freezing. The first series of experiments (Chapter 3) used compound test designs to study how learning is distributed among excitatory and neutral conditional stimuli (CSs). More was learned about a neutral CSB than an excitatory CSA when trained in isolation, indicating that fear learning is negatively accelerated. CSA blocked fear learning to CSB when trained in compound. Unblocking of CSB occurred if the AB compound signalled an increase in unconditional stimulus (US) intensity or number. Assessments of associative change during blocking showed that more was learned about CSB than CSA. Such assessments during unblocking revealed that more was learned about CSB than CSA following an increase in US intensity but not US number. These US manipulations had no differential effects on single-cue learning. The results show that variations in US intensity or number produce unblocking of fear learning, but for each there is a different profile of associative change and a potentially different mechanism. The second series of experiments (Chapter 4) demonstrated that these stimulus selection effects are mediated, at least in part, by nucleus accumbens shell (AcbSh). AcbSh lesions augmented overshadowing during compound conditioning and promoted learning about CSA at the expense of CSB during blocking designs. Lesioned rats could learn normally about the novel CSB if it was rendered more informative regarding shock in Stage II. These results identify an important role for AcbSh and ventral striatum in distributing attention and learning among competing predictors of danger.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nucleus accumbens shell</field><field name="subject">Blocking and Unblocking</field><field name="subject">Summed and seperable prediction error</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44493</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Responding to contemporary public health dilemmas among vulnerable populations in inner Sydney</field><field name="creator">van Beek, Ingrid, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis documents my research on the epidemiology of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and other transmissible infections among 'at risk' young people, injecting drug users and sex workers in inner Sydney, and how this contributed to the early understanding of these infections in these potentially vulnerable populations in Australia. It also demonstrates how this work informed the development of innovative health service models in Sydney??s Kings Cross, including the Kirketon Road Centre (KRC) and the Sydney Medically Supervised Injecting Centre (MSIC), to address the public health risks affecting these populations over time. Sub-themes include the establishment of sentinel surveillance systems at KRC to monitor HIV and HCV prevalence and incidence as well as trends in drug use in these populations, considered to be key drivers of these epidemics in Australia. Another sub-theme is the clinical trials of pharmacotherapies for both opioid and psychostimulant dependence and the development of the dual treatment approach to HIV (and later HCV) and drug dependence that built upon this. KRC has been an exemplar of this approach, which has been shown to enhance treatment adherence among people who inject drugs ?? necessary to achieve treatment outcomes comparable to other affected populations. In more recent years my research has also included a focus on the epidemiology, physiology and treatment of opioid overdose and other injecting-related harms among IDUs.

Literature suggests that while efforts in promoting transport sustainability in the developed world have included policy measures involving urban spatial structure and its physical features as a consequence of the understanding on strong link between land use and transport, there has been lack of understandings on the spatial structure in major cities in Southeast Asia. Exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) is adopted for identification of important components of the spatial structure of employment in the Jakarta Metropolitan Area (JMA). The approach has been specifically designed in order to extract clusters as suggested in the Southeast Asian EMR concept. It is found that the spatial structure of employment in the JMA consists of the following major components: the urban core of Jakarta; the single dominant and expanded regional CBD within the urban core of Jakarta; manufacturing corridors that are largely follow toll roads radiating out of the urban core; local government regions that in general have not been developed into substantial sub-centres; desakota areas overlapping the manufacturing corridors and the agricultural areas; and portions of agricultural areas in the outer parts of Bekasi, Bogor and Tangerang regencies. The result shows that spatial structure of JMA conforms to the Southeast Asian EMR concept rather than the monocentric, polycentric or sprawl patterns debated for the case of developed cities. Commuting impacts of the identified spatial structure of employment and its physical features are investigated using the desireline analysis, home-to-work trip pattern comparisons (ANOVA) by the employment clusters, and ordinary linear regression and logistic regression models. It is found that the spatial structure identified and its physical features have significant associations to variations in the pattern of commuting across the region. The physical features of the employment spatial structure identified include important policy sensitive variables such as job density, job to household ratio, land use diversity and job accessibility. Policy implications of the findings are developed and centred on recommending both the spatial structure of employment and its physical characteristics that promote more sustainable transport in the JMA.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Jakarta Metropolitan</field><field name="subject">Mega-urban region</field><field name="subject">Extended metropolitan region (EMR)</field><field name="subject">JABODETABEK</field><field name="subject">Spatial structure</field><field name="subject">Travel pattern</field><field name="subject">Spatial statistics</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44498</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The long-term biocompatibility of porous Perfluoropolyether (PFPE) corneal inlays in humans</field><field name="creator">Prakasam, Ruby Kala, Optometry &amp; Vision Science, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Purpose: To evaluate long-term biocompatibility, optical clarity and the efficacy of Perfluoropolyether (PFPE) polymer as a corneal inlay in humans.  Materials and Methods: Corneas of 5 unsighted eyes of 5 patients received inlays: one patient selected as control. All were examined at baseline, immediately post-operative, 7 days and monthly thereafter for 12 months and at 3-monthly intervals for the next 12 months. Clinical evaluation includes detailed slit-lamp biomicroscopy, refraction, keratometry, corneal topography, and other routine ocular examinations.  Results: Surgery was uneventful. None of the patients developed corneal oedema or increased vascularisation during study period. All corneas were clear except for minimal haze around the edge of the implant and mild interface reflectivity. Two patients developed epithelial erosion with minimal stromal involvement at 4 and 24 months post surgery resulted in removal of inlay. Inlays remained stable in position in all patients, however clarity has reduced (4% - 26%) gradually with time. We believe mechanical stress from inlay to the surrounding tissue triggered keratocyte activation and extra cellular matrix material deposits around inlay may be responsible for epithelial erosions as well as the reduction in inlay clarity. All test eyes showed acute myopic shift by 8.47D ?? 1.97 (mean ?? SD) following implantation. The epithelial pigment deposits were detected in all test patients following surgery, related to acute corneal curvature changes. The removal data from two patients showed the reversal of the refractive effect to preoperative levels. One patient followed up for an extensive period of 19 months post inlay removal demonstrated stable results.  Conclusion: The PFPE inlays have demonstrated excellent biocompatibility within the human corneal tissue for 2 years. The epithelial erosion and inlay clarity reduction were the two major problems encountered in this study. We believe these problems were related to the mechanical stress induced tissue response from inlay. Critical patient selection and the modification of inlay design should improve the success of the procedure. Inlays are effective in altering the refractive status of the eye by altering the anterior corneal curvature. Also, inlay implantation and removal procedures are found to be easy, safe and quick without any complications.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Corneal inlays</field><field name="subject">Biocompatibility</field><field name="subject">Perfluoropolyether</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44535</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structural equation modelling and its application to quality of life of visually impaired people</field><field name="creator">Nuthethi, Rishita, Optometry &amp; Vision Science, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The main objective of the thesis was to construct a model of r:lationships among perceived visual ability (VF), quality of life (QOL) and visual acuity (VA) using the structural equation modeling (SEM) technique in an older, visually impaired population of India.  The World Health Organization QOL questionnaire, adopted as a QOL questionnaire, and a 16-item visual function questionnaire (VFQ) were administered to adults in the population-based Andhra Pradesh Eye Disease Study prior to their detailed eye examination. Participants aged 40 years and older (n=3,702), who underwent an interview by trained professionals, were included in this study. A total of 1,333 visually impaired subjects (presenting VA &lt; 6/18) responded to both questionnaires. The VFQ and QOL questionnaires were evaluated using Rasch analysis. The general linear model analysis (GLM) was performed to identify the factors associated with the measures of perceived visual ability and QOL. The direct and indirect relationships between VA, perceived visual ability and QOL were established using the SEM after adjusting for socio-demographic factors identified to be significant in GLM.  The mean age of the visually impaired participants was 60.5 years; 753 (56%) were female. There were 760 visually impaired people with cataract in at least one eye, 524 with uncorrected refractive error, 84 with retinal disease, 41 with glaucoma and 60 with corneal disease. The VFQ and QOL measures were found to be valid and unidimensional for those with retinal disease, glaucoma, corneal disease and those who are blind due to cataract or any other cause. In QOL questionnaire the item that required the most ability was "chance to acquire new skills" and the item that required the least ability was "dressing" for the sample with retinal disease, glaucoma, corneal disease and cataract. In the VFQ, the items that required the most visual ability were "recognizing small objects" and "recognizing people across the street". The items that required least visual ability were "reaching an object that is farther or closer than you thought" and "identifying colors".  Perceived visual ability to perform the functional vision activities mediated the relationship between VA and QOL, a new diagram for the International Classification of Functioning (ICF), however, the percentage of change mediated through perceived functional ability varied for different eye diseases. The total change that was mediated through perceived functional ability was 100%, 100%, 52%, 52% and 63% for people with retinal disease, glaucoma, corneal disease and those who are blind due to cataract or any cause of disease, respectively. Decreased QOL and perceived visual ability was associated with the presence of glaucoma or corneal disease independent of VA and with cataract and retinal disease as a function of VA.  Perceived visual ability to perfol111 the functional vision activities mediates the relationship between VA and QOL. Improving the perceived visual ability would improve the QOL of low vision persons. Further longitudinal studies on the impact of therapy and rehabilitation for glaucoma, corneal disease and retinal disease on QOL and VF are needed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44537</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Therapeutic strategies in HIV and Hepatitis B co-infection</field><field name="creator">Matthews, Gail Veronica, National Centre in HIV Epidemiology &amp; Clinical Research, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Individuals with HIV-HBV coinfection are at risk of accelerated hepatic fibrosis, and end stage liver disease is now a major cause of morbidity and mortality in this population. For many years lamivudine (3TC) monotherapy was the only effective treatment for HBV in coinfected individuals, but its use was complicated by the frequent development of HBV drug resistance, and loss of virological suppression. With the availability of new potent antivirals for HBV, including tenofovir (TDF), therapeutic options for HIV-HBV coinfected individuals have increased, although the management of HBV disease in this population is still often suboptimal.  This thesis explores through a series of published papers, issues in the current management of HIV-HBV coinfected individuals_ Chapter 1 describes a high incidence of 3TC resistance in HIV-HBV individuals on extended 3TC monotherapy, and in particular, a significant proportion with complex HBV-drug resistant mutants, with potential public health implications. In Chapter 2 the benefits of TDF ???induced virological suppression on parameters of end stage liver disease are described. Chapters 3 and 6 explore the role of TDF as monotherapy, or in combination with 3TC, within HBV-active antiretroviral therapy (ARn. No benefit for TDFj3TC combination versus TDF monotherapy is observed in treatment naive individuals; although a potential benefit for combination therapy is observed in treatment experienced subjects. In Chapter 4 a high rate of hepatic flare (HF) after initiation of HBV-active ART is described, and potential predictors of flare including elevated baseline ALT and HBV DNA are identified to suggest HBV immune restoration disease (IRD) as the major underlying cause of HF in this study. Chapter 5 discusses the immunopathogenesis of HBV IRD in more detail and proposes guidelines for clinical management.  In summary the thesis finds that the therapeutic outlook for HIV-HBV coinfected individuals is generally optimistic, although several further research areas are identified, particularly in middle and low- income settings where the burden of HIV and HBV disease is greatest.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44538</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of tumour and metastasis suppressor genes in colorectal and bladder cancer</field><field name="creator">Nixdorf, Sheri , Clinical School - Prince of Wales Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Together, colorectal (CRC) and bladder cancer (BlCa) are responsible for a large percentage of cancer related morbidity and mortality in Western society. A dramatic reduction in patient survival occurs as these cancers progress towards invasive and metastatic disease, from a five year survival rate of about 90% for localised disease to approximately 5-10% for advanced disease involving distant metastasis. A greater understanding of disease progression will lead to enhanced screening, diagnostic and treatment strategies, in turn providing an improved prognosis for the patient.  The purpose of this study was to expand the current molecular knowledge of CRC and BlCa by elucidating the role of Mxi1 mutations and MTSS1 expression in CRC and BlCa respectively, and to examine the diagnostic potential of these genes.  The Mxi1 coding region for 41 tumours, collected by the South Western Sydney Colorectal Cancer Tumour Bank from 2000-2001, was screened for mutations using Dideoxy Fingerprinting (ddF) and sequencing. Sequence alterations were detected in 34% of tumours. Three different polymorphisms and three mutations were detected. One mutation could possibly affect the tumour suppressor function of Mxi1. The presence of a gene mutation did not correlate to any clinical characteristics and is therefore not a suitable diagnostic marker. Microsatellite instability (MSI) status however, significantly correlated with tumour grade.  Expression levels of MTSS1 and an associated gene, MTSS2, were examined in 16 BlCa cell lines, 9 clonally-derived BlCa sublines, and 30 transitional cell carcinomas (TCCs) collected by the Heinrich-Heine University from 1993-2000. Variable gene expression was observed in BlCa cell lines and tumour samples. No significant correlation of MTSS expression and invasive ability was observed for the cell lines or tumour samples. Further studies eliminated promoter methylation and p53 functional status as mechanisms involved in MTSS1 and MTSS2 down-regulation.  Functional studies performed on stable MTSS1-expressing BlCa lines found that although migration was increased, cells displayed reduced anchorage-independent growth. The invasive ability of these cells was unchanged confirming that expression does not correlate with invasive ability. These data support the role of MTSS1 as a tumour suppressor and not as a metastasis suppressor gene. Although MTSS1 may not be useful in predicting more invasive disease, its role as a tumour suppressor in cancer may be useful.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mxi1</field><field name="subject">Colorectal cancer</field><field name="subject">Bladder cancer</field><field name="subject">MIM</field><field name="subject">Tumour suppressor</field><field name="subject">Metastasis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44541</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reduction of zinc oxide in sintering of manganese furnace dust</field><field name="creator">Shen, Ruihua, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Manganese furnace dust is made up of volatiles and fine particles of the raw materials collected from the off-gas during smelting of manganese alloys. Impediments to the recycling of the manganese furnace dust back to the ferroalloy furnaces are handling due to the presence of tar, and the potential accumulation of zinc in the furnaces, which can cause irregularities in their operation. The aim of the thesis was to establish conditions for zinc removal from the dust and assess the feasibility of the dust recycling in the Tasmanian Electrometallurgical Company sinter plant. Major findings are: - Manganese furnace dust taken from the settling ponds contained water, carbonaceous materials (tar), and metal oxides. The carbon content of the dried furnace dust was about 20% and the average manganese and zinc contents were 33.4 and 1.29%, respectively. Moisture content was 30-60%. - The tar components were aliphatic hydrocarbons and polyaromatic hydrocarbons, their derivatives, and sulphur- and oxygen-containing compounds with a wide range of carbon number (15-28) and boiling point (230-530oC). Light hydrocarbons were not detected. - If manganese furnace dust was recycled to ferroalloy furnaces through the sintering plant, the overall zinc input had increased by 51-143%. Sustainable utilisation of manganese furnace dust should include enhanced zinc removal. - Reduction of zinc oxide from manganese furnace dust pellets started at 800oC. Zinc oxide was reduced to zinc vapour by tar in the dust. Temperature and gas atmosphere were key parameters affecting the zinc removal from the dust. The zinc removal rate increased with increasing temperature and was close to completion at 1100oC. - Optimal conditions for removal of zinc from the furnace dust include: temperature in the range 1000-1150oC, inert gas atmosphere and furnace dust fraction in the furnace dust-manganese ore mixture above 60%. - Zinc removal in the processing of manganese furnace dust in the sinter plant was low because of zinc reoxidation in the sinter bed. This makes the sinter plant unsuitable for recycling of the dust. More suitable conditions for utilisation of manganese furnace dust exist in the rotary hearth furnace, which development is recommended for further study.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Reduction</field><field name="subject">Manganese furnace dust</field><field name="subject">Sintering</field><field name="subject">Zinc</field><field name="subject">Tar</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44542</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Impulse response measurement and spatio-temporal response acquisition</field><field name="creator">Meng, Qingqing, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this thesis, exponentially swept sine technique for measuring the impulse response are developed.

Another type of coatings arc amorphous. rather than crystalline. for example those based on fullerene-like carbon nitride (CNx). Such coatings possess high elasticity. but relatively low hardness.  In this study. bi-Iayer coatings. designed as 1I CNx-based outer layer and a TiAlN-based inner layer. were deposited on either a silicon substrate or a high speed steel M2 substrate. The CNx outer layer incorporated either Ti/AI or Cr to improve its hardness. Cr was also added to the TiAIN based inner layer in some of the coatings. Detailed microstructural characterization and nanoindentation. to assess contact damage. \\CTC carried out on these coatings. The results showed that the microstructure of these coatings plays a critical part in the contact response. The addition ofCr into the CNx layer improves the toughness of the CNx layer. It acts as an inhibitor to the propagation of shear cracks initiated from the inner TiAIN layer. The incorporation of Cr into the TiAIN-based inner layer results in refinement of grain size and solid solution hardening. subsequently, this hinders inter-columnar sliding. Which results in the plastic deformation occurring lit a higher load. The application of a Cr interlayer was found to enhance the adhesion strength between the coating and the substrate.  It was found the thicker. and harder. coatings on the ductile steel substrate generated inclined and lateral cracking. In contrast. thinner coatings initiated inter-columnar sliding and shear cracking followed by substrate plastic now. In turn. significant edge cracking (circumferential cracking) occurred in the CNx outer layer along the periphery of indent. It was also noted that nano-indentation testing using both Berkovich and spherical indenters produced different mechanical response and deformation microstructures in the coatings deposited on silicon substrates.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44544</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An integrated decision support tool for more sustainable management of biomass resources in agricultural regions</field><field name="creator">Jakrawatana, Napat, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Agriculture currently faces a number of environmental sustainability issues. Three key issues that are the focus of this study are greenhouse gas emissions, depletion of mineral phosphorus resources and cadmium contamination in agricultural soil. Biomass can potentially be used as a renewable energy source and can also be returned to improve the nutrient and drainage structure of agricultural soils. Sustainable management of biomass and agriculture can have significant impacts on reducing greenhouse gas emissions from a region. Moreover, it reduces the demand for external energy supply, phosphorous (P) based fertilizer, and it??s associated Cadmium (Cd) impurity which can contaminate the soil, plant and food chains. These three issues have typically been considered separately, and managed by different agencies or organisations. The aim of this thesis is to develop an integrated decision support tool that can be used for evaluating alternative options for management and resource recovery from biomass for enhancing recovery of energy, returning carbon (C) and phosphorus (P) from biomass back to soil, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and also cadmium (Cd) contamination in an agricultural region. This research employed a combination of the tools of Material Flow Analysis (MFA), Geographic Information System (GIS) and Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA). MFA is used as the primary tool for this research. GIS and CBA are combined with MFA in later stages of the overall procedure to develop an integrated decision support tool.  This integrated tool has been applied to the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area (MIA) in Australia. Tracking the flow of essential substances using MFA has identified current resource management efficiency and substances accumulation across the region. Integrating a spatial analysis tool (GIS) with MFA has provided a feedback driven monitoring tool for evaluating trends of spatial accumulation of substances on agricultural land. This enables the time remaining before acceptable limits are exceeded to be estimated on a spatial basis. Integrated MFA and CBA has been applied to evaluate the tradeoffs and potential synergies of alternative biomass management options. Overall the tool can assist in evaluating the effectiveness of alternative scenarios and visualise the results to stakeholders in a systematic way.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nutrient</field><field name="subject">Biomass</field><field name="subject">Energy</field><field name="subject">Material Flow Analysis</field><field name="subject">Cadmium</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44547</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Science and sentience: the case for phenomenal representationalism</field><field name="creator">Thompson, Trevor John, History &amp; Philosophy, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the epistemological and metaphysical aspects of consciousness or sentience, and how they relate to standards of scientific practice. Historically, orthodox science has denied that there are any real problems of sentience because there is no scientific evidence to support claims regarding its nature and existence. In recent years, however, new approaches to sentience have entered into scientific debate that can be classified by metaphysical frameworks that vary in their conceptions of scientific evidence. In this thesis, four such frameworks are considered and compared: Ordinary Materialism, Property Dualism, Type-F Monism and Phenomenal Representationalism. Many sentience theorists adopt an Ordinary Materialist framework that conceives of scientific observation as the interaction of our physical sensory apparatus with the surrounding physical world. Sentience-friendly theories in this framework fail to present supporting evidence that is acceptable by ordinary scientific standards. There are also contradictions in their claims that we know of conscious events via naturalised introspection, and their claims that these events create no publicly observable physical effects. Theories proposed within Property Dualist and Type-F Monist frameworks suffer from similar problems to Ordinary Materialist theories, especially contradictions between claims of knowledge by direct acquaintance and how this knowledge is stored and processed by publicly observable physical systems. Phenomenal Representationalism is advocated as the most consistent and complete way for science to deal with questions of sentience. In this framework, questions of sentience are part of wider epistemological concerns (regarding publicity, intersubjectivity, realism and scientific observation) that provide presumptions for scientific practice, rather than subjects for scientific investigation.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Intersubjectivity</field><field name="subject">Consciousness</field><field name="subject">Epistemology</field><field name="subject">Sentience</field><field name="subject">Phenomenalism</field><field name="subject">Publicity</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44548</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis and characterisation of gold and copper oxidation catalysts</field><field name="creator">Kydd, Richard Berwick, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this work, Gold and Copper oxidation catalysts supported on a range of metal oxides were synthesised via 2 previously uninvestigated preparation methods. In the first chapter, Gold nanoparticle catalysts were deposited onto TiO2, CeO2 and ZrO2 nanoparticles via the non-aqueous Modified Photodeposition procedure. This method was found to produce smaller Gold particle sizes following intrinsic excitation of the support than the conventional aqueous phase method, with surface physisorbed water apparently acting as the sacrificial reductant. The as prepared catalysts were drastically more active than those prepared by the conventional method and under standardised tests were directly comparable to those prepared by the Deposition Precipitation Method. The second part of the work, explored the preparation of metal oxide supported Copper catalysts via the Flame Spray Pyrolysis process. CO Oxidation tests established the following order of activity for 4wt% Cu loaded on the various supports: Cu-CeO2 &gt; Cu-TiO2 &gt; Cu-ZrO2 &gt; Cu-Al2O3 &gt; Cu-SiO2. CO-TPD studies found that more active materials tended to adsorbed more CO and reacted higher proportions of this with lattice oxygen to form CO2 at lower temperatures. The addition of Cu to each metal oxide surface was found to induce lengthening of the average Metal-Oxygen bond length, with higher electron density on surface O. This phenomenum is proposed as being responsible for the widely reported ???synergistic effect??? reported for similar Cu catalysts. Cu-CeO2 (0-12wt%) catalysts were tested in the Preferential CO Oxidation (COPROX) reaction. Increasing Cu content, varied the Cu morphology from monomers, through to dimers and ultimately CuO crystallites. DFT simulations of the Cu dimer structure revealed higher levels of bonding ionicity in this morphology, relative to the monomeric structure. This coincided with higher levels of activity, reinforcing the earlier finding that highly ionic bonds are conducive to higher levels of activity. High levels of activity and selectivity were maintained until approximately 423 K. Surface redox properties of the 4wt% Cu-CeO2 catalyst were assessed using temperature-programmed reduction (CO, H2) and desorption (CO) experiments, as well as in situ and phase-resolved infrared spectroscopy to study the transition to nonselective conditions. For the first time, it was demonstrated that CO and H2 react at identical surface sites, with CO2 formation proceeding simultaneously via three distinct Cux+-CO carbonyl species. Under non-selective conditions, a gradual red-shift and loss of intensity in the carbonyl peak was observed, indicating reduction of Cu+ to Cu0 and the onset of an alternate non-selective redox-type oxidation mechanism. These results for Cu-CeO2 suggest that improved low temperature catalytic activity will only be achieved at the expense of reduced high temperature selectivity and vice versa. The final section of work explored the use of Cu-based catalysts for the low temperature oxidation of Acetaldehyde (ACA). Based on this work, it is concluded that the ACA oxidation activity of these materials is determined by two main factors: the basicity of the metal oxide support (and its subsequent ability to convert ACA to carboxylates) and the availability of surface oxygen during acetate decomposition. It is proposed that a high concentration of reducible sites (either by Cu addition or naturally occurring on CeO2) accelerates the activation and provision of oxygen and also potentially provides sites for the stabilization of methoxy intermediates resulting from the acetate decomposition.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Copper</field><field name="subject">Gold</field><field name="subject">Nanoparticles</field><field name="subject">DFT</field><field name="subject">Catalyst</field><field name="subject">Catalytic</field><field name="subject">Oxidation</field><field name="subject">Purification</field><field name="subject">Pollution</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44549</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Calibration-free image sensor modelling: deterministic and stochastic</field><field name="creator">Lim, Shen Hin, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This dissertation presents the calibration-free image sensor modelling process applicable for localisation, such that these are robust to changes in environment and in sensor properties. The modelling process consists of two distinct parts, which are deterministic and stochastic techniques, and is achieved using mechanistic deconvolution, where the sensor???s mechanical and electrical properties are utilised. 	In the deterministic technique, the sensor???s effective focal length is first estimated by known lens properties, and is used to approximate the lens system by a thick lens and its properties. The aperture stop position offset???which is one of the thick lens properties???then derives a new factor, namely calibration-free distortion effects factor, to characterise distortion effects inherent in the sensor. Using this factor and the given pan and tilt angles of an arbitrary plane of view, the corrected image data is generated.  The corrected data complies with the image sensor constraints modified by the pan and tilt angles. In the stochastic technique, the stochastic focal length and distortion effects factor are first approximated, using tolerances of the mechanical and electrical properties. These are then utilised to develop the observation likelihood necessary in recursive Bayesian estimation. The proposed modelling process reduces dependency on image data, and, as a result, do not require experimental setup or calibration.	An experimental setup was constructed to conduct extensive analysis on accuracy of the proposed modelling process and its robustness to changes in sensor properties and in pan and tilt angles without recalibration. This was compared with a conventional modelling process using three sensors with different specifications and achieved similar accuracy with one-seventh the number of iterations. The developed model has also shown itself to be robust and, in comparison to the conventional modelling process, reduced the errors by a factor of five. Using area coverage method and one-step lookahead as control strategies, the stochastic sensor model was applied into a recursive Bayesian estimation application and was also compared with a conventional approach. The proposed model provided better target estimation state, and also achieved higher efficiency and reliability when compared with the conventional approach.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stochastic</field><field name="subject">Image Sensor Model</field><field name="subject">Probablistic</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44563</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A combination of molecular and traditional chemotherapy: prospects of synergies against cancer</field><field name="creator">Singh, Preetinder Pal, Clinical School - Prince of Wales Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this study, we have explored the combination of a novel Purine Nucleoside Phosphorylase mediated Gene-Directed Enzyme Prodrug Therapy (PNP-GDEPT) with chemotherapeutics, Taxotere and/or Carboplatin to target prostate and ovarian cancer (PC &amp; OC). PNP converts the prodrug (Fludarabine-phosphate) to a toxic purine, 2-fluoroadenine (2FA) that inhibits RNA/DNA synthesis. Taxotere is active against late stage PC whilst carboplatin is first line therapy for OC. Neither modality is adequately effective. We expect that a combination will target heterogeneity via cytotoxicity to diverse cancer cell populations leading to effective synergies, which may improve efficacy and quality of life. For PC, Synergy between Ad-PNP-GDEPT and Taxotere were assessed in vitro and in vivo. Cell killing effects of combination led to significant synergistic killing of human PC-3 &amp; murine RM1 PC cells accompanied by enhanced apoptosis. A lower individual dose (by up to 8 fold) led to enhanced efficacy. In vivo, the combination regimen given at the suboptimal doses led to reduction in local tumour (PC-3 &amp; RM1) growth in nude and in C57BL/6 mice, respectively. A significant reduction in lung RM1 colony numbers indicated enhanced systemic efficacy. Combination treated mice also displayed significantly improved survival (25 days vs 15 days for control mice). Importantly, the condition of combination treated mice (e.g. weight loss) was better than those given individual treatments. The possible involvement of the immune system in this enhanced effect is under investigation. For OC, three-way synergy between Ad-PNP-GDEPT, Taxotere and carboplatin was effectively demonstrated in SKOV-3 and OVCAR-3 cells. This was significantly greater than bimodal or individual treatments. A 10-50 fold dose reduction of individual treatments was effective when combined, accompanied by enhanced apoptosis. Western-blotting analyses revealed a shift in the expression of anti-apoptotic and proapoptotic proteins upon treatment with various combinations. This is the first demonstration of synergy between these modalities.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Prostate cancer</field><field name="subject">Combination therapy</field><field name="subject">Ovarian cancer</field><field name="subject">Gene therapy</field><field name="subject">Apoptosis</field><field name="subject">PNP-GDEPT</field><field name="subject">Adenovirus</field><field name="subject">Her-2 neu</field><field name="subject">Survivin</field><field name="subject">Transcriptional and transductional targeting</field><field name="subject">Chemotherapy</field><field name="subject">Docetaxel</field><field name="subject">Carboplatin</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44564</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A re-examination of benchmark beating evidence</field><field name="creator">Saune, Naibuka Uluilakeba, Accounting, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the extent to which benchmark beating by Australian firms around the earnings level and earnings changes thresholds can be reliably interpreted as evidence of earnings management. A number of recent academic papers challenge the earnings management explanation for the observed kinks in the distribution of net Income. In response to this criticisms, this thesis is motivated to conduct tests of earnings management with a refined methodology of selecting a subset of firms immediately above the threshold that have a priori incentives to achieve the benchmark. This approach allows for investigations to focus on benchmark beating observations where earnings manipulations would be more prevalent and thereby provide a powerful test for the existence of opportunistic reporting. The paper uses a number of unexpected accruals measures including the Kothari et al. (2005) performance matched models. In testing the hypotheses, this thesis utilises two approaches which were; the regression approach and the test of difference of means approach. Based on a broad sample drawn from all listed Australian firms for the years 1995-2007, small profit firms and small increase firms with high price-to-sales ratio were found to have evidence consistent with opportunistic benchmark beating behaviour. Similar results are also documented for benchmark beating firms with low book-to-market (high market-to-book) ratio. This thesis also finds that firms with equity offering incentives who reported improvement in earnings display unexpected accruals consistent with earnings management. In addition, the accounting behaviour of firms which previously incurred a loss is consistent with earnings management explanation. Firms with long strings of earnings increases also appear to use accounting discretion in order to avoid earnings deterioration. Similarly, evidence of earnings management are also displayed by small profit firms which have consistently reported negative earnings. Finally, this thesis provides evidence that resolves the apparent paradox that benchmark beating is evidence of earnings management which is devoid of the statistical artefact argument posited by Durtschi and Easton (2005) and Durtschi and Easton (2008).</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Unexpected accruals</field><field name="subject">Earnings management</field><field name="subject">Benchmark beating</field><field name="subject">Performance matched unexpected accruals</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44565</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improved flux and torque estimators for application in direct torque controlled IPM synchronous motors at very low speed</field><field name="creator">Sayeef, Saad Mohammad, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">A number of essential and important improvements of a direct torque controlled interior permanent magnet (IPM) synchronous motor drive are presented in this thesis. The studies comprising of analytical, modelling and experimental implementation indicate clearly the potential of a high-performance direct torque controlled IPM synchronous motor drive without any rotor position or speed sensor.  The direct torque control (DTC) technique, its associated problems and algorithms to overcome these problems have been investigated in this thesis. Analysis and compensation of non-linear effects of the inverter such as forward voltage drop and dead-time, speed sensorless control and extraction of accurate rotor position information for reliable sensorless operation of a direct torque controlled IPM synchronous motor drive, especially at very low speeds, are of major concern in this thesis.  Two different speed estimation algorithms, a rotor flux linkage vector and an adaptive sliding mode based observers, were implemented on space vector modulated (SVM) DTC IPM drives. Experimental results show good performance of the observers but their performance at very low speed becomes unsatisfactory, mainly due to non-linearities of the inverter.  Compensation schemes for the non-linear characteristics of the inverter were proposed. Experimental results show significant reduction in stator flux linkage and torque estimation error, leading to improved low speed performance of the DTC IPM drive. However, extremely low speed including zero speed sensorless operation of the DTC IPM drive is not achievable using the offline compensation technique.  A high frequency signal injection algorithm is proposed, where a carrier excitation signal is superimposed on the d-component of the stator voltage in the estimated rotor reference frame and an alternating high frequency current response is detected in the q- direction of the same frame with its amplitude modulated by the rotor position estimation error. The stator flux linkages and torque are estimated using the current model of the IPM machine with the obtained rotor position information. Modelling and experimental results show that rotor position and speed can be estimated very accurately at very low speeds including standstill using the proposed algorithm. A changeover algorithm, which uses a weighting function, is proposed and implemented for smooth handover of observers during transitions between low and high speeds.  The abovementioned studies show that the DTC techniques for IPM machines have now been further improved and are closer to being a viable and cost-effective candidate for sensorless PM synchronous motor drives.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44566</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An examination of accounting distortions</field><field name="creator">Lai, Cheng Yee, Accounting, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">One of the main objectives of financial reporting is to provide information about enterprise resources, claims to those resources, and changes in those resources (Statement of Financial Accounting Concepts No.1).

Presented here are the results of multi-molecular lines mapping of the entire giant molecular cloud G333, comprised sites of low- and high-mass star forming regions in various evolution stages of star formation. The result shows the spatial distribution of CS, HCO+, HCN and HNC are similar on large scales, while N2H+ seems to trace preferentially the very densest regions, possibly due to the chemical difference, that N2H+ is sensitive to temperature and readily destroyed by CO. Two analysis methods were used to characterise this large set of data cubes: GAUSSCLUMPS and principal component analysis (PCA). We found the clumps are heavily fragmented with a beam filling factor of ~0.2. We found no correlation between clump radius and line width, contradicts to Larson's Law. Possible explanation is the clumps are fragmented and unresolved with the resolution of Mopra beam, thus the decomposed clump radius is blended and no physical properties can be interpreted. PCA of the velocity dimension found no significant differences among CS, HCO+, HNC and C2H line emissions, suggesting these four molecules are `well-mixed' on large scale, possibly by turbulence. PCA of the integrated emission maps separates molecules into low (13CO and C18O) and high (the rest) density tracers, identifies anti-correlation between HCO+ and N2H+ (due to the depletion of CO). The possibility of removing the scanning patterns of the `on-the-fly' mapping with PCA was also explored. The detection of broad thermal SiO from the massive dense cold core G333.125-0.562, along with other collected transitions, suggesting the core will host massive star formation and the SiO emission arises from shocks associated with an outflow in the cold core.

Current design guidelines are based on investigations which predominantly used monochromatic waves, thereby neglecting group effects which are inherent to the free propagation of waves in deep water. The Coastal Engineering Manual (CEM) states that wave grouping and its consequences is of significant concern, with breakwater armour damage being generally attributed to higher waves associated with wave groups. However, the CEM also acknowledges that there is little guidance and few formulae for use in practical engineering.  This thesis describes a laboratory-based investigation into the effect of wave groupiness on wave shoaling, breaking and surf zone processes. New optical-based techniques for data abstraction, developed within this study, have allowed examination of the interaction between deep water intra-wave group processes and shallow water shoaling processes. The applicability of existing methods for predicting breaking wave height and position is evaluated, along with the implications of groupiness on engineering design in the nearshore. The effect of wave groupiness on overtopping and hazard on emerged rock platforms is similarly assessed. Wave group testing has revealed that the spatial phasing of intra-group processes during shoaling can result in considerably different shoaling and breaking regimes. Under certain regimes, wave breaking occurred further shoreward and in a more plunging manner than under other regimes. Within the mid to inner surf zone, waves were also observed to propagate into shallower water before breaking than is predicted by existing design guidelines. This could result in under-prediction of wave height by up to 100%. Expressions are developed for the prediction of maximum wave heights and surface elevation on plane slopes. These expressions implicitly include non-linear group effects and group-induced water-level variations within the surf zone, and are found to provide conservative upper envelopes for the range of data observed within the current testing regimes.  Predictive schemes are similarly developed for overtopping hazard on emerged rock platforms based on critical wave and water-level conditions. Variations in maximum overtopping flow values due to intra-wave group processes of up to +/-35% were found. These group effects were found to reduce by up to 30% the threshold wave conditions before the initiation of hazard.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Shoaling</field><field name="subject">Wave</field><field name="subject">Wave breaking</field><field name="subject">Wave group</field><field name="subject">Surf zone</field><field name="subject">Rock platform</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44588</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Foreign investment, return volatility, and economic growth in emerging markets</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Quang Ngoc, Banking &amp; Finance, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">THIS DISSERTATION EXAMINES THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN TNVESTMENT IN EMERGING MARKETS ALTHOUGH THE EFFECT OF FOREIGN INVESTMENT HAS BEEN CONSTANTLY EXAMINED IN VARIOUS ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL LITERATURES OUR APPROACH IS UNIQUE IN TWO WAYS, FIRSTLY, WE LOOK AT THE ISSUE OF FOREIGN INVESTMENT FROM A FIRM???LEVEL PERSPECTIVE AND THUS ARE ABLE TO SEE THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES WHICH FOREIGN INVESTMENT BRINGS UPON INDIVIDUAL FIRMS SECONDLY, WE DEPART FROM EXISTING LITERATURE.

Part One lays a conceptual foundation, presenting three arguments. Firstly, three discourses of religion are inscribed across the general discourse of IR: the secular, sacral and integrated discourses. Second, together the discourses comprise the religious structure of IR. This construction encourages a situative approach (asking ???where is religion????) rather than a normative one (which asks ???what is religion????). Third, the religious structure and the situative question combine to form the dynamics of religion model, a heuristic framework that meets the present need in IR to accommodate and differentiate secular, integrated and sacral elements of religion. Part Two operationalises the model via a study of religion in international development, occurring at three levels. At the level of discourse, ???orthodox??? and ???critical??? schools of development are situated within a religious structure, revealing the pervasive nature of religion throughout development theory. At the institutional level, the model is applied to analyse how religion entered the operational sphere of the World Bank Group (WBG). This application differentiates secular, integrated and sacral interests at work within and upon the WBG in the 1980s and 1990s, highlighting in new ways the ubiquity of religion in the development sphere. At the policy level, the model is applied to critically compare three ???faith and development??? partnerships initiated by the WBG in the period 1998-2005. The model is then applied to a partnership between the WBG and the World Faiths Development Dialogue (WFDD), an initiative that began as an integrated vision of religion and development but gradually disintegrated. These studies highlight the significant challenges that exist to incorporating religious dynamics into development orthodoxy. Finally, the model is used to situate religious actors into critical approaches toward the WBG, highlighting the dynamics of inclusion and exclusion of religious actors in the global development agenda. Overall, a new integrative model of religion is thus employed as an organising force in the study of IR and development.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">International development</field><field name="subject">Religion</field><field name="subject">International relations</field><field name="subject">Secularism</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44590</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Control of the human thumb and fingers</field><field name="creator">Yu, Wei Shin, Prince of Wales Medical Research Institute, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">In daily activities, hand use is dominated by individuated thumb and finger movements, and by grasping. This thesis focused on the level of ???independence??? of the digits and its relationship to hand grasps, from the level of the motor units to the level of synergistic grasping forces. Four major studies were conducted in healthy adult volunteers. First, spike-triggered averages of forces produced by single motor units in flexor pollicis longus (FPL) in a grasp posture showed small but significant loading of the index, but not other fingers. This reflected a neural rather than anatomical coupling, as intramuscular stimulation produced minimal effect in any finger. Also, FPL had a surprisingly large number of low-force motor units and this may account for the thumb???s exceptional dexterity and force stability compared with the fingers. Second, independent control of extensor digitorum (ED) was more limited than flexor digitorum profundus (FDP), as more ED motor units of a ???test??? finger were recruited inadvertently by extension than by flexion of adjacent digits. Third, ???force enslavement??? in maximal voluntary tasks was greater in digit extension than flexion. The distribution of force enslavement (and deficits) matched the pattern of daily use of the digits (alone and in combination), and reveals a neural control system which preferentially lifts fingers together from an object by extension but allows an individual digit to flex to contact an object so the finger pads can engage in exploration and grasping. Finally, during grasping, irrespective of whether a digit had been lifted from the object, coherence among forces generated by the digits was similar. In addition, the coherence between finger forces was independent of any contraction of the thumb, was stable over 2 months, and required no learning. The pattern of coherence between digital grasping forces may be closely related to the level of digit independence and daily use. Overall, the grasp synergy was remarkably invariant over the various tasks and over time. In summary, this thesis demonstrates novel aspects of the properties of FPL, the lack of complete independence of the digits, and robustness in the production of flexion forces in hand grasps.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Neuromuscular control</field><field name="subject">Human digits</field><field name="subject">Grasping</field><field name="subject">Enslavement</field><field name="subject">FDP</field><field name="subject">ED</field><field name="subject">Motor unit co-activation threshold</field><field name="subject">Motor units</field><field name="subject">Spike-triggered averaging</field><field name="subject">Grasping force coherence</field><field name="subject">Extension</field><field name="subject">Flexion</field><field name="subject">Independence</field><field name="subject">FPL</field><field name="subject">FDS</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44591</field></doc><doc><field name="title">High strain-rate behaviour of bolted joints in carbon fibre composite structures</field><field name="creator">Pearce, Garth Morgan Kendall, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">An investigation is presented into the behaviour of carbon fibre composite joints subjected to dynamic loading rates in the range of 0.1 m/s to 10 m/s. The research is focused on the response of single fastener joints and more complex structural arrangements involving multiple fasteners and complex loads.  Fasteners play a crucial role in the joining of aerospace components due to their ease of installation and inspection and their resistance to creep and environmental degradation. A consequence of the operating environment of aircraft is that many critical load cases involve impact and crash. These loading events are characterised by high loading rates, high kinetic energy and possibly loads well above the static design case. The properties of composite materials change with loading rate, so it is likely that the behaviour of bolted composite joints may also vary significantly. Dynamic behaviour of bolted joints is an area of research that has been given little attention to date. The few available papers on the topic are limited to the investigation of ideal bearing loads and include some contradictory results.  The research developed a detailed understanding of the behaviour of bolted joints in composite structures through a combined numerical and experimental investigation. A set of quasi-static and dynamic single fastener joint tests was conducted to develop an understanding of the complex failure mechanisms present in bolted composite joints. Simple structural tests were developed to investigate the interaction of multiple bolts in a joint. High speed camera footage, full-field strain measurement and CT scanning techniques were all used to develop an understanding of the changes in the failure process with increased loading rate.  Finite element analyses used implicit and explicit dynamic algorithms to model the tests. The finite element analysis contributed to the understanding of the experimental results as well as providing a predictive tool to minimise the need for further testing. A method of incorporating detailed information about bolt failure into large scale structural models was investigated and developed.  The original contributions of this thesis involve novel dynamic joint testing including dynamic pull-through and structural tests. CT Scanning was utilised in a novel way to investigate the complex failure modes within a bolted joint. Novel finite element techniques were developed for modelling bolted joints at both a detailed level and a simplified level for structural analyses. These contributions significantly improve the current understanding of bolted joint failure, both quasi-statically and dynamically, and will allow for more efficient design of bolted composite structures for crash and impact loads.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dynamic Testing</field><field name="subject">Composite Materials</field><field name="subject">Impact</field><field name="subject">Carbon Fibre</field><field name="subject">Bolted Joints</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44593</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The investment climate in Brazil, Russia, India and China: a study of integration, equity returns and sovereign risk</field><field name="creator">Nikolova, Biljana , Banking &amp; Finance, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this thesis I study the investment climate in the four rapidly growing emerging economies Brazil, Russia, India and China (BRIC). The first study, Chapter 2, uses a bivariate EGARCH methodology with time varying conditional correlation to study the global and regional integration of the BRICs and to identify the existence of diversification opportunities for international investors. The second study, Chapter 3, employs a restricted version of the model to explore the relationship between equity market returns and volatility of equity returns in the BRIC countries and global oil prices. Chapter 4 is an extension of Chapter 3, and focuses on the sustainability of Russia???s economic growth in view of its large dependence on oil income. A qualitative analysis of the oil industry in Russia, including an overview of the operations of the largest oil producing companies, government regulations, oil production and proven oil reserves, is conducted for the purpose of this study. The last study, Chapter 5, uses a panel data methodology to explore the determinants of changes in sovereign bond spreads for the BRICs as an asset class and for each of the BRIC countries individually. I conclude that the regional and global level of integration of the BRICs is relatively low, and portfolio investors can enjoy sound diversification benefits particularly by taking investment positions in the Indian and Chinese equity markets. Despite the aggressive economic growth of the BRICs and their increased oil consumption, the volatility of stock returns from the BRICs does not have a significant impact on global oil prices; however, oil prices do impact the volatility of equity returns in India and China, and particularly the level of returns and volatility of equity returns in Russia. Based on this and the qualitative analysis in Chapter 4, it is concluded that in the short to medium term Russia???s continued economic growth will depend on increased reinvestment in the oil industry and in the longer term the government should diversify its revenue sources and focus on development of other sectors within the economy. Lastly, it is concluded that sovereign risk in the BRICs is driven by different global and country-specific factors, hence risk should be observed on an individual country basis and not for the BRICs as an asset class.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dynamic correlation</field><field name="subject">BRIC</field><field name="subject">Volatility spillover</field><field name="subject">Sovereign spreads</field><field name="subject">Emerging markets</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44594</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Insulin resistance in patients with kidney disease: the role of adiponectin</field><field name="creator">Shen, Yvonne Yun Hwa, Clinical School - St George Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">The multifunctional glycoprotein, adiponectin has insulin-sensitising, anti-atherogenic and anti-inflammatory properties. However, despite the prevalence of both insulin resistance (IR) and vascular disease in patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), I found levels of adiponectin in these subjects to be high. The high molecular weight (HMW) isoform of adiponeclin is thought to be the most insulin-sensitising form and binds to two receptors, adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1) and adiponectin receptor 2 (AdipoR2). I found that both the proportion of the HMW moiety and AdipoR expression on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were increased in patients on haemodialysis, Further studies showed equivalent phosphorylation of AMP-kinase by recombinant adiponectin implying that AdipoR on PBMC from controls and patients with ESKD were equally functional. Thus, IR in ESKD was not explained by a change in isoform distribution nor by AdipoR down-regulation or dysfunction. Rather, this receptor-ligand axis is up-regulated and may be a beneficial response to the inflammatory milieu of ESKD  After successful renal transplantation, IR (measured as HOMA-R) was lower compared to the group on haemodialysis and this coincided with lower levels of total adiponeclin, the absolute amount of the HMW isoform and of AdipoR on PBMCs. Lower AdipoR post-transplantation may be secondary to immunosuppression and/or an improvement in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and the uraemic milieu. Exposure to uraemic sera in vitro resulted in greater up-regulation of AdipoR on PBMC than that observed with sera from healthy controls. Uraemic sera fractionated by fast protein liquid chromatography {FPLC} showed siginificant up-regulation of AdipoR with each fraction. These results suggested that there may be multiple compounds in uraemic sera that up-regulate AdipoR on PBMC. However, there was discordant induction of AdipoR on PBMC from healthy controls in-vitro after exposure to uraemic sera in comparison to the "native" expression of AdipoR on PBMC from these same individuals with ESKD, This suggested that AdipoR expression is influenced by both serum and serum-independent factors.  Functional AdipoR were also identified on cultured proximal tubular cells, Ligation of AdipoR by recombinant adiponectin on these cells increased phosphorylation of AMPK, and specifically down-regulated the secretion of monocyte chemoattractant protein-' (MCP-') showing that the adiponeetin/AdipoR system may also be involved in the regulation of inflammatory processes in the kidney.  Together, these results show that adiponectin and its receptors may have a protective role in subjects with kidney disease and that these effects may extend to local effects within the kidney itself.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44567</field></doc><doc><field name="title">What does it mean to engage with the state? a comparative case study of two non-government organisations working with marginalised young people.</field><field name="creator">Edgar, Gemma Tamsin, Social Sciences &amp; International Studies, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is centrally concerned with the question of how non-government organisations (NGOs) can support marginalised young people and the role the state plays in facilitating this. It utilises a comparative case study methodology and examines the circumstances of two NGOs, Twenty10: Gay and Lesbian Youth Support, located in Sydney, Australia and the Albert Kennedy Trust (AKT) which is located in both London and Manchester in the United Kingdom. Twenty10 and AKT share a similar client base: both work with gay, lesbian, bisexual and/or transgendered (GLBT) young people experiencing homelessness or in a housing crisis. Both also engage in advocacy and service provision. At the time of my fieldwork Twenty10 and AKT differed in two key respects. First, AKT operated in a political context that was significantly more open to NGO advocacy than was the case for Twenty10. Second, AKT was supported almost entirely by the work of volunteers and through philanthropic support, whereas Twenty10 received the bulk of its funding from government. These differing factors allow a consideration of how the varying nature of an NGO???s relationship with the state impacts upon their activities within varying political contexts.  The theoretical frameworks drawn upon in this thesis are those of citizenship theory and queer theory. Citizenship theory is particularly useful in analysing the objectives of Twenty10 and AKT, which focus on redressing the distributive and recognition based needs of their young people. The strategies employed by these organisations are also both subsumed within the normative framework of citizenship theory ??? while nonetheless being dependent upon how closely each engages with the state. These case studies are situated against the queer critique of citizenship discourses, which emphasise its normalising and de-politicising consequences. As such, this thesis evaluates critiques of forms of activism that involve citizenship-focused issues and engagement with the state, and hence examines the effect a relationship with the state can have upon an NGO???s work.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Queer Theory</field><field name="subject">Non-government organisations</field><field name="subject">CItizenship</field><field name="subject">Third sector</field><field name="subject">Sexuality</field><field name="subject">Homelessness</field><field name="subject">Gay and lesbian</field><field name="subject">Civil Society</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44569</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On the construction of reliable device drivers</field><field name="creator">Ryzhyk, Leonid, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This dissertation is dedicated to the problem of device driver reliability. Software defects in device drivers constitute the biggest source of failure in operating systems, causing significant damage through downtime and data loss. Previous research on driver reliability has concentrated on detecting and mitigating defects in existing drivers using static analysis or runtime isolation. In contrast, this dissertation presents an approach to reducing the number of defects through an improved device driver architecture and development process. In analysing factors that contribute to driver complexity and induce errors, I show that a large proportion of errors are due to two key shortcomings in the device-driver architecture enforced by current operating systems: poorly-defined communication protocols between drivers and the operating system, which confuse developers and lead to protocol violations, and a multithreaded model of computation, which leads to numerous race conditions and deadlocks. To address the first shortcoming, I propose to describe driver protocols using a formal, state-machine based, language, which avoids confusion and ambiguity and helps driver writers implement correct behaviour. The second issue is addressed by abandoning multithreading in drivers in favour of a more disciplined event-driven model of computation, which eliminates most concurrency-related faults. These improvements reduce the number of defects without radically changing the way drivers are developed. In order to further reduce the impact of human error on driver reliability, I propose to automate the driver development process by synthesising the implementation of a driver from the combination of three formal specifications: a device-class specification that describes common properties of a class of similar devices, a device specification that describes a concrete representative of the class, and an operating system interface specification that describes the communication protocol between the driver and the operating system. This approach allows those with the most appropriate skills and knowledge to develop specifications: device specifications are developed by device manufacturers, operating system specifications by the operating system designers. The device-class specification is the only one that requires understanding of both hardware and software-related issues. However writing such a specification is a one-off task that only needs to be completed once for a class of devices.  This approach also facilitates the reuse of specifications: a single operating-system specification can be combined with many device specifications to synthesise drivers for multiple devices. Likewise, since device specifications are independent of any operating system, drivers for different systems can be synthesised from a single device specification. As a result, the likelihood of errors due to incorrect specifications is reduced because these specifications are shared by many drivers. I demonstrate that the proposed techniques can be incorporated into existing operating systems without sacrificing performance or functionality by presenting their implementation in Linux. This implementation allows drivers developed using these techniques to coexist with conventional Linux drivers, providing a gradual migration path to more reliable drivers.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Reliability</field><field name="subject">Operating systems</field><field name="subject">Device drivers</field><field name="subject">Domain-specific languages</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44570</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Buzzing: post-9/11 Muslim male identity, stereotypes, and beehive metaphors</field><field name="creator">Syed, Abdullah, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">Echoing Edward Said&#146;s Orientalism, and Homi Bhabha&#146;s notion of the stereotype as mimicry (camouflage), this research project investigates the recent construction of a Muslim male identity as the Other and Self-Othering following the destruction by al- Qaeda of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, referred to colloquially as &#145;post-9/11&#146;. The fear of a bearded Muslim terrorist, of attacks from Muslim fundamentalist organizations, the distrust leading to extreme security measures and the subsequent laws contributing to the discrimination and radicalization of the Muslim community are analysed. This research identifies and explains the myths surrounding the Muslim cultural and religious practices relating to the traditional appearance of a Muslim male, specifically the beard and marks of prostration, along with associated imagery derived from the prayer rug, Muslim worship, Salat, and the mosque. Beehive metaphors in Western and Muslim art, history, literature and media are explored. The dualistic concepts surrounding the stereotypes and personifications that result in &#145;otherness&#146; are the key aspects of this research. Using the binary nature of beehive metaphors, as well as both cultures&#146; propaganda about the West&#146;s Crusade and Islam&#146;s Jihad, the making of a post-9/11 Muslim identity as jihadi, martyr and terrorist are investigated, culminating in artworks comprising of self-portraiture, sculptures, prints, drawings and installation art. These express layers of interpretation of the clash of international political entities alongside the cultural contestations and religious belief systems within the Muslim culture, and reflections upon my own identity as a Muslim man divided between the East and the West. Due to its conceptual yet allegorical content, this research is descriptive, and is intended to lay the ground for future research aimed at examining the compounded variables of potential cultural clashes, religious conflicts, and political action.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Post-9/11</field><field name="subject">Stereotypes</field><field name="subject">Muslim Male Identity</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44571</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards sustainable tourism in outback Australia: the behaviour and impact of nature-based tourists on vegetation and selected wildlife species</field><field name="creator">Wolf, Isabelle Diana Felicitas Gudula, Biological, Earth &amp;  Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Nature-based tourism offers significant socio-economic incentives to successfully replace more intrusive land uses but also causes negative environmental impacts. Currently, knowledge is needed about the effectiveness of specific management actions such as the provision of different access modes and tour experiences at minimizing these impacts while maximizing visitor satisfaction. Nature-based tourism activities were studied in the species-rich gorges of the Flinders Ranges in Outback Australia. This study developed a conceptual framework of visitor-environment relationships, constructed a regional visitor profile, assessed visitor monitoring methods to quantify usage intensity in relation to the access mode (roads vs. hiking trails), examined changes in vegetation and bird communities in relation to usage intensity and access mode, tested effects of approach behaviour among driving vs. hiking tourists on kangaroo behaviour, and designed a framework for a night-time wildlife tour. The usage intensity of gorge sections was best determined from visitor numbers stratified by their behaviour, as the access mode fundamentally changed visitor behaviour in gorges. High compared to low usage recreational tracks altered species community composition, decreased total plant cover, increased non-native species cover, increased or decreased plant diversity depending on the track distance, increased soil compaction, and decreased bird numbers and species richness. Vegetation changes had secondary aversive effects on the bird community. The magnitude and spatial extent of these community impacts were greater along roads than trails. Visitor approach towards kangaroos varied with the access mode and necessitated individual recommendations for low-impact behaviour. The optimal night-time observation tour employed night-vision devices and bat detectors and coupled visitor satisfaction with low impact on wildlife. A range of factors (e.g., weather conditions) moderated the susceptibility of the wildlife to tourism disturbance. To protect wildlife and habitat along recreational tracks in arid-lands gorges, it is recommended to (1) monitor usage intensity and the identified impact indicators within their effect zone, (2) curtail gorge usage by restricting vehicle access to sections and regulating high impact activities (e.g., wild camping), (3) base environmental education upon scientifically tested low-impact visitor behaviour, and (4) engage with tourism operators in the design of low-impact, yet satisfying tours based on scientific principles.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sustainable tourism</field><field name="subject">Nature-based tourism</field><field name="subject">Sustainability</field><field name="subject">Wildlife tourism</field><field name="subject">Night vision device</field><field name="subject">Bat detection</field><field name="subject">Impact</field><field name="subject">Visitor satisfaction</field><field name="subject">Tour experience</field><field name="subject">Invasive species</field><field name="subject">Species indicator</field><field name="subject">Flight</field><field name="subject">Diversity</field><field name="subject">Arid</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Usage intensity</field><field name="subject">Visitor monitoring</field><field name="subject">Bird community</field><field name="subject">Vegetation community</field><field name="subject">Kangaroo behaviour</field><field name="subject">Night-time observation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44572</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Locating vulnerability in the field of patient safety</field><field name="creator">Travaglia, Joanne Francis, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis sheds new light on the problem of errors and adverse events in medicine. It does so by considering patient safety from a critical, sociological perspective. Four questions drive the thesis: what is meant by patient safety and how did it develop into a major focus for health services at the end of the 20th Century? How can patient safety be examined from a social as well as technical perspective? What are the differences and similarities in the narratives about patient safety emerging from clinicians, health services, patients and the media? What do these narratives tell us about professionals' understanding of key concepts such as error, safety, risk and vulnerability? Empirically, I analyse via data mining techniques a sample of externally documented key international and national inquiries into adverse events and medical errors, and present the results of 30 focus groups comprising 195 individuals who were asked about their views on patient safety.  By applying an analytical framework drawn from the work of Bourdieu to these data, I show that what has generally come to be understood to be a technical endeavour, involving the identification of causes, and the implementation and evaluation of solutions to errors and adverse events, can be understood as a field within which stakeholders struggle over taken for granted concepts of error, risk, safety and vulnerability. In doing so, stakeholders utilise a variety of strategies to gain the cultural, symbolic and social capital which can affect the quality of care available to vulnerable individuals and groups. By conceptualising patient safety as a field, it is possible to expand our understanding of the causes of error into the social relations and attitudes between patients and clinicians, and to capture how external forces, such as the legal system, the media, and politics directly affect the practice of health professionals.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44573</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Collapse analysis of block structures in frictional contact</field><field name="creator">Tran-Cao, Tri, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Computing the collapse load and identifying the associated mechanism of block assemblage structures is an important task in historical restoration works. The research in this thesis is to contribute to the modelling and analysis of rigid block structures in dry frictional contact. The models can be applied to various structures such as masonry arches) vaults) domes, walls or piles in heritage buildings.  Estimates of the collapse load are made by solving the underlying mathematical programming problems. 2-D and 3-D models are formulated and different contact assumptions (concavity and convexity) are investigated. Both associated and nonassociated flow rules are accounted for. The associative problem can be robustly solved by the bound theorems of classical plasticity theory. However, the result is often not valid. The nonassociated rule which shows up as a complementarity relationship in the governing system is the major challenge of the project. The 3-D model is more difficult to deal with as compared to the 2-D case. Proposed methods are presented to treat the nonlinear 3-D problem (Lorentz cone) by formulating it as a second-order cone problem or by piecewise linearizing the cone as a polyhedral.  Various computational methods are proposed to obtain the best upper bound collapse load for the nonassociative model. One method formulates some extended complementarity problems that are able to restrict the domain of the collapse load variable to search for better solutions. The best method uses nonlinear programming) specifically mathematical programming with equilibrium constraints problems) to attempt to directly minimize the collapse load. Some enumerative schemes are also attempted to map out all the nonassociative solutions but proved to be computationally expensive. Various 2-D and 3-D examples are demonstrated for several different types of structures.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Limit analysis</field><field name="subject">Friction</field><field name="subject">Mathematical programming</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44574</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Occupational health and safety of young, part-time workers in the United Kingdom and Canada</field><field name="creator">Tranter, Megan Ruth, Organisation &amp; Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">As the employment landscape continues to shift to a post industrial society, new risks have emerged for less skilled young workers in flexible labour markets (Mills 2004; Taylor-Gooby 2004). This is highlighted in the fast food industry, renowned for its employment conditions such as low pay, irregular work hours and part-time work (Reiter 2002; Royle 2002). A threat to young, part-time workers that has received limited attention is occupational health and safety (OHS). While several researchers suggest poorer OHS for young employees (Knight et al. 1995; Dunn et al. 1998; Hendricks &amp; Layne 1999) and some types of precarious or temporary workers (Alsop et al. 2000; Quinlan et al. 2001; Benach et al. 2002), few have examined both.  The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of individual, task and organisational factors on OHS knowledge and hazard exposure. The study adopted a mixed method research approach using multiple case studies based on questionnaire survey and semi-structured interviews. This permitted examination of the OHS knowledge and hazard exposure of 311 young, part-time workers who worked for a multinational fast food company in the UK and Canada. A modified survey instrument from a similar study of young, casual fast food workers in Australia (NOHSC 1999) was used. The instrument consisted of open and closed questions, and included the 12-item version of the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) to measure psychological wellbeing. Franchise and company-employed workers participated in the survey. The key finding in the research was that, after controlling for all other independent variables, work experience and age did not significantly contribute to any of the OHS outcomes regarding injury or ill health (injuries, occupational violence, and psychological wellbeing) within the industry. The major predictor of OHS knowledge was weekly hours worked, although the direction of the results was mixed. The research highlighted the importance of considering multiple risk factors when evaluating OHS outcomes of young workers, especially those in precarious employment arrangements such as part-time work.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44603</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact on East Asia of China's growth, skill accumulation and trade liberalisation: a computable general equilibrium approach</field><field name="creator">Xu, Jessica Yingfang, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">The purpose of this thesis is to assess the effects of China???s growth, investment in higher education and trade liberalisation on China and its neighbouring East Asian economies. The study is conducted within the framework of a dynamic multi-sector, multi-region computational general equilibrium model, which incorporates endogenous capital and skill accumulation.  China???s trade liberalisation induces substantial investment spending and accumulation of capital and skilled labour in China and East Asia. There is a positive wage outcome for skilled and unskilled labour in both regions. The expanded trade opportunities with China should compensate East Asia for the loss of exports to the rest of the world. Complementarity exists between the exports of China and East Asia with East Asia supplying China???s skill-intensive manufacturing sectors with components and parts which are then used as inputs into China???s exports. Furthermore, the simulation results indicate that China???s trade reforms will support the industrial upgrading process in China but the impact is more apparent in the long term. As China transforms into a more skill oriented, open and competitive economy, it will impose significant structural adjustments on itself and East Asia. A large increase in the output and exports of low tech manufacturing is seen in China, as well as in the high skill sectors of intermediate manufacturing, durables and traded services. China???s exports and imports surge, further rising its presence in the global trading system. The exports of East Asia to the rest of the world decline across the sectors except for the durables sector. However, the decline in the exports of several sectors in East Asia to the rest of the world was offset by the increase in the exports of these sectors to China.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computable General Equilibrium</field><field name="subject">Economic Growth</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">Human Capital</field><field name="subject">International Trade</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44604</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Kinematic analysis of the upper limb during anatomical and functional movements in healthy children</field><field name="creator">Dwan, Leanne Nicole, Safety Science, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Impairments of upper limb function can negatively impact an individual???s ability to carry out everyday tasks. Children with cerebral palsy can have limitations of upper limb movement due to physiological and structural changes in their body. Current treatment regimes for children with upper limb involvement of cerebral palsy are assessed using a variety of qualitative assessment tools. These measures rely on subjective input from the assessor, and can be insensitive to significant functional improvements.  Research methods in upper limb motion analysis are developing towards use as clinical tools. To date, there is a paucity of knowledge on the quantitative measures of range of motion (ROM) and function of upper limbs in healthy children. There is also lack of agreement on repeatable functional tasks of the upper limb for 3D measurement. The identification of a repeatable task in healthy children would facilitate the use of upper limb 3D motion analysis to guide clinical practice and improve patient outcomes.  This thesis aims to describe upper limb joint range of movement in each degree of freedom and present normative three dimensional kinematic data of upper limb movement in healthy children during a repeatable upper limb functional task. This will provide a basis for comparison to children with movement disorders for future research and clinical practice.  The UNSW kinematic upper limb model was found to successfully measure three dimensional upper limb anatomical and functional movements in healthy children. Normative kinematic data are reported for anatomical movements and two functional tasks.  The results of the studies undertaken showed that differences in dominant and non-dominant limbs were present during anatomical and functional movements. Joint angles measured were found to be repeatable in healthy children. The results suggest that methods used were reliable for investigating upper limb kinematics. Functional movement time-series data were found to be repeatable for the group with the exception of wrist flexion/extension during the hand to mouth movement for both the dominant and non-dominant limbs.  These findings improve current knowledge on upper limb kinematics in healthy children.

A major challenge to the accurate evaluation of these reservoirs is accounting for pore scale heterogeneity on multiple scales. This is the topic of this thesis.  Conventionally, this micron scale information is achieved either by building stochastic models using 2D images or by combining log and laboratory data to classify pore types and their behaviour. None of these capture the true 3D connectivity vital for flow characterisation. We present here an approach to build realistic 3D network models across a range of scales to improve property estimation through employment of X-ray micro-Computed Tomography (&#956;CT) and Focussed Ion Beam Tomography (FIBT). The submicron, or microporous, regions are delineated through a differential imaging technique undertaken on x-ray CT providing a qualitative description of microporosity. Various 3-Phase segmentation methods are then applied for quantitative characterisation of those regions utilising the attenuation coefficient values from the 3D tomographic images. X-ray micro-CT is resolution limited and can not resolve the detailed geometrical features of the submicron pores. FIB tomography is used to image the 3D pore structure of submicron pores down to a scale of tens of nanometers. We describe the experimental development and subsequent image processing including issues and difficulties resolved at various stages.  The developed methodology is implemented on cores from producing wackstone and grainstone reservoirs. Pore network models are generated to characterise the 3D interconnectivity of pores. We perform the simulations of petrophysical properties (permeability and formation resistivity) directly on the submicron scale image data. Simulated drainage capillary pressure curves are matched with the experimental data. We also present some preliminary results for the integration of multiscale pore information to build dual-scale network models. The integration of multiscale data allows one to select appropriate effective medium theories to incorporate sub-micron structure into property calculations at macro scale giving a more realistic estimation of properties.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Focussed Ion Beam Tomography (FIB)</field><field name="subject">Pore Network Model</field><field name="subject">X-ray micro Computed Tomography (CT)</field><field name="subject">Petrophysical Properties</field><field name="subject">Microporosity</field><field name="subject">Carbonate Reservoirs</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44606</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gestational diabetes mellitus: a model for the genetics of type 2 diabetes</field><field name="creator">Eltahla, Auda Abdelsalam, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The striking similarity between Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) and Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) in terms of the pathophysiologies and the risk factors has led to the hypothesis that GDM is an early manifestation of T2D, expressed under the stress of pregnancy, and therefore both diseases should share similar susceptibility genes. GDM patients may provide a more homogeneous sample for the genetic causes of the disease than T2D, and therefore make a useful group for the identification of the genes involved. Over 200 GDM affected sib-pairs from 178 families were investigated, with parents available in 40% of cases. Genomic regions from 4 different chromosomes, 6, 8, 14 and 18 were chosen from regions that showed clustering for positive linkage scores in previous linkage studies on T2D and one control region on 13, where no previous positive linkage was reported. A total of 19 microsatellite markers were analysed for linkage to GDM using sib-pair analysis. Subset analyses were performed by ranking sib-pairs on GDM-related variables, e.g. mean BMI of sibs, age at GDM episode, etc. GENEHUNTER was run multiple times, each time including the next highest ranked family in the analysis. This gave a continuous range of scores where increasing or decreasing NPL scores indicated heterogeneity associated with different environmental factors such as age and weight. To evaluate the significance of the subset analyses, the results were compared to 10,000 permutations generated by randomly ranking the sib-pairs. Using the entire dataset, the analysis showed no significant linkage to a disease locus. Positive evidence for linkage was found with the subset analysis on chromosomes 8 and 14, suggesting heterogeneity between sib-pairs in the dataset. Marker D8S1742 on 8p23 showed an NPL score of 3.01 (p=0.001) when age at GDM diagnosis was used as a covariate. Using waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), marker D14S275 on 14q12 showed an NPL score of 2.474 (p=0.006). When adjusted for multiple testing, the results were not statistically significant for linkage to a diabetes disease locus, but gave evidence that GDM and T2D share similar genetic determinants, and defined groups of siblings for follow-up analysis of both types of diabetes.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Linkage</field><field name="subject">Diabetes</field><field name="subject">T2D</field><field name="subject">Sib-pairs</field><field name="subject">Association</field><field name="subject">Genes</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44607</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of labour markets in countries in transition in South East Europe</field><field name="creator">Kecmanovic, Milica, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis explores several aspects of the labour market in Serbia and Croatia during the process of transition from socialism to a market economy. First, it examines how women??s position in the labour market has changed in Serbia. Using five annual Labour Force Surveys (2001-2005), I find that the gender wage gap is still very low in Serbia, and is even decreasing during this period. However, decompositions that apply the Oaxaca (1974) methodology reveal that the unexplained component of the gap is very large, and is increasing. Likewise, quantile decompositions suggest that while the raw gap is falling at each of the quantiles analysed, the unexplained component is increasing at most quantiles at the same time. Thus, the relatively small gap in earnings could be masking considerable discrimination in the labour market.  Second, changes in men??s wage inequality in Serbia in the period from 2001 to 2005 are analysed using five annual Labour Force Surveys. Changes in the distribution of earnings are examined using the Lemieux (2002) decomposition methodology. I find that the change in wage inequality is mostly driven by changes in wage premiums, while the effect of changes in the composition of the labour force is very small. Isolating the effect of the emerging private sector reveals that changes in the private sector size and wage premium account for an average 25 percent of the changes in inequality during this period. Third, the effect that the recent war in Croatia (1991-1995) had on the educational and employment trajectories of the 1971 birth cohort of men is investigated. This birth cohort was most affected by the armed forces draft. I treat the occurrence of the war as a natural experiment and use data from the Croatian and Slovenian Labour Force Surveys. Applying the difference-in-difference framework and comparing this cohort to adjacent cohorts, women, and to respective cohorts in Slovenia, a neighbouring country that did not experience war, I find that the war has had a negative effect on educational outcomes and a small positive effect on the employment and earnings outcomes of this cohort of men. &#8195;</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Veteran effect</field><field name="subject">Gender wage gap</field><field name="subject">Wage inequality</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44608</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating non???pedagogical sociability of asynchronous computer supported collaborative learning environments</field><field name="creator">Abedin, Babak , Information Systems, Technology &amp; Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">While technologically Computer Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) systems have been considerably improved, previous studies have shown that the social aspect of CSCL is often neglected or assumed to happen automatically just by creating such virtual learning environments. Several studies on the other hand showed sociability of CSCL environments strongly relate to online learning enjoyment and effectiveness of learning. Social interactions in CSCL can be broadly categorized as pedagogical/on-task and non-pedagogical/non-task interactions. Accordingly, this thesis investigates the non-pedagogical sociability of CSCL environments and primarily demonstrates that non-pedagogical/non-task interactions do occur in these environments. In addition, this thesis operationalizes the notion of non-pedagogical sociability of CSCL environments and determines factors that impact on it. A multi method approach for data collection and analysis is used. Results of a content analysis extend the Transcript Analysis Tool (TAT) instrument, the tool used for the content analysis, and show the presence and pattern of a substantial amount of nonpedagogical social exchanges occur in both virtual task-related as well as non-taskrelated spaces. The findings from the survey data, on the other hand, support the SIP theory and SIDE theory predictions and revealed that the sense of cohesion and awareness of others significantly impact on the non-pedagogical sociability of CSCL. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that the perception of self-representation and perception of compatibility affect the sense of cohesion and awareness of others and indirectly contribute to the perceived non-pedagogical sociability of the environment. The findings of this thesis can be used in future research for investigating the relationship between the non-pedagogical sociability of CSCL and other CSCL factors. It also provides CSCL lecturers and facilitators with a conceptual model by which sociability can be explicitly addressed in their course planning and delivery processes. From a practical point of view, this study develops and validates an instrument that guides required changes in the CSCL for improving the non-pedagogical social functionality of the environment. The findings also stress the importance of virtual spaces in CSCL design exercises in order to provide opportunities for students to have non-task discussions and to reflect on their own and others??? experiences and ideas.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sociability</field><field name="subject">Computer supported collaborative learning</field><field name="subject">Social computing</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44577</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development and characterisation of a transgenic mouse model to investigate the mechanisms and treatment options for Androgen independent metastatic prostate cancer</field><field name="creator">Jeet, Varinder , Clinical School - Prince of Wales Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Currently, there are no preclinical immunocompetent mouse models that adequately represent all stages of prostate cancer (PC) especially, androgen depletion independent (ADI) and bone metastatic PC. The best characterized, Transgenic Adenocarcinoma of the Mouse Prostate (TRAMP) model is logistically a difficult model for in vivo assessments and it does not adequately represent all stages of PC. Therefore, the aim of this study was to broaden the TRAMP model to include ADI and bone metastatic PC. Three ADI sublines were derived from androgen-sensitive (AS) TRAMP C1 (TC1) and TRAMP C2 (TC2) parental lines in vitro by dihydrotestosterone (TC1-T5 and TC2-T5) deprivation and in vivo by growing in TRAMP female mice (TC1-F1).  The new sublines showed several characteristic features of ADI-PC 1.)  faster growth rates in vitro and in vivo 2.)  increased invasiveness 3.) androgen depletion independence in vitro and in vivo 4.) variable expression of androgen receptor 5.) downregulation of metastasis suppressor genes, E-cadherin and KAI-1. Genetic and molecular studies of ADI sublines showed alteration of genes representing major cancer related pathways. ADI TC1-T5, that displayed the most aggressive phenotype/genotype was selected to expand the TRAMP model to represent PC metastases Metastatic ability of TC1-T5 to migrate to bone and other soft tissues after intracardiac injections was shown in contrast to AS TC1 cells. Bone metastatic lesions displayed both osteoblastic and osteolytic features in multiple locations. Additionally, unlike AS TC1, the TC1-T5 tumours were able to grow with 100% incidence in the prostate and as lungs pseudometastases. The ADI PC lines were used to explore Aurora Kinases (AKs) as therapeutic targets for ADI PC. Compared to TC1, ADI-TC1-T5 cells showed a significant upregulation of AK-A and AK-B and their downstream regulators, survivin and phosphorylated-histone H3. Enhanced sensitivity of TC1-T5 to AK inhibitor VX680 functionally validated this and together with docetaxel led to enhanced efficacy which correlated with implication of AK-A/B in development of docetaxel-resistance.  Thus, TRAMP model now represents ADI-PC that can grow in the bone, lungs and in the prostate; a significant step towards a well rounded preclinical model with greater clinical relevance.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Androgen independent PCa</field><field name="subject">Prostate Cancer</field><field name="subject">Transgenic Mouse Models</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44578</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of term structure of interest rates - theory, modelling and econometrics</field><field name="creator">Chen, Shuling, Mathematics &amp; Statistics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the modelling of the term structure of interest rates, with a particular focus on empirical aspects of the modelling. In this thesis, we explore the ??-parameterised (?? being the length of time to maturity) term structure of interest rates, corresponding to the traditional T-parameterised (T being the time of maturity) term structure of interest rates. The constructions of Australian yield curves are illustrated using generic yield curves produced by the Reserve Bank of Australia based on bonds on issue and by constructed yield curves of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia derived from swap rates. The data used to build the models is Australian Treasury yields from January 1996 to December 2001 for maturities of 1, 2, 3, 5 and 10 years, and the second data used to validate the model is Australian Treasury yields from July 2000 to April 2004 for maturities of all years from 1-10. Both data were supplied by the Reserve Bank of Australia. Initially, univariate Generalised Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH), with models of individual yield increment time series are developed for a set of fixed maturities. Then, a multivariate Matrix-Diagonal GARCH model with multivariate asymmetric t-distribution of the term structure of yield increments is developed. This model captures many important properties of financial data such as volatility mean reversion, volatility persistency, stationarity and heavy tails. There are two innovations of GARCH modelling in this thesis: (i) the development of the Matrix-Diagonal GARCH model with multivariate asymmetric t-distribution using meta-elliptical distribution in which the degrees of freedom of each series varies with maturity, and the estimation is given; (ii) the development of a GARCH model of term structure of interest rates (TS-GARCH). The TS-GARCH model describes the parameters specifying the GARCH model and the degrees of freedom using simple smooth functions of time to maturity of component series. TS-GARCH allows an empirical description of complete interest rate yield curve increments therefore allowing the model to be used for interpolation to additional maturity beyond those used to construct the model. Diagnostics of TS-GARCH model are provided using Australian Treasury bond yields.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">GARCH</field><field name="subject">Yields</field><field name="subject">Term structure of interest rates</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44579</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Late Cainozoic rainforest vertebrates from Australopapua: evolution, biogeography and extinction</field><field name="creator">Hocknull, Scott Alexander, Biological, Earth &amp;  Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Understanding the evolution, biogeography and extinction of Australopapuan vertebrate lineages is fundamental to determining baseline responses of those groups to past environmental change. In light of predicted climatic change and anthropogenic impact, it is imperative to determine the trajectories of Australia???s modern flora and fauna. In particular, mesothermic rainforest faunas are among Australia???s most vulnerable terrestrial biota under threat from both natural and anthropogenic causes. There is a gap in knowledge of past patterns of change and, in particular, a conspicuous lack of direct evidence of response of rainforest faunas to past climatic change. This study documents the late Cainozoic Australopapuan rainforest vertebrate record and its response to environmental change via adaptive radiation, biogeographical change and extinction. In particular, it provides the first detailed systematic appraisal of Quaternary fossil sites and local faunas from northern Australia. The study documents the only known Quaternary mesothermic rainforest fauna in Australia and its transition to a xeric-adapted fauna during the middle Pleistocene. The fossil assemblages analysed are comprised of dozens of species, including several new genera and species. Each fossil taxon shares a close phylogenetic relationship with others either known only from the Australian Tertiary record or from Quaternary-Recent New Guinea and Wet Tropics rainforests. The presence of many species is evidence of previously much larger distributions followed by subsequent massive range retractions. Detailed documentation of this rare fauna testifies to rainforest stability in central eastern Queensland until approximately 280,000 years ago, when the development of an El Nino dominated climate generated variable climatic patterns that could not support aeseasonal rainforest. Extinction of this late Pleistocene rainforest fauna serves as one of only two examples of major rainforest faunal turnover in Cainozoic Australia, the other occurring in the late Miocene. These two major extinction events are compared. The late Pleistocene faunal extinction differs from the late Miocene event in being biased towards large-bodied, terrestrial herbivores and carnivores (both reptile and mammal). This study also combines fossil and phylogenetic data with latest understanding of palaeogeography, tectonics and sea level history along Australia???s northern margin to provide hypotheses of faunal dispersal between New Guinea and mainland Australia throughout the Neogene.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Climate change</field><field name="subject">Pleistocene</field><field name="subject">Cainozoic</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44580</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"You are will to power and nothing besides": Nietzsche, Foucault, Yoga, and Feminist s/Self-Actualisation</field><field name="creator">Moritz, Heather , English, Media, &amp; Performing Arts, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis argues that Friedrich Nietzsche???s notion of world and self as ???will to power and nothing besides??? offers a highly productive interpretive lens or ???grid of intelligibility??? for understanding the ethical implications of Michel Foucault???s middle and late works on power and subjectivity.  For if the late modern era is marked by a sustained and pervasive incredulity toward metanarrative, it is also the historical site for the reappearance and widespread acceptance of a very ancient metanarrative ??? the Heraclitean view of material reality as continual flux.  Inasmuch as Nietzsche???s will to power philosophy is grounded in this Pre-Socratic worldview, his works and those of his devotee Foucault may serve as a productive foundation for a late modern ethics.      The scholarly implications of reading Foucault???s middle and late works through the interpretive lens of Nietzschean will to power in its two key manifestations, domination and dynamism, are multiple.  In addition to providing new insights into the value of Nietzschean-Foucauldian philosophy for advancing a late modern ethics, such an analysis also illuminates important continuities in Foucault???s theory of power and how his works simultaneously extend and critique Nietzschean views on the role of asceticism in culture.      The thesis then turns to a more futuristic exploration of how Foucault???s final texts, feminist critiques and extensions of these texts, and works from the separate discipline of feminist moral theory may advance a feminist form of will to power ethics.  Feminist reflection upon the dualistic philosophical basis of modern androcentric power invites further speculation upon the utility of the nondual philosophies of yoga, including those found in Ved??ntic texts like the Bhagavad G??t??, for such an endeavour.  Because yoga utilises asceticism-based practices of the self as its primary means for moulding moral subjects, it is comparable to the Greco-Roman will to power ethics described in Foucault???s final works.  On the other hand, yoga???s nondual telos may present certain ethical possibilities that dualistic constructs like the Greco-Roman model cannot.  Indeed, by practicing nonduality through yoga, contemporary women and others may be engaging in a practice of freedom in the most essential sense.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Yoga</field><field name="subject">Nietzsche</field><field name="subject">Foucault</field><field name="subject">Feminism</field><field name="subject">Will to power</field><field name="subject">Nondualism</field><field name="subject">Ethics</field><field name="subject">Bhagavad G??t??</field><field name="subject">Asceticism</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44581</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Egon Erwin Kischs Reportagebuch "Landung in Australien" Eine historisch-literarische Studie</field><field name="creator">Ihl, Daniela, Languages &amp; Linguistics, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Politics and literature are two central aspects in the work of Egon Erwin Kisch. His experiences during his brief but intense visit to Australia - from November 1934 to March 1935 ?? as an antifascist and pacifist activist/ writer in exile, led to a renewed reflection on the function of literature generally, and of the specific genre of Reportage in particular. The concept of reportage presented by Kisch in his speech at the Paris Congress ?? For the Defence of Culture?? (1935) was formulated as a direct consequence of his Australian Tour. The aim of the thesis is to analyse Kisch??s Australian Landfall in two different discourses: a historical and a literary one. The objective of the historical discourse is to examine the political relevance of the ??Kisch Case?? with regard to its impact on Australian society: the Commonwealth government??s refusal to allow Kisch to enter Australia as a speaker at the Melbourne ?? Congress against War and Fascism??, and its subsequent prosecution of Kisch as an illegal immigrant following his celebrated ??landfall?? ( a jump overboard in the port of Melbourne) became the focus of political, legal and media controversy that produced a vigorous, if short- lived culture of protest. The Kisch visit polarized Australian society and made apparent a number of internal political and socio-cultural contradictions. The focus of the literary discourse is on Kisch??s concept of Reportage which underwent significant changes due to his experiences in Australia and as a result of the difficulties in writing about events that he witnessed not only as an interested, but passionate observer and researcher, but also as a central character and actor in a very personal political drama. The analysis acknowledges the dominant writing strategies, notably the hybrid generic form of reportage, travel writing and autobiographical narrative. Kisch??s collection of reportages is remarkable also because of its innovative contribution to Australian historiography, an achievement that has been overlooked in existing Kisch scholarship. The thesis breaks new ground by reevaluating ??Landung in Australien?? as a significant contribution to the work of one of the Weimar Republic??s most important authors.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australien</field><field name="subject">Kisch</field><field name="subject">Reportage</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44582</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Fantasy of Whiteness: Blackness and Aboriginality in American and Australian Culture</field><field name="creator">Miller, Benjamin Ian, English, Media, &amp; Performing Arts, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This dissertation argues that a fantasy of white authority was articulated and disseminated through the representations of blackness and Aboriginality in nineteenth-century American and Australian theatre, and that this fantasy influenced the representation of Aboriginality in twentieth-century Australian culture. The fantasy of whiteness refers to the habitually enacted and environmentally entrenched assumption that white people can and should superintend the cultural representation of Otherness. This argument is presented in three parts. Part One examines the complex ways in which white anxieties and concerns were expressed through discourses of blackness in nineteenth-century American blackface entertainment. Part Two examines the various transnational discursive connections enabled by American and Australian blackface entertainments in Australia during the nineteenth century. Part Three examines the legacy of nineteenth-century blackface entertainment in twentieth-century Australian culture. Overall, this dissertation investigates some of the fragmentary histories and stories about Otherness that coalesce within Australian culture. This examination suggests that representations of Aboriginality in Australian culture are influenced and manipulated by whiteness in ways that seek to entrench and protect white cultural authority. Even today, a phantasmal whiteness is often present within cultural representations of Aboriginality.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Blackface</field><field name="subject">Whiteness</field><field name="subject">Aboriginality</field><field name="subject">Race</field><field name="subject">Blackness</field><field name="subject">Australian studies</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44584</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Appearance-based re-identification of people in video</field><field name="creator">Khan, Mohammad Arif, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Re-identification of people in video is of prime importance in many applications.

M., Mathematics &amp; Statistics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This research is aimed at understanding the national wind energy resource of Libya to examine the viability of obtaining wind-generated electricity in the country. High-resolution regional wind observations in Libya are not sufficient for wind resource assessments throughout the country. To overcome such a barrier, the wind conditions have been estimated utilising high-resolution 3-D nested numerical simulations by the Non-hydrostatic Mesoscale Model of the Weather Research and Forecasting system (WRF-NMM). Analysis 2007 data from the Global Forecast System (GFS) were used as initial conditions whereas the boundary conditions came from a combination of GFS analysis and forecast data, in all runs. The coarse domain had a horizontal resolution of 15 km and a temporal resolution of 30 seconds while the fine domain had a horizontal resolution of 5 km and a temporal resolution of 10 seconds. 365 successive nested simulations were performed to produce hourly wind velocity data at 10 m above the ground along with at model sigma levels for both domains for the entire year. A cubic spline interpolation was used to interpolate wind velocity data between sigma levels and 10-m winds. Thus, wind velocity data at each grid point at six fixed heights (25, 50, 75, 100, 125, and 150 m above the ground) were obtained. Hourly power density data were computed at the seven mentioned heights. Wind power outputs were also estimated based on the power curves of commercial wind turbines of different sizes and designs. Results have shown that Libya has a very good potential for wind power generation. Several areas have been identified to be promising for future wind farms. The eastern and western coastlines, the northwestern high-altitude regions, and the mountainous areas in the Sahara Desert, have great potentials of using wind-generated electricity. Summer experiences the highest wind power resource over most parts of Libya. Over most areas, vertical wind shear peaks in the atmospheric layer of 75-100m. The use of the standard value of wind shear exponent would underestimate the vertical wind speed and power changes on most parts of the nation, while it would overestimate them in a few areas.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44595</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Accounting-based composite market multiples and equity valuation</field><field name="creator">Chan, Kelly, Australian Graduate School of Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this study I investigate the potential improvement in multiple-based valuations from using composite valuations based on price to earnings and price to book ratios against their respective individual ratios and actual price in terms of their predictive accuracy against future price. It is motivated by the popularity of accounting-based market multiples used by practitioners in valuation activities with little published research documenting the absolute and relative performance of composite multiples and its vulnerability to manipulation by biased analysts. First, I generate benchmark multiples using a multiple regression approach and in turn these benchmark multiples are used in the generation of composite valuations.  Second, I incorporate firm characteristics such as anticipated growth and financial positions in the development of these composite valuations. Third, I investigate any further improvement in predictive accuracy from enterprise value to sales ratio which is less subjective to accounting policy choices and conservative accounting.  The main results support the hypothesis that composite benchmark multiples lead to improved valuations over single multiples and further improvement is achieved by incorporating the potential growth rate and financial condition in the composite benchmark multiples.  In particular, the three ratio regression-based composite multiples with the growth and the financial condition factor has the smallest mean and median absolute valuation errors.  Findings remain unchanged when the analysis is based on December fiscal year end firms and using a parsimonious model in the estimation regression.  However, the analysis of mispricing reveals that the valuation model might be useful in settings where market price is not available, such as initial public offerings and court valuation of private firms where a valuation is needed due to strong evidence that high positive pricing errors identify subsequent high returns.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Comparable firms</field><field name="subject">Equity valuation</field><field name="subject">Composite market multiples</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44596</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design methodologies for pipelined MPSoCs targeting multimedia applications</field><field name="creator">Javaid, Haris , Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The semiconductor industry has seen a paradigm shift from Application Specific Integrated Circuits to Multiprocessor System on Chip systems over the last decade, primarily due to the miniaturization of the transistor. However, billion of transistors available on a single chip need to be used efficiently to provide more functionalities in portable devices, yet minimize power and chip area, which increases the design complexity of multiprocessor systems. Tighter time to market deadlines further pressurizes the designer, requiring a comprehensive automation of the design process of such complex multiprocessor systems.  This thesis presents a design automation methodology for the design of Multiprocessor System on Chip (MPSoC) systems for multimedia applications. This thesis introduces a heterogeneous multiprocessor system where processing elements are connected in a pipelined fashion. A multimedia application is executed very efficiently on a pipelined system due to the stream oriented data flow nature of such applications. Application Specific Instruction set Processors (ASIPs) are used as the elementary processing elements in the multiprocessor system as they can be customized according to the application tasks assigned to them. The problem of selecting a processor configuration for each of the ASIPs in the pipelined system is formalized. We present three different techniques to select processor configurations by exploring the design space of an ASIP based pipelined system, and integrating them into a flexible and designer driven design flow for efficient exploration of large design spaces in order of 10^16 design points.  The first two techniques are based on Integer Linear Programming (ILP), named Exact ILP formulation (EIF) and Reduced ILP formulation (RIF), while the third technique is based on a novel heuristic. We also developed a design space pruning algorithm that can enable the use of EIF and RIF to obtain optimal or near optimal design points from large design spaces. For four multimedia applications, we show that RIF and the heuristic can explore the design space and reveal the Pareto front in several hours, while EIF took several days to obtain the Pareto front. The quick availability of the Pareto front of a design space will help the designer to make early changes in the design. Furthermore, it is shown that, on average, the error incurred by RIF and the heuristic is within 1.25% and 2.25% of the optimal design points obtained via EIF for all the four multimedia applications. In the worst case, RIF introduced an error of 17.08% while the heuristic had an error of 11.39%.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Streaming Applications</field><field name="subject">Design Automation</field><field name="subject">Pipelined MPSoCs</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44597</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Patient safety: factors that influence patient safety behaviours of health care workers in the Queensland public health system</field><field name="creator">Wakefield, John Gregory, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT  Objectives: To develop and validate in an Australian setting, an instrument to effectively measure patient safety culture; to survey health care workers (HCWs) in a large public healthcare system to establish baseline patient safety culture; and, using the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB), to use behavioural modelling to identify the factors that predict and influence Patient Safety Behavioural Intent (PSBI) Eg. Reporting clinical incidents and speaking up when a colleague makes an error. Design: Cross sectional survey analysed with multiple logistic regression (MLR).  Setting: Metropolitan, regional and rural public hospitals in Queensland, Australia.  Participants: 5294 clinical and managerial staff.  Main outcome measures: 1) Behavioural models for high-level Patient Safety Behavioural Intent (PSBI) for senior and junior doctors, senior and junior nurses, and allied health professionals.  2) Odds ratios to compare levels of PSBI between professional groups.  Results:  1) The factors that influence high-level PSBI for each professional group give rise to unique predictive models.  Two factors stand out as influencing high-level PSBI for all HCWs (R2 0.21).  These are: i) Preventive Action Beliefs (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) 2.38) (HCWs??? belief that engaging in the target behaviour(s) will lead to improved patient safety) and ii) Professional Peer Behaviour (AOR 1.79) (HCWs??? perceptions of the safety behaviour(s) of one???s professional peers). 2) There was a six-fold difference in the level of target behaviour (PSBI) across the clinical groups with few (29.6%) junior doctors having a high-level of PSBI. When compared with the junior doctors, the senior doctors were nearly 1.5 times more likely (Odds Ratio (OR) 1.46, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.01-2.13), allied health staff 2.7 times more likely (OR 2.71, 95%CI 1.91-3.73), junior nurses 3.9 times more likely (OR 3.86, 95%CI 2.83-5.26), and senior nurses 6.0 times more likely (OR 6.01, 95%CI 4.78-9.16) to have high-level PSBI. Conclusions: This is the first published study to develop behavioural models of factors that influence HCWs??? intention to engage in behaviours known to be associated with improved patient safety.  The findings of this study will greatly assist in the future design and implementation of targeted and cost-effective patient safety improvement initiatives.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Safety climate</field><field name="subject">Patient safety</field><field name="subject">Safety culture</field><field name="subject">Behaviour</field><field name="subject">Theory of planned behaviour</field><field name="subject">Survey</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44598</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Longitudinal studies of HIV outcomes in the Asia-Pacific</field><field name="creator">Falster, Kathleen Anne, National Centre in HIV Epidemiology &amp; Clinical Research, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a series of longitudinal studies of HIV-outcomes in Australia and the Asia-Pacific region since highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) became available. The primary source of data is the Australian HIV Observational Database (AHOD). AHOD is an observational cohort of more than 2000 patients with HIV recruited via hospitals, sexual health centres and general medical practices specialising in HIV medicine. Chapter five of this thesis addresses whether there were any differences in antiretroviral therapy use and virological response that might explain the different trends in new HIV diagnosis rates between state jurisdictions in Australia in recent years. Analysis of data from cohort studies of primary and chronic HIV infection, gay community surveys and national prescription data suggest that, for the most part, antiretroviral therapy use and virological response were similar in each jurisdiction during the first decade of HAART. Chapter six describes the prevalence of, and risk factors for, an incomplete immune response despite sustained viral suppression in patients on HAART in AHOD. The clinical relevance of this phenomenon is also explored in terms of AIDS and death during follow-up. Of those with sustained viral suppression, one third of patients did not achieve immune recovery greater than 350 cells/??l in the 12-24 months after starting their first or second HAART regimen, and this was associated with a lower CD4 cell count at baseline. Chapter seven describes cause-specific mortality in patients with HIV in the Asia-Pacific region. Immunodeficiency was associated with non-AIDS and AIDS mortality, and the risk of non-AIDS mortality increased with age. Less conclusive was the relationship between country-income level and risk of death from AIDS or non-AIDS causes because of the relatively high proportion of unknown causes of death in low-income settings. Chapter eight presents hospitalisation rates, risk factors and associated diagnoses in patients with HIV in Australia. Older, sicker individuals, as indicated by markers of advanced immunodeficiency or frequency of hospitalisation, were at greater risk of hospitalisation and death in the AHOD cohort. Despite effective antiretroviral therapy, patients with HIV are currently hospitalised at higher rates than people of similar age in the general population.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mortality</field><field name="subject">HIV</field><field name="subject">Cohort</field><field name="subject">Hospitalisation</field><field name="subject">Immune response</field><field name="subject">AIDS</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44599</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quad-tree motion models for scalable video coding applications</field><field name="creator">Mathew, Reji Kuruvilla , Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Modeling the motion that occurs between frames of a video sequence is a key component of video coding applications. Typically it is not possible to represent the motion between frames by a single model and therefore a quad-tree structure is employed where smaller, variable size regions or blocks are allowed to take on separate motion models. Quad-tree structures however suffer from two fundamental forms of redundancy. First, quad-trees exhibit structural redundancy due to their inability to exploit the dependence between neighboring leaf nodes with different parents. The second form of redundancy is due to the quad-tree structure itself being limited to capture only horizontal and vertical edge discontinuities at dyadically related locations; this means that general discontinuities in the motion field, such as those caused by boundaries of moving objects, become difficult and expensive to model. In our work, we address the issue of structural redundancy by introducing leaf merging. We describe how the intuitively appealing leaf merging step can be incorporated into quad-tree motion representations for a range motion modeling contexts. In particular, the impact of rate-distortion (R-D) optimized merging for two motion coding schemes, these being spatially predictive coding, as used by H.264, and hierarchical coding, are considered. Our experimental results demonstrate that the merging step can provide significant gains in R-D performance for both the hierarchical and spatial prediction schemes. Hierarchical coding has the advantage that it offers scalable access to the motion information; however due to the redundancy it introduces hierarchical coding has not been traditionally pursued. Our work shows that much of this redundancy can be mitigated with the introduction of merging. To enable scalable decoding, we employ a merging scheme which ensures that the dependencies introduced via merging can be hierarchically decoded. Theoretical investigations confirm the inherent advantages of leaf merging for quad-tree motion models. To enable quad-tree structures to better model motion discontinuity boundaries, we introduce geometry information to the quad-tree representation. We choose to model motion and geometry using separate quad-tree structures; thereby enabling each attribute to be refined separately. We extend the leaf merging paradigm to incorporate the dual tree structure allowing regions to be formed that have both motion and geometry attributes, subject to rate-distortion optimization considerations. We employ hierarchical coding for the motion and geometry information and ensure that the merging process retains the property of resolution scalability. Experimental results show that the R-D performance of the merged dual tree representation, is significantly better than conventional motion modeling schemes. Theoretical investigations show that if both motion and boundary geometry can be perfectly modeled, then the merged dual tree representation is able to achieve optimal R-D performance. We explore resolution scalability of merged quad-tree representations. We consider a modified Lagrangian cost function that takes into account the possibility of scalable decoding. Experimental results reveal that the new cost objective can considerably improve scalability performance without significant loss in overall efficiency and with competitive performance at all resolutions.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Video coding</field><field name="subject">Motion model</field><field name="subject">Motion compensation</field><field name="subject">Quad-tree</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44600</field></doc><doc><field name="title">External loads and the neural control of posture</field><field name="creator">Chew, John Zong Zheng, Prince of Wales Medical Research Institute, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the processes of human postural control. How do we keep still? In any action, the force required changes with limb position. This force-position relationship is elastic stiffness. Holding a desired posture requires muscle activation that accounts for this load property. The studies here examine the physiological processes of postural control as elastic stiffness changes. Psychophysical studies show that thresholds for detecting differences in load stiffness are large relative to those normally encountered. To discriminate stiffness, subjects made consistent movements and judged the force required and detection thresholds followed rules for force perception. For the purposes of postural control, stiffness per se is not a variable of primary interest. The effects of load stiffness on postural stability were investigated using a pendulum that allowed independent control of load force and stiffness. Postural stability varied with load stiffness and this effect was independent of load force. Performance deteriorated as load stiffness became more negative. Load-dependent changes were at low frequencies only, suggesting neural processes operating at long latency, and perhaps ???volitional??? tracking, are the key to postural control. Imposed perturbations evoke patterns of muscle activation reflecting the state of the neural pathways of postural control. Stretch responses obtained while subjects held different loads show that the short-latency spinal reflex and the long-latency functional reflex in the active flexor muscle are unaffected by load stiffness. However, a stereotyped response observed after stretch-reflex latency varied systematically with load stiffness, as did reciprocal activation of the antagonist extensor muscle. The long-latency reflex appears to be a part of a coordinated reciprocal response of antagonist muscle pairs. Adapting to load properties involves modulating these later neural responses. A method was developed, based on ultrasound, to track changes in muscle and tendon length associated with small postural movements. The relationship between wrist angle and muscle and tendon length in the active muscle changed with load stiffness. Particularly with negative-stiffness loads, the wrist moves on the end of a compliant tendon without corresponding changes in muscle length. Thus, compensation of postural performance by neural modulation is limited by the properties of muscle and tendon.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Motor control</field><field name="subject">Posture</field><field name="subject">Proprioception</field><field name="subject">Muscle</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44601</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Negotiating the pull of the normal: embodied narratives of living with hepatitis C in New Zealand and Australia</field><field name="creator">Harris, Magdalena, National Centre in HIV Social Research, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Hepatitis C is known as the ??silent epidemic??. Globally 170 million people live with chronic hepatitis C, yet it receives little policy, media or public attention. In developed countries the blood-borne virus is primarily transmitted through illicit drug injecting practices, aiding its silenced and stigmatised status. In this thesis I uncover some of these silences by exploring the narratives of forty people living with hepatitis C in New Zealand and Australia. My status as a person living with hepatitis C informed all aspects of this research project; I therefore also include my own experiences, foregrounding researcher reflexivity and the co-constructed nature of the interview process. My aims are both practical and theoretical. On a practical level I explore the experiences of people living with hepatitis C in order to inform recommendations for policy, research and practice, while also working to elucidate and employ an approach that allows for an analysis of the ill body as a lived experiencing agent, located in a substantive web of connections whereby discourse, corporeality and sociality, inform and mediate one another. To this end I employ a ??political phenomenology?? influenced by phenomenological and poststructuralist theoretical approaches. The central, previously under-researched, issues that arose in participants?? narratives structure the chapter outline, with results chapters focusing on participants?? experiences of diagnosis, living with hepatitis C, stigma, support group membership, alcohol use, and hepatitis C treatment. For many participants, it was found that living with hepatitis C was a liminal experience where distinctions between what it was to be healthy or ill were not clear-cut. Indeed, many of the participants?? narratives exposed the inadequacy of Western binary categorisations to   speak to their experiences of living with hepatitis C. Throughout this thesis it can be seen that the meanings that participants ascribed to health, illness, and their hepatitis C were fluid and contextual, informed by the interplay of corporeality and discourse. From this interplay comes the ability to speak into the gaps of dominant discourses, creating the potential for the disruption, or subtle realignment, of normative ways of knowing.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Governmentality</field><field name="subject">Hepatitis C</field><field name="subject">Phenomenology</field><field name="subject">Researcher reflexivity</field><field name="subject">Qualitative research</field><field name="subject">Narrative</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44602</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Infection and inflammation in children with cystic fibrosis lung disease</field><field name="creator">Dakin, Carolyn , Women's &amp; Children's Health, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships between inflammation, infection and lung function in cystic fibrosis during the evolution of lung disease in childhood and early adolescence. The developmental stages of childhood and the progression of lung disease together affected the methods and techniques used in the study, with the consequence that the work for this thesis fell naturally into two parts. The first part concerned the study of early lung disease in infants and young children who were unable to expectorate or to cooperate with lung function testing. In the second part, the inflammatory processes in both stable lung disease and during clinical exacerbations in older children and adolescents were studied non-invasively using sputum. The absence of a recognised definition of pulmonary exacerbation lead to further investigation into clinical heterogeneity in the diagnosis and management of an exacerbation.  In early lung disease, inflammation was not found to be independent of infection, with pathogens in the lower airways found to correlate with levels of inflammation, respiratory system compliance and degree of air trapping (a relationship not previously shown). This suggested that infection remains the key target to minimizing lung damage in cystic fibrosis. The relationship between sputum markers of inflammation and lung pathology in established disease was found to be less clear, with high inflammation levels in both stability and during exacerbation. Reduction in sputum inflammatory levels following treatment of an exacerbation was found to be greater in those with lower pre-treatment levels. The definition and management of an exacerbation was found to be an area lacking consensus among clinicians, with likely consequent heterogeneity of clinical care and therefore inhomogeneity of hospitalization as a surrogate measure of exacerbation in a research setting.  The work from this thesis, and the ensuing publications, has contributed to the understanding of the interactions between the inflammatory and infectious processes involved in CF lungdisease, in both early and more established lung disease in childhood.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Infection</field><field name="subject">Cystic fibrosis</field><field name="subject">Lung disease</field><field name="subject">Inflammation</field><field name="subject">Child</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44624</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contrast</field><field name="creator">Pursell, Finn, English, Media, &amp; Performing Arts, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis engages the contrast phenomenon in its various manifestations across the different sense modalities in order to assess the plausibility of contrast as a general perceptual principle. There is some question as to whether contrast may spill over into modalities it is not commonly associated with. In particular, a number of researchers have argued that contrast occurs in audition and has similarities to the brightness contrast illusion in visual perception. For example, studies of noise pitch have noted similar psychophysical properties to brightness contrast and invoked the same underlying neural mechanism. Furthermore, there is some suggestion that contrast may come in a non-simultaneous form characterised by perceptual exaggerations arising from the contrasting spectral content of successive auditory stimuli. The speech perception literature on context effects are engaged as it is in this domain that there is some evidence for non-simultaneous contrast. A study was conducted in which 34 subjects were presented synthesized tokens of "da" and "ga" diotically and dichotically following the precursors "al" and "ar". Significantly more "da" identifications were observed (F=62.85, p=.000) following "ar" precursors when stimuli were presented diotically, whereas no significant effects were observed in identifications of the target for different precursors (F=.553, p=.457) when targets were presented to the ear contralateral to that of the precursor. Results fail to support an explanation of the context effect in the form of a causal mechanism with a central locus. Rather, the locus of the context effect can only be hypothesized to occur at the periphery of the nervous system. This suggests that auditory contrast may be a plausible explanation for the context effect, and which if correct, may be a universal phenomenon common to all people regardless of environment and acquired knowledge. Given these results, contrast is explored more broadly. As generic use of the term is often encountered in musical contexts, aspects of music perception relating to contrast are examined. Some theoretical ideas are put forward in this capacity, focusing on an interactive neural network approach to understanding hypothetical structural contrasts, including tonal contrasts. The thesis closes with a consideration of contrast-like effects that may be of some relevance towards understanding contrast more generally.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44625</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vocal tract interactions in woodwind performance</field><field name="creator">Chen, Jer-Ming , Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">How important is the player???s vocal tract in clarinet and saxophone performance? Acoustician???s opinions have ranged from ???negligible??? [Backus (1985), JASA 78, 17] to ???vocal tract resonance frequencies must match the frequency of the required notes??? [Clinch et al. (1982), Acustica 50, 280]. Musicians??? opinions are similarly varied. To understand how the tract-reed-bore system interacts, acoustical measurements of performers??? vocal tracts during playing were made using measurement heads mounted in the mouthpieces of a clarinet and a tenor saxophone. Acoustic impedance spectra of the tenor and soprano saxophone bores were also measured for all standard fingerings, and some others. For fingerings high in the tenor saxophone???s second register, bore impedance peaks downstream decrease with increasing pitch. Above the first 2.7 octaves, peak values fall below 30 MPa.s.m-3 and this ends the standard range available to amateurs. To play the higher altissimo notes, experts produced strong vocal tract resonances upstream with impedances 10-40 MPa.s.m-3 tuned to sound the desired note. While expert saxophonists adjust their vocal tract thus for altissimo playing, inexperienced players do not, and consequently cannot produce these notes.  The smoothly rising clarinet glissando solo opening Gershwin???s Rhapsody in Blue was also investigated. Partially uncovering an open finger-hole smoothly raises clarinet resonances in the lower register, allowing continuous increases in playing pitch. When pitch bending in the second (clarino) register, experienced players produced strong tract resonances with impedances up to 60 MPa.s.m-3, comparable in magnitude with those of the clarinet bore (40-50 MPa.s.m-3). Thus during the glissando, sounding pitch is controlled by smoothly varying a strong resonance in the player???s vocal tract. The phase of the reed impedance is shown to make downwards pitch bending easier than upwards. Similar vocal tract adjustments were observed on the clarinet and saxophone for other advanced techniques such as bugling and multiphonic selection. During normal playing, although experienced players produced vocal tract impedance peaks with only moderate magnitude, these peaks were adjusted systematically to frequencies about 150 Hz higher than the sounding pitch (determined by strong bore resonances). This strategy may avoid the effects of small unwanted tract-bore interactions on sounding pitch.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Vocal Tract</field><field name="subject">Woodwind Performance</field><field name="subject">Acoustic Impedance</field><field name="subject">Clarinet</field><field name="subject">Saxophone</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44626</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cellular mechanisms affecting redox homeostasis in  response to stress in Saccharomyces cerevisiae</field><field name="creator">Tan, Shixiong , Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Maintainence of appropriate redox homeostasis is crucial for processes such as protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and to minimise genesis of oxidative stress. Previous studies have indicated a possible link between ER stress and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) although the cellular mechanisms involved were not fully elucidated. To investigate the cellular mechanisms involved in tolerance to oxidative stress and ER stress, genome-wide screens were performed to identify mutants sensitive to chronic ER stress induced by dithiothreitol and tunicamycin.  These screens identified the Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) and genes involved in NADPH generation (RPE1, TKL1) as important for chronic ER stress tolerance. Superoxide anion has been identified as one of the ROS generated during ER stress. The ER oxidoreductase Ero1p, previously implicated in ROS production in vitro, did not appear to be a source of superoxide when the protein was over-expressed. It was also found that cellular NADP(H) levels affected induction of the unfolded protein response (UPR), since cells lacking TKL1 or RPE1 exhibited decreased UPR induction. These data indicate an important role for superoxide dismutase and cellular NADP(H) in survival of cells during ER stress.  Subsequent analysis determined that NADPH generation was also required for adaptation to H2O2. Mutants affected in NADPH production were chronically sensitive to H2O2 but resistant to an acute dose. These mutants over-accumulated reduced glutathione (GSH) but maintained normal cellular redox homeostasis. This over- production of GSH was not regulated at the transcriptional level of GSH1 encoding ??- glutamyl cysteine synthetase. These data raise the important question as to how cells maintain cellular glutathione redox balance. To better understand how cells respond to perturbations in glutathione redox homeostasis, cells deleted for GLR1, encoding GSSG reductase, were exposed to extracellular oxidised glutathione (GSSG) and intracellular GSH and GSSG were monitored over time. Intriguingly cells lacking GLR1 showed increased levels of GSH accumulation upon GSSG treatment in a manner independent of GSH synthesis. It was  subsequently found that the cytosolic thioredoxin-thioredoxin reductase system contributes to the reduction of GSSG in vivo.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Reactive oxygen species</field><field name="subject">Redox</field><field name="subject">Gluatathione</field><field name="subject">Endoplasmic reticulum</field><field name="subject">Unfolded protein response</field><field name="subject">Oxidative stress</field><field name="subject">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</field><field name="subject">NADPH</field><field name="subject">Thioredoxin</field><field name="subject">Superoxide dismutase</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44627</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Insulin action: unravelling AKT signalling in Adipocytes</field><field name="creator">Ng, Foong Loo Yvonne, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The Ser/Thr kinase Akt plays an important role in many of insulin's actions including GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane (PM). However, there are several features of Akt's regulation of GLUT4 translocation that remain unclear. The goal of my thesis was to resolve some of the following questions: Is activation of Akt sufficient to stimulate GLUT4 translocation? What is the quantitative relationship in signal transmission between individual components within the Akt cascade? What is the role of Akt in insulin resistance? To determine if activation of Akt is sufficient to mediate GLUT4 translocation, I developed a drug-inducible heterodimerisation strategy to activate Akt2 independently of other potential insulin signalling pathways. These studies revealed that activation of Akt2 resulted in rapid stimulation of GLUT4 translocation to a similar extent with maximum insulin, indicating that Akt2 is sufficient for this event.  It was previously observed that maximum effect of insulin on GLUT4 translocation was obtained with minimum activation of Akt. To resolve this discrepancy, the relationship between Akt signalling components was examined using a quantitative kinetic and dose response approach combined with hierarchical cluster analysis. Most notably I observed a strong relationship between Akt at the PM, but not Akt in the whole cell lysate, with its substrate phosphorylation. Active pools of phospho-Akt and -AS160, a major substrate involved in GLUT4 translocation, were found in the lipid raft, highlighting the importance of subcellular partitioning of key signalling components for achieving biological specificity.  The involvement of Akt in insulin resistance was investigated using the heterodimerisation strategy. These studies revealed that insulin itself initiates a pathway that causes insulin resistance by converging on target(s) downstream of Akt. This inhibitory pathway emanates from PI3-kinase and is likely induced by a range of insults including chronic insulin and dexamethasone.  In conclusion, Akt is a crucial element in the insulin action pathway that exhibits precise spatial regulation. While the role of this nanoregulation of Akt in disease remains to be evaluated, my studies suggest that the major defect contributing to insulin resistance occurs downstream of Akt. The elucidation of this target will have major implications for metabolic diseases.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">AKT</field><field name="subject">Insulin</field><field name="subject">Diabetes</field><field name="subject">Insulin resistance</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44628</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structural design of shape-adaptive composite marine propellers</field><field name="creator">Mulcahy, Norman Lex, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Nickel-Aluminium-Bronze alloy is the most common material for ship propellers but, more recently, composite materials have been used in propeller construction. One of the advantages of the use composite materials for ship propellers is that they allow the possibility of shape-adaptability. A shape-adaptive propeller is one that is designed so that the blades deform with load changes in such a way that the propeller performance is enhanced in comparison to that of a conventional ??rigid?? propeller, e.g. the goal of shape-adaptability may be higher efficiency over a greater range of operating conditions, or reduced cavitation and noise. This shape-adaptability can be achieved through the choice of the appropriate blade geometry, and the optimum arrangement of composite materials. A design method for composite shape-adaptive propellers is developed and tested in this work. The method has a baseline rigid propeller as the starting point. A novel method is used to identify a design condition at which the rigid and flexible propellers have identical shapes, and therefore performance. Optimisation procedures, to find the unloaded shape and composite material properties, are a necessary part of the shape-adaptive propeller design method. A shape-adaptive flexible propeller has generally improved performance compared to that of the baseline rigid propeller. As well, a coupled hydrodynamic/structural analysis is required so that the performance of flexible and rigid propellers can be compared. The results of a study of the twist characteristics of straight and curved cantilever beams with various amounts of skew are reported. The cantilever beams are structural analogues of hydrofoils and propeller blades, and the aim of the study is to identify the desired material and geometrical characteristics for shape-adaptive propellers and hydrofoils. Two case studies, that demonstrate the developed design procedures, are described: Design of a flexible hydrofoil, and Design of a flexible propeller. In both cases, the desired shape-adaptive behaviour is achieved but the performance gains are small. It is felt that the example structures do not have sufficient flexibility to take full advantage of shape-adaptability. Possible means of achieving greater flexibility are optimisation of the baseline shape (planform and thickness distribution) for flexibility, and selection of composite materials that maximise flexibility, within the strength requirements. An expression is developed for estimating the efficiency gain of a shape-adaptive propeller operating at the design condition in a ship??s wake. Calculations show that, even for what is considered to be a relatively flexible propeller, the expected efficiency gains are small (&lt; 1%). However, small gains in efficiency across the range, can be significant for the operation of a ship. Furthermore, efficiency gains are higher at off-design conditions as a shape-adaptive design broadens the efficiency curve.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44629</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A versatile and modular approach to modify silicon surfaces  for electrochemical applications</field><field name="creator">Ciampi, Simone , Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The thesis presents the research results obtained while studying novel chemical strategies for preparing Si(100)-based electrochemical platforms suitable for aqueous environments. A primary research aim was the preparation of well-passivated Si(100) surfaces amenable to further chemical derivatization. The preparation and functionalization of alkyne-terminated alkyl monolayers on Si(100) surfaces using the Huisgen 1,3-dipolar ???click??? cycloaddition of azides with surface-bound acetylenes is reported and shown to be a versatile, experimentally simple, chemically unambiguous modular approach to modified silicon surfaces. Covalently immobilized, structurally well-defined acetylenyl organic monolayers are prepared from a commercially available ??,??-diyne (1,8-nonadiyne) species using a one-step thermal hydrosilylation procedure. Subsequent derivatization of the alkyne-terminated monolayers in aqueous environments with representative azide species affords disubstituted surface-bound [1,2,3]-triazole species. Neither activation procedures nor protection/deprotection schemes are required, as is the case with more established grafting approaches for silicon surfaces. The described surface modification scheme has been used in preparing modified Si(100) electrode surfaces, where modular components such as ferrocene derivatives or electrochemically ???switchable??? linker molecules are introduced onto the passivated silicon surface. An implementation study to prepare modified light-addressable ???switchable??? Si(100) electrodes is also reported. Negligible oxidation of the substrate was generally observed after exposure to aqueous systems for extended periods (tens of hours), and the electroactive monolayers showed a robust and reversible behaviour. The proposed concept of modular components and high-yielding coupling procedures has been shown on Si(100) surfaces and also extended to illustrate the functionalization of porous silicon rugate filters.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Acetylene-terminated monolayers</field><field name="subject">Si(100) monolayers</field><field name="subject">Hydrosilylation</field><field name="subject">Silicon electrodes</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44630</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Location privacy in automotive telematics</field><field name="creator">Iqbal, Muhammad Usman, Surveying &amp; Spatial Information Systems, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The convergence of transport, communication, computing and positioning technologies has enabled a smart car revolution. As a result, pricing of roads based on telematics technologies has gained significant attention. While there are promised benefits, systematic disclosure of precise location has the ability to impinge on privacy of a special kind, known as location privacy.  The aim of this thesis is to provide technical designs that enhance the location privacy of motorists without compromising the benefits of accurate pricing. However, this research looks beyond a solely technology-based solution. For example, the ethical implications of the use of GPS data in pricing models have not been fully understood. Likewise, minimal research exists to evaluate the technical vulnerabilities that could be exploited to avoid criminal or financial penalties. To design a privacy-aware system, it is important to understand the needs of the stakeholders, most importantly the motorists. Knowledge about the anticipated privacy preferences of motorists is important in order to make reasonable predictions about their future willingness to adopt these systems. There is limited research so far on user perceptions regarding specific payment options in the uptake of privacy-aware systems.  This thesis provides a critical privacy assessment of two mobility pricing systems, namely electronic tolls and mobility-priced insurance. As a result of this assessment, policy recommendations are developed which could support a common approach in facilitating privacy-aware mobility-pricing strategies. This thesis also evaluates the existing and potential inferential threats and vulnerabilities to develop security and privacy recommendations for privacy-aware pricing designs for tolls and insurance. Utilising these policy recommendations and analysing user-perception with regards to the feasibility of sustaining privacy , and willingness to pay for privacy, two privacy-aware mobility pricing designs have been presented which bridge the entire array of privacy interests and bring them together into a unified approach capable of sustaining legal protection as well as satisfying privacy requirements of motorists. It is maintained that it is only by social and technical analysis working in tandem that critical privacy issues in relation to location can be addressed.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">GPS</field><field name="subject">Spatial privacy</field><field name="subject">Location privacy</field><field name="subject">Ethics</field><field name="subject">Telematics</field><field name="subject">Pay as you drive insurance</field><field name="subject">Privacy</field><field name="subject">Electronic Toll Collection</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44616</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effectiveness of a GP exercise referral scheme as an intervention to promote physical activity in general practice</field><field name="creator">Dutton, Shona Nicole, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Background: Many Australians do not meet recommended levels of physical activity and GPs can play an important role in addressing this. Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of an exercise referral scheme, in patients referred by their general practitioner (GP).  Design: A pre post evaluation with measurement of outcomes immediately post intervention (five weeks) and again at six months.  Intervention: The 42 patients that agreed to participate in the study took part in an initial fitness and lifestyle assessment with an exercise physiologist. They then undertook ten exercise sessions over a period of five weeks, following an individually prescribed exercise program. At the completion of the ten exercise sessions, participants were reassessed (fitness and lifestyle) by the exercise physiologist. This was repeated again six months after they completed the intervention.  Main outcomes measured: The primary outcomes measured were changes in self reported physical activity and associated markers including cardiovascular fitness. Secondary outcomes measured include changes in physiological and anthropometric measures, behavioural risk factors (dietary behaviour, alcohol consumption and smoking) and quality of life. Patient well-being (using SF12), patient satisfaction and GP satisfaction with the program was also assessed.  Results: There was a large withdrawal of participants. Results have been presented in terms of outcome frequency at each assessment point. There was an 18% increase (from baseline) in the proportion of participants achieving the Australian physical activity guidelines and a 31% increase between baseline and the six month follow-up assessment in those that completed the program. There were statistically significant improvements in cardiovascular fitness measures and small improvements in some physiological, anthropometric, dietary behaviours and general well being measures. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that referral to a community based leisure centre for supervised exercise, supported by a written exercise prescription by an exercise physiologist, may be effective in increasing physical activity levels short and long term in those that complete the program. Exercise referrals can form part of national strategies to increase physical activity, particularly for primary care.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Physical activity</field><field name="subject">Exercise referral</field><field name="subject">General Practice</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44617</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Kinematic wave modelling of surface runoff quantity and quality for small urban catchments in Sydney</field><field name="creator">Cheah, Chin Hong, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Extensive research has been undertaken to improve the robustness of runoff quantity predictions for urban catchments. However, equally robust predictions for runoff quality have yet to be attained. Past studies addressing this issue have typically been confined to the use of simple conceptual or empirical models which forgo the tedious steps of providing a physical representation of the actual system to be modelled. Consequently, even if the modelling results for the test catchments are satisfactory, the reliability and applicability of these models for other catchments remain uncertain. It is deemed that by employing process-based, deterministic models, many of these uncertainties can be eliminated. A lack of understanding of the hydrological processes occurring during storm events and the absence of good calibration data, however, hamper the advancement of such models and limit their use in the field.  This research proposes that the development of a hydrologic model based on the kinematic wave equations linked to an advection-dispersion model that simulates pollutant detachment and transport will improve both runoff quantity and quality simulations and enhance the robustness of the predictions. At the very worst, a model of this type could still highlight the underlying issues that inhibit models from reproducing the recorded historical hydrographs and pollutographs. In actual fact, this approach has already been applied by various modellers to simulate the entrainment of pollutants from urban catchments. Also, the paradigm shift to using the Water Sensitive Urban Design (WSUD) approach in designing urban stormwater systems has prompted the need to differentiate the various sources of pollutants in urban catchments such as roads, roofs and other impervious surfaces.  The primary objective of the study reported herein is to model runoff quantity and quality from small urban catchments, facilitated by the procurement of the necessary field data to calibrate and validate the model via implementation of a comprehensive field exercise based in Sydney. From a water quality perspective, trace metals were selected as the foci. The study outcomes include the formulation of a linkage of models capable of providing accurate and reliable runoff quantity and quality predictions for the study catchments by taking into consideration: - The different availability of pollutants from urban catchments, i.e. roads vs. roofs; - The build-up characteristics of pollutants on the distinct urban surfaces and their spatial distribution; - The contribution of rainwater to urban runoff pollution; - The partitioning of pollutants according to particulate bound and dissolved phases; - The respective role of rainfall and runoff in the detachment and entrainment of pollutants; - The influence of particle properties such as particle size distribution and density on pollutant transport; and - The relationship associating particulate bound metals to suspended solids.   The simulation results obtained using the proposed model were found to be suitable for modelling the detachment and transport of pollutants for small urban catchments. Interpretation of these results reveals several key findings which could help to rectify shortcomings of existing modelling approaches. Even though the robustness of the model presented here may not translate into a significant improvement in the overall robustness of model predictions, the physical basis on which this process-based model was developed nevertheless provides the flexibility necessary for implementation at alternative sites. It is also shown that the availability of reliable runoff data is essential for implementation of the model for other similar urban catchments. In conclusion, the proposed model in this study will serve as a worthy tool in future urban catchment management studies.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Kinematic wave model</field><field name="subject">Build-up and washoff</field><field name="subject">Field data collection</field><field name="subject">Process-based</field><field name="subject">Urban impervious catchments</field><field name="subject">WSUD</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44618</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of thermal residual stresses on static strength and fatigue life of welded carbon-fibre/epoxy composite joints</field><field name="creator">Djukic, Luke Philip, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Thermoset Composite Welding (TCW) is a process designed specifically for joining composite materials, developed by the Cooperative Research Centre for Advanced Composite Structures (CRC-ACS). The TCW manufacture process is carried out at higher temperatures than those used in service, causing thermal residual (TR) stresses to develop in the joints. An investigation of the strength of single-lap shear joints (SLJs), and the development of laminate free edge microcracks (LFEMs) is presented in this thesis. The reported investigations are primarily experimental. Finite element analysis has been used to understand observations where appropriate. The effect of TR stresses on static failure of TCW SLJs and Cytec FM1515 thin film epoxy adhesive SLJs over the temperature range of -55??C to 71??C is investigated. At temperatures where the joining material is ductile, plastic flow results in the redistribution of TR stresses within the joints, reducing their effect on the failure strength. No such stress redistributions occur at lower temperatures when the joining material is brittle; hence, the TR stresses cause strength reductions. These results were used to propose a method of shear strength improvement by initiating plastic flow in the joint at the time of manufacture.  Microcracks are common at the free edges of thermoset composites. These develop preferentially near the weld material interface in TCW laminates, and are termed laminate free edge microcracks (LFEMs) in this study. MicroCT scanning was used to find and characterise LFEMs in TCW joints. The results indicated that TR stresses combined with the free edge sectioning process cause their development outside the joint overlap regions. Microcracks developed within the joint overlaps during mechanical fatigue cycling. LFEMs were also found in FM1515 joints. A fatigue life study is presented for TCW and FM1515 SLJs at -55??C, in which the effect of LFEMs is considered. TCW is a new process. This investigation is the first dealing with the effect of thermal residual stresses on the strength of TCW joints, and the development and effect of LFEMs. The shear strength improvement method is also a novel concept for joints.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Finite Element Analysis</field><field name="subject">Carbon-Fibre/Epoxy Composite</field><field name="subject">Welding</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44619</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Automatic emotion recognition: an investigation of acoustic and prosodic parameters</field><field name="creator">Sethu, Vidhyasaharan , Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">An essential step to achieving human-machine speech communication with the naturalness of communication between humans is developing a machine that is capable of recognising emotions based on speech. This thesis presents research addressing this problem, by making use of acoustic and prosodic information.  At a feature level, novel group delay and weighted frequency features are proposed. The group delay features are shown to emphasise information pertaining to formant bandwidths and are shown to be indicative of emotions. The weighted frequency feature, based on the recently introduced empirical mode decomposition, is proposed as a compact representation of the spectral energy distribution and is shown to outperform other estimates of energy distribution. Feature level comparisons suggest that detailed spectral measures are very indicative of emotions while exhibiting greater speaker specificity. Moreover, it is shown that all features are characteristic of the speaker and require some of sort of normalisation prior to use in a multi-speaker situation.  A novel technique for normalising speaker-specific variability in features is proposed, which leads to significant improvements in the performances of systems trained and tested on data from different speakers. This technique is also used to investigate the amount of speaker-specific variability in different features. A preliminary study of phonetic variability suggests that phoneme specific traits are not modelled by the emotion models and that speaker variability is a more significant problem in the investigated setup.  Finally, a novel approach to emotion modelling that takes into account temporal variations of speech parameters is analysed. An explicit model of the glottal spectrum is incorporated into the framework of the traditional source-filter model, and the parameters of this combined model are used to characterise speech signals. An automatic emotion recognition system that takes into account the shape of the contours of these parameters as they vary with time is shown to outperform a system that models only the parameter distributions. The novel approach is also empirically shown to be on par with human emotion classification performance.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">EMD based weighted frequency</field><field name="subject">Automatic emotion recognition</field><field name="subject">Group delay features</field><field name="subject">Speaker normalisation</field><field name="subject">Contour parameterisation</field><field name="subject">Dynamic modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44620</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mass spectrometric investigations into free radical polymerisation reaction mechanisms</field><field name="creator">Hart-Smith, Gene On, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Contemporary mass spectrometry (MS) instrumentation featuring electrospray ionisation (ESI) or matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation (MALDI) ion sources were used to characterise the polymer distributions generated in various free radical polymerisations, allowing insights to be gained into the reaction mechanisms operating in these systems. In studying atom transfer radical polymerisation (ATRP) mediated star polymerisations of methyl acrylate (MA), ESI was found to be more effective in obtaining a comprehensive list of the distinct products present in the samples under investigation when compared to the employed MALDI technique. Furthermore, these studies showed that terminal Br losses observed at relatively high monomer to polymer conversions could be accounted for via mechanisms involving the acetone derived radicals (CH3)2??OH, ??H3 and ??H2COCH3. Through the use of ESI, it was found that for bulk polymerisations of MA and aqueous media polymerisations of N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAAm) initiated using 60Co ??-irradiation and mediated via reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT), hydrogen radicals formed via the radiolysis of RAFT agent and/or monomer, and in the case of the NIPAAm system, water, are capable of initiating the polymerisations. In the NIPAAm polymerisations under scrutiny, it was also observed that hydroxyl radicals generated via the radiolysis of water may contribute towards the initiation process, and that propagating chains can potentially become terminated via trithiocarbonate cleavage reactions. By using ESI instruments to characterise oligomer samples produced via the free radical polymerisations of vinyl phosphonates, it was observed that chain propagations are initiated via activated monomer radicals, which likely form as a result of transfer reactions involving initiator fragments and vinyl phosphonate monomer units. Transfer to monomer reactions were suggested to limit chain growth in these systems, and evidence was also found for scission reactions involving alkoxy moieties which are formed via intramolecular methine carbon abstraction reactions. Characterisation of the polymer distributions generated in R-group approach RAFT MA star polymerisations using an ESI instrument allowed formation processes operating in acrylate star living/controlled radical polymerisations (CRPs) to be ascertained. Initiator fragment derived linear chains, ideal stars, star-star couples, and terminated star products formed as a result of disproportionation and combination reactions were detected. Evidence for mid-chain radical (MCR) derived reaction pathways was also observed; specifically, for termination reactions involving intermolecularly formed MCRs on both star arms and linear chains, and for re-propagation of intermolecularly formed MCRs on star arms.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electrospray ionisation (ESI)</field><field name="subject">Mass spectrometry</field><field name="subject">Polymers</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44621</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influences of HR effectiveness and supervisor support on workers</field><field name="creator">Yu, Chongxin , Organisation &amp; Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Migrant workers in China tend to suffer from inferior status and hardship in the workplace. Domestic private enterprises have become highly market-oriented and have been criticized for exploiting workers; however, some of them have started to pay increasing attention to motivating and retaining workers. The well-being of migrant workers is worthy of study. This study collected survey data from migrant workers in two Chinese private enterprises in the cosmetics industry, aiming to probe how a harmonious and supportive working environment may benefit workers. It is argued that HR???s assistance to line managers can be conveyed to workers via supervisors, leading to perceptions of a supportive working system (represented by the behaviour of HR, managers and supervisors). This kind of system is likely to promote employees??? identification with the organisation and social exchanges with organisational members. Further, these may improve workers??? psychological state and cooperative worker relations. This thesis starts by presenting migrant workers??? experience and discussing how HRM is practised in Chinese private enterprises. Studies of organisational support are introduced as a foundation to explore the influences of HR on employee outcomes???emotional exhaustion and co-worker assistance???through the mechanism of supervisor support. The results validate the substantial role of effective HR assistance to line managers and the role of the supportive supervisor in improving employees??? well-being and in facilitating helping behaviour among co-workers.

A study of existing literature indicated that compressible ground effect has been addressed sporadically in various contexts, without being researched in any comprehensive detail. One of the reasons for this is the difficulty involved in performing experiments which accurately simulate the flows in question with regards to ground boundary conditions. To maximise the relevance of the research to appropriate real-world scenarios, multiple bodies were examined within the confines of their own specific flow regimes. These were: an inverted T026 wing in the low-to-medium subsonic regime, a lifting RAE 2822 aerofoil and ONERA M6 wing in the transonic regime, and a NATO military projectile at supersonic Mach numbers.	Two primary aims were pursued. Firstly, experimental issues surrounding compressible ground effect flows were addressed. Potential problems were found in the practice of matching incompressible Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations to wind tunnel experiments for the inverted wing at low freestream Mach numbers (&lt;0.3), where the inverted wing was found to experience significant compressible effects even at Mach 0.15. The approach of matching full-scale CFD simulations to scale model testing at an identical Reynolds number but higher Mach number was analysed and found to be prone to significant error. An exploration was also conducted of appropriate ways to conduct experimental tests at transonic and supersonic Mach numbers, resulting in the recommendation of a symmetry (image) method as an effective means of approximating a moving ground boundary in a small-scale blowdown wind tunnel. Issues of scale with regards to Reynolds number persisted in the transonic regime, but with careful use of CFD as a complement to experiments, discrepancies were quantified with confidence.	The second primary aim was to use CFD to gain a broader understanding of the ways in which density changes in the flowfield affect the aerodynamic performance of the bodies in question, in particular when a shock wave reflects from the ground plane to interact again with the body or its wake. The numerical approach was extensively verified and validated against existing and new experimental data. 	The lifting aerofoil and wing were investigated over a range of mid-to-high subsonic Mach numbers (1&gt;M???&gt;0.5), ground clearances and angles of incidence. The presence of the ground was found to affect the critical Mach number, and the aerodynamic characteristics of the bodies across all Mach numbers and clearances proved to be highly sensitive to ground proximity, with a step change in any variable often causing a considerable change to the lift, moment and drag coefficients. At the lowest ground clearances in both two and three dimensional studies, the aerodynamic efficiency was generally found to be less than that of unbounded (no ground) flight for shock-dominated flowfields at freestream Mach numbers greater than 0.7.	In the fully-supersonic regime, where shocks tend to be steady and oblique, a supersonic spinning NATO projectile travelling at Mach 2.4 was simulated at several ground clearances. The shocks produced by the body reflected from the ground plane and interacted with the far wake, the near wake, and/or the body itself depending on the ground clearance. The influence of these wave reflections on the three-dimensional flowfield, and their resultant effects on the aerodynamic coefficients, was determined. The normal and drag forces acting on the projectile increased in exponential fashion once the reflections impinged on the projectile body again one or more times (at a height/diameter ground clearance  h/d&lt;1).  The pitching moment of the projectile changed sign as ground clearance was reduced, adding to the complexity of the trajectory which would ensue.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ground Effect</field><field name="subject">Aerodynamics</field><field name="subject">CFD</field><field name="subject">Supersonic</field><field name="subject">Transonic</field><field name="subject">Wind Tunnel</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44696</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanisms and treatment strategies to overcome resistance to non-cytotoxic therapy in cancer</field><field name="creator">Kuljaca, Selena, Women's &amp; Children's Health, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">As anti-cancer agents, retinoid induce cell growth arrest and differentiation, while HDACIs cause cell differentiation, growth inhibition, death and inhibit angiogenesis in many cancer types. However, a proportion of patients respond poorly to these therapies.  My studies, presented here, aimed to improve the anti-cancer effects of these agents by identifying key factors which mediate cancer cell sensitivity or resistance to their action. In this study I have found that the clinically used retinoid, 13-cis RA, exerts its anti-cancer signal in a manner similar to atRA, by modulating the transcriptional response of retinoid-regulated genes.  HDACI-induced cytotoxicity is significantly enhanced when combined with IFN&#945; in 8 out of 9 cancer cell lines from various organ origins. Sensitivity to the combination treatment correlated with an absence of basal p21 protein expression, and cell cycle arrest. Knocking-down p21 gene expression further sensitized cancer cells to the combination therapy. Moreover, IFN&#945; and HDACI co-operatively inhibited pro-angiogenic gene expression in cancer cells, and the combination therapy decreased endothelial cell migration, invasion, and capillary tubule formation.  Further experiments on p21 as a resistance factor to anti-cancer treatment demonstrated that conditioned media from breast cancer MCF-7 cells transfected with p21 siRNA, induced significantly less endothelial cell migration, invasion and vascular sprouting, compared with media from cells transfected with scrambled siRNA. LC/MS analysis of the conditioned media revealed that Trx secretion was significantly reduced after p21 knockdown. The reduction in Trx secretion following p21 knockdown was due to a direct effect of p21 siRNA on the expression of intracellular TBP2 in neuroblastoma, prostate and lung cancer cells. Consistent with this result, media from MCF7 cells transfected with TBP2-specific siRNA alone, promoted endothelial cell invasion and vascular sprouting, Trx knockdown resulted in opposite effects, and the anti-angiogenic effect of p21 siRNA was offset by simultaneous TBP2 siRNA transfection. ChIP assay revealed that p21 directly bound to an E2F1-bindng site in the TBP2 gene promoter. These data indicate that p21 promoted tumour-driven angiogenesis through transcriptional repression of TBP2. Collectively, my experiments indicate several potential treatment targets directed toward enhancing the effectiveness of HDACIs and retinoids.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Resistance</field><field name="subject">Cancer</field><field name="subject">Non-cytotoxic treatment</field><field name="subject">Angiogenesis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44699</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Plant planet; recording / recoding invisible energy via the lens of the land</field><field name="creator">Heymans, Suzanne Elizabeth, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">This research investigates the ???earth / human equation???, in which the land is identified as the indispensable nutrient for human existence.

As a result, module reuse has become common practice in chip design. To save time on both design and verification, Systems-on-Chips (SoCs) are composed using pre-designed and pre-verified modules. The integrated modules are often designed by different groups and for different purposes, and are later integrated into a single chip. In the absence of a single interface standard for such modules, "plug-n-play" style integration is not likely, as the subject modules are often designed to comply with different interface protocols. For such modules to communicate correctly there is a need for some glue logic, also called a protocol converter that mediates between them.  Though much research has been dedicated to the protocol converter synthesis problem of SoC communication, converter synthesis is still performed manually, consuming development and verification time and risking human error. Current approaches to automatic synthesis of protocol converters mostly lack formal foundations and either employ abstractions far removed from the Hardware Description Language (HDL) implementation level or grossly simplify the structure of the protocols considered.  This thesis develops and presents techniques for automatic synthesis of provably correct on-chip protocol converters. Basing the solution on a formal approach, a novel state-machine based formalism is presented for modelling bus-based protocols and formalizing the notions of protocol compatibility and correct protocol conversion. Algorithms for automatic compatibility checking and provably-correct converter synthesis are derived from the formalism, including a systematic exploration of the design space of the protocol converter, the first in the field, which enables generation of various alternative deterministic converters. The work presented is unique in its combination of a completely formal approach and the use of a low abstraction level that enables precise modelling of protocol characteristics and automatic translation of the constructed converter to HDL.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">System-on-Chip</field><field name="subject">Formal Methods</field><field name="subject">Protocol converter</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44701</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sputtering for silicon photovoltaics: from nanocrystals to surface passivation</field><field name="creator">Flynn, Christopher Richard, ARC Centre of Excellence in Advanced Silicon Photovoltaics &amp; Photonics, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Deposition of thin material films by sputtering is an increasingly common process in the field of silicon (Si)-based photovoltaics. One of the recently developed sputter-deposited materials applicable to Si photovoltaics comprises Si nanocrystals (NCs) embedded in a Si-based dielectric. The particular case of Si nanocrystals in a Silicon Dioxide (SiO2) matrix was studied by fabricating metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) devices, in which the insulating layer consists of a single layer of Si NCs in SiO2 deposited by sputtering (Si:NC-MIS devices). These test structures were subjected to impedance measurements. The presence of Si NCs was found to result in two distinct capacitance peaks. The first of these peaks is attributable to the small signal response of states at the insulator/substrate interface, enhanced by the presence of fixed charge associated with the NC layer. The second peak, which occurs without precedent, is due to external inversion layer coupling, in conjunction with a transition between tunnel-limited and semiconductor-limited electron current.  Si:NC-MIS devices are also potential test structures for energy-selective contacts, based on SiO2/Si NC/SiO2 double barrier structures fabricated by sputtering. Using a one-dimensional model, current-voltage (I-V) curve simulations were performed for similar structures, in which the Si NCs are replaced by a Si quantum well (QW). The simulations showed that for non-degenerately doped Si substrates, the density of defects in the SiO2 layers can strongly influence the position of I-V curve structure induced by QW quasi-bound states.  Passivation of crystalline Si (c-Si) surfaces by sputter-deposited dielectric films is another major application of sputtering for Si photovoltaics. This application was explored for the cases of sputtered SiO2 and hydrogenated Silicon Oxy-Carbide (SiOC:H). For the case of sputtered SiO2, an effective surface recombination velocity of 146 cm/s was achieved for an injection level of 1E15 cm???3. The investigated SiOC:H films were found to be unsuitable for surface passivation of Si, however their passivation performance could be slightly improved by first coating the Si surface with a chemically-grown or sputtered SiO2 layer.  The investigations performed into specific aspects of sputter-deposited SiO2, Si NCs, and SiOC:H have highlighted important properties of these films, and confirmed the effectiveness of sputtering as a deposition technology for Si photovoltaics.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Surface passivation</field><field name="subject">Sputtering</field><field name="subject">Nanocrystals</field><field name="subject">Photovoltaics</field><field name="subject">Silicon</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44686</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An empirical inquiry of strategic corporate sustainable development orientation - taxonomy, and interrelationships with antecedents, consequences, contingencies and pathways</field><field name="creator">Xu, Ying , Marketing, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses two research objectives:     i).empirically develop a taxonomy based on firms strategic Corporate Sustainable Development (CSD) orientation to better understand and describe their characteristics and business differentials; and    ii).develop and empirically test an integrated framework of antecedents and consequences of the strategic CSD, including pathways and contingencies.

These findings contribute to the classification scheme and may assist managers to determine current levels of CSD, identify possible business opportunities and/or decide on the strategies of CSD adoption.      Through developing CSD measures and testing the relationships within the proposed framework, Innovation Capability (IC) is found to be a pathway (mediator) for firms to gain competitive advantage from Corporate Sustainable Development, whereas CSD does not impact on Business Performance directly when IC is absent.  This inconsistent mediating effect of IC provides interesting new insight.  In addition, CSD exhibits a positive impact on firms Member Organisation Identification, a surrogate measure of corporate reputation from the perspective of employees.      As part of the second research objective, this study also conducts the first empirical testing of the Menon and Menon (1997) model, and found that Industry Reputation moderated the Enviropreneurial Marketing and Business Performance relationship.  These findings provide new knowledge concerning strategic Corporate Sustainable Development (CSD) orientation as well as the underlying mechanisms, which may inform managers with viable directions for integrating corporate economic benefits with social and environmental considerations.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">CSR</field><field name="subject">Corporate Sustainable Development</field><field name="subject">CSD</field><field name="subject">Sustainability</field><field name="subject">Triple Bottom Line</field><field name="subject">Innovation</field><field name="subject">Organisation Identification</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44687</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimising Australian postgraduate medical education and training in nephrology</field><field name="creator">Lane, Cathie Anne, Clinical School - St George Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">The optimal manner in which to train nephrologists has not been studied. The objectives of this research were to determine:- 1. The educational and historical basis underpinning the Australian nephrology training program. 2. The drivers surrounding a career choice in nephrology. 3. What constitutes an ???ideal??? nephrologist and how nephrologists spend their work time, thereby identifying skills and attributes to be fostered in training. 4. Impediments to training, including examination of the available workforce. Five sub studies were undertaken, utilising a combined quantitative and qualitative approach (mixed methods): 1) A national Basic Physician Trainee (BPT) questionnaire, 2) a national nephrology workforce study, and in-depth interviews of: 3) nephrology patients, 4) nephrology trainees and 5) practicing nephrologists. New findings arising from this research reveal: doctors choose nephrology as a career if exposed to the specialty in a positive manner with good role models, however, there are a range of modifiable factors that make nephrology unattractive to many BPTs; workload is high, impacting negatively on training and trainee recruitment; Nephrologists spend most time in the management of dialysis and transplant patients but have a range of other roles in day to day practice, essential information to develop a competency based training program; availability of nephrologists for training is suboptimal and will likely worsen; Patients and doctors apply and weight parameters differently when defining an ???ideal nephrologist???. Both groups believed that specialist knowledge remains an essential requirement but patients focused more on good communication skills. This research provides evidence that the training program should incorporate training in advanced communication and basic research skills and promotion of an holistic approach to patient care. There is no formal alignment of training with assessment. Trainees and nephrologists believe that feedback is critical to learning, yet the assessment process is not underpinned by sound educational principles. This can be rectified using the findings of this research in conjunction with curriculum development and performance assessment. This research should provide an approach to the examination of training that is applicable to many internal medicine specialties. Importantly, nephrology training can now be improved with sound educational principles, underpinned by the findings of this research.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nephrology</field><field name="subject">Medical education</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="subject">Training</field><field name="subject">Specialising</field><field name="subject">Specialist</field><field name="subject">Nephrologist</field><field name="subject">Workforce</field><field name="subject">Patient satisfaction</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44662</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pharmacological activation of pro-survival pathways as a strategy for improving donor heart preservation</field><field name="creator">Kwan, Jair Chau, Clinical School - St Vincent's Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Despite the development and use of specialised cardiac preservation solutions, the quality of the donor heart may still be compromised by its obligatory exposure to periods of ischaemia (both cold and warm) followed by reperfusion upon reintroduction of the recipient circulation. This is reflected in Transplant Registry data showing increased primary allograft failure as a function of increasing ischaemic time. The research described in this thesis is designed to further the understanding of the mechanisms by which the donor heart may be adapted to these prolonged periods of ischaemia and reperfusion by the activation of endogenous pro-survival signalling pathways by the addition of pharmacological agents to Celsior, a clinical preservation solution. Studies were conducted in an isolated working rat heart model of donor heart preservation. The first study investigated the cardioprotective effects of a novel inhibitor of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1, INO-1153. Maximum protective effect (after a 6 hour storage period) was observed when the PARP inhibitor was administered prior to cardiac arrest and storage and when the agent was added to the Celsior cardioplegic / storage solution. This protective affect was associated with activation of the Akt signalling pathway and could be prevented by inhibition of Akt phosphorylation and activation. The second study examined functional protection and pro-survival signalling pathway activation in hearts arrested and stored for 6 hours in Celsior supplemented with glyceryl trinitrate (an exogenous source of nitric oxide) and Cariporide (an inhibitor of sodium hydrogen exchange). Here, cardiac protection was accompanied by activation of the ERK 1/2 pro-survival pathway as well as a decrease in apoptosis. The third study examined the cardioprotective effect of supplementation of Celsior with all three agents after an extended (10 hour) period of hypothermic storage. Significant recovery of function was only observed in the triply supplemented hearts, being accompanied by activation of both the Akt and ERK pathways. These studies demonstrate for the first time the feasibility of recruitment of endogenous pro-survival pathways as an approach to increasing the post-storage function of the donor heart. Importantly, for the logistics of clinical transplantation, these pathways can be recruited by addition of appropriate pharmacological agents to the arresting and storage solution.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nitric oxide</field><field name="subject">Ischaemia reperfusion</field><field name="subject">Preconditioning</field><field name="subject">Apoptosis</field><field name="subject">Pro-survival pathways</field><field name="subject">Celsior</field><field name="subject">RISK</field><field name="subject">Cardiac Haemodynamics</field><field name="subject">Cardiac contractility</field><field name="subject">Heart preservation</field><field name="subject">PARP</field><field name="subject">Na+/H+ exchange inhibitor</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44663</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Topics in statistical signal processing for estimation and detection in wireless communication systems</field><field name="creator">Nevat, Ido , Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">During the last decade there has been a steady increase in the demand for incorporation of high data rate and strong reliability within wireless communication applications. Among the different solutions that have been proposed to cope with this new demand, the utilization of multiple antennas arises as one of the best candidates due to the fact that it provides both an increase in reliability and also in information transmission rate. A Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) structure usually assumes a frequency non-selective characteristic at each channel. However, when the transmission rate is high, the whole channel can become frequency selective. Therefore, the use of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) that transforms a frequency selective channel into a large set of individual frequency  on-selective narrowband channels, is well suited to be used in conjunction with MIMO systems. A MIMO system employing OFDM, denoted MIMO-OFDM, is able to achieve high spectral efficiency. However, the adoption of multiple antenna elements at the transmitter for  spatial transmission results in a superposition of multiple transmitted signals at the receiver, weighted by their corresponding multipath channels. This in turn results in difficulties with reception, and imposes a real challenge on how to design a practical system that can offer a true spectral efficiency improvement. In addition, as wireless networks continue to expend in geographical size, the distance between the source and the destination precludes direct communication between them. In such scenarios, a repeater is placed between the source and the destination to achieve end-to-end communication. New advances in electronics and semiconductor technologies have enabled and made relay based systems feasible. As a result, these systems have become a hot research topic in the wireless research community in recent years. Potential application areas of cooperation diversity are the next generation cellular networks, mobile wireless ad-hoc networks, and mesh networks for wireless broadband access. Besides increasing the network coverage, relays can provide additional diversity to combat the effects of the wireless fading channel. This thesis is concerned with methods to facilitate the use of MIMO, OFDM and relay based systems. In the first part of this thesis, we concentrate on low complexity algorithms for detection of symbols in MIMO systems, with various degrees of quality of channel state information. First, we design algorithms for the case that perfect Channel State Information (CSI) is available at the receiver. Next, we design algorithms for the detection of non-uniform symbols constellations where only partial CSI is given at the receiver. These will be based on non-convex and stochastic optimisation techniques. The second part of this thesis addresses primary issues in OFDM systems. We first concentrate on a design of an OFDM receiver. First we design an iterative receiver for OFDM systems which performs detection, decoding and channel tracking that aims at minimising the error propagation effect due to erroneous detection of data symbols. Next we focus our attention to channel estimation in OFDM systems where the number of channel taps and the power delay profile are both unknown a priori. Using Trans Dimensional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (TDMCMC) methodology we design algorithms to perform joint model order selection and channel estimation. The third part of this thesis is dedicated to detection of data symbols in relay systems with non-linear relay functions and where only partial CSI is available at the receiver. In order to design the optimal data detector, the likelihood function needs to be evaluated at the receiver. Since the likelihood function cannot be obtained analytically or not even in a closed form in this case, we shall utilse a ???Likelihood Free??? inference methodology. This will be based on the Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) theory to enable the design of novel data sequence detectors.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Statistical signal processing</field><field name="subject">Wireless communication systems</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44664</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of the Chinese reverse mortgage market: possibilities and risks</field><field name="creator">Feng, Jun , Actuarial Studies, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Aging is an inevitable trend for most of the countries. Compared to developed countries, China lacks a comprehensive social security system that provides a safety net for the welfare of the elderly in their retirement. Even more, Chinese seniors are about to suffer insufficient support from traditional means ??? family and government support. As a last resort, reverse mortgages are a good financial tool to unlock home equity and improve the living standard for elderly without them moving out. This thesis aims to assess the Chinese reverse mortgage market from different perspectives to determine whether reverse mortgages will work in Chinese market. From the demand side, the analysis shows that China???s aged population, identified as the potential consumers of reverse mortgages, has a large fraction of wealth tied up in the form of housing and is in need of a method to release their home equity to finance life after retirement. From the supply side, potential providers could also benefit from reverse mortgages despite the exposure to various risks, e.g. cross over risks. Further examination of the Chinese financial and housing markets, and mortality rate helps to build the Chinese context based on which cash flows of reverse mortgage transactions are simulated. Simulation results show that reverse mortgages are beneficial to the Chinese elderly as accessing home equity allows them to double their consumption. Based on this analysis from different angles, we conclude that reverse mortgages will work in the Chinese market.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">Reverse Mortgages</field><field name="subject">Market Analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44665</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular toolbox for the monitoring and control of water distribution biofilms</field><field name="creator">Moore, Zoe, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The water distribution system represents the final barrier to the degradation of treated water prior to consumption. Maintaining the integrity of these systems therefore is essential for public health. Current strategies for monitoring bacteriological water quality within distribution systems are dependent upon culture-based methods, which are affected by many factors, including conventional disinfection strategies (chlorine) that have been shown to impact the culturability of bacteria on media. Improved methods to assess the bacteriological loads and responses to treatment are needed. This thesis investigated the development and application of alternate means of analysis of water quality analytes, enabling a toolbox approach for bacteriological water quality monitoring. Tools used in this study include biomass concentration using DNA quantification, bacterial community characterisation using 16S rDNA polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE), targeted population assessment using quantitative PCR (QPCR) and in situ phylogenetic abundance using fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH). Conventional methods such as heterotrophic plate counts were also included. Results show that chlorine does not eradicate bacteria by the proportions generally reported using culture-reliant methods. Within both drinking and recycled water distribution systems, bacteria belonging to Enterobacteriaceae and species of Pseudomonas were detected in water containing 2 ppm free chlorine concentrations. The persistence of such bacteria in conditions prevalent within distribution systems necessitates the revision of techniques of analysis as well as improved treatment and disinfection management strategies.  Furthermore, current strategies for water quality monitoring are reliant on the assessment of planktonic bacterial populations, and do not consider attached (biofilm) populations. Molecular methods of analysis showed up to 5-log more bacteria are present in biofilms compared to planktonic sources. Thus, improved methods for water quality maintenance in distribution systems need to consider the contributions of biofilms. This thesis also studied the effects of a nitric oxide (NO) donor, as NO has been shown to encourage detachment of bacterial cells from the biofilm which then enter the planktonic phase of the life cycle. The molecular toolbox analysis approach showed that effects are variable on the diverse bacterial populations present in distribution systems, and some bacteria show heightened resistance compared to other populations. Ongoing work targeting biofilms in distribution systems is required to improve conventional practices of water quality assurance in distribution systems.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44666</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The alignment of business and IT strategy in multi-business organisations</field><field name="creator">Reynolds, Peter James, Strategy &amp; Entrepreneurship, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">The alignment of business and information technology (IT) strategy is an important and enduring theoretical challenge for the information systems discipline and has remained a top issue in practice for the past twenty years. The extant literature makes two implicit assumptions. One is that IT strategy is aligned with a single business strategy, either at the corporate level or within a single strategic business unit (SBU). The other is that strategies are developed at a single point in time. Therefore, multi-business organisations present a particular alignment challenge, because business strategies are developed at both the corporate level and SBU levels, and these strategies are developed over time. This dissertation contributes a dynamic, capabilities-based theory of business and IT strategy alignment. Rather than extending existing models, this study draws on theory from the resource-based view of the firm and path dependence to address business and IT alignment within and between corporate and SBU levels across the strategy cycle. A new dynamic alignment model conceptualises IT alignment as the fit between business and IT strategies within the corporate and SBU levels and the coherence between these two levels. Value is created by complementary relationships among business and IT capabilities. IT alignment (or misalignment) is embedded over the strategy cycle, with the degrees of freedom declining quickly over time.  The new model is validated using pattern matching with a single critical case of strategy development in a multi-business organisation across a complete strategy cycle. The strong match between the empirically observed and theoretically predicted patterns, and the complex nature of these patterns, provides strong support for the model.  The model reconceptualises the way IT alignment drives organisational performance and how IT alignment changes over time. This has implications for existing IT alignment models, providing alternative theoretical explanations of how IT alignment creates value and how IT alignment changes over time. The new model also has implications for practice across the IT investment value chain and its governance.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">IT capabilties</field><field name="subject">Business and IT alignment</field><field name="subject">IT strategy</field><field name="subject">Resource-based view of the firm</field><field name="subject">Pathe dependence</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44712</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ontological priority of events in Gilles Deleuze???s The Logic of Sense</field><field name="creator">Bowden, Sean Terrence, History &amp; Philosophy, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the way in which Gilles Deleuze asserts the ontological priority of events over substances in his 1969 publication, The Logic of Sense, with reference to several philosophers and intellectual movements, namely, the Stoics, Leibniz, Albert Lautman, Gilbert Simondon, structuralism and psychoanalysis.  Chapter 1 analyzes the problem which The Logic of Sense sets out to resolve, that is, to determine the ???evental??? conditions of the event if everything is to be understood as ontologically dependent on events. It then examines how Deleuze compares events to Stoic lekta, which are both causal effects and the material of Stoic dialectic. The event is seen to be the juncture of an ongoing ???sense-event,??? simultaneously involving: causal analyses of bodies; the construction of concepts characterizing these bodies; and the development of one???s knowledge of these bodies.  Chapter 2 examines how Deleuze extends a number of Leibnizian notions in order to re-describe this sense-event in terms of ???static ontological and logical geneses,??? or ???disjunctive syntheses,??? bearing on divergent ???points of view??? with regard to the events characterizing worldly things. These syntheses bring about a three-fold determination of: a world of individuals common to divergent points of view; the beliefs of persons holding these points of view; and families of concepts which these individuals and persons ???exemplify??? insofar as they belong to a common world.  Chapters 3 and 4 explore the way in which, with reference to Lautman, Simondon and structuralism, Deleuze argues that static geneses should be thought of in terms of an underlying structure, wherein the events characterizing things are themselves determined only by other events. Within this structure, events of all orders and types determine each other reciprocally, completely and progressively, and without reference to any substance transcending this system.  Chapter 5 shows how, in relation to psychoanalysis, Deleuze understands the structure of events to be produced as an event by speaking persons, even as this structure also produces these persons, and their speech, as events. We are thus able to conclude that the structure of events is both the evental-determination of events characterizing things in general, and itself an event.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ontology</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Events</field><field name="subject">The Logic of Sense</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44716</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Singapore National Employers Federation (SNEF)  and Singapore&#146;s Industrial Relations</field><field name="creator">Gan, Kah Chun Bernard, Organisation &amp; Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the formation, development, role and behaviour of the Singapore National Employers' Federation (SNEF). Its focus is primarily the field of labour management. It addresses key issues in the role of the SNEF from its formation in 1980 to 2004, in the institutional context of Singapore's politics, economic development and industrial relations. This longitudinal study makes a substantial original contribution to understanding Singapore's leading national employers' association, and is a pioneering study of a national employers' association in East Asia.  The thesis is a qualitative case-study, using fieldwork interviews, primary documents and the secondary literature as data sources. Through the critical event method, the work focuses analysis on key junctures for the SNEF's development and change during the period examined. In addition, the author employs the Sheldon and Thornthwaite (1999) model of employers' association strategy in framing the analysis of the thesis' central questions, and in examining SNEF's strategic decisions in response to changes in its external environment. By analysing how the SNEF's external roles and internal relations changed during each period, the research draws attention to the dynamic nature of this employers' association in the rapidly changing conditions marking Singapore's development. Given the central role of the People's Action Party (PAP) in Singaporean society, a central theme of this thesis is how the SNEF balances political pressures from Singapore's government-dominated corporatist system, with the needs of its diversified membership. The narrative core of the thesis identifies five distinct periods of Singaporean industrial relations - through the lens of the SNEF - reflecting larger economic developments through which the government guided the economy and society. The thesis finds that, while the SNEF is an independent and apolitical organisation, it is nevertheless deeply embedded in the Singaporean variant of corporatism. Accordingly, the SNEF's role and behaviour are inherently guided by the PAP's ideology of pragmatism and, in Singapore, sectoral interests deferred to and institutionally served national interests.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Employers' Association</field><field name="subject">Singapore</field><field name="subject">Industrial Relations</field><field name="subject">SNEF</field><field name="subject">Corporatism</field><field name="subject">Employment Relations</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44717</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Titanium surface modification by oxidation for biomedical application</field><field name="creator">Abdullah, Hasan Zuhudi, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Surface modification is a process that is applied to the surfaces of titanium substrates in order to improve the biocompatibility after implanting in the body.  Two methods were used in the present work:  Anodisation and gel oxidation.  Anodisation was performed at room temperature in strong mineral acids (sulphuric acid (H2SO4) and phosphoric acid (H3PO4)), an oxidising agent (hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)), mixed solutions of the preceding three, and a weak organic acid mixture (&#946;-glycerophosphate + calcium acetate).  The parameters used in anodisation were:  Concentrations of the electrolytes, applied voltage, current density, and anodisation time.  Gel oxidation was carried out by soaking titanium substrates in sodium hydroxide (NaOH) aqueous solutions at different concentrations (0.5 M, 1.0 M, 5.0 M, and 10.0 M) at 60??C for 24 h, followed by oxidation at 400??, 600??, and 800??C for 1 h.  Conceptual models representing changes in the microstructure as a function of the experimental parameters were developed using the anodisation data.  The relevant parameters were:  Applied voltage, current density, acid concentration, and anodisation time:  ??	The model for anodisation using the strong acid (H2SO4) illustrates the growth rate of the film, identification of the threshold for the establishment of a consistent microstructure, and prediction of the properties of the film. ??	For the oxidising agent (H2O2), two models were developed:  Current-control and voltage-control, the applicability of which depends on the scale of the current density (high or low, respectively).  These models are interpreted in terms of the coherency/incoherency of the corrosion gel, arcing, and porosity. ??	The model for the strongest acid (H3PO4) is similar to that of H2O2 in current-control mode, although this system showed the greatest intensity of arcing and consequent pore size. ??	Anodisation in mixed solutions uses Ohm??s law to explain four stages of film growth in current-control mode.  These stages describe the thickness of the gel, its recrystallisation, and the achievement of a consistent microstructure. ??	Anodisation in weaker organic acids allows the most detailed examination of the anodisation process.  Both current density and voltage as a function time reveal the nature of the process in six stages:  (1) instrumental response, (2 and 3) gel thickening, (4) transformation of the amorphous gel to amorphous titania, (5) recrystallisation of the amorphous titania, and (6) subsurface pore generation upon establishment of a consistent microstructure.  Gel oxidation was done at low and high NaOH concentrations followed by oxidation.  Three models were developed to represent the gel oxidation process:  (1) Low concentration, (0.5 M and 1.0 M NaOH), (2) Medium concentration (5.0 M NaOH), and (3) high concentration (10.0 M NaOH).  For the low concentrations with increasing temperature, the model involves:  (1) amorphous sodium titanate forms over a layer of amorphous anatase and (2) a dense layer of rutile forms.  For the high concentrations with increasing temperature, the model involves:  (1) amorphous sodium titanate forms over a layer of amorphous anatase, (2) a dense layer of anatase forms and raises up the existing porous anatase layer, and (3) the dense and porous anatase layers transform to dense and porous rutile layers, respectively.  The main difference between the two is the retention of crystalline sodium titanate in the higher NaOH concentration.  Anodised and gel oxidised samples subsequently were soaked in simulated body fluid in order to study the precipitation of hydroxyapatite in the absence and presence of long UV irradiation, which has not been investigated before.  With the anodised surfaces, the porous and rough titania coating facilitated both the precipitation of hydroxyapatite and the attachment of bone-like cells.  UV irradiation showed greatly enhanced hydroxyapatite precipitation, which is attributed to its photocatalytic properties.  With the gel oxidised surfaces, the greatest amount of hydroxyapatite precipitation occurred with the presence of both anatase and amorphous sodium titanate.  Rutile suppressed precipitation.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gel Oxidation</field><field name="subject">Titanium Dioxide</field><field name="subject">Anodic Oxidation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44718</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Non-Line-of-Sight localisation of a sound source</field><field name="creator">Mak, Lin Chi, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis proposes two acoustic localisation techniques that are accurate in Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) conditions and system implementation of the proposed techniques. Such conditions can cause positive bias errors, namely NLoS errors, in the measured Time-of-Arrivals (ToAs) of first-arrival signals received by microphones and thus reduce the positioning accuracy. The primary issue of the thesis is to precisely estimate and correct the NLoS errors by modelling the received first-arrival signals.  The first proposed technique uses multiple on-ground microphones to locate a sound source. The proposed technique approximately estimates and corrects the NLoS errors based on an initial guess of the sound source position and a map. The localisation is then achieved by iteratively correcting the ToAs and updating the sound source location. The strength of the proposed technique is that its accuracy is not notably affected by small or known obstacles. The proposed technique is implemented into two localisation systems of controlled and uncontrolled sound sources. The performance of the proposed technique is investigated by its comparison with three other time-based localisation techniques in series of experiments and simulations, showing at least 10% improvement by the proposed technique under various background noise levels.  The second proposed technique localises a sound source using a single on-ground microphone subject to an assumption of a single diffraction in the first-arrival signal. To predict the angular and radial coordinates of the sound source relative to the diffraction point, a new magnitude delay frequency profile is proposed. The profile can be estimated by applying the uniform geometrical theory of diffraction and be extracted from measured signals using a derived formulation. Similar to the first technique, the second proposed technique estimates the measured delay of the first-arrival signal for computing the radial coordinate. The angular coordinate is then obtained by matching the estimated and measured profiles at the measured delay. A key achievement of the second proposed technique is enabling NLoS localisation using only one microphone without any time-consuming pre-measurement. This technique is implemented into a localisation system of a controlled sound source and validated experimentally with three different sound sources and under two background noise levels.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Time-of-arrival estimation</field><field name="subject">Localisation</field><field name="subject">Non-line-of-sight</field><field name="subject">Acoustic</field><field name="subject">Micro aerial vehicle</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44702</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vision and expertise for interceptive actions in sport</field><field name="creator">Mann, David Lindsay, Optometry &amp; Vision Science, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Exquisite visually-guided movements underpin expertise in fast interceptive sports.  The assumption that skilled performance relies on superior visual skills has been challenged by studies of sporting expertise which typically advocate vision to be a poor predictor of sporting success.  This discordance is addressed in this thesis by examining whether visual degradation (in the form of blur) affects the performance of an interceptive action where successful execution demands precise spatial and temporal visual-motor control.  The vision of skilled cricket batters was blurred using contact lenses (four increasing levels: plano, +1.00, +2.00, +3.00) in each of two experimental phases.  In the first phase batters faced a bowling-machine and in-situ bowlers to examine the effect of blur on bat-ball interception.  The highest level of blur (+3.00) was required to produce a significant decrease in batting performance when facing the bowling-machine at medium-paced ball-velocities (105-115 kph).  A similar effect of blur was found when facing in-situ bowlers of comparable ball-velocity, however performance was found to be affected by a lower level of blur (+2.00) for faster-paced ball-velocities (120-130 kph).  The +1.00 blur was concluded even at this higher ball-velocity to have no measurable effect on interceptive performance in a natural setting.  The second phase sought to investigate the effect of blur on anticipation: a perceptual skill established to be an important component of expertise in many interceptive sports.  It was established, using temporal occlusion of a bowling sequence, that optimal anticipation required an opportunity for bat-ball interception (facilitating close coupling between perception and action).  Coupled anticipation demonstrated velocity-dependent resilience to blur; +3.00 and +2.00 were required for respective decreases in the anticipation of action-sequences for medium- and fast-paced ball-velocities.  Remarkably, results suggest that blur may enhance uncoupled (verbal) anticipation according to the movement velocity of the bowler.  Experimental results led to the conclusion that clear vision is not necessarily required for optimal interceptive performance, even when the demanding spatio-temporal task simulates the conditions experienced at the highest levels of competition.  Results are interpreted based on the predictions of the dual-pathway theory of vision, including differences in the underlying visual information processed via these pathways.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Interceptive actions</field><field name="subject">Vision</field><field name="subject">Sport</field><field name="subject">Dual pathway theory of vision</field><field name="subject">Dorsal</field><field name="subject">Ventral</field><field name="subject">Cricket</field><field name="subject">Vision-for-perception</field><field name="subject">Vision-for-action</field><field name="subject">Anticipation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44704</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Automatic speaker recognition using phase based features</field><field name="creator">Thiruvaran, Tharmarajah , Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Despite recent advances, improving the accuracy of automatic speaker recognition systems remains an important and challenging area of research. This thesis investigates two-phase based features, namely the frequency modulation (FM) feature and the group delay feature in order to improve the speaker recognition accuracy. Introducing features complementary to spectral envelope-based features is a promising approach for increasing the information content of the speaker recognition system. Although phase-based features are motivated by psychophysics and speech production considerations, they have rarely been incorporated into speaker recognition front-ends. A theory has been developed and reported in this thesis, to show that the FM component can be extracted using second-order all pole modelling, and a technique for extracting FM features using this model is proposed, to produce very smooth, slowly varying FM features that are effective for speaker recognition tasks. This approach is shown herein to significantly improve speaker recognition performance over other existing FM extraction methods. A highly computationally efficient FM estimation technique is then proposed and its computational efficiency is shown through a comparative study with other methods with respect to the trade off between computational complexity and performance. In order to further enhance the FM based front-end specifically for speaker recognition, optimum frequency band allocation is studied in terms of the number of sub-bands and spacing of centre frequencies, and two new frequency band re-allocations are proposed for FM based speaker recognition. Two group delay features are also proposed: log compressed group delay feature and the sub-band group delay feature, to address problems in group delay caused by the zeros of the z-transform polynomial of a speech signal being close to the unit circle. It has been shown that the combination of group delay and FM, complements Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) in speaker recognition tasks.  Furthermore, the proposed FM feature is successfully utilised for automatic forensic speaker recognition, which is implemented based on the likelihood ratio framework with two stage modelling and calibration, and shown to behave in a complementary manner to MFCCs. Notably, the FM based system provides better calibration loss than the MFCC based system, suggesting less ambiguity of FM information than MFCC information in an automatic forensic speaker recognition system. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of FM features in a large scale speaker recognition environment, an FM-based speaker recognition subsystem is developed and submitted to the NIST 2008 speaker recognition evaluation as part of the I4U submission. Post evaluation analysis shows a 19.7% relative improvement over the traditional MFCC based subsystem when it is augmented by the FM based subsystem. Consistent improvements in performance are obtained when MFCC is augmented with FM in all sub-categories of NIST 2008, in three development tasks and for the NIST 2001 database, demonstrating the complementary behaviour of MFCC and FM features.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Phase features</field><field name="subject">Speaker recognition</field><field name="subject">Frequency modulation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44705</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Venture capital deal selection in Australia</field><field name="creator">Peters, Timothy Edward, Banking &amp; Finance, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">All venture capital investments exhibit some form of asymmetric information. The seminal paper on the structure of venture investments, Kaplan and Stromberg (2004), investigates how venture capitalists use deal construction to control agency conflicts within funded deals and their associated internal, external and execution risks. Another key strand of the academic literature has reviewed the contractual arrangements venture capital firms reach, the process of venture capital selection and determinants of their success from a post-investment perspective (Fried and Hisrich (1994), Manigart, Vermeir and Sapienza (1996), Gompers and Lerner (2004), Wright and Robbie (1998)). This thesis also explores venture capital investment, albeit from a preinvestment standpoint. In contrast to Kaplan and Stromberg???s (2004) demonstration of the use of venture capital mechanisms to control agency issues, this research addresses how agency issues influence the final selection of potential investments by venture capitalists.  Kaplan and Stromberg (2004) use post-funding metrics to capture risks, which influence post-contract design. From a pre-funding perspective, internal, external and execution risks are subjective, rare and difficult to measure. Nevertheless, this thesis uses pre-funding proxies to replicate these risks, some of which have direct empirical academic support. Information for sixtytwo deals, thirty-four funded and twenty-eight unfunded, was hand collected through a combination of surveys, interviews and consultation with five of Australia???s leading venture capital firms, and individuals from the Australian Private Equity and Venture Capital Association (AVCAL) board and executive. The key results indicate that once past initial screening stages, investment proposals that have a higher likelihood of receiving venture investment are those that had prior government investment, and/or, where the entrepreneur has proposed the investment be through milestone tranches and where revenue is already being generated (for early stage ventures). The results suggest that venture capitalists tend to allocate capital to investments perceived as ???safer??? with respect to agency conflicts. More specifically, venture capitalists are more reliant on signals of quality and lower risk, such as government grants, restriction of capital outlay and prior revenue generation ??? all of which reduce associated levels of internal and execution risk in new ventures.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Asymmetric Information</field><field name="subject">Venture Capital</field><field name="subject">Deal Selection</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44706</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The application of machine intelligence to cochlear implant fitting and the analysis of the auditory nerve response</field><field name="creator">Botros, Andrew, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Effective cochlear implant fitting (or programming) is essential for providing good hearing outcomes, yet it is a subjective and error-prone task. The initial objective of this research was to automate the procedure using the auditory nerve electrically evoked compound action potential (the ECAP) and machine intelligence. The Nucleus?? cochlear implant measures the ECAP via its Neural Response Telemetry (NRT&#153;) system. AutoNRT&#153;, a commercial intelligent system that measures ECAP thresholds with the Nucleus Freedom&#153; implant, was firstly developed in this research. AutoNRT uses decision tree expert systems that automatically recognise ECAPs. The algorithm approaches threshold from lower stimulus levels, ensuring recipient safety during postoperative measurements. Clinical studies have demonstrated success on approximately 95% of electrodes, measured with the same efficacy as a human expert. NRT features other than ECAP threshold, such as the ECAP recovery function, could not be measured with similar success rates, precluding further automation and loudness prediction from data mining results. Despite this outcome, a better application of the ECAP threshold profile towards fitting was established. Since C-level profiles (the contour of maximum acceptable stimulus levels across the implant array) were observed to be flatter than T-level profiles (the contour of minimum audibility), a flattening of the ECAP threshold profile was adopted when applied as a fitting profile at higher stimulus levels. Clinical benefits of this profile scaling technique were demonstrated in a 42 subject study. Data mining results also provided an insight into the ECAP recovery function and refractoriness. It is argued that the ECAP recovery function is heavily influenced by the size of the recruited neural population, with evidence gathered from a computational model of the cat auditory nerve and NRT measurements with 21 human subjects. Slower ECAP recovery, at equal loudness, is a consequence of greater neural recruitment leading to lower mean spike probabilities. This view can explain the counterintuitive association between slower ECAP recovery and greater temporal responsiveness to increasing stimulation rate. This thesis presents the first attempt at achieving completely automated cochlear implant fitting via machine intelligence; a future generation implant, capable of high fidelity auditory system measurements, may realise the ultimate objective.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Artificial intelligence</field><field name="subject">Cochlear implants</field><field name="subject">Auditory nerve</field><field name="subject">Electrically evoked compound action potential</field><field name="subject">Neural Response Telemetry</field><field name="subject">Fitting</field><field name="subject">Loudness perception</field><field name="subject">Profile scaling</field><field name="subject">Recovery function</field><field name="subject">Refractoriness</field><field name="subject">Machine learning</field><field name="subject">Data mining</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44707</field></doc><doc><field name="title">[Re]viewing the Chinese Landscape: Imaging the Body [In]visible in Shanshuihua ?????????</field><field name="creator">Lim, Chye Hong, Languages &amp; Linguistics, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis, titled '[Re]viewing the Chinese Landscape: Imaging the Body [In]visible in Shanshuihua ?????????,' examines shanshuihua as a 'theoretical object' through the intervention of the present. In doing so, the study uses the body as an emblem for going beyond the surface appearance of a shanshuihua. This new strategy for interpreting shanshuihua proposes a 'Chinese' way of situating bodily consciousness. Thus, this study is not about shanshuihua in a general sense. Instead, it focuses on the emergence and codification of shanshuihua in the tenth and eleventh centuries with particular emphasis on the cultural construction of landscape via the agency of the body. On one level the thesis is a comprehensive study of the ideas of the body in shanshuihua, and on another it is a review of shanshuihua through situating bodily consciousness. The approach is not an abstract search for meaning but, rather, is empirically anchored within a heuristic and phenomenological framework. This framework utilises primary and secondary sources on art history and theory, sinology, medical and intellectual history, Chinese philosophy, phenomenology, human geography, cultural studies, and selected landscape texts. This study argues that shanshuihua needs to be understood and read not just as an image but also as a creative transformative process that is inevitably bound up with the body. In addition, the thesis contends that the body is 'invisible' in shanshuihua not because it is absent or irrelevant, but rather because it had been 'naturalised' within the landscape as a palimpsest. Further, the thesis urges that the seemingly 'invisible' may be made visible through knowing how and what to see. In all, this study presents a different view of shanshuihua: as a theoretical object it 'theorises'; as a painting it 'transforms'; and as a process it 'embodies'.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Body</field><field name="subject">Chinese landscape painting</field><field name="subject">Shanshuihua</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44708</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Parameter optimization in simplified models of cardiac myocytes</field><field name="creator">Mathavan, Neashan , Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a complex, multifaceted arrhythmia. Pathogenesis of AF is associated with multiple aetiologies and the mechanisms by which it is sustained and perpetuated are similarly diverse. In particular, regional heterogeneity in the electrophysiological properties of normal and pathological tissue plays a critical role in the occurrence of AF. Understanding AF in the context of electrophysiological heterogeneity requires cell-specific ionic models of electrical activity which can then be incorporated into models on larger temporal and spatial scales. Biophysically-based models have typically dominated the study of cellular excitability providing detailed and precise descriptions in the form of complex mathematical formulations. However, such models have limited applicability in multidimensional simulations as the computational expense is too prohibitive. Simplified mathematical models of cardiac cell electrical activity are an alternative approach to these traditional biophysically-detailed models. Utilizing this approach enables the embodiment of cellular excitation characteristics at minimal computational cost such that simulations of arrhythmogensis in atrial tissue are conceivable. In this thesis, a simplified, generic mathematical model is proposed that characterizes and reproduces the action potential waveforms of individual cardiac myocytes. It incorporates three time-dependent ionic currents and an additional time-independent leakage current. The formulation of the three time-dependent ionic currents is based on 4-state Markov schemes with state transition rates expressed as nonlinear sigmoidal functions of the membrane potential. Parameters of the generic model were optimized to fit the action potential waveforms of the Beeler-Reuter model, and, experimental recordings from atrial and sinoatrial cells of rabbits. A nonlinear least-squares optimization routine was employed for the parameter fits. The model was successfully fitted to the Beeler-Reuter waveform (RMS error: 1.4999 mV) and action potentials recorded from atrial tissue (RMS error: 1.3398 mV) and cells of the peripheral (RMS error: 2.4821 mV) and central (RMS error: 2.3126 mV) sinoatrial node. Thus, the model presented here is a mathematical framework by which a wide variety of cell-specific AP morphologies can be reproduced. Such a model offers the potential for insights into possible mechanisms that contribute to heterogeneity and/or arrhythmia.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Parameter Optimization</field><field name="subject">Atrial Fibrillation</field><field name="subject">Cardiac Electrophysiology</field><field name="subject">Cardiac arrhythmia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44709</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Talk about sex? - how HIV-positive gay men talk about sexual health with their doctors and health care providers</field><field name="creator">Mietinen, Jan Roar, National Centre in HIV Social Research, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is a qualitative study investigating the communication about sexual health between HIV-positive gay men and their doctors and other health care providers. The study was conducted in 2007 and 2008 in Sydney, Australia. Data was collected through in-depth interviews with eleven HIV-positive gay men, and analysed according to a modified grounded theory approach. The study aims to explore the men??s needs, expectations and experiences in relation to how sexual health is addressed in clinical consultations. While previous research has documented that HIV/AIDS is a diagnosis that poses significant physical, emotional and social challenges for People Living With HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) which may impact on their sexual health and well-being, this thesis examines whether, and to what extent this is communicated between HIV-positive gay men and their doctors. In doing so the study identifies and describes the ways in which HIV-positive gay men understand sexual health, how they currently talk to their clinicians about sexual health issues, the priority that such issues have for these men, and barriers and ??incentives?? to sexual health being discussed within HIV treatment settings. The study reveals that the men??s communication about sexual health with their doctors is essentially limited to discussions about sexually transmissible infections (STIs), which represent a common understanding of what constitutes sexual health. The emotional and social aspects of sexual health and well-being are rarely discussed in doctor-patient communication. Instead, the men rely on sources outside the health system, such as friends, peers, partners, gay and HIV community organizations and the gay and HIV media for sexual health information, advice and support. This indicates that broad, holistic sexual health has a low priority in discussions between patients and their doctors, and that social networks therefore play an important role in how HIV-positive gay men take care of their sexual health.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gay men</field><field name="subject">Sexual health</field><field name="subject">Communication</field><field name="subject">Doctor-patient relationship</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44711</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structural integrity of carbon fibre/aluminium foam sandwich composites</field><field name="creator">Idris, Maizlinda Izwana, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis focuses on closed-cell aluminium foams (ALPORAS and ALULIGHT) and on sandwich panels comprising these foams laminated with 2/2 twill carbon fibre (MTM56/0300) skins. The thesis experimentally and analytically investigates the response of foam-only panels (ALPORAS) to indentation with various indenter sizes and shapes; and also studies the behaviour of sandwich panels to contact damage caused quasi-statically or by impact.  Quasi??static uniaxial compression testing is used to determine the mechanical properties of the foams (ALPORAS and ALULIGHT). It is revealed that the plastic collapse strength (&#963;* pl) obtained from the stress??strain curves is lower than the values predicted by the Gibson-Ashby theoretical model. This phenomenon is explained by the fact that the aluminium foams tested are imperfect, non-homogeneous and non-isotropic, and show a distinct cell elongation. Whereas, the Gibson-Ashby theoretical model was based on the finite element method applied to the response of a unit tetrakaidecahedral closed cell having flat faces.  The experimental work shows that the deformation of the foam-only panels to indentation is caused by progressive crushing of the cell bands and by shearing and tearing of the cell walls. This thesis presents new analytical models for the response of the foam-only panels and estimates the applied deformation load in all types of indentation. By fitting the experimental load-displacement curves, the shear strength (&#964;* pl) and the tear energy (&#947;) are deduced. Compared to the literature, more consistent results are obtained for the shear strength (&#964; * pl) and the tear energy (&#947;) from all types of indentation. It is also suggested to determine (&#964; * pl) and (&#947;) through indentations with long punches (FEP and LCP), instead of hemi-spherical or cylindrical indenters, because indentation on enclosed areas shows some indenter size dependence. It is concluded that thinner panels are not suitable for the determination of the tear energy (&#947;) since the densification of the foam is achieved before the tear resistance is fully engaged.  Another objective of this thesis is to study the response of sandwich panels comprising a closed??cell aluminium foam core and laminated with carbon fibre skin to quasi-static and impact local damage. Special attention is paid to the residual (remnant) strength in bending of the already indented sandwich panels (quasi-statically or by impact) up to the failure point. The remnant strength in bending is determined by carrying out four point bending strength tests. The local damage is located on either the compressive or on the tensile side of the sandwich panels. Thus, the capacity of the panels to resist transverse loads after they have been locally damaged at contact is investigated. The contact damage on the sandwich panels is experimentally simulated using spherical indenters. The quasi-static indentation is carried out at a low constant velocity (0.5mm/min) ?? the induced contact damage is found to be independent on the sample thickness but dependent on the indenter diameter. On the contrary, the impact test indicates velocity-dependence of the failure mode of the sandwich panel (i.e. skin breakage or punch through) which is found from the load-displacement curves. The results reveal that there is a correlation between the area of the contact damage and the remnant strength, and that the use of metal foam cores leads to high contact damage resilience of composite structures.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sandwich Composites</field><field name="subject">Aluminium Foam</field><field name="subject">Carbon Fibre</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44722</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Security market manipulations and the assurance of market integrity</field><field name="creator">Ji, Shan , Banking &amp; Finance, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This dissertation is motivated by two major factors. First, there have been no direct studies conducted for the relationship between market integrity and market efficiency and the driving forces behind the cross-sectional variations in market quality. Second, a better understanding the relationships among market integrity, market efficiency and other mechanism design factors for securities exchanges will facilitate securities exchanges  achieve a satisfactory level of market quality.  This dissertation consists of three chapters. In Chapter 1, a review of literature on market manipulation will be given.  A series of common securities market manipulation strategies and corresponding market surveillance alerts will be explained and defined.  In Chapter 2, we develop a testable hypothesis that market manipulation as proxied by the incidence of ramping alerts would raise transaction cost for completing larger trades. We find ramping alert incidence positively related to effective spreads in 8 of 10 turnover deciles from most liquid to thinnest-trading securities. The magnitude of the increase in effective spreads when ramping manipulation incidence doubles is economically significant, 30 to 40 basis points in many moderate liquidity deciles. This compares with an average effective spread of 72 basis points for index-listed securities in the most efficient electronic markets worldwide.  In Chapter 3, In Chapter 3 of this thesis, we test the correlation between the levels of market integrity as proxied by the incidence of ramping alerts and a combination of proxies for factors from the following four potential drivers deciding the market quality across securities exchanges: ???	Securities Markets Trading Regulations ???	Securities Markets Technologies ???	Securities Market Infrastructure ???	Securities Market Participants  The model we developed to test the correlation between the proxies for level of market integrity and seven proxies for the four potential drivers were estimated with Ordinary Least Square (OLS) and Two-stage Least Square (2SLS) error structures assumed, respectively to learn the most about the possible endogeneity of spreads and volatility. By performing Hausman-Wu specification tests, we concluded that simultaneity bias in the thickly-traded deciles is not material for the AI-Volatility and AI-Spread equation pairs. Subsequently, we used the PROBIT model to analyse the probability of adopting RTS across the 240 securities exchange deciles and the likelihood proves to be systematically related to four determinants in our sample. Finally we estimate the structural equations to investigate possible cross-equation correlation of the disturbances with either seemingly unrelated regression (SURL) estimation.  Our findings are three-fold. Firstly, in the moderately-traded deciles, we find that the presence of a closing auction (CloseAucDum) reduces the incidence of ramping alerts. Trade-based manipulation proves more difficult when a manipulator???s counterparties can use closing auctions to unwind their intraday exposures. The RTS dummy variable is significantly positively related to alert incidence. In the absence of any panel data on the dynamic effects of adopting RTS, what we are observing in cross section is the perceived vulnerability of certain exchanges to manipulation and their consequent adoption of RTS plus the regulatory regimes required to have a salutary effect on market integrity. Second, in the moderately-traded deciles, we find that the closing auctions and more regulations in pursuit of market integrity lower quoted spreads. RTS and a regulation specifically prohibiting ramping indicate in cross-section the perceived likelihood of more ramping. Thirdly, in terms of the probability of the deployment of a real-time surveillance system, the estimations again differ by liquidity decile grouping. In the moderately-traded deciles, higher alert incidence, the presence of DMA, and higher FDI again increase the likelihood of adopting a real-time surveillance system.  Our findings have a couple of policy implications for many securities exchanges in terms of market design and market surveillance. First, the exhibited relationship between alert incidence and effective spreads indicates trade-based manipulation has a significant impact on execution costs. Therefore, the prevention of securities market manipulation not only serves the indirect purpose of improving an exchange???s reputation for market integrity but also contributes directly to achieving a more efficient marketplace. Second, our results indicate that some market design changes can enhance the regulatory efforts to prevent securities market manipulations. For example, to prevent manipulators from marking the closing price, some exchanges could choose to adopt a closing auction or a random closing time, which would make manipulation more costly. Nevertheless, no securities exchange can be designed perfectly. Consequently, exchange and broker-level surveillance backed by effective regulatory enforcement is a necessary and pivotal complement to good design choices.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Market Quality</field><field name="subject">Market Integrity</field><field name="subject">Microstructure</field><field name="subject">Market Efficiency</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44724</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimization of instruction memory for embedded systems</field><field name="creator">Janapsatya, Andhi, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents methodologies for improving system performance and energy consumption by optimizing the memory hierarchy performance. The processor-memory performance gap is a well-known problem that is predicted to get worse, as the performance gap between processor and memory is widening. The author describes a method to estimate the best L1 cache configuration for a given application. In addition, three methods are presented to improve the performance and reduce energy in embedded systems by optimizing the instruction memory. Performance estimation is an important procedure to assess the performance of the system and to assess the effectiveness of any applied optimizations. A cache memory performance estimation methodology is presented in this thesis. The methodology is designed to quickly and accurately estimate the performance of multiple cache memory configurations. Experimental results showed that the methodology is on average 45 times faster compared to a widely used tool (Dinero IV). The first optimization method is a software-only method, called code placement, was implemented to improve the performance of instruction cache memory. The method involves careful placement of code within memory to ensure high cache hit rate when code is brought into the cache memory. Code placement methodology aims to improve cache hit rates to improve cache memory performance. Experimental results show that by applying the code placement method, a reduction in cache miss rate by up to 71%, and energy consumption reduction of up to 63% are observed when compared to application without code placement. The second method involves a novel architecture for utilizing scratchpad memory. The scratchpad memory is designed as a replacement of the instruction cache memory. Hardware modification was designed to allow data to be written into the scratchpad memory during program execution, allowing dynamic control of the scratchpad memory content. Scratchpad memory has a faster memory access time and a lower energy consumption per access compared to cache memory; the usage of scratchpad memory aims to improve performance and lower energy consumption of systems compared to system with cache memory. Experimental results show an average energy reduction of 26.59% and an average performance improvement of 25.63% when compared to a system with cache memory. The third is an application profiling method using statistical information to identify application???s hot-spots. Application profiling is important for identifying section in the application where performance degradation might occur and/or where maximum performance gain can be obtained through optimization. The method was applied and tested on the scratchpad based system described in this thesis. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the analysis method in reducing energy and improving performance when compared to previous method for utilizing the scratchpad memory based system (average performance improvement of 23.6% and average energy reduction of 27.1% are observed).</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Memory management (Computer science)</field><field name="subject">Cache memory</field><field name="subject">Computer architecture</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24210</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing a model for patients??? acceptance of a home telecare management system</field><field name="creator">Rahimpour, Mohammadreza, Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Successful implementation of any technology requires acceptance by the users. Numerous studies in the area of information technology acceptance, based on wellknown theories have been conducted to examine technology acceptance models and predict user adoption/acceptance behaviour. There are several studies dealing with patients??? acceptance of different telemedicine applications, but few about the patients??? acceptance of home telecare. Most existing studies are not based on a strong theoretical framework. In this study, based on an extensive literature review and preliminary qualitative data, a theoretical model of the effect of Home Telecare Management System (HTMS) characteristics and psychological variables associated with technophobia on patients??? acceptance of HTMS is proposed. The proposed model is an augmented Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) of Davis (1986), which is called Home Telecare Management System acceptance model (HTMS-AM), in which TAM has been augmented by two constructs: HTMS anxiety and HTMS self-efficacy. The model is proposed to improve our understanding regarding patients??? acceptance of HTMS, which may lead to successful design and implementation of home telecare systems. In addition, it can be used as a theoretical basis to evaluate new generations of HTMS in terms of users acceptance in the early stage of their design and development even prior to implementation. In order to test the reliability and validity of the measures, video demonstrations of a home telecare system and demonstration of a system prototype to potential users was employed. To propose the HTMS-AM the following five stages were taken: 1. General well-known theoretical models of human behaviour from psychology and technology acceptance models from information technology were reviewed to create a basic template for the proposed model. 2. A preliminary study (focus group interviews, Chapter 5) was conducted to assess patients??? perceptions of HTMS.  3. Based on an extensive literature review and findings from preliminary qualitative studies, HTMS acceptance model was proposed, to improve our understanding about factors, which may affect patients??? intention to use HTMS. Several adaptations were applied in the model to be applicable in the HTMS context, such as augmenting the model with HTMS self-efficacy and HTMS anxiety constructs. 4. To measure the different psychological variables in the proposed model, valid and reliable measures from previous studies were used. However the preliminary study was used to develop measures, which did not exist in the literature. 5. These measures were tested in the final study. The subjects were patients who had been affected with Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) and/or Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (COPD). Given the chronic nature of these diseases, the necessity for extended monitoring and management and frequent admission to hospitals due to worsening health status, these patients were deemed the most appropriate candidates for the HTMS. Further studies with more cases need to be conducted to test the actual model in which the impact of HTMS characteristics, psychological and demographic factors associated with technophobia upon intention to use the HTMS and the correlation of these factors with each other in appropriate healthcare settings.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24234</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Personality and the prediction of work performance: artificial neural networks versus linear regression</field><field name="creator">Minbashian, Amirali, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Previous research that has evaluated the effectiveness of personality variables for predicting work performance has predominantly relied on methods designed to detect simple relationships. The research reported in this thesis employed artificial neural networks ??? a method that is capable of capturing complex nonlinear and configural relationships among variables ??? and the findings were compared to those obtained by the more traditional method of linear regression. Six datasets that comprise a range of occupations, personality inventories, and work performance measures were used as the basis of the analyses. A series of studies were conducted to compare the predictive performance of prediction equations that a) were developed using either artificial neural networks or linear regression, and b) differed with respect to the type and number of personality variables that were used as predictors of work performance. Studies 1 and 2 compared the two methods using individual personality variables that assess the broad constructs of the five-factor model of personality. Studies 3 and 4 used combinations of these broad variables as the predictors. Study 5 employed narrow personality variables that assess specific facets of the broad constructs. Additional methodological contributions include the use of a resampling procedure, the use of multiple measures of predictive performance, and the comparison of two procedures for developing neural networks. Across the studies, it was generally found that the neural networks were rarely able to outperform the simpler linear regression equations, and this was attributed to the lack of reliable nonlinearity and configurality in personality-work performance relationships. However, the neural networks were able to outperform linear regression in the few instances where there was some independent evidence of nonlinear or configural relationships. Consequently, although the findings do not support the  usefulness of neural networks for specifically improving the effectiveness of personality variables as predictors of work performance, in a broader sense they provide some grounds for optimism for organisational researchers interested in applying this method to investigate and exploit complex relationships among variables.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Neural networks</field><field name="subject">Regression analysis</field><field name="subject">Personality</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24195</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Listening to refugee bodies: The naturopathic encounter as a cross-cultural meeting place</field><field name="creator">Singer, Judy</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the meanings of naturopathy through the experiences of twelve women with refugee backgrounds involved in naturopathic treatment at the Victorian Foundation for Survivors of Torture (Foundation House), a refugee torture and trauma rehabilitation service in Melbourne, Australia. The findings of this research show that the naturopathic encounter provided a transformative and meaningful meeting place for healing, a place in which the women felt at ease and in place.At Foundation House naturopathy has been practised alongside counselling since 1989, two years after the organisation&#8217;s inception. The women I interviewed for this project came from diverse sociocultural backgrounds and a wide range of countries including Iraq, Iran, Yemen, Afghanistan, Somalia, Burma and Serbia.The thesis brings together two contemporary fields of practice: Western models of refugee health care and traditional medicine. It argues for the place of non-biomedical approaches in refugee health care in a Western setting. The thesis takes an interdisciplinary approach to theorise the naturopathic encounter. The distinction between holistic and reductionist perspectives on health, illness and the body is underpinned by the theoretical work of medical anthropologists Nancy Scheper-Hughes and Margaret Lock and that of medical sociologist Aaron Antonovsky. A cultural studies perspective, influenced by the work of embodiment scholar Elspeth Probyn is employed to theorise these women&#8217;s experiences of the naturopathic encounter.This qualitative study is based on in-depth interviews and draws on grounded theory as an approach to data analysis. Descriptions of respite, renewal, and healing in the naturopathic encounter are cited as the most observable themes emerging from the women&#8217;s stories. These themes represent a health-oriented, as opposed to a disease-focused, perspective. Importantly, a health-orientated approach is congruent with the core tenets of naturopathic philosophy. Listening to the body is a crucial therapeutic tool in the naturopathic encounter, where primacy is given to supporting and strengthening health-creating strategies. I argue that this orientation disrupts the existing dominant biomedical approach to refugee health care. I draw on the work of Probyn to theorise the movement from the naturopathic encounter (NE) to the naturopathic meeting place (NMP). Central to this transposition is Probyn&#8217;s articulation of the body&#8217;s awareness of being in and out of place. This awareness lends itself to an understanding of the connectedness between past and present in the bridge-making that these particular refugee women have engaged in across cultures in the NMP.The thesis addresses an important but often neglected focus in refugee research: the resilience and agency of refugees. This positive aspect of refugee recovery is revealed in the research by theorising the women&#8217;s stories through Probyn&#8217;s embodiment analysis and cognisance of the &#8216;everyday&#8217; as a productive and creative process. The research interrupts the ubiquitous image of the &#8216;disempowered refugee victim&#8217;. It highlights the practical wisdom and agency of these particular women that is often overshadowed in the complex resettlement process. It makes a call for further health-orientated research to broaden and deepen our understanding of the refugee experience.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">naturopathy</field><field name="subject">refugee women</field><field name="subject">western herbal medicine</field><field name="subject">traditional medicine</field><field name="subject">refugee health care</field><field name="subject">qualitative research</field><field name="subject">Antonovsky</field><field name="subject">Probyn</field><field name="subject">Habitus</field><field name="subject">medical anthropology</field><field name="subject">Alternative and Complementary Medicine</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/81</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Isolation and characterisation of P450 gene(s) in barley (Hordeum vulgare)</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Linh</field><field name="description">In plants, P450 enzymes encoded by P450 genes play a central role in numerous biosynthetic pathways, such as the production of secondary metabolites, stress responses and disease resistance. This thesis reports upon the utilization of molecular biology techniques to study P450 gene(s) in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.).Using several combinations of degenerate primers, a large number of barley P450 gene fragments were cloned and sequenced from two commercial varieties, Chebec and Harrington. Among 247 isolated sequences, twenty six percent were homologous to genes of known function. The abundance of these sequences differed between the two cultivars. Variations in the motif sequences of the cloned genes were also found between these two cultivars. In addition to the cloned fragments, twenty-two putative barley P450 encoding genes were identified from 24,000 cereal sequences in the International Triticeae EST Cooperative (ITEC) database by homology search. Among these Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) sequences, a full-length P450 sequence was selected for further investigation in this study.This novel P450 gene, CYP72A39, was expressed at a very early vegetative stage, but no expression was detected at the reproductive stage. Comparison of expression profiles of this gene and &#8220;digital expression&#8221; databases confirmed that this gene was homologous to several cereal EST clones with tissue-specific transcripts responding to various environmental stimuli, such as stresses and disease. Among these, many transcripts in barley were obtained from stressed tissues at the vegetative stage, and two transcripts in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were expressed after being challenged by barley powdery mildew pathogen (Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei L.). This suggested that CYP72A39 may play a defence role in the barley seedling.The secondary structure of CYP72A39 was investigated in a comparative analysis using a computational approach. However, attempts to express CYP72A39 in a heterologous system and functional assays of the native protein in barley did not give decisive results, due to the disordered structure of the native protein and limitations of the current method. Screening the 3&#8217; UnTranslated Region (3&#8217;UTR) of this gene in 158 genotypes of domesticated, landrace and wild barley revealed two haplotypes, which differed by a 12 base indel positioned between two transversions. The presence of both haplotypes in wild and cultivated barley suggests this polymorphism predates the domestication of barley. This indel was mapped to the long arm of chromosome 6H, less than 10 centi-Morgans (cM) from the gene encoding resistance to powdery mildew in barley (B. graminis). A comparison between haplotype diversity and powdery mildew resistance data for over 102 genotypes showed a weak link between the &#8216;long&#8217; haplotype and resistance, while the &#8216;short&#8217; haplotype was associated with susceptibility. There was no evidence for a strong correlation between haplotype and quality type (malt or feed); however, more malting varieties had the long haplotype, suggesting a possible association with some attributes in modern malting barley. There was no evidence for association with other characteristics such as geographic origin, growth habit or row number. Phylogenetic relationship of the CYP72A39 to other CYP72 members was also investigated.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">P450</field><field name="subject">barley</field><field name="subject">Hordeum vulgare</field><field name="subject">isolation</field><field name="subject">characterisation</field><field name="subject">Plant Breeding and Genetics</field><field name="subject">Plant Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/107</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mapping the complexity of computer learning: journeying beyond teaching for computer competency to facilitating computer</field><field name="creator">Phelps, Renata</field><field name="description">For future generations to maximise their capability to operate within technologically driven economies, it is critical to foster computer abilities at every level of the schooling process. Teachers are central to this process. Yet, for many teachers, the need to integrate computer use in their teaching is threatening and overwhelming. This thesis argues that, given the rapid rate of technological change, skills-based approaches to computer education inadequately prepare teachers for a career of continued technological change. Effective computer education for teachers requires more than skills training. It involves changes in attitudes, values and beliefs that provide confidence for ongoing learning. Furthermore, it involves learning to adapt to change, to be flexible, intuitive and above all persistent. It requires the fostering of teachers who know how to be self-directed and independent in their computer learning, rather than those dependent on structured routines or guidelines. This thesis is the &#8216;story&#8217; of an action research initiative underpinned by a belief in the importance of approaches to computer education which foster lifelong computer learning. It traces the journey of a reflexive process of change and iterative development in the teaching of an educational information technology (computer) unit to pre-service teacher education students. Over a period of three years (1999-2001) I pursued a central research question, namely: How can I develop my teaching practice to better facilitate the development of capable computer users? The research explores the distinction between a &#8216;competent&#8217; and a &#8216;capable&#8217; computer user and trials a range of teaching and learning approaches that aim to facilitate the development of capable computer users.From this constructivist research and teaching process a multidimensional approach to computer education emerged, founded on metacognition and reflection. This approach is demonstrated to offer many advantages over a skills-focused approach. This thesis maps the complexity of the computer learning and teaching context, arguing that simplistic approaches to teaching will produce narrow and limited learning outcomes. Rather, a holistic approach is proposed, one that moves beyond the development of computer competency toward a longer term vision of facilitating computer capability. It is argued that the role of the computer &#8216;teacher&#8217; is to foster reflective awareness and develop a learning environment that can assist computer learners to become comfortable existing on the &#8216;edge of chaos&#8217;.This research supports previous studies which indicate the important role of computer self efficacy and the influence of factors such as perceived usefulness, anxiety, support and frequency and duration of use. However, the research also documents the unpredictable influence of these factors on individuals&#8217; resultant approach to computers and challenges dichotomous interpretations of such factors. Appropriate attribution is also shown to be a major influence on computer capability, as are factors such as help-seeking, motivation and goal-setting, although again, these influences are non-linear. It is argued that computer capability cannot be &#8216;taught&#8217; but, rather, computer educators should look to creating environments where its emergence can be facilitated. The metacognitive computer learning context developed and explored through this research is one such approach.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">information and communication technology</field><field name="subject">ICT</field><field name="subject">IT</field><field name="subject">teacher professional learning</field><field name="subject">teacher education</field><field name="subject">metacognition</field><field name="subject">complexity theory</field><field name="subject">learning theories</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/67</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Digital dilemmas: the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and interactive multimedia publishing, 1992 &#8211; 2002</field><field name="creator">Martin, Fiona R</field><field name="description">From the 1990s onwards the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) adopted a range of interactive multimedia activities: CD-ROM, web publishing, datacasting and interactive television. Drawing on extensive primary research, this thesis explores why the ABC pursued an interactive multimedia program under a neo-liberal rationality and how online publishing in particular has impacted on its role as a public service broadcaster. Drawing on neo-Foucauldian governmentality theory and Scott Lash&#8217;s critique of information, the thesis examines how the ABC operates as a technology of government in the transition to an informational society. While it considers the ABC as a localised, specific form of public service broadcasting, many of the findings have importance for analysis within the broader field of state intervention in media markets. It demonstrates that networked interactive multimedia are a communications strategy appropriate to the governance of a globally implicated market-state during a period of informationalisation &#8211; characterised by increased symbolic flows, spatial and temporal compression, decontextualised and disorderly relations of information. Public service media will transition this period, characterised by rapid social change and institutional upheaval, where they can incorporate and exploit the informational relations that threaten to diminish their utility as governmental assemblage. It finds that while ABC executives used technological change to adapt to the enterprise focus of neo-liberal government, the corporation was simultaneously transformed by disorganisational influences pursuing an ethics of internetworking. Contrary to Lash&#8217;s ideal schema of institutional decline, disorganisation &#8211; embodied in the ad hoc, program-maker led push for internet access and publishing &#8211; can become a force for organisational renewal. This is observable in the development of ABC Online, a public access web service. The conclusion drawn from ABC Online&#8217;s emergence is that the era of digitalisation exposes the ABC as a mutable object, a flexible strategy of national communications governance. It is not exclusively tied to a technical system, such as radio or television, or a practice such as broadcasting. Interactive multimedia such as ABC Online may help the ABC to readdress its contradictory political rationale &#8211; the call to represent a coherent national identity in the face of infinite lived diversity &#8211; and play a new role in connecting and engaging its users.This thesis re-examines that role in light of Lash&#8217;s observations about the nature of informational power. It explores at length the response to a new self-governing, performative subject, the user of interactive multimedia technology. The user, unlike the audience, is visible, often vocal and social. She negotiates both the space of a multimedia object and dialogic interactions within that space. Her exemplary expertise may rival that of the ABC&#8217;s program-makers. This analysis indicates that in response to informational phenomena, the ABC has reconceived its space of government, its pedagogy and its production of citizenship in order to remain an effective expression of governmentality. An online ABC may act as a mediatory, contextualising strategy that helps users negotiate the construction and function of difference. It may also be altered by user knowledge. These relations are possible, although preliminary in this research, while the ABC remains wedded to the more disciplinary relations of broadcasting. The implication is that a digitally networked ABC should not be a self-enclosed institution. It is part of an informational network: a multi-sector innovation system. It should not be divorced from its public or the market except in its ethics of exchange. It is a technology that through its technocultural relations socialises, is shaped by and melds with its sometimes unruly user/citizens. It influences, is influenced by and is part of a volatile mediascape. The ABC is organisation and disorganisation, the rigidity of the one generating the other and then being reincorporated, in a cycle of institutional and industrial change.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">public service broadcasting</field><field name="subject">national broadcasting</field><field name="subject">new media</field><field name="subject">internet</field><field name="subject">online media</field><field name="subject">Australian Broadcasting Corporation</field><field name="subject">multimedia</field><field name="subject">governmentality</field><field name="subject">informational society</field><field name="subject">Michael Foucault</field><field name="subject">Scott Lash</field><field name="subject">online journalism</field><field name="subject">cultural policy</field><field name="subject">Arts and Humanities</field><field name="subject">Film and Media Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/66</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A critical evaluation of aspects of the tourism information commodity marketplace in Australia and some implications for innovation in tourism</field><field name="creator">Taylor, Andrew James</field><field name="description">There is a growing body of literature which discusses the importance of systems of innovation (SOI) to modern economies. Systems which are innovative are characterised by organisations and institutions which identify weaknesses in current technologies, pursue new ideas through research and development, develop and produce technological innovations, and apply or distribute these for the collective benefit of the system. The literature suggests a number of structures which contribute to fostering systems of innovation. Efficiency in the production and exchange of knowledge is one of these.Tourism has been described as an economic system and recent public policy has recognised the importance of the production and exchange of knowledge for innovation in tourism. The distribution (or presentation) of secondary information resources (also referred to as &#8220;commodities&#8221;) has received particular attention from policy makers. The totality of information resources which is presented to information marketplaces at a point in time can be described as the information stock. Past commentary on the stock of tourism information in Australia indicates that inefficiencies may exist in the presentation and exchange of these resources in the marketplace.This research proposes a model of the marketplace for the exchange of tourism information commodities, the Tourism Information Commodity Marketplace (TICM). The model is applied to testing and identifying weakness in current production and exchange processes in Australia. In the research, the stock which is presented to the market is located, identified, catalogued and tested against the model to identify whether there are marketplace inefficiencies in the form of leakages. Leakages are the costs which tourism firms and organisations face as they try to address information needs by procuring and applying secondary information commodities.The research shows that a proportion of the presented stock can be moved efficiently from suppliers to consumers and is capable of meeting information needs of consumers at a point in time. However, a range of presentation and demand-side issues are identified which reduce the potential for knowledge-based innovation in tourism systems. These relate to language, access, availability, reliability, validity and coverage aspects which are associated with the stock and demand-side characteristics.The implications of this research for policy makers and suppliers of tourism information commodities are that dissemination weaknesses, in particular, must be addressed for the contribution of secondary information resources to innovation in tourism to be fully realised. For informatics researchers, the TICM is a valuable and adaptable tool for depicting and assessing marketplace dynamics where information is the commodity for exchange. It augments the understanding of the innovative potential of tourism stocks for systems of innovation as well as identifying potential barriers.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">tourism infomatics</field><field name="subject">information management</field><field name="subject">tourism data</field><field name="subject">information marketplace</field><field name="subject">systems of innovation</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management, and Operations</field><field name="subject">Hospitality Administration and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/42</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Grandparents raising their grandchildren: impact of the transition from a traditional grandparent role to a grandparent-as-parent role</field><field name="creator">Backhouse, Jan</field><field name="description">In many Western societies grandparents take on the role of occasional or short-term care providers of their grandchildren. However, recent years have witnessed a significant increase, both in Australia and overseas, in the number of children being raised by their grandparents due to the inability of the children&#8217;s parents to effectively meet their parenting responsibilities.This study is an interpretive inquiry that seeks to understand the meanings grandparents attach to their experiences of the grandparent-as-parent role, rather than the traditional grandparent role. The study also investigates how assuming the non-traditional grandparent role has influenced the identity of grandparent caregivers. A narrative inquiry approach was employed to &#8216;hear the voices&#8217; of 34 grandparents who were raising their grandchildren in NSW, Australia. In-depth interviews were conducted with each of the participants and their narratives were subsequently analysed through the lens of identity theory.Findings from the study reveal that grandparents experience a significant degree of roleidentity conflict in their grandparent-as-parent role. The loss of their traditional grandparent role, together with the shift in commitment to the grandparent-as-parent role, has resulted in a &#8216;space of difference&#8217; between the &#8216;ideal&#8217; and the &#8216;real&#8217; of being a grandparent. This &#8216;space of difference&#8217; is made up of a series of binary experiences described as myth/reality, visible/invisible, deserving/undeserving, voice/silenced, included/excluded, which appear to have consequentially impacted grandparents&#8217; selfesteem and self-verification processes. The study posits that grandparents lack adequate support, or doulia, resulting in a prevailing belief that their commitment to the grandparentas- parent role is not publicly acknowledged nor afforded the justice it deserves.The study concludes that both policy and practice in NSW have failed to recognise and address the complexity of experience, or the &#8216;space of difference&#8217; occupied by grandparents who are raising their grandchildren, and provides a number of recommendations in response to the grandparent experiences narrated through this research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">grandparents-as-parents</field><field name="subject">narrative enquiry</field><field name="subject">identity theory</field><field name="subject">role conflict</field><field name="subject">grandparents raising grandchildren</field><field name="subject">kinship care</field><field name="subject">Family, Life Course, and Society</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/79</field></doc></add>
